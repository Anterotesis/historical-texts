            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DISCOVRSE,
CONCERNING THE SEVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALL
INNOVATIONS OF
THE ALTAR.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of ALTARS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Great Faction of Church-men
has of late yeares, by many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
innovations attempted to
alter our Religion, and to new
reforme that Reformation of it
which was begunne by <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.
and further matured by Queene
<hi>Eliz.</hi> The pretence was, that our Ancestors in the
Reformation did depart too farre from Popery,
out of favour to Puritanicall <hi>Calvin,</hi> and so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
was, to have brought in Popery againe; but
with a muzzle upon it at first (as Sir <hi>Ben. Ruddlard</hi>
sayes) which muzzell would soone have falne off,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64406:5"/>
or beene taken off, as is generally conceived,
Amongst other innovations, much care was
had of Altars, many bookes were printed and set
forth by authority in favour of them, but no man
was suffered to say do, or write any thing in answer
or prejudice thereof. The times are now a little
more propitious, and that audaciates me beyond
my learning, or profession to enterprise at this time
something for the better clearing of the truth in
this case concerning <hi>Altars.</hi> If I faile not for want
of learning and judgement, I shall not for want of
ingenuity, and modesty; and I wish that our <hi>Altar</hi>-Patrons
had not beene so scurrilous, and bitter as
they have beene; for it seemes to me, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
raylings and distempers of men within sacred
Orders, when they are treating of matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
cast a great disgrace upon the age we are borne
in, the Countrey we are bred in, the Religion we are
Baptized in. In this <hi>Altar-dispute,</hi> foure things come

               <head type="sub">1 Concerning the reality of Altars.</head>
               <p>AS for the maintaining of reall, and proper <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> layes these grounds. Hee
sayes, that the Passion of our Saviour, as it was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64406:5"/>
prefigured to the Jewes in the legall Sacrifice, a parte
<hi>ante:</hi> so by Christs Institution it is to be commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by us Christians in the holy Supper <hi>a parte post.</hi>
A Sacrifice it was in figure, a Sacrifice in fact, and
so by consequence a Sacrifice in the commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or upon the <hi>post fact.</hi> He sayes further, that if
a Sacrifice be, there must also be both Priest and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
Yet he assignes these differences, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sacrifices were bloody, as this is not; that the
former Priests were from <hi>Aaron,</hi> ours from <hi>Melehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeck;</hi>
that the former <hi>Altars</hi> were for Mosaicall,
ours for Evangelicall Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>To shew the weaknesse of these grounds, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
that the word Sacrifice taken in a generall
sense for any sacred office, or divine service perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
does not inferre any propriety of either Priest,
or <hi>Altar;</hi> and if we take Sacrifice in that serise, as
the Patriarchs, Jewes, or Heathens did, or as Papists
now doe: we grant Priests, and <hi>Altars</hi> are necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implied thereby, but such a Sacrifice we deny
our Communion to be.</p>
               <p>Tis true, the Passion of our Saviour was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Sacrifices <hi>a parte ante,</hi> but very darkly; and if
<hi>Cain, Abel, Noah,</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> did sacrifice to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signifie
the death of Christ: yet their maine, or their
meere end was not to make any such type, or figure.</p>
               <p>Sacrifices were from the beginning as well before
<hi>Aaron,</hi> as after, but the knowledg of our Saviors death
was obscure under <hi>Aaron,</hi> but much more before the
most knowing times under the Law, did not expect
such a suffering dying Redeemer, as God had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
much lesse did those more cloudy times before
the Law. The Rock in the Wildernes, the Manna, and
divers other things were typicall, yet no Sacrifices,
and Sacrifices may as well be, not typicall, and euen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64406:6"/>
those Sacrifices which are typicall, are not <hi>typicall,
qua</hi> Sacrifices, more then Types are Sacrifices, <hi>qua</hi>
Types. By the very light of nature, all Nations did
agree in all ages in presenting their God both with
free will-offerings in testimony of his goodnesse,
and with expiatory Sacrifices in testimony of their
owne finfulnesse. Howsoever, all such oblations,
whether expiatory or gratulatory were equally Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
though not equally typicall; for all expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory
Sacrifices were not bloody onely, nor all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory
unbloody.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> before the institution
of <hi>Aarons</hi> Order, that the one presented to God his
homage in part of his flocke, the other in part of
his graine; the one did sacrifice upon an <hi>Altar</hi> as
well as the other: and that Sacrifice which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody
was typicall, and expiatory as well as that
which was bloody, and that which was bloody
might be graulatory as well as that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody,
or at least nothing appeares to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>We read also of <hi>Noah</hi> that he had a distinct no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of cleane and uncleane creatures, and did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
accordingly, so that the Religion and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
before the Law was not so farre different from
that under the Law, though pompe and ceremonies
and some other accidentall parts were wanting, as
from ours under the Gospel: or at least in matters of
Sacrifice, it was little or not at all different. All Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
also under the Mosaicall Law were not bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for Incense was offered to God as well as flesh;
and there was an <hi>Altar</hi> for Odours, as well as for
blood: and all Sacrifices whatsoever received their
value and acceptation from the Passion of Christ, as
that did purifie them, not as they did typifie that:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64406:6"/>
for it seemes else that other divine services should
not be so valuable, and acceptable as Sacrifices, not
those Sacrifices which were lesse typicall, as those
which were more: and that no Sacrifices at all had
beene admitted of by God from such men as did not
understand their typicall nature, as few did either
before, or under the Law. Besides it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that the Passion of Christ, was a proper, reall
Sacrifice in fact, and therefore it was necessary that
it should be prefigured, yet no necessity is, that it
should be prefigured by Sacrifice <hi>a parte ante,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated
by Sacrifice <hi>a parte post.</hi> The death of our
Saviour was rather a pious Passion, then a divine
action, or service done to God, and though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did not resist, or shunne such a martyrdome
wickedly inforced by other; yet he was not so active
in it, as to imbrue his owne hands in his owne
blood. So that if our Saviours Passion was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
it was but a figurative, improper, mentall
Sacrifice, in as much as the meritorious sanctity
thereof did not consist in the act done, but in the
innocence, patience, and excellence of the party suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
We cannot more properly call the death of
Christ a Sacrifice, then we may the Crosse the <hi>Altar,</hi>
or God the Priest, and we cannot properly say that
God did sacrifice to himselfe upon an <hi>Altar</hi> of that
forme and matter. It is a very lame inference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that Sacrifice must now be to commemorate
Christs Passion past, because it was prefigured by
Sacrifice being yet to come, and because it was it
selfe a proper Sacrifice in the act Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> sayes
once, that Christ did not deprive us of all manner
of Sacrifices, but onely those which had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which might, if continued, have beene a
strong presumption of his not comming in the flesh.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64406:7"/>
This seemes a weake reason, for if our Saviours
Passion were a proper Sacrifice, it was a bloody one,
and if there be the same reason of representing it
past, as there was future by Sacrifice, then bloody
Sacrifices are no lesse proper now to represent it,
then they were before: and if so, why were former
Sacrifices abolished at all Surely the best reason why
Jewish Sacrifices were abolished, is because those
services were but shadowes of that body, which in
our Sacrament is really presented and exhibited. If
we doe acknowledge that the body of our Saviour
is otherwise present in our Sacrament then it was in
the Jewish Types, we must acknowledge that the
shadowes of that body are the lesse needfull: for
gianting that Jewish Sacrifices and ours differ not
in nature, but in circumstance; as their signifie a
thing future, ours past, I doe not see but that our
Sacrament is as meere a shadow, as their Sacrifice
was, and that beasts now slaine might as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
our Saviours death past, as they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
it to come. The Doctor sayes that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Sacrifices were bloody, ours not; that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Priests were from <hi>Aaron,</hi> ours from <hi>Melchisedeck;</hi>
and these he puts as substantiall differences, tomake
our Sacrament no Jewish Sacrifice. But these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are not sufficient for his purpose, because we
know that all Jewish Sacrifices were not bloody, nor
does the order of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> hinder from bloody
Sacrifices, for if <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> did sacrifice, as it is
most probable that he did, it is as probable that his
Sacrifices were not all unbloody.</p>
               <p>So then his other difference also is as fond, when
he sayes that our <hi>Altars</hi> are for Evangelicall, not
Mosaicall offerings; in as much as betwixt Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and Mosaicall offerings, he has not yet proved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64406:7"/>
any other difference, but nominall, or circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
onely: of the like reason and weight are the
rest of the Doctors inferences, for as he has proved
yet no true proper Sacrifice, so much lesse has hee
proved any necessity of either Priest, or <hi>Altar</hi> in a
downe-right sense. We may grant Sacrifice, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both Priest, and <hi>Altar,</hi> for we read that the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
was called the Lords Sacrifice, yet we know
it was not killed only by Priests, nor eaten upon an
<hi>Altar,</hi> though it was the most honourable of Jewish
Sacrifices, and most neerely relating to the Passion
of Christ. So also the Passion it selfe of Christ, if
it was a proper Sacrifice, yet it was offered up upon
a woodden Crosse, not a stone <hi>Altar,</hi> and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
thereof was not a Priest; wherefore we see
plainely that all the Doctors allegations hitherto
are frivolous, and altogether insufficient.</p>
               <p>We come now from the Old, to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and here Doctor <hi>Pocklington,</hi> and Master
<hi>Meade</hi> lay hold of these words of our Saviour.
<hi>Leave thy gift at the</hi> Altar, <hi>and g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and reconcile thy
selfe to thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> These words were spoken by
our Saviour, whilst the <hi>Altar</hi> was in use, and before
the Communion was instituted, and may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be interpreted of such an <hi>Altar,</hi> as men did
repaire to with gifts, and offerings, then to our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
where we come rather to receive then give; yet
our Divines now cite them to patronise the word
<hi>Altar.</hi> It would little advance the reality of <hi>Altars</hi>
that they had beene so named once by our Saviour:
but here so much as the name used is not cleerely
proved. Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> for his next evidence, cites
1 <hi>Cor. 11. Doe this in remembrance of me, &amp;c. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as yee eate this bread, and drinke this cup, yee shew
forth the Lords death till be come.</hi> Here is (sayes Doctor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64406:8"/>
                  <hi>Heylin</hi>) a Sacrifice whose nature is commemorative,
here is in this Sacrifice an <hi>Hoe facite</hi> for Priests, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the <hi>Hoc edite, &amp; bibite</hi> of Lay-men: and
so here is proofe both for Sacrifice and Priest: by
this proofe it seemes, that the life of the Sacrament
consists in this that it is a Sacrifice, and that the life
of the Sacrifice consists in this that the Priest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates
it, not that the people of God celebrate it;
but I take this as a strange glosse of the Doctors, not
agreeable to common understanding, or naturall to
the text, or savouring of Protestantisme, and so I
leave it as not worth an answer. He cites further,
13. <hi>Heb. Habemus Altare:</hi> and so he concludes that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> furnishes us both with Priest, Sacrifice,
and <hi>Altar;</hi> if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did here by <hi>Altar</hi> meane the
Table, here is some authority for the name, not
thing, but this is it selfe controverted: for first, it is
plaine that the word <hi>Altar</hi> is taken for the <hi>epulum,</hi>
not the thing upon which it was offered, for of this
<hi>Altar,</hi> it is said that they may not eat which serve at
the Tabernacle. Secondly, the Papists do not alwayes
here by <hi>Altar</hi> interpret our Communion Table, and
therefore sayes <hi>Bellarmine, Non urgeo hune loeum
quia non desunt ex Catholicis, qui interpretantur de cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
vel de Christo ipso, &amp;c.</hi> But sayes the Doctor, I am
not the first of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it, for Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> has it thus: The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
in the Old Testament is called <hi>Mensa Domini,</hi>
by <hi>Malachy,</hi> and of the holy Table the Apostle in
13. <hi>Heb.</hi> sayes, <hi>Habemus Altare.</hi> The Lev. Minister here
rightly answers, that the Apostle here cals the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>Altar</hi> no otherwise then as <hi>Malachy</hi> cals the <hi>Altar</hi>
Table, and that must needs be improperly: for the
Jewish <hi>Altar</hi> was not a proper Table, more then the
Table whereon the Shew-bread stood was an <hi>Altar.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64406:8"/>
It is certaine and plaine that the Syriack word,
Luke 22. and the Hebrew in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> is Table,
and not <hi>Altar.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 10. useth the
word <hi>Mensa,</hi> and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is frequent, and
not denyed to be proper, but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is
seldome used for the Table, and not properly at all,
if we doe grant it at all used for Table, as is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned.
And therefore <hi>Bellar.</hi> gives a reason why the
Apostles all their time used no other word then Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
especially not <hi>Altar;</hi> to which opinion the Bishop
of <hi>Durham</hi> agrees, though not to the reason of it.
And we know also that the Romish pictures present
Christ, and his Disciples in their Churches commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
alwayes at a Table, not at an <hi>Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the practise of the Antients,
and they (as Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> sayes) without scruple,
or opposition, used the words Priest, Sacrifice, and
<hi>Altar,</hi> not tying themselves only to those words; but
not shunning the use of them: but the truth is, the
Greek Fathers used the word Table more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Latin lesse; but both Greek and Latins used
the word Table more frequently then <hi>Altar.</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reformation begunne by <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c. both
words beganne to be examined, and then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
not allowing the Sacrament to be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
rejected <hi>Altar</hi> as improper, but the Papists,
though they pretend not to disallow the word Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet in their reformed Canon of the Masse, they
used not at all the word Table: and yet still in the
Roman Pontificall we finde the word Table used.
Howsoever the dispute being not about the meere
use, but sense of the word <hi>Altar,</hi> we come now to
other arguments.</p>
               <p>All metaphors (sayes Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>) allude to
something which has reall existence in nature, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64406:9"/>
therefore the Fathers in the word <hi>Altar,</hi> did allude
to something existent. I answer, Metaphors must
have some basis to support them, but that basis may
be any thing past, or incorporeall: Christ may bee
called the brazen Serpent, the sting of conscience
may be called <hi>Ixions</hi> wheele, &amp;c. Yet there is no such
thing now as the one, nor ever was as the other; but
(sayes Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi>) those <hi>Altars</hi> which bore
carpets, corporals, &amp;c. could not be meer notionall,
metaphoricall <hi>Altars,</hi> but such were those of the
Antients, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I answer, the same thing might
be a notionall <hi>Altar,</hi> yet a materiall Table, and, as
it was a materiall Table, it might support carpets,
&amp;c. That cursed Tree whereon our Saviour suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
was a metaphoricall <hi>Altar;</hi> yet it did not truly
beare our Saviour, as an <hi>Altar,</hi> but as a Crosse: but
(sayes the same Doctor againe) these <hi>Altars</hi> were
such as were frequented for oblations sakes, to
which none came without Sacrifices of wealth, as
well as of prayse. I answer, for presents and almes
Tables are as proper as <hi>Altars;</hi> and such being but
metaphoricall Sacrifices prove the Table to be the
rather a metaphoricall <hi>Altar:</hi> but (sayes Doctor
<hi>Heylin</hi>) some Sacrifices are meerely spirituall, and
to such no materiall <hi>Altar</hi> is requisite, for such the
heart is a sufficient <hi>Altar,</hi> and every man is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Priest: but the Sacrament is a Sacrifice, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirituall and mysticall, but also externall and
visible, and to such a Sacrifice, a visible Priest and
materiall <hi>Altar</hi> is requisite. This is answered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the <hi>Paschall Lam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> for that was a Sacrifice visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and externall, yet it required no materiall <hi>Altar;</hi>
and so it may be said of our Saviours crucified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
besides, we may make a difference with Saint
<hi>August.</hi> betweene the Sacrament it selfe, and that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64406:9"/>
which is visible in the Sacrament, and so deny any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>Altar</hi> to be necessary; and for further instance,
man is said to offer up his soule and body to God as
a reasonable Sacrifice, and the body being materiall,
does not require any materiall, grosse <hi>Altar:</hi> but,
sayes D. <hi>Heylin,</hi> if the Sacrament be but an improper
metaphoricall Sacrifice, then no more a materiall
Table, then a materiall <hi>Altar</hi> is requisite. I answer,
though in that exception of a Sacrifice it be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall;
yet as a Communion, it is a reall action,
and requires a reall Table whence to communicate.
So the Passion of our Savior, it was a tropical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but a proper execution, and therfore though our
Saviour was sacrificed without a proper <hi>Altar,</hi> yet he
was not executed but upon a proper Crosse: but
(sayes the same Doctor) if the Sacrament be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
immateriall Sacrifice; it may not onely be
celebrated without a Table, but without a Church
also: any place may serve for such a Sacrifice: the
Pulpit, the Pewe, the Belfrie, the Chancell may bee
as proper <hi>Altars</hi> as the holy Table, and what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Doctrine is this? We doe say that any place
may be as properly called an <hi>Altar,</hi> but not that
any place may be as fitly and honourably imployed
to communicate in. Our Saviour did communicate
in a common roome upon a common Table for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
sake; and so we in case of necessity dare not
despise such communicating, but we use not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to prove a parity of all places: the Doctor
knowes this is but a slanderous consequent, issuing
out of his malice, not out of our tenet; for if the
honour of the Sacrament doe not wholly consist in
being a Sacrifice, or the honour of Sacrifice in the
externall worke done, there is no more necessity of
<hi>Altar,</hi> then Table; or that either <hi>Altar</hi> or Table
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64406:10"/>
should be held so essentially honourable to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and this may be held by him, which holds
not all places equall and indifferent for divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
Wherefore, as for Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> rule: <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristia
in altari consecratur,</hi> which Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi>
affirmes to be undenyable: we say it must stand with
our Saviours example, who did administer the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
upon a reall Table, but upon an imaginary
<hi>Altar,</hi> and so we are not opposed to it: but (sayes
Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> further) materiall <hi>Altars</hi> are very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in the Church, which if they were not erected
for our Sacrifices, certainely they were for Popish,
and this will prove Popery to be very antient, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
the Doctor has not proved formall stone <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
so antient, but if he had, he has not proved anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
free from all error, and superstition, but
we can easily prove the contrary: but Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>
proceeds thus; he which teaches that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church there was neither Priest, Sacrifice, nor
<hi>Altar,</hi> properly so called, brings in confusion and
ruine into the Church, takes away all externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
inables every man to the Priestly function,
and robs the Church of all due reverence. This is
a strange inference that I cannot sufficiently honour
the Sacrament, but under the name of Sacrifice, nor
Ministers, but under the name of Priests; nor the
Communion-Table, but under the name of <hi>Altar.</hi>
D. <hi>Heylins</hi> supposition herein of me, must bee more
weighty then my own certain knowledge of my self.
Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> also concurres herein, for hee
which denyes <hi>Altars</hi> (sayes hee) may as well deny
Churches, and he which denyes Churches, may as
well deny the Throne of Bishops in the Quire neere
the <hi>Altar</hi>-place, and he which denyes Thrones, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
the truth of Christian Religion: by a strange
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64406:10"/>
dismembred, deformed kinde of argumentation; he
makes <hi>Altars</hi> as necessary to be beleeved, as Thrones
of Bishops; and Thrones, as the succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
and the succession of Bishops, as the rocke
and foundation of all Religion. <hi>Cartwright, Ames,</hi>
and those of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and all other Countreys which
cannot derive their lineall succession of Bishops
from the Apostles are Puritanes, and Heretiques:
though they scarce differ from us in any other point
of consequence, yet in this they are in worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then the Papists. The Anchor of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for no inthronization of
Bishops, no personall succession; and no personall
succession, no derivation of faith can be from God
to, &amp;c. Were not this written against Puritans, or by
such as have an authority to prove <hi>quidlibet ex quoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi>
it would deserve laughter, and not an answer: but
now we must be more serious. The allegation is, that
there is the same evidence for <hi>Altars,</hi> as Thrones,
aud therefore since it is most impious to deny
Thrones, it is the like to deny <hi>Altars.</hi> I wish Thrones
had beene better proved, for if Thrones doe prove
<hi>Altars,</hi> yet men of such ordinary faiths as mine may
something scruple Thrones themselves. Saint <hi>Aug.</hi>
sayes that Thrones were remaining at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
till his dayes from the very Apostles times.
Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> might see thrones standing in both
places, but when they were first raised, or by whom,
or for whom, or for what reason; he could not
understand but by relation, and what that relation
might be, he has not exprest: neither doe I thinke
that his maine hope of salvation was chained to
that relation, neither can I chaine mine to the
same; for my part, I am so farre from making
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64406:11"/>
Thrones or <hi>Altars</hi> my soules anchorage, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
neither to be Apostolicall, and till the Doctor
can better convince me of them, I could wish hee
would call in his Anathemaes; or rather Epigrams
against such Atheists as I am: but (sayes Doctor <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>
further) No <hi>Altar,</hi> no Priest; no Priest, no
Rubrick, &amp;c. but we say in answer, First, that the
relation betweene Priest and <hi>Altar</hi> is not inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
as has beene proved. Secondly that the
word Priest derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implyes not
reall Sacrifice. Thirdly, if we did reject the word
Priest utterly as lesse proper then Minister, and lesse
fit to be used (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> maintaines)
and as we doe not affect to use it, yet we reject not
the thing with the name, the same Ministry, the
same sacred order we retaine, and honour, and
hold it as revenerd as either Jew, or Papist doe their
sacrificing Priest-hood. But what consequence is
this? no Priest, no Ordination; no Ordination,
no Rubrick; no Rubrick, no Law. He which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the word Priest onely, does not oppose the
thing; and he which opposes not the thing, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
not the Rubrick; and he which opposes not the
Rubrick, opposes not the Parl. establishing it: it
is sufficient that we oppose neither the thing Priest,
nor the word, except onely in its Popish sense as it
intimates reall Sacrifice to us.</p>
               <p>I come now to such proofes as cleere antiquity
from meaning of reall proper <hi>Altars.</hi> And first wee
read the word <hi>Altar</hi> sometines in the workes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Authors, but that is no proofe that <hi>Altar</hi> was
the common terme or word so used in common
speech, of that there is no proofe, or colour at all;
it is ordinary to use Metaphors in studied discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and as unusuall to use them in our ordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64406:11"/>
That the word Table was first in common
use at the beginning is very credible, that it is now
wholly disused amongst Papists is evident, therefore
when we see the change, but cannot perceive the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time or motion of that change, as it happens
in the shadow upon the Sun-diall, we may well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the mystery of inquity has had its secret
operation upon it, as upon divers other things. We
finde secondly, in the most antient times, that it was
a common objection made against Christians
by Jewes, Pagans, and renegado Christians, that
they had neither Churches, <hi>Altars,</hi> nor Images.
And to this common objection we finde that the
greatest Apologetick, and most learned Divines of
those dayes did all unanimously yeeld that they
had no materiall proper <hi>Altars,</hi> nor no other but
Metaphoricall onely. <hi>Clesus</hi> objected to <hi>Origen</hi> that
the Christians did avoid to raise <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Caecilius</hi> askes <hi>Octavius, Cur nullas aras ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
templa nulla, nulla nota simulacra? Arnobius</hi>
sayes to his adversaries, <hi>Nos accusatis quod nec templa
habeamus, nec imagines, nec aras.</hi> And <hi>Julian</hi> who
had beene a Christian, and knew their worship well
enough, and lived after the erection of Churches,
yet sayes to <hi>Cyrill, offerre in altars, &amp; sacrificare cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi>
'twas strange if any Christian <hi>Altars</hi> then were,
that neither Heathens, nor apostate Christians
should know thereof: and yet the more s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ange that
this being objected against Christians, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, that Christians would not justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against so manifest an untruth. <hi>Origen</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
that the Christians <hi>Altar</hi> was his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and that prayers were his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> .
<hi>Octavius</hi> answers that the Church Sacrifice was <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
animus, sincera mens, &amp; pura conscientia. Arnobius</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64406:12"/>
confesses sacrifices, but not corporeall, agreeing with
the former that they were mentall only. And <hi>Cyrill</hi>
gives not a deny all to <hi>Julian.</hi> Is it not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, that so many men, of severall places and
times, should all so farre prevaricate, and make such
fond answers, if they could have advantaged their
owne cause, or satisfied their adversaries, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proper <hi>Altars,</hi> and such reall Sacrifices, as our
Doctors now affirme? How easie had it beene, and
how true, &amp; how necessary was it to have made this
direct answer? Persecution suffers not Christians
to build such sumptuous Churches and <hi>Altars</hi> as you
doe: but we have <hi>Altars</hi> as proper, and would build
Temples as stately as you doe, if we had power and
liberty; we deny not al Sacrifices, as you erroneously
object, we deny not true, visible, externall Sacrifices,
we deny only Jewish, bloody, and meerly corporeall
Sacrifices: so that the force of that objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is against
our hard condition, not against our worship or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

whereby he accounts them meere cheaters, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers,
not regarding whom they treated withall, or
the current sense of the words according to common
acception, but desiring to obscure truth, and deinde
their opponents, this is to bee slighted as a toy.
<hi>Pocklington</hi> takes pains to prove Churches out of the
Scripture, &amp; antiquity, &amp; sayes that those Churches
had <hi>Altars,</hi> to which none came without oblations,
and that with those oblations, captives, widowes,
orphans, &amp;c. were relieved. He also insists upon the
great names of Thrones and Syndos: but his proofes
are most of them indefinite, both to time, place, and
thing. We say, that before <hi>Constantine</hi> few Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64406:12"/>
were, especially so formally, built with Thrones,
and other divisions, as he seemes to intimate, and
in respect of the vast surface of the earth scarce visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or considerable, especially to severall men, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in severall places, and at severall times, such as
the Apologeticks were. And yet the word Church
is taken sometimes for any place where God was
publikely worshipt, and sometimes for the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
it selfe of the faithfull named by such a
Towne, City, or Country; and in this sense, and
no other the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is said to maintaine
in it, 1. Bishop, 46. Priests, 7. Deacons, 7. Sub-Deacons,
42. Acolythites, Exorcists, Readers, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
52. Widowes, 1500. Poore. It is not meant that
any locall materiall Church in <hi>Rome</hi> during the
times of persecution, was so rich, capacious, or
stately: for this would evince more then a meere
toleration of christianity, and yet we read not of so
much. <hi>Hospinian</hi> for the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ace betwixt Christ and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
more reasonably collects, that those <hi>Altars</hi>
which were then, were neither fixed nor of stone,
which sufficiently cleeres that they were woodden
unfixed Tables, not stone, and fixed <hi>Altars:</hi> for if
Christians during Heathenisme, had liberty to build
and meete in such formall Churches, and had such
Synods, Thrones, Libraries, Schooles, Gazophyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as the Doctor labours to prove, they could not
want power, or opportunity to adorne or inrich
<hi>Altars,</hi> or to fix them and fashion them as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And thus the ages before <hi>Constantine</hi> might
be defective in Discipline by reason of persecution,
and we may suspect the ages after for their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Constantine</hi> was too pompous in Discipline,
and soone inclined to Arianisme, and long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his owne Baptisme; in his times the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64406:13"/>
of Popish usurpation beganne to be laid. Then
it was said, <hi>hodie venenum infusum est Ecclesiae:</hi> then it
was said, That there were as many Religions as
opinions, and opinions as men. I ascribe not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
such infallibility as some do, and yet many
things might fit those times which fit not ours, and
many things may be misreported, misunderstood, and
mistaken by us in these times; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> perhaps were not
in such repute of old, as we now beleeve. Our third
reason against materiall and proper <hi>Altars,</hi> is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Fathers. <hi>Eusebius</hi> often cals that of
Christians, an unbloody, and reasonable Sacrifice:
the word Unbloody is used in opposition to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
and sensitive things, the word Reasonable, to
reall or vegetative things; for if we conceive that
Reasonable, and Unbloody distinguish from Jewish
Sacrifices, we must understand notionall, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Sacrifices, because the Jewish were not all bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
The same <hi>Eusebius</hi> also sayes that we are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to offer daily to God the commemoration
of Christs Sacrifice <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. A Kings deputy
is entertained as a King, and its an honour to him;
but Kings are not entertained as deputies, that's
derogatory: so, if this were a Sacrifice, it were an
undervaluing, lessening word, to say it were a meere
commemoration, or instead of a Sacrifice. In another
place also he cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which
is the representation of a proper Sacrifice, is not it
selfe a proper Sacrifice, these things differ in predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And to put all out of doubt, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> by
way of correction, for more proprieties sake, having
call'd it a Sacrifice, addes this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to shew
that it is in propriety but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It
may be called a Sacrifice figuratively, but in truth it
is rather the remembrance of a Sacrifice. Our fourth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64406:13"/>
reason is taken from the acts of our Ancestors in
the reformation, who did expresse great dislike of
<hi>Altars,</hi> and did remove, and abollsh the same as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
innovations. We will therefore against Doctor
<hi>Heylin,</hi> make these two things cleere.</p>
               <p>First, that the Reformers were very adverse to
<hi>Altars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that they were so upon just grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantines</hi> times, though not so pure as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
yet were farre more pure then those which
succeeded; for Antichrists entrance is obscure:
he seemes likes <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> without pedegree, as to
some of his mysteries of tyranny: He beganne to
worke presently after the the infancie of the
Church, but as to his solemne inthronization at
<hi>Rome,</hi> he is much younger then <hi>Constantine. Tantae
mo'is erat Romanam condere gentem.</hi> It appeares by
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> his insulting over <hi>Theodosius</hi> that
the Hierarchy was advanced in good times, and that
by the blinde zeale of some men otherwise very
good. <hi>Altars</hi> had gotten great adoration before St.
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> but that adoration was not wholly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
till the installment of Antichrist; and then
the Sacrament was soone turned into a present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
Sacrifice, and the forme of a Table being
utterly rejected, a stone <hi>Altar</hi> was received into its
place, and an immolating Priest ordained. Priest,
<hi>Altar,</hi> Sacrifice, are now growne the common termes,
and onely proper words, and though the instant
creeping in of this factious change be not knowne,
yet the change is now apparent, it is now is plaine,
that these words are growne common, as it is that
they were not so from the beginning. And for this
cause our English Martyrs, were necessitated to use
these words conversing with Papists at that time
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64406:14"/>
when no other words were current: and this is no
proofe for the propriety thereof. <hi>Frith, Lambert,
&amp;c.</hi> mention their examination touching the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the <hi>Altar:</hi> and so must I now repeate
the same name, and so must any man in the same
case, but what? this mention or repetition proves
not our approbation thereof. So that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. use the name both in the act, and in
the writ granted thereby: but what? neither was
the tide of language yet turned, nor the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in any degree perfected: and so in the first Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
the word <hi>Altar</hi> for the same reason is usually
mentioned: but in the second Liturgy we see the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgement, and more setled practise of the State,
by the utter rejection of the very names of Sacrifice
and <hi>Altar.</hi> But the Doctor replyes that the second
Liturgy was introduced upon no other just conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but onely to please the fond, pragmaticall,
puritanicall humor of <hi>John Calvin.</hi> King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.
comming to the Crowne 1547. found the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of altering Religion very difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and not suddenly to be expedited. Young he
was, and destitute of a competent number of trusty,
potent, and learned Ministers, and his Father had
altered nothing but in discipline onely, and his
taske now was to extirpate a sensuall Religion of
great antiquity, and yet within sixe months he sets
out his injunctions, wherein he prescribes divers
things tending to a reformation. Some few months
after in Parliament, the Sacrament is commanded
to be administrrd <hi>sub utraque specie,</hi> and a Writ
therefore awarded; in both which Act and Writ,
the vulgar common name is not yet disused. In 1548.
Images are ejected, and a new celebration of the
Sacrament ordered: The first Liturgy is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64406:14"/>
and <hi>Bucer</hi> sent for, and as yet the word <hi>Altar</hi>
is not quite relinquisht. In 1549. the King having
thus farre adventured to countenance Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
he now adventures to strike at the heart of
Popery, by pulling downe the Masse; but this hee
does by Proclamation, not daring to put it to votes
in Parliament. Upon this a great rebellion is raised
in the West, the French King also bidding defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at the same instant; and now <hi>Bucer</hi> first arrives.
In 1550. great troubles hapned about the Protector,
but the West being calmed, and the French threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
diverted, Bishop <hi>Ridly</hi> is commanded to take
downe <hi>Altars</hi> in his Diocese, and in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church it
selfe the <hi>Altar</hi>-wall was removed: by the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
also to <hi>Ridly,</hi> it appeares that <hi>Altars</hi> had beene
displaced in many other parts before, and the Act is
allowed by the King to be good and godly, though
our Doctors now terme it an horrible outrage: and
by this it seemes that <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> were not the
first instigators thereof. In 1551. we read of <hi>Bucers</hi>
death, and the arraignment, commitment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the Protector; and now <hi>Hooper</hi> in his
Sermon before the King, preaches against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of <hi>Altars,</hi> yet standing as occasions of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
In 1552. a Parliament establishes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Liturgy in stead of the first, and finally, and
generally demolishes <hi>Altars,</hi> not using so much as the
name of Sacrifice, or <hi>Altar.</hi> And by such limits and
degrees did the Kings power increase, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ripen; but amongst these publike affaires
we may take notice also that some other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
passages did intervene. <hi>Bucer</hi> about Autumne,
1549. received advertisements from <hi>Calvin</hi> not to
be <hi>mediis consilii<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> authorem vel approbatorem,</hi> and to be
instant with the Protector for the taking away of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64406:15"/>
superstitious ceremonies. The like counsell also
<hi>Calvin</hi> had sent to the Protector to goe on in abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
all superstitions without regard of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
abroad, or peace at home, such cautions
being onely requisite in civill, not divine affaires; for
in these the word of God is the strict rule, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more distastfull to God, then to alter; or
mitigate divine precepts according to worldly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
His advise also was further that the Protector
would hasten the compounding of ceremony dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and to support <hi>Hooper,</hi> a man zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Altars,</hi> and ceremonies; and one that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Duke of Northumberland. In his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
also to <hi>Farellus</hi> 1551. it appeares that <hi>Calvin</hi> had
written to the King, and that his letters had beene
gratiously accepted both by the King and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and that the Arch-Bishop had wished him to
write more frequently, and that the Arch-Bishop
also had received letters from him; and that the
State had received the like advertisements from <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi>
also. These pious indeavours of <hi>Calvin</hi> secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Bullinger, &amp;c.</hi> so honourably entertained
by the King, and his Prelates and Counsellours of
State; nay, and by the whole Parliament, Doctor
<hi>Heylin</hi> traduces as the busie offices of his tampering,
practising, and unhappy medling: and thus through
<hi>Calvins</hi> sides our heavenly inspired Ancestors are
wounded, and through their sides our Religion. 'Tis
true, the first Liturgy had a Morall, though not a
Mathematicall perfection in it; and so it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testated
by <hi>Fox, &amp;c.</hi> But this concludes not that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was altered only to please <hi>Calvin;</hi> for though
in the first Liturgy, nothing was introduced but what
was good and godly, as might be well justified; yet
that was more good and godly which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64406:15"/>
introduced in the second: the one might bee
as <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Temple, the other as <hi>Solomons,</hi> both
beautifull, yet one more beautifull: He that rightly
considers the Acts of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and his short raigne,
will wonder to see so much, not so little done in
such a space of time: especially since his Peeres was
so factious, his people so ignorant, and his Clergy
so Popish. Had not Divines also beene so averse
at home to reformation, the consultation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
Doctors was necessary, especially of such as had
beene actors and spectators abroad in the like alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
but such Doctors were now pretious
in the world, the Harvest was farre too great for the
Labourers, and the age also too queasie to endure
their rigor. It is no wonder therefore if <hi>Bucer</hi> came
not till two yeares after the beginning of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and if <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Bullinger,</hi> came not
at all. <hi>Tantae molis erat Romanam extinguere gentem.</hi>
Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> supposes <hi>Calvin</hi> pragmaticall, because
he was not sent for into <hi>England,</hi> though he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himselfe unsent for, and was so forward to
ingage himselfe by his avisoes: but this is ill sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
for <hi>Calvin</hi> was knowne to be a rigorous man
against ceremonies, and the pompe of Prelates, and
this made him terrible here in <hi>England. Hooper</hi> is a
sure instance of this, for being a learned pious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
his meere consent with <hi>Calvin</hi> cast him out of
his Bishopricke, and scarce could he ever obtaine his
reinvestment, though the King countenanced him,
though Northumberland supported him, though
the greatest of forraine Divines intreated for him.
So tender a point, even in those dayes was it to
touch upon ceremonies, the darling of Episcopacie,
and so jealous were the holiest of our Prelates in a
case of such concernment to Hierarchy. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64406:16"/>
                  <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had the same opposites, and
friends; and therefore though the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
did not send for <hi>Calvin, Bullinger,</hi> &amp;c. because
the Popish and Episcopall faction hated them; yet
they kindldy embraced their counsels, and (as farre
as might be) put them into execution. The meere
Popish faction could not have deterred, or retarded
the King and his councell, we see greater matters
carried against that side, some other more potent
enemies both <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had even in those
zealous times; but in other ceremonies whatsoever
difference might be, I doe not see but that in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
and condemning of <hi>Altars,</hi> all sides did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree, and that <hi>Ridly</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as either <hi>Hooper</hi> or <hi>Calvin.</hi> It is manifest also
that Queene <hi>Eliz.</hi> in her restitution of Religion
was as ill affected to them, as her brother had beene
in his first reformation, abolishing both the name,
forme, and use of them, and adhering wholly to the
second Liturgy, and imitating in all things her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
paterne. And it is as manifest, that in all the
raigne of King <hi>James</hi> under any visitor whatsoever,
there was no question ever moved concerning the
name, nature, paterne, or adoration of any <hi>Altar,</hi>
till these later yeares made them a ground of
schisme. We may more probably guesse that <hi>Edw.</hi>
the sixth, and the best of his Clegry would have
followed <hi>Calvin</hi> further if they had had power, and
further time to perfect their designes, then that they
followed him too farre, being deceived by his P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall
faction. But Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> blames <hi>Calvin</hi>
for being an enemy to middle counsels in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods strict commands: not to regard humane
policie in such divine affaires, the Doctor cals going
on without fear or wit. We know how far <hi>Saul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64406:16"/>
from Gods command for politick respects
when he would offer Sacrifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came,
and when he would reserve some of the Amaleki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
spoyle for Sacrifice; yet this was not meere
temporall wisedome: Sacrifice was his end, and the
service of God in both, yet we know strict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had beene better accepted then such uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Sacrifice: besides, though <hi>Saul</hi> was strictly
commanded to destroy the Amalekites, yet he was
not commanded to destroy the Amalekites without
all preparation, consultation, or opportunity:
Gods command did binde him from all mitigation
in the execution of it, but not from all policie in
effecting it. So King <hi>Edw.</hi> the sixth, received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God to expell Popery; in this case for
want of power, the King might awaite time and
opportunity wherby to compasse his end, as he did;
but being master of opportunity, he might not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dispensation depart from that end, or faile of
executing his commission to the utmost. When
<hi>Calvin</hi> dissuaded from middle counsels, he took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
withall of the ceasing both of forreine and civill
warres, (as appeares by his letters) so that we may
well suppose his counsell was chiefely touching the
end, not the meanes: for the end is strictly defined
by God in divine affaires, but the meanes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
left to humane advise. Let the Doctor carp
at <hi>Calvin,</hi> and at our Ancestors, for crediting so
medling a fellow, let him disdaine that <hi>Elijah,</hi> or
<hi>Baptist</hi>-like spirit wherewith God had so plenteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
anoynted him: but this is no warrant for us to
doe the like. We may better imagine that <hi>Calvin</hi>
was one of the blessedst instruments whom God fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and qualified for the most blessed imployment
which was ever effected the redemption. Wee

groped with their hands. But (sayes Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>)
in <hi>Germany Altars</hi> are still retained; and there the
reformation was complete: and so complete refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and <hi>Altars</hi> may well subsist together. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Altars</hi> doe remaine in <hi>Germany:</hi> but it seemes
in the first place <hi>Luther</hi> was no favourer of them, for
he reproves it in <hi>Carolostadiue,</hi> that he did by force
shew downe <hi>Altars,</hi> when by dispute hee ought
to have expelled them. Secondly, it appeares by the
same story that <hi>Altar</hi> were in many places very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive.
Thirdly, the Lutherans use and repute their
<hi>Altars</hi> as meere Tables: and we admit that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
relation of an <hi>Altar,</hi> is not the externall forme
as its wood or stone, round, or square, &amp;c. but its
imployment for Sacrifice We allow <hi>Occ<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

to say, that for peace sake we abhorre not from

that which is not necessary to them by Law, is so to

would not have abolisht <hi>Altars</hi> contrary to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition

then the reality thereof was of deeper consequence,
and much more to be provided against. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is sufficient to alledge, that in our Liturgy in

and that Sacrifice which is mentioned in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is onely of spirituall praise, and that
wherein other Hoste, but our soules and bodies

               <head type="sub">Concerning the propriety of the Name.</head>
               <p>THus we see there is no <hi>Altar</hi> but tropicall, and
the name cannot be proper, where the thing is
improper: and yet we further say, that as the name
<hi>Altar</hi> is lesse proper; so it is also lesse antient then
Table, and in both these respects lesse convenient
to be used. For antiquity, D. <hi>Pocklington</hi> affirmes,
that <hi>Noah</hi> built an <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> being a Christian,
his <hi>Altar</hi> was a Christian <hi>Altar;</hi> and hence it results,
that the <hi>Altar</hi> amongst Christians, is farre antienter
then Table.</p>
               <p>To this we reply, that if <hi>Noah</hi> was not a Jew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not descended of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor of the Mosaicall
Religion, because he was many hundreds of yeares
antienter then <hi>Moses,</hi> by the same reason he was not
a Christian, being ancestor to Christ himselfe. And as
for his Religion it does not appeare that hee had
therein any nearer relation to Christ, then <hi>Moses,</hi>
especially in Sacrifices, for as <hi>Moses</hi> had his bloody
Sacrifices, so had <hi>Noah:</hi> and as <hi>Moses</hi> in his bloody
Sacrifices did observe a distinction of cleane, and
uncleane creatures; so did <hi>Noah.</hi> Wherefore it <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
be no Jew, it followes not he was a Christian; and
if a Christian, it follows not his <hi>Altar</hi> was a Christian
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64406:18"/>
                  <hi>Altar;</hi> and if a Christian <hi>Altar,</hi> it followes not that it
is that Christian <hi>Altar,</hi> which we call the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Table. And surely Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> is ill applyed,
as to this purpose, to prove that the Christian is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienter
then the Jew: as if that because <hi>Altars</hi> came
in with <hi>Noah;</hi> therefore Tables came not in till under
the Ceremoniall Law, or as if it concerned us to
strive about the generall indefinite words of <hi>Altar,</hi> or
Table, in this dispute of the Communion Table. Our
dispute is about that Table, or other utensill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Saviour did eate both the old Passover, and
his new one; and this Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> call a Table, using the same word as is used
for that utensill whereon <hi>Dives</hi> his meate was served
in; and the Papists deny not the proprlety of this
word, nor the use of the thing, onely Doctor <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>
affirmes our Saviour to have supped upon
the pavement, not that he can thereby averre his
<hi>Altar,</hi> but that he may impugne our Table. If the

a commemoration of a Sacrifice, nay even that

as the Crosse was an <hi>Altar,</hi> or as the crucifiers were

M. <hi>Mede,</hi> admitting no true Sacrifice, yet the Table
is a true <hi>Altar;</hi> for Table and Altar both have the
same <hi>genus: Altar</hi> and Table differ as Church and
house, <hi>Altar</hi> is a holy Table, as Church is a holy
house: so the difference is specified onely. I answer.</p>
               <p>First, all Sacrifice is not offered: as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, some
things are offered neither edible, nor potable, a
Incense, and by this it seems that the relative for<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of an <hi>Altar</hi> is not meerely to support sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasts,
as it should, if it were onely a sacred Table.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this crosses the typicall intention
of Sacrifice, for in this sense Christ was no proper
Sacrifice, nor his Crosse as <hi>Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the Jewish Temple there was both a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Altar.</hi> &amp; a sacred Table, and as they had severall
names, so they were different in forme, and sitted <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
severall uses, although both their uses were sacred.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we admit Table to be called <hi>Altar,</hi>
in respect of the sacred food there pres<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, not
thereon sacrificed, this opposes not our opinion,
but it regard that holy Table expresses as much as
<hi>Altar</hi> in Master <hi>Mede<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> sense; but the word <hi>Altar</hi>
does not alwayes e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>presse so much as holy Table in
our sense, as the vulgar now use it, for this reason it
is not so fitly used in common speech.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Altar</hi> is more <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and uncertaine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64406:19"/>
then the holy Table; for as Sacrifice is appliable to
all diuine services of Heathens, Jewes, and Papists;
so <hi>Altar</hi> is as generall: but our Service here being
more eminent and excellent, deserves a name as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar.
A King is a man and more, hee is truly a
man, yet his distinct name of King is more fit to be
be used: for the title of King, includes the name of
man; but the name of man does not include the
title of King. The Doctors being so egar for the
names of Sacrifice and <hi>Altar,</hi> ought to have proved
those name<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the most honourable; but of this they
have made no proofe at all: for even amongst the
Jewes, obedience, humiliation, and internall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the soule was of more acceptation in the
sight of God, then the flesh of Buls, or the fat of a
thousand Rams. The Passeover also, which was
both Sacrament and Sacrifice; yet was farre more
reverent as a Sacrament, then as a Sacrifice: and they
which did keepe that with the inward preparation
of an humbled spirit without legall purity, were
more accepted (as appeares by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over)
then meere legall preparation could make any.
Besides, the Table to our Sacrament is not as the
<hi>Altar</hi> was to the Jewish Sacrifice, for the Jewish
<hi>Altar</hi> did sanctifie the Sacrifice, but our Table bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
its sanctity from the Sacrament. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
honour the Table as a sacred Utensill, but wee
attract no honour from it, we hold it a diminution
to name the Sacrament by the <hi>Altar,</hi> when we may
more honourably name it by the body and blood
of our Saviour. For our Princes sake we bowe to
his chair, but we denominate not the Prince by his
chaire, or bowe to the Prince for the chaires sake;
neither doe we disgrace the word Table, or <hi>Altar,</hi>
when we denominate not the Sacrament by them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64406:20"/>
but contrary to the Papists, we rather name the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
by the body of Christ, then by them, as
we stile Kings rather by Nations then Castles, or
Villages, though they be equally Lords of both.
The Jewes had Sacraments more honourable in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then meere Sacrifices, and our Sacraments are
farre more pretious then the Jewish, and therefore
the wrods Sacrifice and <hi>Altar</hi> must needs be lessening
words to our Sacrament. And were they not lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
words, yet for other reasons, wee see our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
have disused them; and chosen rather to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the Sacrament by the body of Christ, then
to descend to a community of name therein with
Jewes, Pagans, and Papists. And we may conceive,
that if our Ancestors had no respect to future abuse
in abolishing the words Sacrifice, and <hi>Altar;</hi> yet
they might have to former: for <hi>Altars</hi> as they are
Jewish are to be deserted, as Paganish detested, as
Popish abhorred. The brazen Serpent might have
remained as free from abuse after <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> dayes, as
it had done before; and yet though the sinne night
have beene reformed, &amp; the thing reserved, that good
King out of indignation, as wel as prevention, takes
it away, and defaces it. We may read further of
this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 13. For the same reason the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would not use the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
nor the Latins <hi>aru,</hi> but <hi>Altare:</hi> because they would
avoid community with Heathens, though there was
no sinne in the bare words. And this kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
is commended as pious by Sir <hi>Francis, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
even against words in themselves offencelesse,
where better choyce may be had, and where great
abuse has beene offered. To conclude then, if
words may bee prophaned, and made unchristian,
meerely by comming into the mouths of Pagans,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64406:20"/>
&amp;c. Surely much more impurity and offence is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to stick upon the things themselves: but in things
abused by Papists, wherein we ought to to elongue
our selves from them, I thinke we ought not to look
upon them as the Primitive Christians did the
Jewes, but as the Jewes did Heathens. For the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Religion had beene true, and was rather altered
then abolisht, and that in accidents, rather then in
substance; and so we must not hold of the Popish
schisme. And it may be conceived, that our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
in the reformation did shun correspondence
and conformity with Papists in some things and
words otherwise indifferent, not onely for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, but also out of policie; for my opinion
is that our approaching towards Popery in some
of their rites, and traditions, does the more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Papists, and make our cause seeme a weake and
warping cause. But this is a <hi>sic videtur</hi> onely; Iob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
it upon no man, it may be the good worke
which the piety of these warping times seemes so
willing to incline to, is more visible to Doctor <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
then it is to me.</p>

and that onely for innovations sake. Doctor <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>

thereof then theirs: but it is a wonder, since the
Doctors would faine prove such toleration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that Churches and <hi>Altars</hi> might have beene
before <hi>Constantine,</hi> that they make no proofe at all

for his first proofe alleadges, that the Primitive

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> at
the East end of the Church. And sayes he, if the
Table was placed East-ward, then doubtlesse in the
most eminent part of the East, that no man might
have place beyond it: for any man standing beyond
the Table, must either not pray towards the East,
or not towards the Table. Be it granted that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64406:21"/>
Antient Christians had a custome to pray
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that because our Sauiour
hung upon the Crosse with his face West-ward, as both
may be questioned; yet this we receive onely from
writers which lived West from <hi>Judea,</hi> where our
Saviour was crucified, and this justifies it not in
the Westerne parts of Christendome, and if it does,
yet what followes? does the reason of this main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the <hi>Altar</hi> posture. So is it therefore a sinne to
take the wall of the <hi>Altar</hi> when we pray? or if thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
be a sinne, can it be no wayes avoided, but by the
<hi>Altar</hi> posture? Amongst the Jewes, the West was
most honourable, and yet the Arke was not so fixed
to the West wall of the Oracle, that the Cherubins
might not stand betweene; and therefore honour
is not alwayes rigorously, and superstitiously to be
applyed Besides, if our Saviours posture on the
Crosse be the rule of our posture in our dev<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> not to all Christians, but onely to
such as lie West from <hi>Judea;</hi> for those which lie
East, by the same rule, if they will not turne their
backs to our Saviour ought to turne their faces to
the West: but why should any certaine postures bee
held so necessary, when all nations cannot agree
in the same for the same reason? Whatsoever was
formerly by some imagin'd, we know that the East
is named so from the rising of the Sunne, and wee
know the Sunne has neither rising not setting, but
comparative, and so <hi>America</hi> is as properly East, as
<hi>China,</hi> for if <hi>America</hi> lie West to us, yet it lies East
to <hi>China;</hi> which lies East to us. The Doctor tels as

to the contrary. If the Christians prayed Eastward
onely, because their Churches were so built, then
they held that posture of praying in it selfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and if they built so because they prayed so,
then they held the posture for building so to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
and sure the proofe is very weake, that
the Primitives did put any vertue in all places of the
world either in building or in praying East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
since it is most apparent, that private dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and Pagan Temples, and Jewish Synagogues
were at first converted into Churches, and some new
erections were not contrived in this Eastern posture.
For his second proofe, the Doctor sayes, that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
(according to Bishop <hi>Juell,</hi> the Quire or
Chancell was drawne with curtaines, and this
would be very unsightly (he sayes) if the Table
should stand in the middle, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

The Doctor here makes no difference betweene a
Cathedrall, and Parochiall Church, for in Par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

a curtaine may hang at the Chancell dore
without incumb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ance, and in Cathedrals it may be
drawne in the middest of the Quire without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
though the Table stand not neere the
wall. In our Cathedrals, the Quires are now so
spatious, that a third part of them may bee assigned
to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Altar</hi> place, and yet all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may stand in the other division, nay, if in Saint
<hi>Pauls London,</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> wall were againe removed, as
it was in <hi>Ridleys</hi> time, the <hi>Altar</hi> would be seene
standing in the very middle of the Quire. For his
third proofe, the Doctor cites the <hi>Altar</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which not standing to the East,
is storied to have differed in posture from all other
Churches. If it be granted that all Churches in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64406:22"/>
West parts from <hi>Antioch;</hi> nay, all of the whole
world had <hi>Altars</hi> standing towards the East; this
proves not that they touched the East wall, and
stood side wayes. The Doctors fourth proofe is from
the divisions in Churches, for first occurred (hee
sayes) the seates of the Presbyters, and then above
them the Episcopall throne, and above all the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This is spoken onely of Cathedrals, and
in Cathedrals we see the same division still; yet see
withall, that betwixt the Bishops throne and the
<hi>Altar</hi> wall, there is a great distance, so that the <hi>Altar</hi>
is not necessarily driven close to the wall. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
last and maine proofe is from the custome of
Papists, who since they retaine the old fashion of
their buildings, are not likely to innovate in the
fashion of their <hi>Altars.</hi> This proofe is no stranger
for <hi>Altar</hi> posture, then for the multitude of Pillar-<hi>Altars,</hi>
Chappell-<hi>Altars,</hi> and Requiem-<hi>Altars,</hi> and
for a thousand other superstitions; and yet we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
more over that it was not so easie for the Papists
to alter in the fashion of Churches, as <hi>Altars,</hi> and
therefore this is a very non-concludent, argument. I
have now answered Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> and I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

to the appointment of visitors. And in the third of
Queene <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the visitors set forth their order, that
the steps in the Chancell shall be decently <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

they which indured not the forme of an <hi>Altar,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64406:23"/>
should indure the posture, or why they which liked
not that posture in time of receiving, should like it
at other times: or why they should call that the
North side, which our Doctors now will needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the North end of the Table. Lastly, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>sanctorum</hi> be <hi>interpres praeoeptorum,</hi> we must beleeve
that the <hi>Altar</hi> posture had not beene so generally
used in all Parochials in the whole Kingdome ever
since the reformation, and no care thereof taken by
authority, if it had beene irregular. But the Doctor
sayes that the <hi>Altar</hi> posture is retained in the Kings
Chappell, and in Cathedrals, and that they ought to
give Law, and not to receive it from Parochials. For
answer we say that Chappels and Cathedrals have
their own peculiar Statutes, &amp; may differ sometimes
from themselves therein, and from Parochials, but
Parochials are all governed by the publike Canons:
besides we see there is a great difference in the very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
between Cathedrals, Chappels, and Parochials;
and therefore in Parochials the Table is removed in
time of administration, because the Chancel was not
held so fit for the audience and accesse of the people,
but in Cathedrals, and Chappels, no such removall is
necessary. Chappels &amp; Cathedrals <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> also other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as in pompe, and in the intelligence of the
congregation; and in this respect also ceremoni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
may be perhaps the more plausible in them, then
they are in Parochials. The Doctor lastly cites Saint
<hi>Gregories</hi> case, and sayes that their <hi>Altar</hi> posture was
adjudged by the Kings owne decision. But I conceive
otherwise, for these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because that Church of Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> stood
under the very wall of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and owed a filiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because that Church had no Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64406:24"/>
to officiate in, but was built Chappell wise, the
East eud thereof being sufficiently visible to all the
congregation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because the King did not intimate in his
order that he intended to make that case a precedent
to other Parochials, and we know no reason why
that pleasure should be concealed, which desires to
be obeyed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because many other visitors both wise
and godly, have not taken it as an over-ruling Law
in their Jurisdictions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the King did onely settle the Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
removed, and prevent further removals, but hee
did not place it side-way to the East wall himselfe,
and we know the Law would not have all things
done, which it hinders from being undone. For
these reasons it may be conjectured that the Kings
aime was at uniformity onely, but not in all things,
nor at all times where the like reason is not. And
since <hi>B. Bilson</hi> sayes that the very word <hi>Altar</hi> so<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nts
superstition, and the Parliament adjudges that the
forme of a Table shall more move from superstition,
and there can be no reason why the posture of the
<hi>Altar</hi> should not fall under the same, consideration,
we conceive the Kings meaning to have beene mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

               <p>THe honour and sanctity of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and that
adoration which is due thereunto, is now to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64406:24"/>
insisted upon. The name, nature, and posture of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
has beene all this while so stifly vindicated, and
maintained in behalfe of the Table; that a divine
worship might be asserted and challenged as due to
it: but now behold on a sudden, when the name of
<hi>Altar</hi> will not serve, the name of Arke must supply
that office. In the twinckling of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> eye the scene is
changed by our Doctors, and that which was an
<hi>Altar</hi> before, is now become an <hi>Arke;</hi> and that
which stood before in the Sanctuary is now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the Propitiatory, and there shrowdes it self
under the wings of Cherubins. The surest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
now is, that as our Churches are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
holy, and reverenced as the Temple was amongst
the Jewes; so in our Churches the holy Table (not
<hi>Altar</hi>) stands responsible to the Arke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and the Mercie-seate. Doctor <hi>Micklethwaite</hi>
sayes, that God may be worshipped in such places
where his presence is truly specified: as it was in
the Mount, in the Temple, &amp;c. and if under the
Law it was no idolatry to worship towards the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and monuments of Gods extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
it is none in the Gospel. And thus it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
(he sayes) to lift up our hands and eyes towards
heaven, and so vocally implore God, because in the
act of such worship, we use heaven but as a meere
circumstance, not as an object, no not relative, or
mediate, and we direct our posture only, and not at
all the act of our worship towards it. Hence he infers
that the like respect may be used to our Table or
<hi>Altar,</hi> which the Jewes used to the Arke or Temple,
because ours answer to theirs, being according to
antiquity, <hi>solium, Christi,</hi> and <hi>oculus Ecclesiae.</hi> So wee
see his maine ground is that a reverentiall posture
being due to any sacred place where Gods presence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64406:25"/>
is specially manifested, as in the Church, &amp;c. this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
best directed to that place of the Church which
is most sacred, and of most eminent relation to
God; and that place is the <hi>Altar,</hi> or Table. God
is in all places present, and yet the monuments, and
specifications of his presence are not alike cleare
and glorious in all places: his presence in heaven is
not as it is in the Jewish Temple, nor in the
Jewish Temple as in ours, nor in our Churches as
in common places: Gods presence is sometimes in
some places extraordinary, yet even his very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence is not alwayes to be alike honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all places, and at all times. Heaven it selfe is
not to be made the object, but onely the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of devotion, and that not of the act, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the posture of our worship; and yet Heaven
is indeed the true Throne of God, and can therefore
the lifting up of our hands to God in Heaven, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the falling downe before an <hi>Altar?</hi> Had the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
first proved that the Table was <hi>solium Christi,</hi>
and the Chancell <hi>oculus Ecclesiae,</hi> and that there was
the same adoration now due to the <hi>Altar,</hi> as was
once to the Arke; and that Gods presence is so now
specified in our Churches as it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or as it is in Heaven; he had maintained enough
for the meere posture of adoration. But since this
maine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is still unproved, it will bee better
worth my while to passe from hence to Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Lawrence</hi> his Sermon upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. where hee is
more full, expresse, and direct in the point, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other of the Doctors. There was (sayes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Lawrence</hi>) a holinesse acknowledged amongst
the Jewes in places, in persons, and in things; and
that according to degrees, some holy, some more
holy, some most holy: according to the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64406:25"/>
of Gods residence and grace, as that did more
or lesse shine upon them. Not onely the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the Mount, the Temple; but even the staming
bush shewes this: for at a nearer distance <hi>Moses</hi>
might not be at all, nor at a farther without unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his shooes. Hence the Doctor indeavours to
conclude, that if Gods presence and grace was the
cause of this holinesse amongst the Jewes; then the
same reason of holinesse remaines still amongst us
Christians, since no man can deny that God is still
as present and gratious amongst Christians, as eve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he was amongst the Jewes. And in this hee does
not depart from the same principles which Doctor
<hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>klethwaite</hi> took before for granted, and which at
first view carry a very specious colour of reason with
them. To this therefore I make a fourefold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>First, It is true, God is now as present, and as
gratious in his presence as ever he was amongst the
Jewes: but he is not so visibly, nor so majestically
present to us as to the Jewes. There is some kinde
of opposition betwixt Majesty and love; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Poet affirmes, <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bene conveniunt, nec in
una sede morantur:</hi> To us God descends in more
love, to the Jewes in more Majesty, and wee hold
that a severall entertainment is due accordingly.
Majesty requires more externall prostration, and
feare; love expects more internall joy, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Even in these dayes when we come to the
Church of God; we ought to make our addresse
with all possible humility and zeale: but if God
should in the Church appeare in fire, or any fearfull
similitude to us, as he did formerly, certainely we
ought to clea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to the dust, and to inwrap our selves
externally in the more confusion; and yet God is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64406:26"/>
not the more truly, or gratiously present, because
of that apparition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when God did ocularly appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jewes, hee did not at all times,
and in all places, and of all men require the
same adoration: so that we may suppose that the
manner of adoration given, was not meerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God did appeare; but brcause God would
have his apparition so entertained. <hi>Moses</hi> here did
worship, but God commanded the manner of his
worship; and in many other interviewes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherin God did grace both Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
wee doe not read of any consecration of
place, or any such distinct adoration, as this of
<hi>Moses,</hi> either commanded by God or performed by
man. Certainely <hi>Elijah,</hi> when God passed by him,
and gave him the beatificall sight of his back-parts
fell prostrate upon the ground, to humble, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
himselfe before that gratious presence: but that
he performed any homage, or gratefull service to
the place it selfe, we doe not reade. Besides, in this
case of the blazing bush, there was a command, and
that but temporall; and we doe not reade that any
holinesse did remain in the bush after the command.
So also the holinesse of the Mount, of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
of the Temple, as it was created by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, so that command had its limits of
time, by which we may observe in my opinion, that
the honour was rather politicall then physicall (as
I may so say) &amp; without speciall command had not
bin due in such a manner or degree. But (sayes D.
<hi>Lawrence</hi>) after an apparition in <hi>Luz, Jacob</hi> anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Pillar, &amp; built an <hi>Altar</hi> &amp; changed the name of
the place from <hi>Luz</hi> to <hi>Bethel. Jacob</hi> did so, and did
religiously in doing so; but yet if we suppose <hi>Jacob</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64406:26"/>
had no especiall command to doe so, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
that <hi>Jacob</hi> had finned if he had not done
so. Besides, <hi>Jacob</hi> did erect those Monuments of
honour, not onely in celebration of that ground
whereon he was reposed, when he beheld the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ascending, and descending: but also of that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
gate of Heaven which opened it self to him to
inebriate his soule with such celestiall beautifull
spectacles. And lastly, <hi>Jacob</hi> did chuse that place
whereon to worship God, but this does not imply
that <hi>Jacob</hi> did performe any reverence at all, or
honour to the place it selfe; and so if he had done
the like in another place, upon another occasion,
he had done well.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Jewish honour and reverence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the manner of it was chiefely negative, and
except in cases of divine worship, and civill worship,
we read of no other. The Arke was so holy that it
might not be approacht, or toucht but with such
and such conditions: so the bush which Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
inflamed, it was too holy for too neere accesse,
a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the ground about it too pretious to be trod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with uncleane shooes: but who ever read of any
bowing, or kneeling, or positive adoration attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Arke, or bush, or Temple, or any other
thing under the Jewish discipline? Doctor <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
indeed does produce a third kind of worship
betwixt divine and civill, which he cals reverentiall,
or religious: but he does not fully prove what kind
of conditions it had, whether it was positive, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
internall, or externall, or how farre it did
extend, or how farre it was due to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> relative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for Gods sake; wherefore, if the Doctor
means this negative kind of worship which consists
in distance and forbearance for reverentiall, it is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64406:27"/>
most evident that this kinde of worship was never
in use since Christs time, as to the rigor of it, nor
cannot be now introduced without great absurdity,
and superstition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the honour and worship of God i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not
to be weighed in humane ballances, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or lesse according to that proportion, which we
call Arithmetical, or Geometricall. <hi>Moses</hi> being in the
bosome of God, far above the sight of the people, is
not to be supposed to honour or worship God lesse
by his familiarity, then the meanest of the peopl w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
lay groveling &amp; trembling at the feete of God, and
durst not approach the very outmost, and lowest
borders of the mountaine. Some resemblance wee
have of this in Princes Courts, for it is not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in some favorites to be covered in the Kings
presence, or to approach the bed-chamber, though
it be almost capitall in others; and yet where Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are so familiarly honoured, they may be sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured without all saucinesse; and such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
may stand as compatible with internall
humility, as the most debafing subjection in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
men. So if God doe admit <hi>Moses</hi> into familiarity,
into such familiarity as abates of externall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and distance, and feare; yet it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
that <hi>Moses</hi> is hereby transported beyond
the limits of internall awe, and zeale, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
And if it was so amongst the Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in those rigorous times, shall it not be so now
amongst Christians, when Christs iron Scepter is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a golden sheep-book in his hand? In the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
worship there was feare, but not without joy, in
the Christian worship there is joy, but not without
some feare: for as feare was more predominant in
them, so joy is in us. Why is our Saviours raigne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64406:27"/>
over us now called in the Scripture, the Kingdome
of Heaven? Certainely, in comparison of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
which the Jewes lived under, for in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Jewish, which is more earthly, our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
now is like that of the triumphant Saints in
Heaven, where joy is predominant, and not feare;
wherefore it is not rightly objected by Doctor
<hi>Lawrence,</hi> when he expostulates thus. Shall God
loose part of his honour from us, by sending his
Sonne to us? must there be lesse <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>linesse in the
Church where Christ is in truth sacrificed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
then where he was sacrificed in a type or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
by <hi>Aaron</hi> in the Temple? I answer, no: God
loses no honour, the Church loses no holinesse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the rigorous worship of the Jewes which
consisted in distance and terror, and forbearance,
be mitigated by the milde, sweete, and peacefull raign
of our Saviour over us, we worship with more joy
and confidence then <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Moses</hi> then the Jewes,
the Saints in Heaven then us; yet neither <hi>Moses,</hi>
nor we, nor the glorified Saints diminish, but adde
rather to the glory of God, and if any men now
thinke that the most servile worship is not honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, even when they are most over-whelmed
with feare, and lie lowest upon the dust, the Saints in
Heaven may upbraidingly say unto them, or rather
triumphantly sing: <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Curvae in terras animae, at <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lesti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inanes.</hi> But will
D. <hi>Lawrence</hi> say, is not this the doctrine of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Corahs</hi> of this age? does not this doctrine make
all persons alike holy, and all places, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all order in Religion? Our Saviour tels us
in the Gospel, that the Temple is holier then the
gold, and the <hi>Altar</hi> then the gift; and by expulsing
those exchangers and hucksters beyond the utmost
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64406:28"/>
borders of the Sanctuary, both after his Baptisme,
and before his Passion, when those legall Sacrifices
were before ejected thence, where the Christian
Church was best represented, their lasting devotion
being performed here, their expiring types within,
showes that this distinction should last. The Doctors
first proofe was, So it was amongst the Jewes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so it ought to be now: in this place the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
proceeds to show further, that by our Saviours
owne doctrine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd precedent the Jewish distinction
of holinesse in the Church ought still to remaine.
To the Jewish platforme of Worship, it was in
part answered before; that our Saviour had made
an alteration thereof, inducing in its stead a more
ingenuous confident manner of worship: but now
this of the Doctors seemes to crosse that opinion.
By this argument the Doctor would seeme to prove
that our Saviour was so far from violating the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
distinctions, that he did zealously preserve them
and vindicate them from the violations of other
men; and that also after the ejection of legall Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I answer, It is confest that our Saviour did purge
the Temple from the prophanation of those which
bought and sold therein, as in a common place: but
herein many things are considerable, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
passes over with silence.</p>
               <p>First, these buyers, and sellers, did not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a common trade in that sanctified place, but it
should seem their trading was full of fraud, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
for our Saviour sayes plainely that they
made the house of prayer a very den of theeves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not manifest whether legall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were now <hi>de jure</hi> ejected or no, and so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this prophanation be to be considered as a tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
committed against the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64406:28"/>
of a Christian Oratory. Baptisme was now
in force by <hi>Johns</hi> institution, but Circumcision
was not disanulled by any act of our Saviour, nor
disused by his Apostles, for we finde the contrary
even after Christs Ascension. Besides, we finde not
that our Saviour, till his passion, did repeate, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any Mosaicall rites whatsoever, but wee finde
apparently, that he did observe strictly many of
them. He observed the Sabbath, he did eate the
Passeover, he did refraine the lists of the inner courts,
&amp;c. and till his expiration he did not teare the vaile
of the Oracle in sunder: so that we see no reason why
the Temple till then might not remaine wholly
Jewish.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, consider this act of prophanation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and it is no wonder that our Saviour
should reforme it: for even in Christian Oratories
at this day no such thing ought to be indured. He
which denies any externall positive adoration or
genuflexion due to the Church it selfe, or any divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it, or utensill in it, does not deny internall,
and such negative reverence as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it
should be free, &amp; preserved inviolable from common,
servile exercises, and offices, and much more from
impious abuses. This unjust aspersion the Doctors
every where labour to cast upon us, but as they want
proofe to confirme it, so I hope they will want au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
to beleeve it. But if wee suppose this as a
hrist an abuse, the Temple being now <hi>de jure</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
why did not our Saviour comming with such
unresistible authority purge the inner court, and
Oracle also from Jewish ceremonious services, and
destinate them to prayer, and preaching, as well as
the outer court? Why did he not enter and draw
the vaile, and dissolve that partition as after he did?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64406:29"/>
If the Jewish devotions had beene now fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated,
who had beene more fit to enter into the
Holiest, then He and his Disciples? or what Incense
could have beene more sacred in that place then his
prayers? Certainely if his time had beene come, he
might have as well expelled the Priests and Levites
usurping against him, as he did the chapmen of
Doves and Oxen: and certainely he did not want
boldnesse, for wee know with what freedome hee
spoke at other times to the greatest of them. So then
this is a very weake argument to prove that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did still preserve in force that terrible kinde of
holinesse in the Church of God, which makes some
parts thereof inaccessible to Lay-men, and others to
Priests according to the Jewish patterne. But on the
contrary what is more apparent then this truth,
that our Saviour hath rent in sunder that vaile of
partition, which these Doctors would faine hang
up againe, that they might usurpe a greater dignity
to themselves, and their owne Order, then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ doth allow them? As to the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the throne of grace, and that with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wee say wee are all royall Priests now, and
we are not to disclaime that prerogative, because
the Doctor seemes to jeere at it. It is true that the
Nation of the Jewes was also stiled a Priestly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to the Lord, and it was so in comparison of
all other Nations which then lived: but whereas it
is said now that we are a royall Priest-hood, it is
said in comparison of the Jewes themselves. <hi>Aaron</hi>
might once a yeere approach the Oracle, but with
feare and trembling, presenting Incense in one hand
and blood in the other: but we may now approach
that Throne which is more honourable then the
Oracle, and that with boldnesse, and at all times
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64406:29"/>
whatsoever. Neverthelesse, I doe not say that the
raigne of our Soveraigne doth take away the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of persons, or places, or things, but it changeth
that holinesse which was in them, and maketh the
manner thereof different. That holinesse which was
then in the High Priest, is now dispersed into all the
people of God, for if we are all Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Aaron</hi> was,
certainely we are all Priests of a higher order then
<hi>Aarons</hi> was. Therefore the sinne of <hi>Corah</hi> cannot
justly be charged upon us under the Gospel (as the
Doctor would have it) if we claime accesse into the
Holiest, for <hi>Aarons</hi> order is now dissolved, and so
are the conditions of <hi>Aarons</hi> order. Neither <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et the
Doctor suppose that I make no difference now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the person of a Priest, and of a Lay-man as
to all purposes: for all equality does not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all order and decencie. <hi>Vzziah</hi> had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as sacred as the Priest, yet <hi>Vzzia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> might
not officiate as the Priest did: <hi>Vzziah</hi> had his offices
distinct, and so had the Priest; and these offices
might not be confounded <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontrary to decencie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the sanctity of persons might be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
without disorder. So now it were disorder
and the confusion of <hi>Corah</hi> for a secular man to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe
the function of a Minister, but it is not the
same, to challenge an equall prerogative in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
empire of our Saviour. In the like manner
we say of places, the sanctity of them is altered, not
destroyed: we say, God is now more extensively, and
universally present by his grace then hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jewes. In <hi>Judea</hi> (as to his terrestriall
habitation) he did confine himselfe within the wals
of one Temple, but now that of <hi>Malachy</hi> is verified,
where the Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, from the rising of the Sunne,
unto the going downe of the same, my name shall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64406:30"/>
be great among the Gentiles, and in every place I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
Besides, as God now inhabits amongst us
more universally, so also more amiably: or else no
Lay-men, nor Priests, but with such and such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
might make any addresse at all into the
Church or C<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>cell; which the Papists themselves
doe not maintaine. To the Jewes God was more
dreadfull, as to servants; to us he is more milde, as
to sonnes. The Law was delivered with terror, and
so kept, for it was made mortall to approach either
the Moune where the Law was delivered, or to
touch the Arke where it was kept: But when our
Saviour came into the world to publish his Gospel,
he tooke not on the habit of a Lord, but of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
and as his entrance, so his life and death was,
and as his soveraignty was acquired, so it seemes to
be maintained ever since. In the like manner wee
say also, that there is a change of things. Many
externall rites, and customes of reverence, which
consisted in the rigorous observations of times, and
in the lotions of their bodies, and purity of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and cleannesse of diet, are vanished; and yet
some equity of these still remaines according to the
rules of order, and decencie, but no further. Though
these rites were honourable to God, and conducing
to decencie, and the pompe of Religion; yet the
strictnesse thereof is now relinquished according to
the <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 10. for there they are called carnall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
imposed on the Jewes only, untill the time
of reformation. Wherefore let the Doctor con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if all the Jewish rites which were requisite to the
externall honour of Religion, bee not as properly
vindicated, and maintained by these arguments as
the distinct sanctity of places in the Church: and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64406:30"/>
yet these no Papist will defend. Neverthelesse I doe
not speake against all pompe in Religion, I onely
say that simplicity seemes more sutable with these
times of Christianity wherein wee worship such a
Saviour as we doe. And on the other side, it is most
apparent that our pompe addes nothing to God:
for <hi>Aaron</hi> in all his beauty, <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
did retribute no more honour to God, then
<hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Isaack</hi> in their naked simplicity. But it
hath beene rather observed, that when the Church
had woodden Chalices, it had golden Priests, but
God send us golden Priests and golden Chalices
both. After our Saviours death, Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were accused amongst the Jewes for spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
against these Mosaicall distinctions in the
Temple, and here Doctor <hi>Lawrence</hi> sayes if the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
were true, it was just. I will aske the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
this question: Was the Temple at that time <hi>de
jure</hi> Jewish, or Christian? was Moses or Christ to
take place in it? if he say Christ, as he must, then
why should he thinke Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
more unworthy to enter into the most honourable
parts of the Temple, then any of the Jewish priests?
It ought not to be presumed that these blessed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Christ did generally vilifie the honour of
Gods house: but their crime was, that they did
preach against the Mosaicall strictnesse of the limits
and divisions of the Temple, shewing that all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
therein were approachable by the ador<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s of
Christ. There can be no other charge probable,
and if the Doctor say that in this they were justly
accused, he is as wrongfull a judge over them, as
any of the Jewes whatsoever could be.</p>
               <p>Now we come to Fathers, and Antiquity. The
Primitive Christians (sayes Doctor <hi>Lawrence</hi>) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64406:31"/>
their Oratories into an <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rium, Sanctum,</hi>
and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and accordingly put more
holinesse in one then in the other, having an <hi>Altar</hi>
here answerable to an Arke there, and in signe of
perpetuity poynted their Churches East, looking
towards the Temple. In this conceit Doctor <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
goes not alone; onely the other Doctors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the changing of the Scene from the <hi>Sanctum,</hi>
to the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> from the <hi>Altar</hi> to the
Arke, upon the sudden would be too remarkable,
are more sparing of language. But what an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this? Because the Primitive Christians did
build their Churches with some kinds of divisions
resembling the Jewish Temple, and because they
did esteeme one place more holy then another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did esteeme the very Jewish holinesse, and
distinctions in all things equally in force. It should
seeme the <hi>Altar</hi> was advanced to an higher dignity,
and removed out of the <hi>Sanctum,</hi> to possesse the
place of the Arke, and the Mercie seate, because this
alteration suits with the Doctors purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in all
other things the Jewish honour and holinesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
unchanged in our Churches. The building
of our Churches East also looking towards the
Jewish Temple, shewes the perpetuity of holinesse,
and although this be but a particular reason not to
be extended to any Churches, but such as stand
West from <hi>Judaea;</hi> yet for the Doctors benefit it
must be taken for universall. Neither must we make
any use of this Doctors argument to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
although it be as apply able to the Heathen
Temples, as to ours, or the Jewish, for they had
the same divisions also, whereof some were more
holy and unaccessible then others. But it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that the Jewish sanctity in its strictnesse cannot
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64406:31"/>
be attributed to our Quire by our Doctors owne
Tenet, for he himselfe grants it accessible to Priests,
and all within Orders: and we on the other side
in an equitable sense allow it more reverence then
other parts of the Church, therefore what kinde
of honour is it which the Doctor challenges both
different from the Jewish, and ours also? If the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church stood wholly to the Jewish patterne,
then they may be produced against the Doctor, as
well as against us, if not, how are they produced
against us in this point more then against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himselfe? That antiquity did observe a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene common and consecrated ground,
and also betweene one consecrated place and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and in the fashion of their buildings hold
some complyance with Jewes and Gentiles both,
so farre as the rules of decencie, and charity did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
certainly it was piously, and prudently done.
That which we say is onely this.</p>
               <p>First, we doe not perceive that antiquity did
strictly adhere to the Jewish discipline.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if antiquity in honouring of sacred
places were more rigorous then we are now, we doe
imagine that in part it was erroneous, and in part
that it had some reasons unknowne to us at this
time, and so vanished now, that they ought not to
prescribe to us. All rude prophanation of holy
ground wee doe dislike as antiquity did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is opposite to the rules of decencie and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and if any man teach that the house of God is
contemptible, or that there ought to be a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of places, or persons we wish the <hi>Anathema</hi> of
Gangra to seize upon him. Howsoever we dare not
in all things follow antiquity. If antiquity did
thinke the Church too holy for justice to approach,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64406:32"/>
when malefactors sought shelter there from the due
execution of law, we dare not follow antiquity
therein; if antiquity did thinke the Quire so holy
that the person of an anoynted Emperour might
have no place therein, we dare not in this follow
antiquity: if antiquity did thinke the Chancell
ground too holy for any Lay-mans bones to repose
in, or the Church-yard too unholy for a Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment,
we dare not justifie this usage: if antiquity
did thinke fit to translate the bones <hi>Peter, Paul, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
Aidan, &amp;c.</hi> from one consecrated place to
another for more holinesse sake, as if it were profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the ashes of the Saints so to be translated,
we dare not applaud this invention: if antiquity
did place such holinesse in the <hi>Altar,</hi> as if it had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall
force in it to cure bodily diseases, and for
that reason did fall downe before it, as to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Physitian, wee cannot so farre abuse our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:
if antiquity did exclude divers stations of
Christians from divers partitions and limits in the
body of the Church, wee dare not now in these
dayes practise this observation. We doe not hold
the judgement of antiquity to be in all things infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
neither in these circumstances dare we strictly
addict our selves to their imitation: the Papists
themselves being scarce devoted to all these observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at this day. But if we approve antiquity in all
these things, yet how does it appeare that it did
sanctifie the <hi>Altar</hi> in stead of the Arke, and Mercie-seate,
or the Chancell in the same manner as the
Jewish Oracle was? and if it did, how could our
Priests prove hence such worship as they now chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
due to the <hi>Altar?</hi> If we consider the Arke and
the Oracle, and compare them with our Table, and
Quire, we shall finde that the paralell of honour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64406:32"/>
cannot hold for many reasons; for, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>First, Those times were not as ours are, the
sweete pacification of Christ had not then made
God so indulgent to mankind, as now he is, so that
he would be glorified then with more terror than
now he is. God in those dayes did not admit of
so much familiarity in his Servants, as now he does,
yet to shew that some familiarity might be without
sawcinesse (which the Doctor seemes unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grant) to some men he offered himselfe in
the milde semblance of a familiar friend, even in
those times. This, the examples of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, Moses, &amp;c.</hi> sufficiently verifie. Was <hi>Moses</hi> saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or <hi>Joshua, &amp;c.</hi> when he ascended up into the
Mount within the cloud, and brightnesse of God?
or was the Congregation more reverent, and obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious
when they durst not so much as lift up their
eye after <hi>Moses,</hi> because of the terror of God? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
no: for God was more sanctified by the
bold addresse of <hi>Moses,</hi> then by the awfull distance
of the people, and therefore, whilest their faces
were blacke with feare, his face was arayed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
splendor, and Majesty. Neither was it the
holinesse of <hi>Moses</hi> his person, but the gratious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of God, that made this difference betwixt
him and the people: And so wee say now of these
dayes, <hi>mutatis, mutandis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Table is of it selfe much different
from the Arke, and Mercy seate. The Arke was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
by reason of the Law of God, which was
therein inclosed, that mortall Law, from whose
condemnation no man living could escape of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
But the Table presents us with the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the Gospell, wherein is life, and health, and
forgivenesse of sinnes. Also, the Arke was Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64406:33"/>
with the Mercy seate, that dreadfull Thro<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
of God, where God did keepe a strange residence,
vocally ruling his people, and administring justice
after a terrible manner: But the Table is an <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill,
wherein God is not so presentiall at all times,
nor at any time meerely by the meanes of that it
selfe, but by the meanes of the Sacrament at some
times supported by it. Also, the <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
it selfe was such a place, as was wonderfully
terrible by reason of Gods residence in it, after the
losse of the Arke, and the Mercy seate: And so<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
doe not repute our Chancells; whose chiefest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is borrowed from the holy table: and for these
reasons we know the Arke was not to be touched,
even by a Priest, and that upon a godly considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but upon such penalty as <hi>Vzzah</hi> indured, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd
with this condition our Table cannot <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uite, and we
know that the Oracle also was not to be approached
but once a yeare, and that by the High Priest only, &amp;
with this condition also our Quires cannot agree,
for if these conditions were admitted, the Table
might not be touched, or remooved, or altered for
any reason whatsoever, or any other place designed
for the administration of the Communion: or any
other time appointed but once every yeare.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Neither the Gospell written, nor the pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of antiquity doe informe us, that ever the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
and Chancell were so honoured by Christians, as
the Arke, and Oracle were by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> we see no
probability that ever the Table was accounted any
thing but a holy utensill, till Doctor <hi>Helyn</hi> dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ned that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for why should the chalice and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
be utensils, and not the Table, they being more
necrely imployed about the body and blood of our
Saviour, then the Table? if the Table be not as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64406:33"/>
meere an instrument, and utensill as the Chalice is,
then the Doctor must derive its honour from some
other thing than the Sacrament, and designe it for
some higher use proper to it selfe, as the Arke and
Merci-seate was: but this the Doctor cannot doe,
and if he should attempt it, even so he would crosse
his owne assertions. The Arke with the Mercy-seat
could not properly be said an utensill in the Jewish
service, because they were ordained by God for no
humane office, but rather for a receptacle of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
as a place where God would set the soles of
his feete. But the Table is therefore placed in the
Church, that it may be employed in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and if the Communion had not beene institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
no such thing had beene necessary at all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it of any absolute necessity in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for in case of persecution, it is held, that for
want of a Table, wee may celebrate the Eucharist
upon the ground it selfe. Besides, among the Jewes
the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi> instruments were of the
same metall, in the same manner beautified, and
with the same solemnity consecrated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why our chalice and patin should not much
rather be of the same honour and sanctity as the
Table, I cannot discerne. For it is most certaine
that our Table is more properly a relative instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our Sacrament, from whence it receives all
its honour, then the Jewish <hi>Altar</hi> was, which lent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to <hi>Mosaical</hi> Sacrifices, rather than borrow' d any.</p>
               <p>But (sayes Doctor <hi>Lawrence</hi>) we finde a kinde
of Worship in <hi>Cyrill,</hi> a direct worship in <hi>Eusebius,
Emissenus, Theodoret, Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> We
have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>adgeniculation</hi>
in <hi>Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi> I answer,</p>
               <p>First, We our selves doe grant a reverentiall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64406:34"/>
due to all holy relative instruments for Go<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
sake, and therefore from all those Fathers which
speake generally, and meane no other but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as <hi>Ignatius</hi> does, we doe not at all dissent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where particular adgeniculation is
required, or bodily prostration, so it be in the time
of receiving, and tender'd for the Sacraments sake,
and not to the very Table, wee doe practise, and
allow it. And so wee agree with Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
that we ought to approach the Table, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. and <hi>cum prius adoraverimus</hi> with, Saint <hi>Austine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, At any time, as well when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not upon the Table, as when it is, we doe
not alwayes censure of such a decent bowing before
the Table, or towards the Table, as the Jewes did
performe towards the Mount, or Tabernacle, so
the Table it selfe be not the object, or held the onely
occasion of our worship.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we say the Table may be called holy,
venerable, and divine in a qualified sense, by reason
of its relation, as the garments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the
utensils of the Temple were, but this infers no duty
of Worship.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We say that antiquity might erre, by
way of superstition towards the Table, and this we
beleeve the rather, because in some places they did
ascribe inherent, physicall vertue to it, and at some
times such rigor of holinesse, that Princes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
might not be permitted to abide in the same
division of the Church where it stood: if <hi>Tertullian</hi>
say that bodily worship is due to the <hi>Altar,</hi> yet i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he prove it not out of Scripture, we answer out of
Saine <hi>Augustine: Non credimus, quod non legimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is not proved by any one humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or more, that <hi>Altar</hi> worship was in use in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64406:34"/>
all parts of Christendome at one time, or in any
one part at all times: much lesse is any thing brought
out of Scripture to this purpose.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the same manner, and by the same
authority we finde <hi>Presbyteris advolvi</hi> due, as well as
<hi>aris adgeniculari,</hi> and in antiquity also, it was part
of penance <hi>Presbyteris, &amp; aris advolvi.</hi> And we know
moreover, that not onely excessive honours, but
also all the revenues and treasure of Churchmen,
was first raised and advanced by this Art. It is not
to be wondred therefore, if ambitious and covetous
Prelates did so much magnifie, and extoll that,
which did so much magnifie and extoll them. Well
may the Pope still in all consecrations hallow the
<hi>Altar</hi> with most pompe, and ceremony, well may
he anoynt that, which was the first cause of anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him: well may he sacrifice to that net, which
has made all Princes sacrifice to him: well may he
claime divinity, and sanctity for that, which has
promoted him to fit in the Temple of God, as God,
nay above all that is called God. When the hornes
of Antichrist first began to shoote forth, when the
man of sinne, and the sonne of perdition first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be revealed, it had beene very unadvisedly
ordered, if Psalmes of degrees had not beene sung
at the ascending of those staires, whereby the Priest
did mount to as much, or more exaltation himselfe
as he did procure to the holy <hi>Altar.</hi> But this is a
tender point, and if I speake any thing in disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of antiquity, especially the great Bishops of
old times; I shall be fore-judged as a man ill-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to Truth, or Religion, and all which I shall say
will be soone rejected, and easily refuted.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to avoyd unjust imputations, I will
confine my selfe to the meere point in question, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64406:35"/>
digresse no further then the Doctors arguments <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
me, and therein also my chiefe indeavour shall be
to doe reason to Princes, not to detract at all from
Priests. Two things I shall observe.</p>
               <p>First, that this tenet of the <hi>Altar</hi>-doctrine, and
<hi>Altar</hi>-worship doth naturally issue forth conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are very dangerous, and prejudiciall to
Princes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Doctors have too farre co<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
and maintained the same in their late
Treatises concerning the <hi>Altar,</hi> contrary to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se
many pretenses of zeale and devotion, which they
every where make to the name of royalty. By the
Doctors grounds, meere relation to sacred things is
of vigor, and honour sufficient to transfer revere<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce
and dignity upon the instruments relatively used,
for sayes Doctor <hi>Lawrence,</hi> God is not worshipped,
if relative instruments be not worshipped for his
sake. This being granted, it followes, that most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is to be transferred upon that instrument,
which is most nobly relative, and so in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Priest being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Table
or patin, being but insensible utensils, the Priest is
to be accounted more holy, and honourable, then
either the Table, or patin. If so, then what becomes
of Princes? for they are as much inferiour to the
<hi>Altars</hi> in sanctity, as <hi>Altars</hi> are to Priests. They
are not holy enough to approach the rayle of the
<hi>Altar,</hi> or to stay in the Chancell, therefore, how
shall they demeane themselves towards Priests, who
are farre more honourable, and venerable in their
offices, then the <hi>Altars</hi> are in their imployments?</p>
               <p>Besides, if the <hi>Altar</hi> be honourable for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
sake, and the Sacrament onely or chiefely, as
it is a Sacrifice, then how honourable is he that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64406:35"/>
makes this a sacrifice, for the Sacrament is not a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
by vertue of our <hi>hoc edite,</hi> but only by vertue
of the Priests, <hi>hoc facite,</hi> so sayes Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> very
plainly. How many Kings ha's this doctrine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
dethroned? what warres and calamities has
it imbrued the whole world withall? when it first
brought Christians downe to the Clergies feete,
how many heresies did it broach? withall, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
myriads of Soules did it at the same instant sinke
into the Lake of Hell?</p>
               <p>But will the Doctors say, if Popish Priests have
made ill use of this doctrine, what is that to us, who
honour and adore soveraignty above all other men?
I wish the Doctors were as they pretend to bee, I
wish they were not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as they
taxe their opposites unjustly: I wish they did no
more profit by this doctrine then their adversaries
doe, or else I wish they did not more advance this
doctrine, then those which they call the seditious
<hi>Corahs</hi> of the time. But if the Doctors are so well
wishing to temporall rulers, how is it that they all
alleadge the example of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> so
often without any kinde of detestation, or dislike,
nay seeming rather to justifie, and applaud it? and
how is it, that they speake so pleasingly of <hi>Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus?
Numerianus</hi> sonne to <hi>Carus</hi> the Emperour
comming into the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and desiring to
behold their mysteries <hi>quasi per transennam,</hi> peeping
it is likely through the rayles or lattice dores of
the Quire, he was presently rebuked by <hi>Babylas</hi> for
that attempt: but this heinous prophanation was
committed but by the sonne of an Emperour, and
so <hi>Babylas</hi> might be the more bold in his rebuke,
therefore let us rather see how <hi>Theodosius</hi> was used
at <hi>Millaine. Theodosius</hi> a penitent Emperour having
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64406:36"/>
beene long prohibited, the Church and at last <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>

he was thought unworthy after his offring made <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

have any abode granted him within the bounds of

and a Christian Emperour, and a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Christian Emperour, it was not sufficient that i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
was within the Quire: but at the proud check of a
Bishop of <hi>Millaine</hi> sent by one of the Deacons, he
must depart that sacred place. This story the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
do all severally produce either once, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
if it were not dishonourable to all Princes to have

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in all Priests to suffer the mention thereof <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
passe uncensured from their lipps. Here is a cleare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
cited againe and againe with the weight of
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> his name to abet it, that by the rules
of approved antiquity, the persons of Princes were
not worthy to approach that part of the Church
where the <hi>Altar</hi> was placed, and where the Priest<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and Deacons did officiate. And if Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
would so extrude an annoynted Emperour at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine,</hi>
what would the Pope himselfe have done at
<hi>Rome?</hi> if such a pious Bishop would be so insolent
and distoyall, what would the Bishop of all Bishops
have done? The Doctors do not openly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in favour of this act of Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> because
I thinke it needs not, for their opinion in sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident of itselfe, and if they did not discover
their consent by silence, yet their scope in this whole
busines would make it manifest. For by what Law
did Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> confine the Emperour to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Church? it was not by the Law of God,
nor of the Emperour, for it should seeme the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64406:36"/>
had a contrary Law in his Easterne domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
it must needs be by this <hi>Altar</hi> Law, and this
only. If the <hi>Levites</hi> table be so much dignified and
hallowed meerly by bearing the body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
then certainly the Priest which con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecrates
the same, and is more nobly and intelligently active
in the celebration of the Sacrament, must needs
acquire much more dignity and holinesse: and if
so, then Priests must needs be more excellent then
Princes, then whom the table is more excellent.
This must needs bee that which did convince <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi>
and this if it be yeelded to, will still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and confound, and degrade all Christian
Princes whatsoever: for this is one of the most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
intoxications that the Inchantresse of <hi>Rome</hi>
mingles for the princes of the earth. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Popish Hierarchy are not yet quite
razed in many mens minds. The Scripture is cleere,
that as Priests are dedicated to God, and admitted
to a nearenesse in holy affaires, to serve and officiate
at Gods <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tar,</hi> and doe thereby gaine a sanctity
above meere Lay-men: so also that Princes are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

by God to feede, governe, and protect both Priests
and Lay-men, and to represent God himselfe in his

things of the highest, and holyest nature. <hi>Aar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

his solemne consecration from the hands of him
which weilds the scepter, and when the Law is to

Tabernacle, and the Arke, is to be framed, and when
the Temple is to be erected, the modells are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and committed to the charge of the Prince,
and when all is finished, the Princes blessing and
prayer presents the same as dedicated, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Gods service. And in all the offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the Priests serve in the outward action, but
the Lawgiver superintends over the Priests in
that service, and when any great difficulty requires,
God is to bee consulted and approached at the
command of the supreme Ruler: so that the good
or ill state of Religion depends chiefly upon the
good or ill government of Gods immediate Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.
And thus <hi>Aaron</hi> is but as a mouth to <hi>Moses</hi>
in some things, but <hi>Moses</hi> is as a God to <hi>Aaron</hi> in
all things, and though <hi>Moses</hi> may not officiate at
the <hi>Altar</hi> meerly out of contempt to <hi>Aaron</hi> and
his function, or out of enmity to all order and
relation, yet he may move uncontrolled in his own
superiour first moving sphere. It is a poore shift
of our Doctors to pretend that <hi>Moses</hi> was within
sacerdotall orders, and to cite the 99. <hi>Psalme,</hi> where
it is sayd, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> among the Priests; for
<hi>Moses</hi> had not Ecclesiasticall power, because he was
of Ecclesiasticall Order, but he may therefore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee
reckoned amongst men of Ecclesiasticall Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had more then Ecclesiasticall power. What
<hi>Moses</hi> had in the government of the Church over
Church-men themselves, the same <hi>David</hi> had, and
<hi>Solomon</hi> had, and all the successors of <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Solomon</hi> ought to have. Till the world was inslaved
to Church-men, under the pretence of Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
the care of Temporall and Spirituall affaires
was not divided; neither was the one which is the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64406:37"/>
basest, given to the Magistrate, and the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
attributed to the Priest, as if the Prince was
the body, and the Priest the Soule of the State.
Miserable were wee (sayes Doctor <hi>Pockington;</hi> he
meanes in poynt of Religion) if my Lord of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
could not derive his lineal succession from
Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> but I thinke if this bee all our stay,
wee are now most miserable, for our Religion is
the same as theirs is in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and theirs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and theirs in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and in the
North parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where no Bishops are,
and if they are miserable, wee cannot be happy.
Had wee beene Hereticks, if in the reformation
none of the Romish Clergy had had hand in our
reformation, if <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridly, Hooper,</hi> &amp;c.
had not turned Protestants, had we been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the true and effectuall power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and imposition of hands? Could not God by
the sacred hands of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, have derived
his grace unto the Protestant Clergy, unlesse some
from the Romish party had come over to doe those
offices of consecration? Was the hand of <hi>Moses, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,
&amp;c.</hi> more gratious and effectuall in the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ordination under the Law, then a Protestant
Princes is under the Gospell? What is the reason of
it, that the Gospell should bee introduced to the
detriment and prejudice of temporall authority?
Or else shall we thinke, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was as the Soule
in Spirituall rule whilst the Jewish Law was in
force, and that <hi>Moses</hi> had but a corporeall, subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,
lesse excellent power under him? But I will
follow this chase no further now, because the times
are lately changed, and I believe the Doctors will
easily yeeld to retreate of their owne accord. <hi>Praes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris
&amp; Aris advolvi,</hi> was the old penance as well
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64406:38"/>
for Princes, as people, now wee will bee content if
they will leave out <hi>Presbyteris,</hi> and shew devotion
<hi>Aris</hi> onely. My Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Pocklington</hi> thinke it a good argument for <hi>Alta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,</hi>
that 300. yeares agoe the Founders of the
Garter did performe their Ceremonies with ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
before the <hi>Altar,</hi> and that the successors
of that Order have continued the same adoration
ever since. This is scarce worth an answer, for the
times when this custome began, were blinde and
superstitious, and the meere practice of a few Noble
men was never yet thought a Canon in matters of
Ecclesiasticall Discipline. But I come now from
precedents, to give answer to our Doctors Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
A difference of places (sayes <hi>Lawrence</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a difference of respect, that honour may be
sutable to merit, as justice requires. I answer, wee
dispute not against degrees of internall reverence,
whereby wee hold Churches more honourable then
Barnes, &amp;c. our exceptions are against the Jewish
rigor of bodily adoration, or such externall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of worship, as favour of too much terror,
and consternation: but the Doctor further presses
thus. It is but as justice requires, that that place
should have the preeminence from which vertue is
derived to the rest, for the word is not operative, but
by the merit of that sacrifice, nor the streames of
regeneration pure, unlesse first bathed in his bloud.
I might deny that any one place in the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth
vertue to an other, but I will not stand upon
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avills, for the Doctors meaning is no more then
this, that the word is not operative, but by the
merit of that sacrifice, &amp;c. therefore that place,
where the word is Preached is not so honourable,
as that where Christ is sacrificed. To make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64406:38"/>
of honour betwixt the Ordinances of God
is not so safe, and commendable, but grant the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to be more operative, then the word, (for
so the Doctor should have argued) is not the word
therfore operative at all, but by the Sacrament? How
does this conclude? may not Baptisme, and the
Preaching make us partakers of Christs bloud,
and merits, except wee actually receive the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist?
Is the vertue of Christs bloud only annexed
to the Sacrament? and if so, is the vertue of the
Sacrament affixed to the <hi>Altar</hi> place? and if so, must
that place bee infallibly in the upper end of the
Chancell? doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> so oblige
it selfe to that place in all cases, that it will not
have the Communion celebrated in any other part
of the Church? and if so, is all the honour of the
Sacrament in the consecration, and nothing in
the distribution? is not the place where the people
receive, of some sanctity, as well as that place where
the Priest blesses it? And grant all, yet what doe all
these Paradoxes conclude for any particular kinde
of worship? or what wee are to worship, whether
the Table, or Table-place, or both, or whether
these as relatives only to the Sacrament, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
sake, or equally as the Sacrament it selfe?
But let the Doctor goe on: why should any slave
be more vile in the hight of his Lord, then wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God? &amp;c. Nor is this grace greater then is
ascribed by Ecclesiasticall writers to the parts which
our Saviour conversed in, &amp;c. to his spitle, to his
garments, &amp;c. Wee doe acknowledge a greater du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and distance, and humility to bee used towards
God, then any slave can render to his Lord; wee
de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y no kinde of honour to God, internall, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
only wee dare not present to him but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64406:39"/>
to his owne command. But for relative
instruments which we are to hold sacred for Gods
sake, such as the ground whereon our Saviour trod,
or his Garment, or his spitle, &amp;c. or the <hi>Altar,</hi> wee
are uncertaine how to reverence them according
to our Doctors opinion. The Jewish manner of
distance according to strictnesse, is not to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Doctor himselfe, and wee know no
other kinde of worship used by the <hi>Jewes;</hi> neither
when the Arke was solemnly moved, or removed,
doe wee read of any other reverence applied. And
therefore to what purpose the Doctor does urge
the Jewish example against us, wee doe not see:
and if he will moderate his honour according to
the equitable tenor of Christs Gospell, wee shall
willingly be informed by him. In two things the
Doctor leaves us unsatisfied, and very uncertaine
of his meaning: first he does not cleerly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
nominate any distinct forme of reverence,
which he would have us use; secondly, he does not
certainly and fully instruct us in the grounds, and
reasons of that reverence. First he sayes, adoration
in the Law, which was a very strict time against
superstition, was never without prostration, and to
this purpose he cites examples, wherein men did
civilly so fall downe before men, and religiously
before God: but he gives us no instance at all wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
any such prostrate manner of worship was given
to any third, middle, holy relative instrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and man. Wee say that bodily adoration
may be given to man, because it is but a meere civill
act, and for civill reasons, and the mind is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be misled thereby into superstition, because
the nature of man whom wee worship, and the
manner of adoration wherewith wee worship, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64406:39"/>
the civill reasons for which wee worship, are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knowne to us. Also wee worship God with
bodily worship prostrating together our Soules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, acknowledging that the highest kinde
of divine worship is not competent for his majesty,
and herein also there is no feare of superstition,
because wee cannot erre in the excesse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Doctor cannot either from divine, or civill
worship, conclude any thing for his middle kinde
of religious honour; because in these relative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
wee are to divide our Soules and bodies;
not ascribing so much as to God, nor so little as
to man: neither have wee any precept, or precedent
for this third kinde of worship in Scripture, but
rather the contrary: Where do wee read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did bodily worship the Arke, or
the Altar, or the Tabernacle, or Temple, or the
Footsteps, or Garments, or Spitle, or Sweate of our
Saviour, as our Doctor instances? or how can he
prove that any Orthodoxe Doctors in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times did worship the Gospells, or Crosse of
our Saviour? Is it sufficient for the Doctor to say,
as things have beene in esteeme, so religious persons
have ever esteemed them? how does this tautologie
confute us? But, (sayes the Doctor) the constant
obeysance of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wildernesse was towards
the Mount, Tabernacle, Fire, Cloude, Arke, &amp;c.
And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saith, At the gate they shall worship
God: for the gate of the Temple was over against
the Mercy-seate, and so towards the Temple they
did worship as well when they were farre distant
in other Lands, as neere it. And so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
the converted <hi>Gentile</hi> falling downe shall worship,
&amp;c. I answer, here the Doctor strives to prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worship, by divine, as if they were both the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64406:40"/>
same, and not to bee distinguished. Is there not a
plaine difference betweene falling downe before
the gates, or towards the gates of the Temple, and
to the gates, or to the Temple it selfe? nay, there is
a difference in falling downe before, or towards
the house of God in mens mindes: and it is most
evident that even to the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not fall downe
before the house of God, as the Papists doe before
their Images. The Papists say, they fall not downe
to, but before the Picture, worshiping that which
is represented, not the thing representing; but if so,
if they have the same reason to worship God repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the Image, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had really, and
gratiously presentiall in the Temple, then why
might they not fall downe towards their Pictures
being a hundred Leagues distant, as well as holding
them in their hands, for so the <hi>Iewes</hi> did? It was
proper in <hi>Daniel</hi> to set open his casements towards
<hi>Sion,</hi> and to worship God in that posture, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee made it evident that hee did not worship by
reason of any motive arising from the meere buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it selfe, but meerly for the presence of God
himselfe there residing. How fond would it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee if
Papists now should doe the like to their deities, or if
wee should doe the like to our <hi>Altars,</hi> except we did
believe God to bee as presentiall in them, as the
<hi>Jewes</hi> did in their Mercy-seate? This quite dashes
the conceite of all memorative instruments, for
they which worship Pictures, or <hi>Altars,</hi> as being
memorative only, must needs confesse that they
worship them otherwise, then as <hi>Daniel</hi> did the
Mercy-seate, for he being absent was rather memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of that for Gods sake which there inhabited,
then that was memorative of God to him. Besides,
if wee did believe that the glory, and face of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64406:40"/>
God (as the Scripture sayes) did as majestically
dwell in our Table, as it did betweene the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Cherubins, yet the <hi>Jewish</hi> example will not guide
us to the adoration of the Table only. <hi>Solomon</hi> in
his consecration names, and blesses the whole
house, and prayes God to be favourable to all sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants
extending their hands to the whole house,
and so supplicants alwayes did extend their hands
to the whole house. I know one part of the Church
is more honourable then another, but the whole is
sufficiently memorative, and so not the Table more
then any other part, and if I must distinctly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
according to the distinct degrees of holinesse,
how shall I proportion my severall bowings in so
many severall places? At my first entrance into the
house of God, I fall downe and worship that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
name of God which sanctifies that place, must
I needs ascend by degrees unto the Table after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
there to worship in a higher degree? expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
there a greater blessing, or a perfecter memory
of my Saviour? I doe not thinke that the Jewish
Levites, and Priests did thus performe so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
worships: much lesse could the people by that
Discipline. But in the second place, let the Doctor
give us some certayne knowledge of the grounds,
and reasons of our worship, and then wee shall
guesse at the manner thereof the better. In this
poynt the Doctor (in my opinion) is very much
staggerd, and gives very uncertaine resolutions:
Sometimes he saith, that wee worship not the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
but God towards the <hi>Altar:</hi> and he that so
worships a house for the owners sake, worships not
the house, but the owner. Sometimes, hee saith,
that wee doe worship the <hi>Altar</hi> it selfe, but as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen</hi>
saith, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not equally with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64406:41"/>
and his reason why wee may doe this, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Altar</hi> is for God, not an Idol, or against
God. Sometimes, he saith, that wee adore God in
the place without separation of God from the place,
as wee adore whole Christ, the whole supposition
in grosse, the humanity as well as the divinity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abstraction of one from the other. Generally,
the Doctors ground is, that wee are to worship the
Table, as an holy relative instrument, for wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
worship God, except wee worship relative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for his sake: but herein wee are left as
uncertaine also, as ever, for all holy instruments,
are not holy alike, nor to be reverenced alike, and
therefore in what ranke wee are to place the Table,
or with what height to adore it, is not described.
To all these assertions something briefly must bee
sayd; in the first place therefore, if no worship at all
be given to the <hi>Altar,</hi> but to God towards the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
which is our owne acknowledgment, then why
is the <hi>Altar</hi> so supereminently worshipt, before
any other relative instrument whatsoever? At my
entrance at the Church dore, I may so worship
God, as well as at the <hi>Altar:</hi> and so when the Font
appeares to mee after my first entrance, thus I may
as lowly, as heartily adore God, by reason of his
gratious presence in his whole house, or his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
relation to the Font, as at the <hi>Altar;</hi> and if
it be said, that God is not so highly present in any
other part of the Church, or in all, or in any other
relative instrument (which is a hard saying) as in
the Table at all times: yet this doth not infirme my
inference, for even before the Font (the same God
being present by the same meanes of consecration)
my devotion may be as intense, and as acceptable,
as before the <hi>Altar.</hi> In the second place if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64406:41"/>
that the <hi>Altar</hi> it selfe is worshipt, though
not, as God himselfe, and that this is justifiable,
because the <hi>Altar</hi> is no Idol, but a holy instrument,
and not against God, but for God. I answer, first
this is more then the <hi>Jewes</hi> ever did, or then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
precept in Scripture can warrant. Secondly,
this is no more then the Papists alleadge for their
Idolatry. Thirdly, this is contrary to reason,
for if God bee there extraordinarily present, what
neede wee honour any thing else but that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
presence it selfe, or how can wee without
indignity? indeed in civill worship when the King
is absent, we doe our reverence to his chayre, but
when the King sits there in person, what man is so
infatuated and voyd of discretion, as to doe any
honour to the chayre? and for the absence of God,
that cannot be pleaded. But the Doctor sayes in the
third place, that in this <hi>Altar-worship</hi> wee worship
God and the place together without abstraction, as
wee doe both natures of our Saviour. This answer
(in my opinion) of all others is the worst, and I
am perswaded there is scarce any Jesuite that would
not bee ashamed to say the like. In our Saviour the
Godhead dwelt bodily, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and even the
dead body of our Saviour lying breathlesse in the
grave divided from his humane Soule, was not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
wholly from the hypostaticall union of
the Godhead, and shall this stupendious union be a
resemblance of Gods union with the Table or Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place?
I am perswaded that Seraphins did attend
the buried carkasse of our Saviour, and adore it
even resting in the Tombe, and this by reason of
its union with the Godhead: but shall the Doctors
imagination create the like inseparable relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God, and the Table? God deliver mee from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64406:42"/>
such audacious thoughts. But grant this, and
then where is the Doctors religious, middle wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
betwixt civill, and divine? how can he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this, and yet maintaine with <hi>Damascen</hi> too
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In conclusion then,
the Doctors shete anchor, is the old maxime, that
all relative instruments are to bee worshipt for Gods
sake, and since a worship (saith he) is due <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso,</hi>
then this worship is most proper. I answer,
this rule of relation must needs be a very uncertaine
fallible rule as to the manner of our worship, and
the degree thereof: because wee can neither distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of the relations themselves, as God values
them, neither can wee limit, and proportion our
respects accordingly. In the Law, nay before the
Law Circumcision was a very venerable Sacrament
and gratious league betwixt God and man, and
yet in the act of Circumcising there were no other
Knives used, but such as were common, and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accounted and valued. So also the Passeover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Jewes</hi> it was an ordinance more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and reverend then circumcision, and yet in
this great celebrity the <hi>Jewes</hi> used no other then
common Tables, and Dishes wherewithall to eate
their Paschall Lambe, the type of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
even now under the Gospell in our baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Infants, our Ministers use consecrated Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sometimes common Basons without any
scruple, or offence, and yet wee cannot deny, but
that there is great honour due to that sacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as to the laver of regeneration it selfe. Neither
do these Doctors that fight so violently <hi>pro aris,</hi> seme
at all to regard, what honour wee ascribe to any
other kind of sacred utensil whatsoever: nay I think
if the Patin or chalice should bee unconsecrated
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64406:42"/>
wherein the Body and Bloud of our Saviour is
offered, they would thinke it little to bee regarded.
The honour and sanctity of the Lords day is of
late much lessened, as if there were not the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in times, as in places, and I feare that this
swelling of <hi>Altar-worship</hi> in the Church may grow
as fatall to Religion, as the swelling of the Spleene
does many times to the body. But I desire these
Doctors to consider that God ha's expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee a jealous God in such cases as these,
more then in any other sinnes whatsoever; nay in
other offences hee proclaymes himselfe to be long
suffering, and patient; but in the sole fruition of his
worship and adoration he professes himselfe jealous
over us, and apt to take offence against us. Does he
not declare himselfe to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as if he did
purposely forbeare to appeare to them in any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
apprehensible forme, and similitude, that they
might not adore the same? I pray what can be more
worthy to bee adored in the whole world, then
such a representation? what relative instrument can
bee so holy, as the ocular dispensation or sensible
displaying of Gods most inscrutable Essence, in what
figure soever it was opened to the eye, or eare? yet
God wee see was not delighted to be so worshipped
by the meanes of any such externall instrument:
but he did rather avoyde, and refuse such bodily
worship, and did deny gratious apparitions, that
they might not remaine in the mindes of men as
instruments of devotion; and if God did not affect
to bee adored in any heavenly resemblance of his
owne apprehended by any humane sense, (all such
apprehension being utterly unworthy of this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Majesty) why should wee imagine that it can
be pleasing now to him to be adored in a <hi>Stone-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64406:43"/>
or wooden Table: but all our <hi>Altar-Patr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
doe not make this their ground of worship, that
the <hi>Altar</hi> is the same now, as the Arke was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or that the Table is <hi>solium Christi,</hi> wherein Christ
is supposed to sit majestically, and gloriously: for
this will be very hard to bee proved: and I thinke
the Papists are scarce so grosse. M <hi>Ironsides</hi> ground
is, not that God doth reside in the Table, as in the
Mercy-seate, but that he is there strangely and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
commemorated: wee worship not (saith he)
the Table, nor any thing set upon the Table, but
Christ, as the <hi>Messias</hi> slaine; for the Table is only
a memorative instrument, unto which the assistance
of grace is never fayling, either to beget in our
mindes thoughts of Christs death, or to extract
from us a worship of him, if wee bee not wanting
to our selves. He cites <hi>Cajetan, Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and
<hi>Gerson</hi> to prove that the learnedst of Papists hold
no more. So then Doctor <hi>Lawrence</hi> is confuted out
of the Papists themselves, if he worship the Table
for Gods sake relatively, or together with Christ
without abstraction, this is Idolatrous. The
ground of this opinion is, that <hi>Consecratio non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est opus, sed efficax.</hi> God is in a speciall manner
present in consecrated things and places to assist us,
and stirre up devotion in us, if wee resist not his
assistance, so that though they have no reall quality
of holinesse, or vertue in them, yet by their very
consecration they gaine a certaine fitnesse to stirre
up holy thoughts. But in the first place, if the meere
act of consecration be so peremptorily vigorous, <hi>ex
opere operatio,</hi> yet this concludes nothing for adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The words of the Evangelists relating the
Passion of our Saviour, and the Sermons of good
Divines have more then an aptnesse of commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64406:43"/>
in them, yet wee worship not either the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,
or the Preachers thereof. It a meere memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
aptnesse bee maintained, and that to bee all
the ground of our worship, then why shall not all
things of the like nature procure from us the same
adoration? if I looke upon a Crosse, or Picture, or
upon the Sunne, or Moone &amp;c. and by that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative
aptnesse which is in them, finde thoughts
of reverence and piety begotten in mee, why shall
not I (according to the Doctors advice) embrace all
occasions and furtherances of devotion, and so fall
downe before them? And if more then a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
aptnesse bee maintained, and some higher ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
transfused into an <hi>Altar</hi> meerly by its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
then into other things wee desire further
proofe thereof. Secondly, if consecration bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to bee so infallibly vigorous, as to imply
Gods holy presence, yet this claymes worship not
only to the <hi>Altar,</hi> but also to the Font, and to all
other consecrated things, places, and times, and this
involves us in many doubts. For if I must worship
at the <hi>Altar</hi> more then at the Font, or more then
at the first view of the whole fabrick, yet how much
oftner, how much more must I worship at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
then in other places? The consecration of the
whole building has vertue to beget pious thoughts
in mee, when I first approach it, and I finde in mee
a holy commemoration, must I now stay my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
till I come to the <hi>Altar,</hi> there to expect yet a
more vertuous commemoration? or must I bow at
my entrance with lesse reverence, and then bow
more lowly at the <hi>Altar</hi> afterwards? what must be
the severall measures of my worship? Thirdly, this
worship by way of motive is not agreable to that
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for <hi>Daniel</hi> in his worship remembers
