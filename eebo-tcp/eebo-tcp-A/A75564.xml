            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I have had the honour to be named
by the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all the
Commiſſions which had relation to this
Kingdom, ſince the beginning of this
War; yet I had never the happineſſe to be
with your Lordſhips till now, wherein I
reverence Gods providence, that he hath brought me hither
at ſuch an opportunity, when I may boldly ſay, it is in
the power of the two Kingdoms, yea, I may ſay, in your
Lordſhips power to make us both happy, if you make good
uſe of this occaſion, by ſetling Religion, the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The work of Reformation in theſe Kingdoms, is ſo great
a work, as no age nor hiſtory can parallel ſince Chriſts daies,
for no one Nation had ever ſuch a Reformation ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, much leſſe three Kingdoms, ſo that this Generation
may truly think themſelves happy, if they can be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
in it. And as the work is very great, ſo it cannot be
expected, but it muſt have great and powerfull Enemies;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113669:3"/>
not only fleſh and blood which hate to be reformed, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the darkneſſe
of this world, and ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high places.
As the dangers are great, we muſt look the better to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the beſt way to performe theſe, is to keep us by the
Rules which are to be found in our Nationall Covenant,
principally the Word of God, and in its owne place, the
example of the beſt Reformed Churches; And in our way we
muſt beware of ſome Rocks, which are temptations both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the right, and upon the left hand, ſo that we muſt hold
the middle path. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the one part, we would take heed,
not to ſettle lawleſſe liberty in Religion, whereby, in ſtead
of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, we ſhould ſet up a thouſand Hereſies and
Schiſmes, which is directly contrary and deſtructive to our
Covenant. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the other part, we are to looke that we
perſecute not piety and peaceable men, who cannot through
ſcruple of conſcience, come up in all things to the Common
Rule; but that they may have ſuch a forbearance as may be
according to the Word of God, may conſiſt with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and not be deſtructive to the Rule it ſelfe, nor to the
Peace of the Church and Kingdom, wherein I will inſiſt no
further, either to wrong your Lordſhips patience or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
who I doubt not will be very carefull to do every
thing according to our Covenant.</p>
            <p>As to the other Point, concerning the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of
the Kingdoms, I know it is that which all profeſſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
I hope it is that all do ayme at; ſure I am, it is that
which all men ought to ſtudy and endeavour. And I thinke
it not amiſſe to remember your Lordſhips of ſome former
experiences, as an argument to move us to be wiſe for the
future. If the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> in the 1640 yeare of
God, then ſitting in Parliament, had concurred, as they were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113669:3"/>
deſired, againſt the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> no queſtion we
had been brought to many difficulties, which, bleſſed be God,
was by the wiſdome of the Honourable Houſes prevented.
So likewiſe when this Kingdome was in difficulties, if the
Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> had not willingly, yea cheerfully,
ſacrificed their peace to concurre with this Kingdome, your
Lordſhips all know what might have been the danger.
Therefore let us hold faſt that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which is ſo happily
eſtabliſhed betwixt us, and let nothing make us again two,
who are ſo many waies one, all of one Language, in one
Iſland, all under one King, one in Religion, yea one in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
ſo that in effect we differ in nothing but in the
Name (as Brethren do) which I wiſh were alſo removed,
that we might be altogether one, if the two Kingdoms ſhall
think fit; for I dare ſay, not the greateſt Kingdom in the
Earth can prejudice both ſo much as one of them may do
the other.</p>
            <p>I will forbeare at this time to ſpeak of the many jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
I heare are ſuggeſted, for as I do not love them,
ſo I delight not to mention them, onely one I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to ſpeak of, as if the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> were too
much affected with the Kings intereſt. I will not deny but
the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reaſon of the Raigne of
many Kings his Progenitors over them, hath a naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to his Majeſty, whereby they wiſh he may be rather
reformed then ruined; yet experience may tell, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
regard to him has never made them forget that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rule, <hi>The ſafety of the People is the Supreme Law.</hi>
So likewiſe their love to Monarchy makes them very deſirous
that it may be rather regulated then deſtroyed, which I hope
I need not to mention further to your Lordſhips, who I truſt
are of the ſame minde.</p>
            <p>I know likewiſe there are many jealouſies and unjuſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113669:4"/>
aſperſions caſt upon our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
I can, if it were needfull, preſently produce heads of a
Declaration intended by the Army in <hi>England,</hi> for vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
themſelves from ſuch injuries, and ſhewing the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their reſolutions and integrity, both in the Cauſe,
and towards this Kingdome, wherein their undertakings
and coming in at ſuch a ſeaſon of the yeare, their hard ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and conſtant endeavours ſince, may be ſufficient
teſtimonies. Therefore I am the more bold to deſire your
Lordſhips, that ſo long as they ſtay in <hi>England</hi> (which I
wiſh may be for a ſhort time) they may be ſupplyed with ſome
moneys, and their Quarters enlarged, leaſt their lying in
too narrow Quarters, make the burthen inſupportable to
that exhauſted corner of the Country where they now remain
and ſo beget outcries againſt them, when they are not able
to diſcharge their Quarters, as other Armies within the
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As for the Army in Ireland, I have beene an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to their ſufferings, and ſo may ſpeake of it likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certaine knowledge, That never men have ſuffered grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hardſhips, who might have been provided, for they
have lived many times upon a few Beanes meaſured out to
them by number, and never had any other drinke but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And when they were in ſome better condition, they had
but an Iriſh peck of rough Oats for a whole week. And now at
their beſt condition, when they are quartered upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(which is able to entertaine them only for a very ſhort
time) they have only an Iriſh peck of Oatmeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or a ſhilling in
the ten dayes, both for Meat and Drinke. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the many deſires given in to the Honourable
Houſes for that end, I humbly entreat that your Lordſhips
will take care to provide for them, ſo long as it is thought
fit they remaine in that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113669:4"/>
For a renewed teſtimony of our earneſt deſires to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Honourable Houſes for ſetling the Peace of
theſe Kingdoms ſo much longed for, we doe returne unto
your Lorſhips the Propoſitions of Peace (which we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on Tueſday laſt) with our conſent thereunto, wiſhing
they may be haſted to his Majeſtie, who hath ſo often called
for them. And I likewiſe offer to your Lordſhips the Copy
of his Majeſties Letter to my Lord of Ormond, diſcharging
him from any further medling in any Treaty with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in Ireland, I hope in order to his Majeſties further
condeſcending to the ſetling of that Propoſition concerning
Ireland, and the reſt of the Propoſitions now to be ſent
unto him. Another Paper there is which concernes the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the Scottiſh Armies in England and Ireland,
and the perfecting of the Accompts betweene the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
together with a Letter from Generall <hi>Monro</hi> to the
Committee of Eſtates of the Kingdome of Scotland, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſtate of affaires in Ireland. All which when
your Lordſhips have conſidered, I truſt you will take ſuch

<hi>Ireland,</hi> and in other things did ſhew our readineſſe to
heare, or propoſe ſuch expedients as might determine
any differences, ſo that in a whole yeares time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
have not remained in our hands the ſpace of
foure weekes, which we onely mention to cleare our
proceedings from miſtakes and aſperſions; and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
having now after two moneths farther deliberation,
delivered unto us upon the 23. of this inſtant June, all
the Propoſitions they intend to ſend to the King at this
time; We doe, without any delay, returne ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
and reſolution thereupon, as will be unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and future Generations, one undeniable teſtimony
(beſides many others) of the integrity and faithfulneſſe
of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their ſolemne League
and Covenant, of their love to Peace, and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſatisfie their Brethren of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe things
which concerne the good and Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
being further reſolved touching the Kingdome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113669:5"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That as nothing of ſingle or ſole concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that Nation did engage them in this Warre, ſo
nothing of that nature ſhall continue the ſame. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe Propoſitions now to be ſent doe much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the Propoſitions formerly agreed upon by the
Parliaments of both Kingdomes, and the moſt materiall
additions, omiſſions, and alterations are in ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
as concerne the joynt intereſt, and mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and conjunction of both Kingdoms, which were,
as we conceive, much better provided for, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the former Propoſitions then by theſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the particular Propoſitions preſented by Us,
concerning the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> are not yet agreed
unto by the Houſes of Parliament, as was offered in
their Papers of the tenth of Aprill. Although divers
Propoſitions of joynt concernment be now ſuperſeded,
and the ſending of them delayed to a more convenient
time, as is expreſſed in the Votes of both Houſes of the
twenty ſixth of March; and although (which is to Us
more then all the reſt) thoſe Ordinances of Parliament
unto which the fifth and ſixth Propoſitions doe relate,
(and were therefore communicated unto Us upon our
deſire to ſee what the Houſes had already agreed upon
concerning Religion) doe not containe the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch a Reformation of Religion, and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
as was expected, and was the chiefe end of our
engagement in this Warre; and as all theſe Ordinances
put together come ſhort of what we wiſhed, ſo there
are ſome particulars which we conceive to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Word of God, and the example of the
beſt reformed Churches, and therefore cannot in our
conſciences conſent unto them; which particulars were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113669:6"/>
expreſſed to both Houſes in the Remonſtrance of the
Commiſſioners of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> of the date,
March 26. 1646.</p>
            <p>Yet nevertheleſſe we do ſo earneſtly deſire and ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value the eaſing of the heavy Preſſures under which
both Kingdomes groane, and the bringing of this bloudy
laſting warre to a ſpeedy and happy end, conſidering
with-all that not onely the Booke of Common Prayer
and the Prelaticall Government are aboliſhed, &amp; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
directory of worſhip eſtabliſhed in both Kingdoms,
but that likewiſe the Ordinances afore mentioned do
containe divers Parts of a Poſitive Reformation and
uniformity in Church-Government, unto which we
formerly gave our conſent in our anſwer upon the whole
propoſitions of Peace, of the 20. of <hi>April,</hi> and for ſo happy
begining, and ſo good a foundation laid for the future,
we heartily thank God, and do acknowledge the zeale,
Piety and Wiſedome of the Honourable Houſes therin,
remembring alſo that thoſe Ordinances doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the whole moddell of Church government and
that the Houſes have beene Pleaſed to expreſſe [<hi>that it
cannot be expected that a perfect Rule in every Particular
ſhould be ſetled all at once, but that there will be neede of
ſuppliments, &amp; aditions, and happily of alterations, in ſome
things, as experience ſhall bring to light the neceſſity
thereof</hi>] upon theſe Conſiderations as we doe cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conſent to many materiall Parts of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
ſo we Reſolve to make no let, but to give way
to the ſending of ſuch other particulars therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
with which we are unſatisfied in the matters for
the Reaſons formerly Repreſented to both Houſes, of
which ſome ſtill ſtand in force, though others of them
be taken away by the new expedients it being alwayes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113669:6"/>
underſtood that our not Diſſenting from, nor our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the ſending of the Propoſitions as they now
ſtand, ſhall be no prejudice nor Impediment to all or
any one of the Articles of the <hi>Solemne League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
eſpecially to the firſt Article, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Reformed Religion in the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
againſt our Common enemies, the Reformation
of Religion in the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, and example of the Beſt
Reformed Churches, and the bringing of the Churches
of God in the three Kingdomes, to the neereſt conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and uniformity in Religion, Confeſſion of faith,
forme of Church-government, Directary, for Worſhip,
and Catechiſing; Which thing both Kingdomes are by
Covenant oblieged ſincerely and Really to Endeavour,
and that not for a time, but conſtantly, ſo that neither
of the Kingdomes can be looſed or acquitted from the
moſt ſtrait and ſolemne obligation of their continued
and conſtant endeavouring theſe good ends ſo farre as
any of them is not yet attained, it being alſo underſtood
that our concurrence to the ſending of the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall be without prejudice to any Agreement or
Treaty betweene the Kingdomes, and ſhall not infringe
any Engagement made to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
nor be any hindrance to our inſiſting upon the other
Propoſitions already made knowne to the Houſes; and
it being underſtood that it is not our Judgment that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Particular and Circumſtance of theſe Propoſitions is
of ſo great Importance to thoſe Kingdomes as Peace
and warre ſhould depend thereupon.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds which we make known only for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113669:7"/>
clearing our conſciences, and for diſcharging Our ſelves
in the truſt put upon us, without the leaſt thought of
Retarding the ſo much longed for Peace, We Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend
and agree that the Propoſitions as they are now
Reſolved upon be in the Name of Both Kingdomes
preſented to the King, whoſe heart we beſeech the
Lord wholly to incline to the Councels of Truth and
Peace.</p>
