            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

iniquitie. This the blood of Gods martyrs shed in all ages proclaimeth vnto all men. And thus haue the chief Pastors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> dealt with Christs lambs, in these our dayes. For hauing gotten into their hands the sword of the Magistrate, they there with haue smitten such as with the word, (the sword of the spirit) they could not conuince.

For they that hold forth the truth are exposed to the reproch &amp; venim of the tongue, and many vniust calumniations come forth against their persons, especially the principall of them, whom evill minded men doe most maligne. Also the cause it selfe is often wronged, whiles the truth thereof, and reasons that vphold it, are sv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How others heretofore haue caried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues this way, all records shew: how men at this day haue dealt with vs and the truth which we imbrace; many pulpits in <hi>Engl.</hi> can witnesse. besides priuate calumnies innumerable, and some publicke pamphletes. The stinch of their reprochfull mouthes, hath caused many to distast the sweet sauour of the Gospell, and caused also for a while a dislike in sun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dry of vs, till God in mercy visited and saued vs from the deceitfull tongue.</p>

Yet is not this yenough, but men seek to bear down the truth by writing against and to the defamation of the same, with all exquisite cunning and frawd to disgrace it, and by plausible reasons to perswade vnto error.

For the church of Eng., and parish assemblies thereof, from which we haue departed, consist of all sorts of persons; the ministers stand priests by law to the whole parishes, whereof all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the holy things of God, every one baptized &amp;c. and can you say, they are not then builded in and with your church? And for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, we know your priests, nor the whole parish, cannot excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any, be they never so blasphemous, wicked or licentious: that power is in the Bishops courts And how few are excommunicated for their heresies, blasphemies, atheisme or wicked life, who knoweth not: but for wel doing, you haue excommunicated many. And further, if a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of your ministers should goe about to make a separation or gather any other churches or assemblies, then are already by the lawes of the land established and allowed they are <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicated, by force of the <hi>Canons</hi> of your church; made in Anno 1603. <hi>Can.</hi> 9, 11, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what speak I of others <hi>Mr Bern,</hi> himsefe is fayn to vse such colours, els would the glory of his church soon fade: for in the 48, <hi>page</hi> of his book he allegeth God for wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that they are his people, 1 <hi>by giuing them his word, Psa,</hi> 147.19 20. 2 <hi>by his effectuall working thereby, Ier,</hi> 22, 22, <hi>therefore there is the voyce of the sonne of God, Ioh.</hi> 5.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If these be found and sufficient proofs, that <hi>England</hi> hath Gods word, because <hi>Israel</hi> had it, and so in the rest; then why may not men allege like Scriptures and proofs against them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They are stayned with their own works, and goe a whoring with their own inuentions</hi>; Psal. 106, 39. <hi>from the Prophets of Ierusalem, is hyprocrisie gone forth into all the Land, Ier.</hi> 23.15, I <hi>haue not sent these Prophets sayth the Lord: yet they ran &amp;c.</hi> Ier. 23.21. and the like. So then <hi>Mr Bern.</hi> must ey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther bring better reasons for himselfe, or els he may blush to blame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for that wherein himself is more faulty then they; if they be faulty at all.</p>
               <p>The other particular which he specifieth is, that <hi>places setting forth the inuisible church</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we bring to set forth the visible church by</hi>; as namely; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10. But <hi>Mr Bern.</hi> shewes his reader no reason at all, why that Scripture must be vnderstood of the inuisible church, as he Sayth; and it is an easie matter for him to find faults without reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s writing. That place of <hi>Peter,</hi> (as the wise reader may perceiue,) Speaketh of and to the visible or Sensible church: for th' Apostle wrote to the visible chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1.1</note> strangers that then dwelt in <hi>Pontus Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. and this which he speaketh to them in Chap· 2, 9.10. is as <hi>Moses</hi> of old spake to the visible church of <hi>Israel,</hi> Exod. 19:6. Againe, he mentioneth the end of their calling to this dignity, vidz. <hi>to shew forth the vertues of him that had called them out of darknes into his maruelous light</hi>; which whether it appertaynes not to the visible church, I leaue it for euery true member thereof to iudge.

Surly these ministers ar eyther very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or carelesse what they say, when they call this an <hi>euident proof.</hi> The churches in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Belgia</hi> haue published Confessions and Articles also, better then those in England: yet are there thowsands and ten thow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sands dwelling among them, that neyther so professe, nor are members of their churches.</p>
               <p>But if it were granted that the publicke writings, articles canons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be esteemed the faith &amp; profession of all Engl. yet we deny them to make profession of the true faith; for their Seruice book, homilies. book of Ordination, with the impious canons confirming all the Romish idolatries, Antichristian clergie and ceremonies that are among them, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>communicating, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>See before p.</hi> 56.</note> 
                  <hi>ipso facto,</hi> all that speake against them; this is no true Christian profession, whatsoeuer other truthes are mixed with them. For as the Papists holding many good grounds of religion in generall, yet by other additions and contradictions, do ouerthrow the truth: so is it in England, as before in this treatise, and in many others, hath been proued and after shall further appear.</p>
               <p>Whereas these Ministers <hi>confidently deny that their church accounteth any one for her childe or member, that doth not professe the faith of Christ in some measure</hi>: it is nothing but a vayn flourish. For was there euer such gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the deepest gulfe of Popery as to deney Christ utterly, and not to professe him <hi>in some measure</hi>? Nay it could not be the throne of Antichrist vnlesse he did professe Christ. It is wel known, none are baptised among the Papists, but they professe the very same faith that is now professed at the baptisme in Engl. namely that which they call <hi>th' Apostles Creed</hi> So then what haue these godly ministers sayd more then the simplest papist in the world could haue sayd for his church? Now in that they make this a colour, as if the profane and wicked were not accounted children of the church: they shew themselues to be <note n="b" place="margin">

For who knowes not that there be multitudes of profane and wicked persons in the land? Who knowes not that the whole land generally is baptised?

                  <hi>The onely fundamental truth in religion</hi> is this; <hi>That Iesus Christ the Son of God, who took our nature of the Virgin Mary, is our onely and alsufficient Sauiour</hi> For proof of this, they first allege, that <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But first, none of these scriptures doe say, that this one article, which these ministers haue set downe in this forme of words, is <hi>the onely funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truth in religion.</hi> Neyther doth any other scripture, that <hi>I</hi> know of, so speake; for though Christ <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.</note> onely is the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Christian church; and though (as they secondly allege) no other point of religion is necessary otherwise then as it tendeth necessarily to teach or confirme this one truth: yet foloweth it not, but other points also are fundamental truthes the denyall of which will abolish from Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly they haue altered, added to, and omitted some of the words of these scriptures, for their own aduantage: For fearing that we would (as indeed we mean to doe) presse them with the profession of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists Papists and other heretiks; they thinke to preuent vs. And first against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> which deny that Christ took our flesh, these men haue added, <hi>who took our nature of the Virgin Mary.</hi> Then against the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists which hold merit of works, they adioyne these words, <hi>our onely and alsufficient Sauiour.</hi> And this because the church of England mainteyneth the truth in these points, against those fore sayd heretiks. On the other hand to help themselues in their corrupt Antichristian walking, and false constitution; they omit and mention not th' Apostles words Col. 2. wher he sayth, <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>Mat</hi> 16.16.</note> For let the position be set downe in the scripture termes, and we shall see, how weake their plea will be. <hi>The onely fundamentall truth in religion is this: That Iesus is</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 4.2.</note>

               <p>If now these ministers will insist vpon the three first scriptures onely, and generall terms that are in them; it is apparant that the Papists, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists and many other miscreants, doe hold and professe them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely:

               <p>Hitherto of the reasons alleged by the <hi>godly ministers</hi> wherein how they haue proued and setled their first <hi>position</hi>; let the godly wise judge. Next follow their answers to the obiections made by vs. And these they make two.</p>
               <p>First, that their church of Engl. <hi>was not gathered by such meanes as God in his word hath ordeyned and sanctified for the gathering of his Church.</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>that they communicate together in a false and idolatrous outward worship of God, which is polluted with the writings of men, vidz. with read slinted prayers, homilies, catechismes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here let it first be obserued, that whereas <hi>Mr Barrow</hi> (whose books they would seem to answer,) hath <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Refut. of Giff pag,</hi> 1.</note> giuen 4. causes of our separation, namely the 1. false worship, 2. profane people, 3 false ministery, and 4. Antichristian hierarchie; these godly ministers like the vniust steward <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk</hi> 16, 6</note> that set down fifty for fiue skore, haue contracted the 4. causes into 2. for what cause let him that readeth consider.</p>
               <p>Secondly in the two which they professe to answer, they keep not the words by <hi>Mr Barrow</hi> there set downe; as to begin with the first; he sayth <hi>For that the profane vngodly multitudes without exception of any one per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son are with them receiued into and reteyned in the bosome of the church</hi> These<note place="margin">

ministers set down the poynt to be about the not <hi>gathering by due meanes.</hi> Whereas if it were granted that they had <hi>due meanes</hi> of gathering, yet the exception made is of force against them, rather more then lesse for they that haue the true meanes of gathering a church, and yet gather it amisse; the greater is their sinne.</p>
               <p>Now to the particulars, whereas <hi>Mr Barrow</hi> had first <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dis, p,</hi> 8.</note> shewed by many scriptures and reasons what manner persons were to be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gods church; and then compared here with the people of the church of Engl. where all sorts of wicked persons are admitted &amp; kept in communion: to this the ministers answer, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 182.183, <hi>Ioh</hi> 20.19.</note> 
                  <hi>First that they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be accounted a true church, though it could not appear that they were at the first rightly gathered. For euen as the Disciples might be wel assured of Christs bodily presence amongst them when they saw and felt him, though they could not haue discerned which way or how he could possibly come in. so may we esteem them a true church, of whose present profession and faith we are wel assured, though we cannot see by what meanes they were first gathered.</hi> This answer of theirs is full of errour and frawd; for, (not to speake how they corrupt <hi>Mr Barrowes</hi> words in the places which they quote; by leauing out things of speciall importance,) first they blamed because all profane &amp; wicked perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ar of the mater their church; they tel us, they <hi>may esteem them a true church of whose present profession and fayth, they are wel assured.</hi> If this answer be direct and to the purpose then we must beleeue that the <hi>godly ministers</hi> are wel assured of the present profession and faith of all the lewd, profane. irreligious and wicked persons in the realm, which are members of the church of Engl. Against these was the exception made; for these the answer is giuen, vnlesse they answer their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. and now what assurance the ministers have of such mens faith, let the faithfull iudge.</p>
               <p>Secondly the similitude which they bring, is a great abuse of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whome they would blinde with a false comparison; which if it were duely made, would make against them thus. As the disciples might be wel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But now as these men haue made the parable, what likelihood of truth is there in it, for iustifying the vngodly? If a man seeing a Priest in bed with one of the Popes courtizans, should blame him for this fornication, and an other to defend him should plead thus; <hi>As we are sure that Sarah was Abrahams wife, though we cannot tell when or how they were married. so may wee esteeme these two (of whose present chascity we are wel assured,) to be lawfull man and wife, though we cannot tel how they came together</hi>; would this be a sufficient defence? Yet loe when Mr Barrow blamed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dis. p.</hi> 10.</note> the Priests of England for linking themselues in the bed of spirituall loue, with the idolatrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and all other wicked of the land, at the beginning of Q. Eliz. and

continuing in like sinful commixtur vnto this day: these Ministers now, to saue their credit, tel vs an example of <hi>Christ presence,</hi> &amp;c. as before is seen. Yea the indignity of it stayeth not here; for as the Apostle by the Ministery of the gospell prepared the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as a pure virgin for her husband Christ, so these men pretending to be true Ministers,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.24</note> will haue Papists, Atheists, profane and wicked persons, to be <hi>Hephzi-bah</hi>

This being thus obserued, how these ministers haue missed at first o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ques<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion; the further they goe, the further they stray, and run themselues out of breath in vayn. For neyther the examples of <hi>Melchisedek, Iob, Corne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius</hi> &amp;c. nor their reasons following of 2 other meanes of gathering the church then by the preaching of the Gospel; 3 of the preaching of <hi>Mr. Wickliff.</hi> &amp;c 4 &amp; 5 of the course that Q <hi>Elizab.</hi> took for bringing the Gospell in agayne &amp;c. none of these (I say) will proue eyther that open profane and wicked persons, may be receiued and kept in the bozome of the church; or that there be not multitudes of open profane and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, members of the church of England. Their present lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state proclaymeth this latter to all men that haue conscience; their own writings also heretofore doe strongly confirme it: and all the scriptures cry out against the former &amp; teach a separation as before in this treatise, and in sundry other books is manifested.</p>
               <p>As these ministers have thus passed by the mayn controuersie; so haue they in their pretended answers, inserted some things corruptly and frau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dulently: which I will briefly touch First, for to bolster out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned profession of faith, and ioyning to the church which their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are compelled vnto, they plead; <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 185.</note> that <hi>Synce Kings</hi> became noursing fathers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the church; their lawes haue been means to bring men to the outward society of the church; and the parable proueth, that men may be compelled to come; Luk. 14, 23.</p>
               <p>This doctrine openeth a dore in the church to all the profane in the world, contrary to the scriptures; <hi>Isa</hi> 25.2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.8, 9.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Zac.</hi> 14.21, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. For if a prince may compel some of his subiects to be members of the church, he may compel al; and if one prince may doe it, all may. So if there were such an Emperor as <hi>Augustus</hi> that commanded <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1,</note> 
                  <hi>all the world to be taxed,</hi> he might also command and compell all the world to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnto the church. And thus the world and the church, between whom there hath been perpetuall warr, mought soon be reconciled. If this be a lawfull and orderly course, it is strange that Christ sent forth poor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen to conuert sowles by preaching, and set not the princes, (which

               <p>Now for the <hi>parable</hi> they allege, it is apparant, that the same seruant was sent to <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>vers</hi> 17.21.22, 23.</note> compell, that was before sent to call the inuited: and if this be meant of the Magistrate then, kings must leaue gouerning and goe to preaching. We finde in the scripture, that <hi>compulsion</hi> is not alwayes by the ciuill sword, but sometime by instant and earnest vrging of the word and doctrine; as they that <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal</hi> 6, 12</note>

For (besides the abuse of holy scriptures alleged to iustify these popish stratagems,) how sound &amp; diuine, (or rather how fond and corrupt) is the reasoning of these men, from Gods example and authority, vnto their own practise and power that because the Lord God gaue formes of blessing, prayer and psalmes to his people, (as the scriptures which they cite doe shew) therefore their Lords the Prelates may giue them also prescript words for <hi>blessing, prayer,</hi> and <hi>Psalmes</hi> &amp;c. as is to be seen in their seruice book. Can we thinke that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had so slender a reason for his golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calues? Why doe not these men also plead, that God gaue a law by <hi>Moses</hi>? therefore ther may a law be giuen likewise by the Bishops: or, th' Apostles wrote a new Testament, therefore the <hi>Conuocation house</hi> may also write a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Gospel; &amp; bring it into the church?

And that therefore these Bishops and Priests are very presumptuous, that wil take vpon them to doe that which Christs Apostles neuer did in the churches. Agayn, that if those men of God had to done; yet seing the writings of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> are canonicall scriptures, and so are no mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings now: it will by no meanes follow, that if they wrote catechismes to be vsed in the Church, therefore men may writ some for like vse now.

               </gap>ect of the worldly multitudes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all the Saincts are not begotten vnto Christ in the wombe of a true particular church for when the Apostle preached among <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 17.22.33.34.</note> Pagans &amp; conuerted many, <hi>I</hi> would know in the womb of what church they were begotten? they were first conuerted vnto Christ, before euer they were in any other church, then that Ierusalem which is aboue, &amp; <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 26</note> the mother of all the elect. Let vs come to later times; your selues when you began to be a church of protestants, in what particular womb were your people begotten? I suppose if in any, it was in the womb of your mother church of Rome, where they had both receiued Baptisme the seal of regeneration, and been catechised in Christian religion: and then look how your selues can deny that to be a true church, or be free of vnthankfulnes towards her that bare you.</p>
            <p>But you prosecute your cause against vs, and would driue vs eyther to say, <hi>there is indeed a true ministery of the word among you. but it is not powrfull to any but our selues; or els that we were not called in your church, but since we left you.</hi> To the first I answer; there is no necessity that we must grant <hi>a true ministery</hi>; for first we hold that the true word may be put in <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Num,</hi> 23 5, 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Balaamites mouthes, and a false ministery may through Gods wondrous grace, beget faith in his elect: if you say otherweise you will shake the foundation of your English church, layd by <hi>Aust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> the <hi>monk</hi> Pope Gregories Apostle; and damn all your late fathers vnder the Roman Clergie. Secondly, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie not the grace of God in the true church to the ministers lips: knowing that men by other meanes are often conuerted to the Lord. And if your ministers in <hi>England</hi> hold that men cannot be begotten to Christ among them, but by their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61209:78"/>
preaching; you may take vp your Letanie (which causlesse you vse for vs) and say <hi>from this horible and bellish pride, good Lord deliuer them.</hi> As they cannot restreyn the winde from blowing: so much lesse the spirit of God from breathing, out of other places then ministers mouthes.</p>
            <p>To the second also I answer; that it is one thing to be called <hi>in your church,</hi> as you speake; and another thing to be called <hi>by your church</hi> or ministery, as I thinke you mean. It is written Reu. 18.4. <hi>Goe out of her my people.</hi> you see here Gods people were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are called ovt of the same, not by Babel it selfe, or any minister of it, buy by a voyce from heauen. So we might be called in your church. though not <hi>by</hi> the same. And thus we haue not <hi>bard our selues</hi> from pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, as you would bear men in hand: neyther yet shew you of whom or wher you had that which you say <hi>we all stoutly answer and stifly stand to it,</hi> namely that we leau your church <hi>meerly &amp; only out of conscience</hi> &amp;c. We haue a better ground if you would receiue it, euen the Law of the Lord that so commandeth both vs and our consciences.</p>
            <p>Conscience is the blinde Papists common plea: but we know that mans conscience is as much <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit</hi> 1, 15,</note> defiled as any other part or power of his sowl or body; and therefore it may be no rule of our actions, but the law of God onely, which is <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.</note> pure, perfect, and vndefiled. Yet you wil needs proceed and say, <hi>then we had conscience before we left you.</hi> I answer yea, or els we would not haue left you. Thinke you that your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had <hi>no conscience</hi> when they left the Popish church? <hi>Then where</hi> (say you of us, and minde whether the Papists will not say as much of you where) <hi>came they to that conscience and care of their saluation but in our church</hi>? You are answered before, we had it in your church, as Gods people had in Babylon. But that (I suppose) will not satisfie you, but it was you will say, <hi>by your church</hi> and ministerie. Therefore I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and consider of conscience in generall and in particular General lie, when men so farr as they are taught and see, doe walke carefullie: &amp; this I confesse we had through Gods grace &amp; by means of your church: this also I acknowledge many among you haue, walking conscionably so farr as they see and know. The same I am perswaded also of many Papists and other misbeleeuers. But as a conscionable Papist or Anabaptist, when a further light of the Gospel ariseth vnto him, must leaue that church, wherein his conscience was so farr informed, because it is not the true church of God: so must a conscionable Protestant doe with your church, when God giueth him to see the false estate wherein you stand although you worke many good effects in a mans hart and conscience.</p>
            <p>Particularly a good conscience is to be considered in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular action, as for example in this particular of our separation; and so we had not this good conscience from or by your church or ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery;

            <p>Thus haue we dealt with you, according to all the duties that your selfe haue shewed both from the Iewes practise. and from your own. For whereas you allege <note n="a" place="margin">
