            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Power and Authority which Princes, or Supreme Magistrates have, is derived to them from God; and that, by these several Wayes,</hi> Immediate Deputation, Hereditary Succession, <hi>and</hi> Election.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEing about to Discourse of a Point both difficult and dangerous, I mean, The Right of Succession to Supreme Authority, whether it be not limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conditions, and subject to <hi>Alterations?</hi> I shall in the following Dispute use such Caution in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and that too, from no worse Topicks than Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason and Divinity, as may, I hope, prove some means of Satisfaction, but none of Distaste. And because this Question about the <hi>Alterability</hi> of Succession to the Supreme Authority, will receive great Light from a Discussion of what is the Nature of that Right which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59988:4"/>
Princes have to Succession, and the Nature of that Right be Cleared, by a Consideration of him who gives it, and to what Ends; I shall in the first place state, from what Fountain, Power, and Authority, it is Derived; by what Ways, and to what End.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I take it for granted, that no man <hi>Naturally</hi> and <hi>of Himself,</hi> has a Right Inherent in Himself to exercise Rule and Government over others; and all men as to a <hi>state of Nature</hi> to be Born in the same Degree of <hi>equality</hi> with one another; but yet, that most Men are Born in a state of <hi>Subjection</hi> to some other, comes thus to pass; because Man, being at the Will, Disposal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of His Creatour, who gave Him Life and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, and continues it to him, shall be likewise at the Command of <hi>whomsoever</hi> the Creatour shall <hi>transfer a Right to</hi> of Government and Command; and only of Him: So that supposing God not to have transfer'd His Right of Dominion over Man, or any part of it to any else, every Man is born in the same condition and relation of <hi>Equality,</hi> (for though Son-ship doth Oblige to many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gratitude and Duty, yet not to such a Subjection as we are handling) and consequently, no one is <hi>Naturally</hi> a Servant or Subject, nor any one a Prince, till God hath Invested some Person with an Authority of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a number of Men, and all that shall be born of them. The Inference then is plain, that if men should be <hi>naturally equal,</hi> and no one subject to other, did not God Depute some one Person to Exercise part of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Government over others; then, that they are not <hi>Equal,</hi> is the effect of God's Appointment; and so all Pre-eminence of Power and Authority, is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily derived from Him. And that this immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from right Reason, is Consonant to <hi>God's</hi> Word (and so must all such of necessity be) I shall quote but one place of Scripture, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are Ordained of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This being laid for a Foundation, that all Authority is derived from <hi>God;</hi> the next Doubt is, how we shall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59988:4"/>
know to whom He does derive it, that we may give Him due Obedience, and not be imposed on by Usurpers? And this will best be known, if we consider the several ways, by which <hi>God</hi> Derives this Power to Men: For we may infallibly conclude, that He has no Authority from <hi>God,</hi> who did not receive it by those ways by which <hi>God</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it; and that He is <hi>God's</hi> Minister to whom we see Providence has Derived it by some such way, as He makes use of to that purpose: and they are these;<list>

                  <p>Of the first sort, were <hi>Moses, Saul,</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> of the second, were <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam, &amp;c.</hi> the last was <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> though <hi>God</hi> had also foretold to Him by His Prophet, that He should be King over Ten Tribes, and accordingly <hi>v.</hi> 20. of the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 1 of <hi>Kings, All Israel,</hi> when they had heard that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was come again, (out of <hi>Egypt)</hi> sent and called Him to the Congregation, and <hi>made Him King</hi> over <hi>Israel.</hi> Of these three ways of being Inaugurate into the Supreme Power, the <hi>First</hi> is more Noble and Glorious, for as much as in that, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Approbation of the Person by <hi>God</hi> Himself, is the Reason of his Advance; but He who Succeeds as next of Blood, owes it to his good Fortune; and He who is Elected by the People, often to some Policy, whereby He Ingratiated himself; but sometimes to his Vertues: and of the two last, <hi>Hereditary Succession</hi> and <hi>Election;</hi> the former is more Preferrable, for the inconveniences it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voides, which Elections subject a Nation to: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, one time with another, it has produced as many Examples of Vertue and Ability to Govern, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Right of Government then being once by <hi>God</hi> Immediately Transfer'd to any one, after His Decease (unless <hi>God</hi> immediately by Himself Transfer it to any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59988:5"/>
other, or the Prince do) <hi>Naturally</hi> doth pass to the very <hi>next</hi> of Blood and Kin, and that for these Reasons: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He who received Authority from <hi>God</hi> to Govern a People, received it to this end, to procure that peoples Good and Welfare, to the utmost of His Knowledg; which He would never do, if he took not care that the evils of Anarchy, (to prevent which <hi>God</hi> had Crowned Him,) might likewise be prevented for the future, by translating His Authority at His Death to some other, who might sustain the Government when He was incapable of bearing it Himself; and on this Reason is founded the Axiom in our common Law, <hi>Rex nunquam moritur.</hi> Now because Government doth not only intend the Peoples good, but imply the great Honour and Dignity of Him who bears it; the Prince cannot be supposed to wish so great a Dignity (if he declare not himself to the contrary) to any less than Him who may be reasonably supposed most inward in His Affections the <hi>next</hi> of Kin; and therefore if He die, His silence shall be taken for Consent that the very <hi>next</hi> in Blood is the Person to whom for love and custom sake He Propagates His Right: (by the very <hi>next</hi> of Blood meaning that Person, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed so by the Vulgar Account of that Nation; Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as to <hi>nearness</hi> of Blood, among different People, differing) and that Princes may exercise their Authority in provision for the Future after their Decease, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently appoint a Successor, is evident from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Laws any one of them makes, are not suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to cease to be so immediately upon his Death, but to retain their full force for ever after, unless a like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority repeals them.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed further, I must speak to an Objection, which possibly may be raised; That to found the Right of Succession to Government in being lineally Descended or next of Blood and Kin, or appointed by Testament, to Succeed to some one, who <hi>Originally,</hi> tracing the Line of Princes backwards, derives His Authority from one who <hi>Immediately</hi> received it, and was <hi>Deputed to it by God,</hi> is to destroy the Right of most or all Princes, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59988:5"/>
derive their Authority from <hi>such</hi> a Predecessor, and that it is to take away the old and common Notion of Supreme Authority, being naturally founded in <hi>Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> I Answer, that I am of Opinion, that <hi>Paternity</hi> or <hi>Father-hood</hi> never did give a Right of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that before God <hi>Actually</hi> and <hi>Immediately</hi> constituted Governours, and that, not upon the Account of <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> or Men <hi>Chose</hi> some to themselves, or voluntarily upon certain Considerations submitted themselves, there were no such Persons in the World as Kings, or Persons possest of Soveraign Authority, or pretending to be so merely as <hi>Fathers:</hi> and that if no Prince can trace His Authority backwards to him who received it from <hi>God Himself immediately,</hi> yet he may to him who received it, together with the condition of <hi>Hereditary Succession</hi> for the Future, from God <hi>Immediatly,</hi> either by the <hi>Election</hi> of men, for as much as that <hi>first</hi> Predecessor could not Reign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Consent of People (which is the same thing as Choice) or else to him who took the Advantage of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Liberty by some Offence, and so in compensation righted himself by enforcing their Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is as good a Title to Dominion as any, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if by After-Acts and Compacts settled and confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Now, that <hi>Election</hi> of Princes doth Transfer as full and ample Power and Right to Government as any other way whatsoever, (which being prov'd, though all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may Succeed to such an One as primarily was <hi>Elected</hi> by the People, will take away all Defect on that account) I Argue thus, that where God doth not <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly</hi> provide for the safety and welfare of any People by giving them Laws, or a sufficiently authorised Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver; there God, and Nature, and Reason do permit and encourage that People, to procure their own welfare, by what honest means are most conducive to it in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by choosing or pitching upon a Person or Persons to exercise over them Gods Power and Authority, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the publick Good; and the Person so Elected Acts by <hi>Gods</hi> Authority not the <hi>Peoples,</hi> forasmuch as <hi>all Power</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59988:6"/>
is solely Gods, and therefore no one can Act lawfully as a Governour by any Authority but by Gods, though this Authority may be conveyed to Him <hi>instrumentally</hi> by a Predecessor or the People; and as a Successor in the Government, Acts not by the Authority of His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor who had none <hi>Originally of Himself,</hi> and therefore could not properly give any, (for He Governed not by His <hi>own</hi> Authority, but by <hi>Gods;</hi> and therefore His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor Acts not by His Authority who had none of his <hi>own,</hi> but by <hi>Gods,</hi> which the other conveyed to Him) so neither may an <hi>Elected</hi> Prince be said to govern by the <hi>Peoples</hi> Authority by whom he was <hi>Elected,</hi> but by <hi>Gods,</hi> who empowred these People by right of Nature and <hi>Reason,</hi> to Depute or Name one to the Government in order to the publick Good, when he himself did not: And such a Prince is subject or accountable to none but <hi>God:</hi> But if in any Nation the Prince, or He who bears the Title of such, and appears to be so, is accountable to any else, they to whom He is accountable are the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, and He only in Name, not really a Prince.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That a Disposition in a</hi> Prince, <hi>proceeding from</hi> Opinion <hi>or otherwise, to both the</hi> Spiritual <hi>and</hi> Temporal <hi>Dammage, and Destruction of a Nation, maketh a</hi> Forfeiture <hi>of Right to Succession.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving Discours'd of the Principle from whence all Humane Power is Derived, Namely God; and of the several wayes by which He Conveys this Authority to Men; that Right and Succession, depends either on the Prince's Will to bestow it on whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver He pleases, whether <hi>next</hi> of Kin or not; or, in case of Law. to tye it <hi>precisely</hi> to the <hi>next</hi> of Kin (which still
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59988:6"/>
is the Princes Will, because his Law) it may depend on the nearness of Alliance, Or, on popular <hi>Election;</hi> the Question lies thus, whether a Prince having <hi>Right</hi> to Succession, by those Laws which tye it up <hi>precisely</hi> to the <hi>next</hi> in Blood or Kin, may not <hi>Lawfully</hi> and <hi>Rightfully,</hi> for some <hi>Reasons</hi> be Deprived of Succession without <hi>Injury</hi> done to Him, and both <hi>Forfeit</hi> and <hi>lose</hi> his <hi>Right</hi> to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession? And this we shall be able more clearly to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, after having Considered what Qualifications are necessarily requisite in a Prince, and they are these;
<list>
                        <item>First, <hi>To intend and Design the utmost Good of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both</hi> Spiritual <hi>and</hi> Temporal.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, <hi>That Intending and Designing Well, He be not accidentally Disposed either by</hi> Opinion <hi>or otherwise to both the</hi> Spiritual <hi>and</hi> Temporal <hi>Destruction of His People, though contrary to His intent.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, I Assert, that either the want of the <hi>First</hi> of these, or addition of the last, is <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason and Ground to cut off, and alter Succession, and makes <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture</hi> of Right to it, which may be taken without <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> or <hi>Wrong</hi> to the Person <hi>so Affected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Proof of this position, I shall <hi>first</hi> shew, that <hi>Hereditary</hi> Right to Succession is not <hi>of it self in its own Nature Eternal or Unalterable;</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the above mentioned Disposition in a Prince, makes a perfect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis used by some as an Argument, to prove that a Right to Succeed to the Soveraign and Monarchical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Hereditary</hi> Kingdoms is <hi>unalterable</hi> and Sacred, because <hi>Monarchy,</hi> say they, is of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and the apparent Heir to it, having his Right from <hi>God,</hi> His Right is immoveable. I Answer, that I acknowledg not only <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but <hi>all other Forms</hi> of Government to be of <hi>Divine Right:</hi> because there is <hi>no Power</hi> but is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of <hi>God;</hi> (so the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or great Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jewes</hi> being an <hi>Aristocracy</hi> was <hi>by God</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59988:7"/>
to be, and continued for a long while the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Authority on Earth over them) But deny, that any person, who by <hi>Ordinary</hi> Course or Rule, has a Right to Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, has it <hi>from God;</hi> for Succession is Determinable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of the Supreme Authority on Earth, and then, He who has Right to Succession, has it by <hi>Vertue of those Laws</hi> and <hi>Determinations</hi> of the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which might otherwise have setled it; and not <hi>from God;</hi> who appointed not Him to Succeed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gave Him no right to Succession, but he has it from the Supreme Authority on Earth; in which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is comprehended a Power of appointing a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, as I before shewed, that is, of giving the Right of Succession to some Person who can receive that Right from none but Him, and may be deprived of it by Him, because he gave it. But supposing (which I need not) that He has his right to Succession <hi>from God,</hi> I deny that he has <hi>therefore</hi> an <hi>unalterable</hi> Right, because He has his Right from whence He is to have his Power, <hi>from God;</hi> for neither Right nor any thing else is <hi>therefore unchangably</hi> appropriated to any Man, because <hi>God gave it;</hi> for what he gives us, He gives on certain <hi>Conditions,</hi> on the non-observance of which, the thing given may be impropriated and taken from us; so Life, which I think a Man may as properly call his own as any thing, is given on <hi>Condition of obeying</hi> God, else our life is <hi>Forfeited,</hi> and our right to it lost. So that right to Succession is not <hi>unalterable</hi> supposing it is Gods Gift; but contrariwise, is <hi>therefore alterable</hi> because it is <hi>Gods Gift,</hi> that is, bestowed and granted on certain <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to be performed, which not performed do Forfeit it: So that <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Heir to Succession having no other <hi>Reason</hi> for His Right to Succession in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> than there is for <hi>Government</hi> in general, that is, the safety and welfare of Prince and People; if he be so Disposed as to destroy the <hi>Reason of Government,</hi> He likewise loses the <hi>Reason of Right to Succession</hi> in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; because no one has right to succeed in <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> who destroys the very <hi>Reason</hi> of it, why there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59988:7"/>
should be any Government at all, even the safety of the People which was the Foundation and <hi>Reason</hi> of his Right; and he who hath no <hi>Reason</hi> for a Right hath no Right at all; and being yet a Subject, (for the very words, <hi>Heir,</hi> and having <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Succeed,</hi> imply, that He is not in <hi>actual Possession</hi> of the Soveraignty, and therefore in subjection (for between them there is no Medium) He may incur the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of every thing he has <hi>as a Subject,</hi> and so he has the Right of Succession; for, though the <hi>Heir</hi> to one Kingdom may be <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> in another, yet is <hi>a Subject</hi> in the Kingdom to which he is <hi>Heir,</hi> because he <hi>receives Right</hi> from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and such an one is less than <hi>Him who gives</hi> it, and therefore subject; and if he be a <hi>Subject,</hi> and byassed from the publick good, he is accountable, and may be Censured with Disinheritance. And this the <hi>Heir</hi> has no great reason to resent in such a Case; For if he be <hi>Conscientiously</hi> Disposed to both the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> Ruine of the Subjects, He then will exact O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to many things which they will in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence know to be <hi>Sins,</hi> and therefore, be Obliged not to Obey; and so that <hi>Prince,</hi> had better never have Assumed the <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, than in his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be slighted and disrespected, because Disobeyed in what <hi>He</hi> Commands (though really it be no Disres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be disobeyed in things not within his Command, but the dishonour lies in enjoyning them) and be forced to turn the Persecutor of his Subjects, to Vindicate the Honour of himself and Commands, and leave his Name to stink upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>But neither is the Person <hi>so Disinherited</hi> at all <hi>Injured;</hi> for, <hi>Injury</hi> implies <hi>Violence to Right,</hi> which I have prov'd he <hi>Forfeited,</hi> and therefore, That Proceeding just; the whole Argument I will thus sum up: He who is a Subject, (and so is every <hi>Heir</hi> to the Supreme Power as <hi>Heir,</hi> as I hinted before) is in a capacity of offending the Supreme Power, and then of being punished: <hi>He</hi> may offend against the present Soveraigns Authority and care of providing for the future welfare of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59988:8"/>
people, by intending and purposing to do such things as would hereafter prove <hi>extreamly</hi> Damageable and Destructive to the Nation; and if He offend in this kind, a more <hi>proper</hi> Punishment cannot be applied to Him than such an one as will <hi>prevent</hi> those Mischiefs, the <hi>designing</hi> of which brings Him to punishment, and that is <hi>Disinheritance;</hi> for Civil Punishments ought not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be Vindicative, but remedies for <hi>preventing</hi> Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: Or, if <hi>His</hi> Intentions and Designs are not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by any <hi>Hint</hi> or <hi>Prospect He has given of them by Words or Actions,</hi> yet if his <hi>Prepossessions,</hi> which <hi>Himself</hi> owns, are such as <hi>Naturally</hi> and <hi>Necessarily</hi> tend and lead him to such Designs and Intentions, as being most <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> conjoyned with them, though <hi>outwardly</hi> He makes no <hi>Declaration</hi> of His intentions; He is, as far as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can judg, most dangerously Affected, and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to attain the end of Government, the general Welfare; Nay, will hereafter, as far as Men can see, do that, which will be <hi>Destructive</hi> to their Welfare, the <hi>end</hi> of Government, insomuch as it were the <hi>same thing</hi> if they had <hi>none:</hi> Now, He who destroys the <hi>end of Government,</hi> doth as ill as destroying <hi>Government it self,</hi> but since that ought to be <hi>Eternal,</hi> for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it ever had a beginning, He Forfeits His Right <hi>to it,</hi> who is disposed to a Nations <hi>extreme Hazard</hi> or <hi>Destruction,</hi> to <hi>prevent all which</hi> is the <hi>only Reason</hi> he should Succeed in the Government, and that there should be <hi>any such thing at all;</hi> which if He will not only not prevent, but is the Person who brings it about, there is no Reason He should Succeed in the Government, he has made a <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of His Right.</p>

                  <p>If it be Objected, That though the Predecessor by a <hi>particular</hi> application of his Will did not take the forfeiture, because he did not see it, or believed it not; Yet <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> he must be supposed to <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> the taking it, forasmuch as he <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> the Publick well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and so, though not by a <hi>Special Act,</hi> Yet by his <hi>General Intention</hi> of the Peoples good He must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have taken the advantage of it.</p>
                  <p>I answer, That this will not stand good in <hi>Policy,</hi> as it may do in many other things; because such a belief would put it in the <hi>Peoples Power</hi> at their pleasure to

The Scriptures command Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Obedience not only to Gentle, but froward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Applaud Suffering <hi>Wrongfully;</hi> and the Primitive Christians did so, even when they were strong enough to resist, and the Souldiers were content to be decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to lay down their Armes, to be <hi>wrongfully</hi> put to Death, that is for a cause not deserving Death, for professing the Christian Religion; which plainly proves that both the Apostles, and Primitive Christians, who were as well Catechised in the Principles of Religion as we can pretend to be, thought it an Article of their Faith, that it was not lawful for Subjects to <hi>Depose</hi> or <hi>Resist</hi> the cruelest Tyrants, though endeavouring their <hi>Spiritual</hi> destruction by obliging them to Idolatry, and their <hi>Temporal</hi> by Proscribing them, by Imprisoning and Murthering them if they refused: and this we call <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience,</hi> that is, submitting to the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity's pleasure even when we are <hi>Injured</hi> rather then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against Him.

                  <p>THe Country-man in the Fable who called upon <hi>Hercules,</hi> to draw His Cart out of the Mire in which it was set, was bid to apply His own Shoulders to it, and thrust, if he would have it out.

                  <p>But this <hi>careless Opinion</hi> I much dislike; because it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brings Men into Misery, by making them to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect those Means for their Safety which God frequently puts into <hi>their own hands,</hi> and so they are undone for want of Care, for presuming God will Save them without the least of their Caution and Circumspection.

                  <p>Tis to be Confessed, that <hi>Disinheriting</hi> a Prince, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> the <hi>Lineal</hi> Succession, is a dangerous Precedent, because of the ill Consequences it may draw with it; the Right of Succession ought to be Sacred, and not toucht or medled with, but with the greatest Reverence and Caution, and upon weighty Considerations; but when once People have prevailed on a Prince, to Disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a Legal Heir for <hi>real and great Causes,</hi> they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten afterwards prove humoursom; and sometime for <hi>no Causes,</hi> or <hi>not equal,</hi> exact and <hi>require</hi> the doing of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have an <hi>Example and Precedent:</hi> This, I say, is a great <hi>inconvenience,</hi> but is unavoidable; because, as long as Men are Men, they will be subject to Faults; but yet I suppose it not Impossible, but such Laws and Rules may be stated and provided, whereby to procede in such Cases, as would much <hi>Alleviate</hi> this inconvenience: But shall leave that to Wiser Heads to Determine what they must be.

The <hi>Institution</hi> of Marriage seems not to have been <hi>Occasional</hi> and by accident, as the appointment of most things by God was, but <hi>Cotemporary</hi> with the very Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and Formation of man it self; so that He was no sooner shaped into the form of Body which we see he has, but he seemed to be <hi>Incompleat</hi> and <hi>Solitary,</hi> till such a Companion were given him; for the use and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, in order to another end, <hi>Procreation,</hi> His Body both in its inward and outward Fabrick, provision and design of Nature appeared to have been <hi>purposely</hi> Framed, and by it self, as to that end, to be <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>imperfect:</hi> Nay, Marriage must have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and Pre-ordained, even <hi>before</hi> Mans Creation; for if God, when He said, <hi>Let Us make Man,</hi> had an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar or Idea</hi> before Him, of what manner of Creature He was about to make, He then both saw, that the Creature He should make according to that Pattern, would want such a Companion, because of his inability to <hi>procreate</hi> without Her; and yet, for which <hi>Procreation</hi> his Body appeared <hi>purposely</hi> Designed, by reason of its <hi>proper, natural,</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> Composure for it; Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Designedly</hi> and <hi>on Purpose</hi> made him such a Creature, as should have such a Companion in order to <hi>Procreation,</hi> because else, all that Aptitude and Structure which now serves to that end, would have been <hi>useless;</hi> and God have done, what He and Nature never do, <hi>something in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Institution, or Reason of Ordaining Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, depending on its <hi>End;</hi> and its Immediate, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural End, being <hi>Procreation</hi> and <hi>Propagation</hi> of a <hi>Species</hi> of Creatures, and Man's Body apt and suitable for such Procreation, at the <hi>Moment</hi> of His formation <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;</hi> it follows, that at the <hi>Moment</hi> of his formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Compleated,</hi> when he was an apt, and fit Creature for the End of Marriage, <hi>Procreation,</hi> the Institution of Marriage, if not before, yet then Commenc'd; because the <hi>Natural</hi> Frame of Man, did <hi>Necessarily</hi> suppose such a thing as <hi>Marriage;</hi> and therefore, its Institution was <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Natural,</hi> not <hi>Occasional:</hi> it was designed by

Nature, it self, and therefore needed not to be Instituted with any formal <hi>Ceremony, Law,</hi> or <hi>Circumstance</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I confess, that a secondary end of Marriage, namely <hi>mutual Society, help and Comfort,</hi> seems to have been <hi>Occasional:</hi> for after God had made Man, and placed Him in the Garden, He said, Gen. 2. 18. <hi>That it was not good that Man should be alone, that He would make Him an Help meet for Him;</hi> as if, upon consideration of his Solitariness, as having no Creature capable of Conversing with Him, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for remedy of that evil, to give Him a <hi>Wife:</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> in the 23 <hi>ver.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> gives another Reason, why a Man should <hi>leave his Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife;</hi> because she was taken out of Him, was <hi>Bone of his Bone,</hi> and <hi>Flesh of his Flesh;</hi> not that this was the <hi>only Reason</hi> of Marriage, because Woman was taken out of Man; but that it should be a <hi>strong Motive</hi> of Love and Inclination to Woman, because she was a piece of Man himself, and therefore He should prefer Her before the Dear Relations of Father and Mother. By which very words, <hi>Father and Mother,</hi> Adam <hi>seems</hi> to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the <hi>end</hi> of Marriage to be <hi>Procreation,</hi> and what <hi>Procreation</hi> was; else He could not have known what the words <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> signify; unless you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose those Words not <hi>Adams,</hi> but the Holy Pen-mans by a <hi>Prolepsis.</hi> From what has been said, 'tis clear, that the <hi>two great Ends</hi> of Marriage are <hi>Procreation,</hi> and <hi>mutual help;</hi> and that He who Marries, is Obliged to intend none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but those Ends.</p>
                  <p>Having shewed, that the Institution of Marriage was <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary</hi> with Mans first Creation, that the <hi>natural Disposition and Frame</hi> of Mans Body, was its very Institution <hi>in Nature it self,</hi> without <hi>further Ceremony, Law,</hi> or <hi>Circumstance,</hi> that <hi>Adams</hi> Marriage was Consummate, and Perfect without such; yet now since the World is Increased, there is something more requisit to be done, I mean, as to the Contracting, and Solemnization of Matrimony. For when there were none in the VVorld but one Man and one VVoman, and both <hi>naturally</hi> loving one another, <hi>Circumstance</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi> were needless, since they are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59988:14"/>
significative only of our minds to others, but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no others but themselves, and their minds <hi>sufficiently</hi> known to one another, from the very inclinations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Nature, as Man and Woman in <hi>general,</hi> and there being no other VVoman for Him to take, or Man for Her; I say, neither Nature nor Reason could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>Circumstance</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi> as convenient or useful: but now they must be used as signs and tokens of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> that such a <hi>particular Man and Woman</hi> do agree to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to prevent Defrauding one onother by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> the Marriage, (which, if done in secret between themselves only, either might) and to prevent any ones wronging of either, by <hi>intruding</hi> upon the <hi>Right</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is better secured and known, by being <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Solemn,</hi> and Acted before VVitness. Further, because all words do not <hi>equally</hi> express Consent, but some more, some less; 'tis likewise convenient, a <hi>determined form</hi> of words, whereby to express Consent validly, should be Authorised, and so all refuge to <hi>Equivocation,</hi> and <hi>dubious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of former Promises might be avoided. And to the end, that the Persons consenting to Marriage, might have the stronger Obligation to stand to their Promise, it was thought fit, they should mutually Promise each other, as far as lies in their Power, <hi>before God Himself,</hi> in the Presence and Hearing of one of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p>So then, the Ends and Reasons of Marriage, is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and mutual Help;</hi> an inducing Motive is the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Love</hi> Man and VVoman bare to each other, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing originally Flesh of one anothers Flesh; the Essence or Actual Contract of it consists in <hi>Consent,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>outward Circumstances,</hi> are requisite for its Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ad extra,</hi> and may not <hi>ordinarily</hi> be neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault, because they are <hi>wholesome</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>MArriage, although so strait an Union as nothing more, yet admits of a <hi>Dissolution,</hi> commonly called <hi>Divorce;</hi> that is, a Separation of both Man and VVoman, so as to return into the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Singleness of Life,</hi> in which they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59988:15"/>
were before their Marriage; but this, not lightly, but on great weighty and high Considerations: And this is by the By to be observed, that every Separation of Man and VVoman after Matrimony <hi>outwardly</hi> Solemnized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is not <hi>properly</hi> Divorce; for Divorce is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Separation of Persons, who according to <hi>the intent</hi> of outward Solemnization, were <hi>really and perfectly</hi> in a state of Marriage, and that, so as to return into a state of <hi>utter Disobligation</hi> or <hi>Non relation</hi> one to the other: but a Separation of Persons not <hi>perfectly</hi> Married, or of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Married if <hi>not for ever,</hi> so as both shall remain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, is not <hi>properly</hi> Divorce. When therefore two Persons are Separated and Disjoyned, because the one is <hi>naturally Impotent;</hi> that is, in Body <hi>not Perfect</hi> Man or VVoman, (for by <hi>natural Impotency,</hi> Age, VVeakness, or Barreness is not to be understood; for they are to be born with; but an <hi>imperfect</hi> or <hi>monstrous</hi> Body.) Such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration I say, is not <hi>properly</hi> Divorce, because none are Divorced but <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife;</hi> and such were not they: For since none are <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> but they who are <hi>perfectly</hi> Married; and the <hi>firm Contract</hi> of Marriage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not only on the <hi>Consent</hi> of the Parties, and <hi>Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> but on a <hi>supposition</hi> that they are what they are taken to be; that is, <hi>perfect</hi> Man or Woman; (for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage supposes the joyning of such together) if either be <hi>naturally Impotent,</hi> that is, not <hi>perfectly</hi> Man or VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the other is imposed on, and the <hi>Consent</hi> of that Person to have married <hi>a Man or Woman,</hi> shall not be adjudged Valid, so as to imply that Persons <hi>Consent</hi> to Oblige to Cohabitation, with one who is <hi>not Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whom alone that Person <hi>did Consent and intend</hi> to have in Marriage; and therefore, such are not joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>God and Nature,</hi> since Nature Abhors such a Conjunction; but without more adoe, are <hi>Actually</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If for other Reasons, a Man and VVoman <hi>perfectly so,</hi> and Married, do Part; that parting is not a <hi>real</hi> Divorce, so as to be Disengaged from each other; for thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11. <hi>And unto the Marryed I</hi>

                     <hi>Command; yet not I, but the Lord; Let not the Wife depart from Her Husband, but and if she Dapart, let her remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, or be reconciled to her Husband; and let not the Husband put away his Wife:</hi> In which place St. <hi>Paul</hi> first Exhorts, that there be no Separation between Man and Wife, that is, that they should not <hi>Disagree,</hi> so as to part from one another; but if such a Case ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; that their Separation for such a Reason, is not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, doth not dis-unite them, but that the VVoman continues the Mans VVife still, notwithstanding this Separation, and ought not to marry any one else, but that a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> should be Endeavoured, and both return to each other: but by the last words, <hi>Let not the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band put away his Wife,</hi> is not to be understood, as if a Man might <hi>by no means, for no Cause, Totally</hi> Divorce his VVife; for even our Saviour allows <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> to be a <hi>sufficient</hi> Cause; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 32. and 19. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> place in these VVords, <hi>I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his Wife, saving for the Cause of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, causeth Her to commit Adultery; and whosoever shall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her that is Divorced, committeth Adultery:</hi> In the last place thus, <hi>I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his Wife, except it be for Fornication, and shall Marry another, Committeth Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and wboso Marrieth her which is put away, doth Commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery:</hi> which Exception of the Case of <hi>Adultery,</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proves, that Divorce for <hi>some Cause</hi> is Lawful, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because these Places are <hi>generally</hi> understood in that <hi>rigid Sence,</hi> which the VVords without due Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seem to bear, as if <hi>no other</hi> Cause whatsoever but <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Fornication</hi> in the VVoman, is <hi>sufficient</hi> Cause of a <hi>Total</hi> Divorce, and so 'tis <hi>impossible</hi> that my <hi>Policick Reasons</hi> should be <hi>sufficient</hi> Cause; I shall clear the Sence and Meaning of the VVords, <hi>First,</hi> Observing, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Adultery</hi> it self is partly a <hi>Politick Reason</hi> of Divorce; forasmuch as Marriage is Instituted for <hi>Propagation,</hi> and that is mischiev'd, and hindred by nothing more, than promiscuous Embraces; and thence Accrues great Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> and its <hi>politick Good.</hi> Besides, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59988:16"/>
the VVoman do sometimes prove with Child, it being possibly anothers, it shall however be obtruded on the Mothers Husband to Maintain: She then who is found Guilty of this high Crime, shall be <hi>Finally</hi> Dismist, as one who perverts and hinders the end of Marriage, and endamages the <hi>publick</hi> if she have not Children; and if she have, greatly <hi>injures</hi> her Husband, both by dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of her self to another, who was <hi>Rightfully</hi> only His, and probably burthens Him with what ought natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be anothers Charge. But to clear the Sence of the <hi>above Cited Places.</hi>

                  <p>In the 19. of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> Ver. 3. we have the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees coming to our Lord, and tempting him, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a Branch of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, to try whether he would contradict it; and then they had sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Accusation against him they thought. They Asked him; Whether it were Lawful for a Man to put away his Wife <hi>for Every Cause,</hi> according to what is written in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>When a Man hath taken a Wife, and Marryed Her, and it come to pass, that she find no favour in his Eyes, because He hath found some Uncleanness in Her, then let him write her a Bill of Divorcement, and give it her in her Hand, and send her out of his House.</hi> The Law gave License to put away Wives <hi>for Every Cause,</hi> for every Dislike; for <hi>not finding Favour</hi> in their Husbands eyes, for <hi>no greater cause</hi> than not pleasing their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: What thinkest Thou, Is it Lawful or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of <hi>Equity and Reason,</hi> as well as to the strict Letter of the <hi>Law?</hi> And this Their Question he thus in effect Answers: That such Reasons as these, for which <hi>Moses</hi> allowed the <hi>Jewes</hi> to put away their Wives, were not Reasonable nor Equitable, but Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him by them, whose hardness of Heart would be content with nothing less; and therefore it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law should be <hi>Remitted,</hi> and so their hardness become more pardonable, as not being an Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any <hi>Positive Law,</hi> but allowed of: But for the future, Divorce shall not be Lawful for any of those <hi>Petty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> but for <hi>no less</hi> than <hi>Adultery,</hi> which the Law judged
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59988:16"/>
so Heinous, as to punish with <hi>Death it self;</hi> but, as all Rigors in the Gospel are Mitigated, so now <hi>Adultery</hi> shall be punishable only with <hi>Divorce;</hi> or else, because the Jews now cannot put any Man to Death, have lost <hi>Jus vitae &amp; necis;</hi> they shall punish it by <hi>Divorce,</hi> which remains in their power. The whole Scope and Design of which Answer, I judge to be This; That the Jewish <hi>Rigor</hi> and <hi>Moroseness</hi> of Divorcing their Wives for <hi>every petty Dislike</hi> he did not only not approve, but hereafter would not have <hi>Adultery</hi> it self punisht so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely as formerly, with <hi>Death,</hi> but only with <hi>Divorce;</hi> and that Divorce was punishment great enough for <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi> and that <hi>nothing less</hi> than <hi>Adultery</hi> does deserve to be, &amp; must in the Gospel-state be punished with <hi>Divorce.</hi> And that this Answer does not suppose, but that <hi>Offences as great as</hi> Adultery, may deserve it as well as Adultery; nor deny, but <hi>some Offences may be as great as</hi> Adultery, I have this Reason to think; because, in the 6th. <hi>Verse,</hi> Christ sayes of Man and Wife, <hi>That they are no more Twain, but One Flesh,</hi> and that <hi>Man should not put asunder what God had joyned together;</hi> which being <hi>generally</hi> spoken <hi>of all</hi> Husbands and Wives; (for, <hi>All</hi> God hath Joyned together) one might conclude, that because <hi>All</hi> Husbands and Wives are joyned together <hi>by God,</hi> and no man must put asunder what <hi>God</hi> has joyned; therefore it is not Lawful to put them asunder for any Cause whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no not for <hi>Adultery,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> did once joyn them together; which being contradictory to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> he gives afterwards, for the cause of <hi>Adultery,</hi> plainly shews, those words are not to be understood in a <hi>strict and literal</hi> Sence, which excludes even the cause of <hi>Adultery.</hi> And therefore it is reasonable to suspect, That <hi>its not being Lawful to Divorce but for the Cause of Adultery only,</hi> is not either <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>literally</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>only that;</hi> but that <hi>nothing less than Adultery</hi> is a <hi>sufficient</hi> cause, not denying, but <hi>something may be as great.</hi> I shall state a Case, which I will leave others to Judge, whether it be as Great or no.</p>
                  <p>Suppose two Persons of different Religions Married,

and one by the <hi>avowed necessary</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Principles of His or Her Religion, <hi>firmly</hi> Believes the other to be in a State of <hi>Heresy, Damnation,</hi> and <hi>Enmity to God</hi> and true Religion, and that Faith may <hi>lawfully</hi> be broke with that Person; that 'tis <hi>Lawful,</hi> Nay, highly <hi>Commendable</hi> to murther that Person, because His or Her Religion, by this Act, is according to all <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> sure to be <hi>Propagated;</hi> which to promote, as far as in this Person lies, is an <hi>indispensable</hi> Duty; and to compass, is to rescue Multitudes of Souls from Hell, and to cover and expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for all this Persons private Sins, and to secure to Him or Her self Heaven and Gods Favour, by so merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Act: that there is no other <hi>probable way</hi> of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting this great VVork but by this means; that to die in the Attempt, or failing of Success to be afterwards put to Death for it, is a most glorious <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> I should think a Person in the same Kingdom, City, House, but much more <hi>Bed,</hi> with such an one, to be very un-secure; and if the Person escapes, it can be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to nothing but the others <hi>extreme Faint-Hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which one can scarce Imagine any guilty of, who is prepossest by such winning, prevailing, and strong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as these I have been mentioning: And therefore, between a Sinful, Amorous and Adulterous Love of a Stranger, if it remain still <hi>within the Heart,</hi> and has not proceeded to <hi>Actual</hi> Commission; and such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as believing it <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Meritorious</hi> to Murther an Husband or wife, as to the Influence they have on Marriage in order to <hi>Dissolution,</hi> there is no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference but this; That a Man must expect the <hi>Actual</hi> Commission of Adultery, the bare <hi>intention</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> of which is not <hi>sufficient</hi> Cause of Divorce; besides, that it proceeds not from <hi>a Vowed</hi> Principle, that 'tis <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Commendable</hi> so to do, and therefore that intention may alter; but the imminent danger from those other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as fixt and <hi>unalterable,</hi> will not admit of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay until the Fact be Committed. <hi>Separation</hi> therefore from such a Person, as to all Society and Converse, is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly Necessary,</hi> and <hi>always,</hi> is <hi>Natural</hi> and agreeable to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59988:17"/>
Reason, forasmuch as 'tis for the <hi>preservation</hi> of Life; and a Separation warranted by Reason to be <hi>perpetual,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suppose any mutual Obligation, Tye or Relation whatsoever in Reason to <hi>remain</hi> between them whom good and justifiable Reasons have <hi>perpetually</hi> Separated; and therefore being thus Separated, not <hi>accidentally,</hi> but by <hi>moral and reasonable Necessity,</hi> there shall not remain an <hi>Obligation</hi> to the Person so <hi>Necessitated</hi> to <hi>remain Bound</hi> to the other in the Tye of Marriage; the Duties of which 'tis impossible for one to Satisfy and Perform, because it is <hi>absolutely</hi> rendred <hi>useless</hi> by the other: and for disengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such a Case as this, there is both <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Countenance</hi> in Scripture; we have these Words in the 15 <hi>Ver.</hi> of the 7 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 1 <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Corinth. <hi>But if the Un-believing depart, let Him depart; a Brother or Sister is not under Bondage in such a Case:</hi> Whence I argue thus, if upon the voluntary Departure of a barely <hi>Un-believing</hi> Husband or Wife, either from other, neither is so tyed up, but that in such a case of Separation and Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Christian is not in Bondage; that is, remains not Obliged under the Yoke of that Marriage which the other by final Departing, has <hi>Dissolved,</hi> but may Marry; Shall not then the <hi>Necessitated sending away or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of a Person for the Reasons I have mentioned (since 'tis the same thing, whether a Person depart volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, or force himself to be sent away, because the person who caused the Separation must be judged to depart)?

                  <p>IF the Case, I in the last Chapter put, were a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no doubt but that would Aggravate it with Circumstances, as <hi>peculiar</hi> to Princes as is their <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> For a Prince being not only an <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> but a <hi>Soveraign,</hi> such Principles would be more than <hi>doubly</hi> Pernicious, because they are directed against a Person, who is not only in a <hi>twofold Capacity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>doubly Injured,</hi> but likewise, because imagining or believing the Destruction of a Prince to be Lawful, is it self an higher Crime than the same belief concerning a private man; because His Right in his Wife as <hi>His Subject</hi> is more immediate from God and Absolute, than as he is <hi>Her Husband;</hi> the Right of <hi>Dominion</hi> being greater than that of <hi>Propriety</hi> and <hi>Use.</hi> Besides, the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering such a Person is not <hi>Confined</hi> to His own Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but involves all his Subjects in it, as those whose Welfare depends on their Head and Protector; and either the utter Ruin, or extreme Danger of the whole Nation attends His Destruction, especially in the Case of being <hi>morally certain</hi> after His Death, to be both <hi>Spiritually</hi> and <hi>Temporally</hi> enthralled: And therefore, such a Case would so much the more warrant a Divorce, as the breach of a far greater Obligation is more notorious, and of more dangerous Consequence, and less capable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and a stronger and more <hi>necessitating</hi> Reason to put her away, supposing the Wife to be so Principled as to give just Occasion of such <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>necessity.</hi> 'Tis possible, I consess, that one <hi>Externally</hi> of such or such a Profession

may not be so <hi>in Heart,</hi> or may not be seasoned with those Doctrines which the <hi>Presidents</hi> of that Religion judg too <hi>apparently</hi> startling to Communicate to some of their Disciples: but nothing there is but may be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected and feared from some mens <hi>Importunity, Cunning, Boldness</hi> and <hi>Impudence.</hi> But I will not Insist upon this supposed Case any longer, which under all these Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations must needs imply the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of Divorce, which I think I can infer <hi>Allowable</hi> in a Case more <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and of <hi>less evil Aspect.</hi> For I will imagine the Consort not so dangerously disposed and affected, nor to Design any such thing; but that the Prince having no Heir of his Body, to Succeed, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in such a Religion and Principles, as will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Him to procure the Peoples real good, and that such a destructive and dangerous Religion <hi>naturally</hi> falls in with him who is the <hi>presumtive Heir,</hi> as they call it, that is the <hi>next</hi> of Blood or Kin for want of a <hi>nigher;</hi> and that this Princess or Queen never had, nor, <hi>morally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ever can have, and bring forth an <hi>Heir</hi> to be <hi>so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed</hi> and Succeed; and this Conjecture for the <hi>Future,</hi> grounded on the <hi>time past;</hi> because she had none then when it was more <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and without such an <hi>Heir</hi> so much danger and destruction imminent; the Case thus Stated, I say, <hi>prevention</hi> of Mischief, which could not give the <hi>People</hi> Authority to Depose a Prince, because though they may be <hi>Injured</hi> by Him, yet they never can have <hi>Authority</hi> to vindicate themselves <hi>against Him;</hi> will however give a <hi>Prince,</hi> who has a full <hi>Authority</hi> over all, Power and Warrant to Divorce a Wife, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unavoidably</hi> and <hi>necessarily</hi> forced thereto, though not by <hi>Her self,</hi> or <hi>own Principles,</hi> yet <hi>so accidentally,</hi> as is <hi>inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable</hi> from Her <hi>Marriage;</hi> and this <hi>necessity</hi> is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because 'tis absurd, that a Prince should suffer His People to incur such great danger and destruction <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> upon any pretence whatsoever, and therefore is not to be supposed: For the Christian Maxim of <hi>not doing Evil that Good may come of it,</hi> would be mis-appli'd here; for, a <hi>private</hi> Interest or good standing in Competition
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59988:19"/>
with the <hi>publick,</hi> ceases to be a real Right if <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>publick,</hi> inasmuch as every Subject doth <hi>implicitly</hi> and <hi>tacitly</hi> relinquish His Right, Possession and Pretentions to every thing which cannot consist with the Common Good; and then to make void such a Right, is not <hi>to do Evil,</hi> and so the <hi>necessity</hi> remains <hi>unavoidable;</hi> but still with this Proviso and not else, That the Prince may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus, if He believe the <hi>probability</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of such a destructive Religion's coming in, if He Die without other Heir than He has already; Or that, if it do come in, He believes it as <hi>Dangerous</hi> and <hi>Destructive</hi> as others do: else His Conscience is bound, and He Obliged to follow it. In the last place, to strengthen the belief of this Maxim, on which the stress of the Dispute depends, that what was once a Mans full and undoubted Right and Propriety, if it ever after prove utterly <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>publick</hi> Good, finally <hi>ceases</hi> to be His Right or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; and that to deprive him of the <hi>Possession</hi> of that thing, is not an <hi>Injury,</hi> nor <hi>doing Evil that Good may come of it,</hi> I will in short, endeavour to make out, by shewing, That God doth Himself <hi>Dispence</hi> in such Cases, with Princes <hi>forc't Actions.</hi> I might insist on a tacit Consent of every Subject to this purpose, because Government is not Fixed and setled without such a Consent, but shall rather conclude with the strongest Proof, the Authority of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles had a Power given them by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, That <hi>what soever they did bind on Earth should be Bound in Heaven, and whatsoever they did loose on Earth should be loosed in Heaven; and whosoever Sins they did Remit they were Remitted, and whosoever Sins they did Retain, they were Retained.</hi> Which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Power of <hi>Loosing</hi> and <hi>Binding, Remitting</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,</hi> the Learned observe, and Expound to be the power of <hi>admitting</hi> into the Number and Fellowship of the Faithful, upon Repentance, and <hi>Exclusion</hi> or <hi>Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from it for Sins Scandalous, and putting them into a state of unworthyness, to partake of the <hi>Christian Mysteries,</hi> and be reputed a <hi>Member of Christ;</hi> and this is called <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;</hi> from which too, upon unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59988:19"/>
they had Authority to Release; now this Power is commonly called the <hi>Power of the Keyes,</hi> is an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary jurisdiction</hi> derived from the Apostles to their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, who exercise such an Authority to this day. Now, <hi>This jurisdiction</hi> seems to derive from the abovementioned Texts, on which 'tis grounded, so <hi>universal an extent,</hi> as if no one <hi>whatsoever,</hi> not <hi>Princes themselves,</hi> were exempt from it, the words <hi>Whatsoever</hi> and <hi>Whomsoever</hi> being <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal;</hi> and in common Speech Excluding none, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all. And some men, namely the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who catched at the least <hi>outward</hi> appearance or countenance from Scripture for erecting the <hi>Popes Unlimited Power,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these places of Scripture to confer on Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours a Jurisdiction, Authority, and Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over <hi>Princes Themselves,</hi> so as to <hi>Censure,</hi> and <hi>Actually</hi> Excommunicate them; because 'tis said, That <hi>Whatsoever</hi> they did bind on Earth, should be bound in Heaven: But neither in the Apostles <hi>practise</hi> nor <hi>examples</hi> of Antiquity can we find ever such an Authority to have been exercised over <hi>Princes,</hi> though no doubt, occasion might often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough occur. And Conformably to this, the best <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> (I mean <hi>That of England</hi>) Teaches, That 'tis not Lawful to Excommunicate <hi>Princes;</hi> that is, denounce them to be <hi>No Members of Christ and his Church.</hi> For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Power is for <hi>Edification,</hi> and not for <hi>Destruction;</hi> and no doubt every <hi>Christian Prince,</hi> like every other <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christian,</hi> is intrusted to the care of some <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor or Pastors to Instruct him, and give Account for his Soul, if it be lost through their default; and therefore they might seem to have Power of using all means for <hi>His Salvation</hi> as they may for <hi>others,</hi> and this of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> being such, they might therefore <hi>Excommunicate</hi> Him; (I mean not from the <hi>Visible</hi> Company of the Faithful, for that they cannot, but from Participation of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of our Religion, and from being a Member of Christ's <hi>Invisible</hi> Church); But this neither they did nor we do, on this <hi>Supposition,</hi> and Maxim in Divinity, that <hi>Princes</hi> are, and ought to be Exempt from <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> Rules, which others
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59988:20"/>
are Subject to, if so be the Obliging a <hi>Prince</hi> to those Rules, would be occasion of Dammage and Danger to the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> as subjecting him to <hi>Church-Censures,</hi> tho never so deservedly, would <hi>necessarily</hi> be; for it would look as if he had a <hi>Superiour</hi> on Earth, though real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were only a Superiours <hi>Delegate;</hi> and subject Him to be despised and slighted by some, who would value themselves above him, as not so near to Gods Favour and Commnunion as themselves; it would occasion dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and hazard the taking away all <hi>just Authority,</hi> nay, the expulsion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> it self: and therefore rather than endanger the <hi>publick</hi> Peace and Tranquillity, the <hi>Prince</hi> should be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from an Ordinance and Institution of <hi>Christ Himself,</hi> which <hi>in Reason</hi> doth touch Him as well as any else; Will it not then follow, that rather than manifestly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> good of His People, a Divorce, being the only remedy, may as well be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted; and He as well freed from the dangerous Tye of <hi>Marriage</hi> in such a Case, as from <hi>Excommunication</hi> it self? Nay, we find God himself <hi>Dispensing</hi> with an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Law for the sake of the <hi>Publick Spiritual</hi> Good. God Dispensed with the <hi>Natural</hi> Law of doing no Murther, and that within the near Relation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, and commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to flay <hi>Isaac,</hi> that He might thus give a rare Example of his Faith for all the Church of God afterwards to <hi>imitate,</hi> both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Christians:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in extremity of Hunger was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,</hi> and that not <hi>immediatly</hi> by God, but by the <hi>prudential rational</hi> deduction of <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Priest, that a Case of <hi>necessity</hi> did <hi>sufficiently</hi> Dispense, was <hi>Indulged,</hi> I say eating the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> against a positive Law, that none but the Priests alone should eat it, and yet <hi>did not do Evil,</hi> in eating the forbidden Bread, that <hi>Good might come of it,</hi> the preservation of his Life; and that was all the good it did, because his Life, at that time not being King, had no other Influence on the <hi>publick</hi> Good, than as <hi>afterwards</hi> he was to be King.</p>
                  <p>I Conclude therefore, that if not only the <hi>publick</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59988:20"/>
good cannot be <hi>procured,</hi> but the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>highest Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi> be <hi>prevented</hi> without the Divorce of a Person whose Marriage hinders the only remedy and <hi>prevention</hi> of those great <hi>Mischiefs,</hi> introduction of Idolatry, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Defection from the true Religion; that a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> Separation of that Person from the Prince is made <hi>necessary</hi> to the avoiding those Mischiefs, and because those Mischiefs must and ought to be, and may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, by this way of Separation be Avoided; <hi>(Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> it self, for the prevention of <hi>like</hi> Mischiefs dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Him in <hi>another as solemn an Ordinance</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,) this Separation <hi>so necessitated</hi> shall not leave any <hi>Tye</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi> on the Prince which is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with <hi>perpetual necessary,</hi> not <hi>accidental</hi> Separation, and such a Tye is <hi>Marriage,</hi> but that the <hi>Prince</hi> is thus dis-ingaged sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and free to pursue the averting those dreadful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, and otherwise certain <hi>Mischiefs</hi> which would Ensue to the ruine of the greatest Publick Good, both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal;</hi> the procurement of which cannot be prejudiced by any <hi>private</hi> Interest or Right, for that ceases to be so, when it stands in competition with the <hi>Publick;</hi> but dispenseth with the <hi>Annulling</hi> that <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> by a <hi>prudential, rational,</hi> and true Inference from an <hi>unavoidable</hi> Necessity.</p>
