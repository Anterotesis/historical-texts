            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO
His HIGHNESS
THE
Most Illustrious Prince,
WILLIAM,
Duke of Glocester.</head>
                  <opener>

                  <p>THE Author of the ensuing Work,
originally a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was in his
life-time, so highly esteemed for
his <hi>Learning, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi>
in <hi>State Affairs,</hi> that he made no small
Figure in the greatest <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi>
Nor has this Off-spring of his Brain met
with less favourable <hi>Success.</hi> For having
<pb facs="tcp:56556:3"/>
been translated into several Languages, and
in each often printed, it has been received
with great Applause, and ever been honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Protection of some <hi>Illustrious
Young Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Precedent, <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> is not my
only Apology for this Presumption; for were
<hi>Saavedra</hi> now living, he might see his
Theory reduced to Practice by the best of
<hi>Kings,</hi> in the best of <hi>Governments:</hi> And
though he has indeed given you excellent
<hi>Maxims,</hi> supported by many eminent <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi>
yet are there none so worthy your
Imitation, as those you may continually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
in the Conduct and Bravery of that
most Excellent <hi>Prince,</hi> your <hi>Heroick</hi> Vncle;
the whole Series of whose Life as far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
Panegyrick, as the Greatness of his
Soul abhors Flattery. And I was the rather
induced to attempt this unpolished Version,
knowing that honest Plain-dealing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed
Integrity, the two darling Mistresses
of our Author, could not be unacceptable in
a Nation where they are so generally belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in a Court where they are beyond
<pb facs="tcp:56556:3"/>
Precedent, more peculiarly cherished and
maintain'd.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Royal Highness</hi> will here find Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which I hope will not only be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to your Youth, but profitable even in
your ripest Years; by reviving those Seeds
of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> which are daily
sown by the pious Care and Example of
Your most Illustrious Parents. You may here
learn, not only the Duty of a <hi>Prince,</hi> but that
also of an accomplish'd <hi>States-Man</hi> and
<hi>Loyal Subject:</hi> And if ever it shall please
God to make You his Vicegerent, You may
from hence (next to the Holy Scriptures)
learn your Duty to him also, <hi>by whom
Kings Reign, and Princes decree Justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine: You have here a Compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
of <hi>Religious Politicks,</hi> which may
guide You through all the Labyrinths of
Government in this World, and crown You
with immortality in that to come. But, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> I presume not by this
Address to think, but that the nicest Stroaks
of our Author come far short of Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>'s
blooming Virtue, but as near as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb facs="tcp:56556:4"/>
can be copied, this Work has a Right
in Your <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> it shewing not so
much what You should be, as (if we may
Iudge the ensuing Day by the Glorious Morn)
what You will be, the best of Princes.</p>
                  <p>But here I beg leave to retire, having
already waded out of my Depth, Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>'s
Praises being a Topick so profound,
that in attempting them, I should only
trouble the <hi>Stream</hi> without hopes of ever
plumbing the <hi>Bottom.</hi> The main Motives
to this Dedication, were those two inherent
Passions of Mankind, especially Writers, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
and <hi>Ambition;</hi> the first in Regard to
this Work, which has need of no less a Name,
than that of Your <hi>Royal Highness</hi> to protect
it; the last in respect to my self, having
none greater than to subscribe my self,</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN the toilsome Leisure of my continual Travels
over <hi>Germany,</hi> and several other Countries, I
compos'd these Hundred Emblems; wherein you
have an Idea of a Royal Christian Politician,
penning them down at vacant Intervals. These I had
meditated on in my Journeys upon the Road, as oft as
that continual Intercourse I had by Letters with his
Catholick Majesty and his Ministers, and other publick
Concerns incumbent on me, gave me Time and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
By Degrees the Work swell'd, and though I
was well assured, it came far short of Perfection, as
not being compil'd with that continual Application of
Thought, nor with that Accuracy and Labour correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as was requisite to have render'd it agreeable in all
its Parts, and an abfolutely perfect Piece; and that it
<pb facs="tcp:56556:5"/>
would be thought Pride in me, to presume to prescribe
Precepts to Princes<note n="1" place="bottom">Praecipere qualis debeat esse princeps, pulchrum quidem, &amp; genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, &amp; prope superbum. <hi>Plin. Jun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 3. Epist.</hi> 18.</note>: However, the Importunity of
my Friends (who have ever great Influence over me)
prevail'd upon me to publish it; in which also Self-love
had some part, for we are generally as fond of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of our Brain, as of those of Nature. I write not
this, <hi>Reader,</hi> to excuse my Errors, for that I can't do
sufficiently, but that I may more easily obtain Pardon
of those, who shall consider my Zeal, in having amidst
such a Croud of Business, Fatigues, and Dangers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd
this Book, that if any Benefit might be reap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d from
it, it might accrue to my Prince and Master; and least
with me should die the Experience which I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by a continued Exercise in Bus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ness for Four
and thirty Years, which after five years Study in the
University of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> I have pass'd in the principal
Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> always employ'd in Publick Affairs,
having been at <hi>Rome</hi> at the Election of two Popes; at
the Assembly of the Electoral Princes at <hi>Ratisbone</hi>
when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, the present most August
Emperor, was created King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> at Eight Diets
in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and lastly at the Imperial Diet at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi>
being Plenipotentiary for the most Serene House
and Circle of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Wherefore, if any one of these
Political Counsels or Precepts, shall be any ways bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to him who is happpily born to govern both the Old
and New World, I believe this Attempt will be excus'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor should any one be disgusted at the Use of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
since God himself is the Author of them. The
Brazen-Serpent<note n="2" place="bottom">Numb. 21.</note>, The Flaming-Bush<note n="3" place="bottom">Exodus 3.</note>, <hi>Gideon</hi>'s

<note n="6" place="bottom">Exodus 28.</note>, The Amours of the kind Spouse<note n="7" place="bottom">Song of Solomon.</note>, What
are they else but Emblems?</p>
                  <p>It has been my chiefest Endeavour to have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
new; whether the Performance be answerable
<pb facs="tcp:56556:5"/>
I know not. There have been many Ingenious Men,
who have wrote upon the same Subject, and 'tis very
obvious for different Persons to Jump upon the same
Thoughts; which has been my Fortune, having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
met with in other Authors, those Emblems which
I at first thought my own Invention, which I therefore
thought fit wholly to omit, not without Prejudice to
my Design, for my Predecessors have made use of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Figures and Motto's, which has oblig'd me to
take up with others less proper.</p>
                  <p>Also some Political Precepts, which though my own,
as to the Invention at least, yet I have found since to
be of other, and far more ancient Authority: I have
therefore Inserted the Authors Names in the Margin,
that due Honour may be paid to Antiquity. 'Twas the
Happiness of the Wits of former Ages, that they could
engross from their Posterity the Glory of Invention.
I have made it my Design and Care, to Interweave
this Web with some Threads of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt the most accomplish'd Master of Princes,
and who most judiciously penetrates their Nature, and
the Customs and Intrigues of Courts, as also the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
and Success of Governments; with Precepts
and Sentences taken from this Great Man, as with
my Hand, I lead the Prince whom I would mould by
these Emblems, that he may without danger, gather
Flowers transplanted hither from anothers Garden,
and purg'd from the Venom and Thorns which their
native Soil frequently subjects them to, or the rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those times produc'd. In this Second Edition,
I also illustrate the principal Maxims of State, with
Proofs from Holy the Scriptures; for those Politicks
which are refin'd in that Furnace, may be truly call'd,
Silver try'd and refined seven times in the Fire of
Truth<note n="8" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Psalm</hi> 12. 7. The Words of the Lord are pure Words; as Silver tried in a Furnace of Earth, purified seven times.</note>. And who would learn of a Heathen, or
Impious Person, when the Holy Spirit is so ready to
give Instruction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56556:6"/>In explaining the Emblems, I am not too prolix, that
the <hi>Reader</hi> may not lose the Satisfaction of discovering
their meaning of himself. If by Chance, in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I sprinkle a little Learning, it is not out of
Ostentation, but to enlighten the Prince's Mind, and
render the Instruction more agreeable.</p>
                  <p>The whole Work consists purely of State Maxims and
Rules, those being the fittest Materials for such a Politick
Building; however I don't barely propose them, but
intermix them with the whole Discourse, applying
them all along to particular Cases, to avoid the Danger
of general Precepts.</p>
                  <p>It has been also my Endeavour to render the Stile
polite, but without Affectation; short too and concise,
but not obscure; which in <hi>Horace</hi>'s Judgment was a
difficult Matter<note n="9" place="bottom">Brevis esse laboro obscurus fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>, and of which I have not yet seen
an instance in the <hi>Castillian</hi> Language. I have however
made an Essay towards it, knowing that what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to Princes should be neither idly Sententious, nor
superfluously Copious. Their time is precious, and he
does not a little obstruct the Publick Interest, who with
empty and frivolous Discourse diverts them from Affairs
of greater Importance.</p>
                  <p>I don't so wholly confine my self to the Institution
and Direction of Princes, but that I also descend to
Governments, reflect upon their Growth, Preservation,
and Fall; and so to frame a Minister of State, and a
prudent Courtier.</p>
                  <p>If at any time I am liberal of my Commendations of
any, 'tis to excite Emulation, not to Flatter, to which
I am very averse; for it were a Crime unpardonable
to publish to the whole World, Flatteries, and those
too engraven in Brass, or to make my self guilty of
the very same thing, which I so much reprove and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
in others.</p>
                  <p>If I speak the Truth with too much Freedom, 'tis to
be imputed to Ambition, which is so deeply rooted in
Mens minds, that without Fire and Sword 'tis incurable.

consequently may with less Danger be imitated, and a
Prudent and Politick Judgment may more safely be
formed thereon, which is the principal Advantage of

Book will be of excellent Use to all Ingenuous Persons of what

have used to Conquer their Enemies, and learn that their
greatest Interest consists in good Order and Discipline, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Obedience to their Superiors, that Vice is as pernicious
in a Camp as a Court, and that Bravery and Virtue in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction

                  <p>Our Celebrated Author, <hi>Don Diego Saavedra Faxardo,</hi>
Knight of the Order of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> was Born of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Murcia</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Peter de
Saavedra</hi> and <hi>Fabiana Faxardo,</hi> who was also of Noble
Extraction. He was Educated in the University of <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
in the Profession of the Laws, wherein he became very
Eminent, especially in those Parts thereof which are requisite
for the Accomplishment of an Absolute Politician and Compleat
Statesman. From thence he was chosen Secretary to Cardinal
<pb facs="tcp:56556:8"/>
                     <hi>Gaspar Borgia,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and soon after Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for his Catholick Majesty at <hi>Rome;</hi> where his Conduct
gain'd him so great Applause, that he was sent on the same
Imploy into <hi>Switzerland:</hi> After that, he was Plenipotentiary-Ambassador
at two Imperial Diets at <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> and then
commanded to assist <hi>Don Gaspar de Bracamont,</hi> Count <hi>de

gave signal Demonstration of his great Experience and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity

State. At his Return he sate in the Supreme Council for the
Government of both the <hi>Indies;</hi> in which Imploy he died at

                  <p>The greatness of his Personal Character and Reputation, and
of this Book in particular, are too well-establish'd in the

Learned of the Age, let him read the Epistles prefix'd to the
<hi>Latin</hi> Version thereof. His Religious Temper more particularly
appears in the great Veneration he always shews for the Holy
Scripture, and his apt Application thereof; and his Politicks
no less by being so well read in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the Great Master
thereof. Were that Excellent <hi>Roman</hi> now living, he could
not but be pleased, to see the Roughness and Crabbedness of
his Stile so finely polish'd, without Diminution to the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Sense and Iudgment, in our <hi>English</hi> Version;
though in the Annotations thereof, he would find himself Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vald,

is no greater Argument to prove the general Approbation and

Languages, besides the Original, as <hi>Latin, French, Italian,

                     <pb facs="tcp:56556:9"/>The <hi>Reader</hi> is desired to take notice that our Author, a
all others of his Religion, makes use of the Vulgar Translation
in his Quotations out of the Holy Scripture, which in many
Places is so different from the <hi>English</hi> Version, that they are
not applicable to the Purpose for which he Quotes them.
For Instance the Seventy eighth Emblem is a Syren or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
and the Motto, <hi>Formosa Superne.</hi> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof, he quotes Isaiah 13. 22. <hi>Et Sirenes in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris
voluptatis,</hi> which we Translate, <hi>and Dragons in
their pleasant Places.</hi> How beautiful they are, unless we
do them wrong, I leave you to judge. The Fifty fifth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,
is a Hand holding a Scepter full of Eyes; the Motto,
<hi>His Praevide &amp; Provide.</hi> He there quotes <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 1. 11.
where the Vulgar has <hi>Virgam vigilantem ego video;</hi> the
<hi>English, I see the Rod of an Almond Tree;</hi> which
literally taken, is little to his Purpose, and therefore we
leave it in the Sense he took it. The Word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
is <hi>Saked,</hi> for an Almond Tree, and Verse the 12th, <hi>Then
said the Lord unto me, thou hast well seen, for I will
hasten my Word to perform it.</hi> The Almond Tree is there
mentioned as an Emblem of Hast; the word <hi>Saked,</hi> an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Tree, alluding to <hi>Sakad,</hi> a Word which signifies making
Haste. Nor is the Allusion frivolous, for <hi>Pliny</hi> says, <hi>Floret

and likes not his Picture, let him consider he sate not for it,

at hearing his own commendations he smooths his
Brows, looks pleasantly and smiles; on the contrary,
when discommended, he is concerned, blushes and
casts his Eyes on the ground; if of an undaunted Spirit,
he looks stern, is not terrified with shadows or threats;
if Liberal, he despises toyes and presents, or readily
parts with them again to others; if revengeful, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
Angry, is all in Tears till he have satisfaction;
if he be Cholerick, the least trifle puts him in a heat,
he lets fall his Brows, looks dogged, and threatens with
his fist; if Affable, with a sweet Smile and alluring
Eye, he wins favour and acceptance; if Melancholy,
he avoids Company, delights in solitude, is often
complaining, seldom Laughs, and generally looks sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len;
if he be Airy, he unfolds the Wrinkles of his

withdrawing them, and agreeably pleating his

of Education, of right reason and free-will which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

seems unaccountable, when nature joyns some eminent
Vertues with the most enormous Vices in the same

two branches, which growing out of the same Root pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

Nature, it certainly comes so near it as that

desire more. Nature I believe would envy Art if she
could possibly do the same, but now she is so kind, as
in many things to use the Assistance of Art; for whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

some effect on. Altho' I confess Education is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
sufficient of it self to make men Vertuous, because
many times under Purple as among Briars and Woods,
there spring up such monstrous Vices, particularly in
persons of a great Spirit, as prove utterly Incorrigible.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by Luxury, Liberty or Flattery in Princes Courts,
where abundance of Vicious affections grow as Thorns,
as noxious and unprofitable weeds upon ill manured
Land. Wherefore Except these Courts are well insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the care taken in a good Education will be to
very little purpose; for they seem to be like Moulds
and accordingly so Form the Prince as themselves are
well or ill disposed, and those Vertues or Vices which
have once began to be in repute in them, their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
transmit to posterity. A Prince is scarce Master
of his reason when his Courtiers out of flattery Cry
up the too great Liberty of his Parents and Ancestors,
recommending to him some great and renowned Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theirs, which have been as it were the propriety
of his Family. Hence also it comes to pass that some
particular Customs and Inclinations are propagated
from Father to Son in a continued succession, not so
much by the Native force of their blood, (for neither
length of time nor Mixtures of Marriage are used to
Change them) as because they are established in the
Courts where Infancy imbibes them and as it were
turns them into nature, thus among the <hi>Romans</hi> the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56556:18"/>
                        <hi>Claudii</hi> were reputed Proud, the <hi>Scipio's</hi> Warlike, the
<hi>Appii</hi> ambitious; as now in <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Gusmans</hi> are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to be Good Men, the <hi>Mendozas</hi> Humane,
the <hi>Mauriques</hi> have the Character of Formidable, the
<hi>Toletan's</hi> Severe and Grave. The same is Visible in
Artificers, when any of a family have attained an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
they easily transmit it to their Children, the
Spectatours of their Art and to whom they leave their
Works and Monuments of their Labour. To all this may
be added, that Flattery mixt with Errour sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
in a Boy for Vertue what by no means deserves
that name, as Lewdness, Ostentation, Insolence, Anger,
Revenge and other Vices of the like nature; some men
erroneously perswading themselves that they are tokens
of a great Spirit; which withall induces 'em too eagerly
to pursue these, to the neglect of real Vertues: as a
Maid sometimes if she be commended for her free
Carriage or Confidence, applies her self to those rather
than Modesty and Honesty, the principal good Qualities
of that Sex. Tho' indeed young men ought to be driven
from all Vices in general, yet more especially from
those which tend to Laziness or Hatred they being

'tis as impossible to form a good Prince in an ill
Court, as to draw a straight Line by a Crooked
square: there's not a wall there which some lascivious
hand has not sullied; not a Corner but Echoes their
dissolute Course of Life: all that frequent the Court
are so many Masters and as it were Ideas of the
Prince, for by long use and Conversation each imprint
something on him which may either be to his benefit
or prejudice; and the more apt his Nature is to Learn,
the sooner and more easily he imbibes those domestick
Customs. I dare affirm that a Prince will be good
if his Ministers are so; bad if they be bad: an instance
of this we have in the Emperor <hi>Galba,</hi> who when he
light upon good Friends and Gentlemen, was governed

                     <p>After the Vices of the Court have been (as far as
possible) thus corrected, and the Princes humour and
inclinations well known, let his Master or Tutor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to lead him to some great undertaking, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Mind Seeds of Vertue and honour so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that when they are grown it will be difficult to
judge whether they were the product of Nature or
Art. Let them incourage Vertue with Honour, brand
Vice with Infamy and Disgrace, excite Emulation
by Example; these things have a great Effect upon
all Tempers, tho' more on some than others. Those who
are of a Generous disposition, Glory influences most;
the Melancholy, Ignominy; the Cholerick, Emulation,
the Inconstant, Fear; the Prudent, Example; which
is generally of most efficacy with all, especially that of
Ancestors; for often what the Blood could not, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
does perform. 'Tis with Children as young trees
on which you must Graff a branch (as I may say)
of the same Father, to bring them to perfection. These
Grafts are the famous examples which infuse into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
the Vertues of their Ancestors and bear excellent
fruit. That therefore it may be conveighed as it were
thro' all the Senses into the mind, and take deep Root
there, should be the particular industry of his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and consequently they are not to be proposed
to the Prince in ordinary Exhortations only or Reproofs,
but also in sensible objects. Sometime let History put
him in mind of the great Atchievements of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
the glory of which eternized in print may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him to imitate them. Sometimes Musick (that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56556:20"/>
sweet and wonderfull Governess of the passions) play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Trophies and Triumphs, will be proper to
Raise his Spirits. Sometimes let him hear Panegyricks
recited upon their Life, to encourage and animate him
to an Emulation of their Vertues, now and then reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them himself, or with his young Companions Act
over their Exploits as upon a stage, thereby to inflame
his mind: for the force and efficacy of the action is
by degrees so imprinted on him that he appears the
very same whose person he represents: Lastly let him
play the part of a King amongst them, receive peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
give audience, ordain; punish, reward, command
or marshal an Army, besiege Cities and give Battel.
In experiments of this nature <hi>Cyrus</hi> was educated from
a little Boy and became afterwards an eminent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
But if there be any inclinations unbecoming
a Prince discernible in his Infancy, he should have the
Company of such as are eminent for the opposite Vertues
to correct the Vices of his Nature; as we see a straight
Pole does the Crookedness of a tender Tree tyed to it.
Thus if the Prince be covetous, let one naturally liberal
be always at his Elbow; if a Coward, one bold and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
if timorous, one resolute and active; if Idle and
Lazy, one diligent and industrious: for those of that
Age as they imitate what they see or hear, so they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
easily copy their Companions Customs. To
Conclude, in Education of Princes too rough Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
and Chastisement is to be avoided as a kind
of Contempt. Too much Rigour makes men mean spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited;
nor is it fit, that he should be servilely subject to
One Man, who ought to Command all. It was well

that men of generous Spirits usually conceive a
secret horrour of those things they learnt thro' fear;
on the contrary have an inclination and desire to try
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56556:21"/>
those Vices which in their Childhood were prohibited
them. Affections too much confined (especially such
as nature endows a Prince withall) break out at last
into Despair, as Exhalations hard bound within the
Clouds, into Lightning. He that imprudently shuts the
gates upon natural inclinations, is the occasion of their
attempting to get thro' the Windows. Some allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is to be made to humane infirmity, which is by

The advantage or disadvantage of this different Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was visible in the Two Kings, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second,
and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, one of which had his at
Court, the other in the Camp; that among Women,
this among Soldiers; that entring his Government seem'd

but knew how to Rule even in another's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and force Subjects to their Duty; that was
contemn'd, this honoured and esteemed by all; that
ruined his Kingdom, this advanced to a Monarchy.
'Twas upon this consideration that King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named

that they might accustom themselves to War; gain
the Soldiers hearts; be free from the Debauchery of the

Pride and Ostentation of Beauty easily discompose the
Modesty of Vertue; a Prince therefore should not
esteem feminine and affected Charms, which serve only
to inflame another's Lust; but those which usually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

if he were eminent for both. Thus the Palm is
singularly commended, as well for the neatness of its
Trunck and Leaves, as for the pleasant Fruit it bears, and
other excellent qualities of it, being a Tree so usefull,
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> says the <hi>Babylonians</hi> reckoned 360 Vertues
in it; these, I conceive, the Complement of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial

Tree</hi>
                        <note n="9" place="bottom">Cant. 7. 7.</note>. For by these words he would commend not
only the beauty of his Spouse's Body, but the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
also of her Soul, signified by the Palm as 'tis an
Emblem of Justice and Fortitude: of Justice because its
leaves hang in aequilibrio; of Fortitude upon the account
of the admirable strength of the Boughs, which the more
weight they are loaded with, the more forcibly grow
up. 'Tis further an Hieroglyphick of Victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the Games and Exercises of the Ancients,
the Victors were crowned with Branches of it. The
Cypress was never esteemed at this Rate, however
flourishing and green it always is, lifting its self even
up to heaven in form of an Obelisk: for that its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is meer outside without any good quality inherent
in it; it's of a slow growth, bears useless fruit, bitter
leaves, has a strong smell and taste, a thick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
shade. To what purpose is a Prince of a
delicate Body, if he only satisfies the Eyes, and does
not discharge his Duty. There needs no more in him
than an agreeable harmony of parts to shew a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and well disposed mind, into which afterwards
Art and Industry may inspire Motion and Vigour, for
without that every Action of a Prince will be dull,
and rather cause Ridicule and Contempt than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Authority with his Subjects. But sometimes these
extraordinary Endowments of the Mind don't render a
Prince amiable, as when the State is distempered and
inclined to Change its Government, which <hi>Ferdinand</hi>

Vertue her self is unhappy, and a good Prince

But tho' Prudence may have some efforts from Nature,
yet tis to be perfected by Learning; for to know well
how to chose whats good, and reject the contrary, a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56556:26"/>
general knowledge is almost necessary, and a long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Examples both past and present, which is
not perfectly to be attained without labour and study;
nothing therefore is so necessary to a Prince as the Light
and Ornament of good Literature; <hi>For for want of the
knowledge of these things</hi> (says K. <hi>Alphonso) a Prince will
be oblig'd to take to his assistance, one who does understand
them; and he may experience what King</hi> Solomon <hi>said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of himself, which is infinitely requisite in a Prince.</hi> For
the Office of a King requires a great understanding
and that too illustrated with Learning, <hi>for without doubt,</hi>
says K. <hi>Alphonso</hi> in the same Law, <hi>no man can acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of an Office of such importance as this, at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great understanding and wisdom,</hi> whence he who
scorns the favours of Knowledge and Education, will

A Mind too intent upon Speculation is usually slow in
Action, and fearful in Resolution, for of necessity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
different and contrary Reasons must occur to such
a Person, which either wholly take away or obstruct
the liberty of his Judgment. If an Eye looks upon
Objects by the Sun's Light reflected, it clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
sees them as they are; whereas if it be fixed
directly against the Sun's Rays, 'tis so dazled with
too much lustre, that it can't so much as distinguish the
Colours and Figures of them. It happens thus to Wits;
those who too eagerly apply themselves to the Studies
of Wisdom and Learning are less fit for publick busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

History is like a faithful Counsellor, always ready and

which relates to Government, turning over such Laws

defend it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly Judicial Astrology has been the ruine of
many Princes; for that desire of knowing future events
is in all Men vehement, especially in Princes, for they

                     <p>THE Sciences have bitter Roots, though the Fruit be
sweet; for this reason our Nature at first has an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
for them, and no labour appears so harsh as what
must be employed on their first Rudiments: What Pains
and Anxiety do they cost Youth? Upon which account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and because Studies require assiduous Application, a
thing very injurious to Health, and which the Business
and Diversions of the Court don't permit; the Master
should be industrious in inventing several means to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
this troublesome Institution by disguising it under
some pleasant Game, that the Prince's mind may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
what he is to learn insensibly. For instance, to
teach him to read he may use this contrivance; let
there be made four and twenty small Dice, on each of
them be engraven a Letter of the Alphabet, then let
some Children play, and he win who at one Cast
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56556:29"/>
throws most Syllables, or an entire Word. These lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Victories and Entertainments will take off much of
the difficulty of this Task, for 'tis far more hard to play
at Cards, which, however Children presently learn.
Now, to teach the Prince to Write in a way as short,
I would have the Letters engraven of a thin Plate, this
put upon Paper, and him to go over these Tracts of
Characters, as so many little Furrows, with his Hand
and Pen; especially exercising himself in those Letters
of which the rest are framed. Thus, while he Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to his own Wit and Industry, what is only the
effect of this artificial Plate, he will by degrees be more
pleased with those Labours. Nor is skill in Languages
less necessary for a Prince; for always to use an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
or read only Transactions, is a thing too liable
to deceit, or at least the truth thereby loses much of
its Force and Energy: Not to mention that it can't but
be very hard for a Subject not to be understood by him,
from whom he is to expect Comfort in his Afflictions,
to have his Miseries relieved, and to be gratified for
his Services. This moved the Patriarch <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when
he was made Commander over <hi>Egypt;</hi> before all things
to apply himself to learn the Languages most in use
there, and which he did not understand<note n="1" place="bottom">Psa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

able to answer every one in his own Native Idiom;
but a Prince is not to be instructed in this by way of
Precepts, for they confound the Memory; but rather
great Persons Sons of Foreign Countries should be taken
into his Family, by whose familiar Conversation he
may in a few Months time, and that with a little Pains,
and as it were by way of Diversion, make so great a
Proficiency, as to be acquainted with the Language of
each of them.</p>
                     <p>That he may also know the use of <hi>Geography</hi> and <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography,</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56556:30"/>
it were not amiss to furnish and hang his Chamber
with Tapistry so artificial wrought, as to represent a
kind of General Description or Map of the Universe,
that is, the Four Quarters of the World, and most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Countries, together with the more celebrated
Rivers, Mountains, Cities, and other place of Note.
By the same contrivance may the Lakes be disposed,
that he may fancy he sees in them, as in your Sea-Charts,
the Situation of the whole Sea, its Ports and Islands.
In Globes and Mathematical Spheres, he may see the
Extent of both Hemispheres, the Motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the Sun's Course, its Rising and Setting, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude
of Days and Nights, and all this by way of
Discourse and Divertisement, leaving the Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
subtle way of arguing and demonstrating to the
Schools. It will suffice in <hi>Geometry,</hi> if he know how to
Measure distances, take Altitudes and Depths with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.
'Tis withal necessary that he learn Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and accordingly for Instructions sake may raise
Forts of Clay, or some such material, with all sorts of
Trenches, Breast-works, Pallisadoes, Bastions, Half
Moons, and other things necessary for the Defence of
them; then he may Assault and play upon them with
little Artillery made for that purpose. But to fix those
Figures of Fortification more firmly in his Memory,
'twould be for his advantage to have the like artificially
contrived in Gardens, cut in Myrtle, or any other
Greens, as you see in the present Emblem.</p>

The Sciences should possess the Center of the
Soul; gentile Learning be instead of a circumference; the
knowledge of one, without the Ornaments of the other,
is a kind of ignorance; for 'tis with the several parts of
Learning, as with the Nine Muses, who joyning hands,
make a Circle in their Dances. How tiresome a thing
is Philosophy if too severe, and not qualified, and made
agreeable by Polite Literature and Humanity? These
are therefore necessary for a Prince to temper the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Government with their pleasantness; for 'tis from
that they have the name of Humane. A Prince should not
be altogether singular, but have something common to
the rest of Mankind; he should discourse with them of
different sorts of Studies, and that with a courteous and
obliging Carriage; 'tis not Royal Grandeur which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds

be deckt and embellished with the Liberal Arts, which

with a Fiddle-stick or a Pencil; which we still look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be a greater fault, if the Prince be of an Age,
wherein one would think the care of the Publick ought
to take him off these private Pastimes: It being our
Nature not to accuse a Prince of loss of time, if he's
idle or does nothing, but rather blame him for spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at these Diversions. The other Caution is, that
he lay not out too much time upon them, or be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

As for Poetry, though it be a part of Musick, Accents
and Rhimes having the same effect in that, as Notes in
in this; though that be the far nobler Exercise of the
two; for this is of the Hands, that of the Brain. The
one designed meerly to divert, the other to instruct with
Diversion; notwithstanding it seems by no means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for a Prince; it's strange Sweetness being a great
obstacle to Masculine and Noble Actions; for when
the Mind is once captivated with the Charms of its
Thoughts and Conceptions, as the Nightingal with the
Melody of her Voice, it never leaves of, and grows so
keen with Poetical Niceties, that its Edge is soon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Hence it also follows, That if a Prince takes not the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56556:33"/>
same delight in Ruling as Composing, he will in all
probability least regard this greatest concern, wholly
neglect or abandon it to the care of others; as did
<hi>John</hi> II. King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who squandered away his
time in the Study of Poetry, and sent for Persons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for it from the remotest Countries, till his Subjects
tired with his Negligence, put a stop to this useless Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of his by an open Rebellion. Nevertheless,
since Poetry is so much in Vogue at Courts, and does
much refine and polish the Mind, a Prince will hardly
escape the Charge of Ignorance, if he have not some
smattering in't. He may therefore be allow'd some
time for that Study, I mean as much as shall be thought
fit to quicken his Parts, and improve his Judgment;
for how many excellent Poems have by this means
come from the Pens of such as have govern'd in Church
and State, with general Applause and Approbation?
There are abundance of Princes given to the practice of
Chymistry, which is indeed a very noble Diversion,
and discovers many wonderful Effects and Secrets of
Nature; but for all this, I would advise a Prince not to
meddle with it<note n="11" place="bottom">Be not curious in unnecessary matters; for more things are shewed unto thee, than men understand. <hi>Eccl</hi> 3. 24.</note>, for Curiosity will easily lead him
from thence to Alchymy; or at least, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Simple Distillation, he will have a fancy to six
Mercury, and make Gold and Silver; things which the
most precious of our time is thrown away upon to no
purpose, and certain, wasted for uncertain Treasures.

                     <p>THE Affections are born with us; Reason comes
not till many Years after, when they are already
possess'd of the Will, and this deluded with a false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of good submits to them, and owns no other
Empire but theirs, till Reason recovering strength by
Time and Experience, takes upon it the Right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it had by Nature, and begins to make Head
against the Tyranny of our Appetites. This Light usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
rises later in Princes, because the Delicacies of the
Court which they're used to, render their Affections
more prevailing; besides, that their Courtiers strive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to get their Favour, which they know, rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Will than Reason; hence all use the
art of Flattery, and make it their business to engage
that, but cast a Cloud on this. A Prince ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be well acquainted with these Arti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56556:34"/>
arm himself not against his own Passions only, but
all such Persons as would abuse them to govern him.
This is a great and general Negligence in those who
undertake to form Princes Minds. Useless and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Weeds which grow among Corn, we spend time in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>adicating; yet suffer vicious Passions and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that wage War with Reason, to grow. To cure a
Prince's Body, many <hi>Galens</hi> are always ready, the Mind
often has scarce one <hi>Epictetus;</hi> though this is subject to
no less Infirmities than the Body, and those so much
worse, as that is more excellent than this. If its counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
were visible, and we could discover in it its ill and
distempered Affections, we should pity the Condition
of many, we at present take for happy Men, whom
that feverish Heat of depraved Appetites so miserably
preys upon. If the Hearts of Tyrants could be opened,
one might see Bruises and Wounds<note n="1" place="bottom">Si recludantur tyrannorum mentes, posse aspici laniatus, &amp; ictus, quando, ut corpora verberibus, ita saevitia, libidine, malis consultis animus dilaceretur. <hi>Tac. 6. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. Alas! What
Tempests of Confusion and Distraction is a Mind in
that Condition rack'd with? Its Light is all obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his Reason so disturbed, that all things appear to
him far different from what they really in themselves
are. Hence proceeds that variety of Judgments and
Opinions in the World; hence few weigh things aright,
but pass a different estimate according to the light by
which they see them. For 'tis with the Affections, as
with Tellescopes, which at one end magnify, at the
other diminish Objects. The Crystals are the same, the
Objects nothing alter'd; this only is the difference, that
the visual Rays falling in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Center to the Circumference, and consequently
diffuse themselves and multiply more; whereas at
the other end they are contracted from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Center, and so represent Objects consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
less: Such is the difference between these two
ways of looking upon things. At the same time (tho'

Son of <hi>Dionysio,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had in view the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of their Fathers Crown. But see in how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
a manner, the first against his Father's Will refused
to accept; the other contrary to the Laws of Piety, by
force of Arms attempted to snatch it from the Head of
his. One considering the vast Cares and Dangers of
Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bid adieu to the World, and preferr'd a
Monastick Life as the more quiet and happy; the other
look'd upon Life without Sovereignty to be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and unprofitable, and had more respect to his
Ambition than the Law of Nature. This look'd upon
the Circumference of the Crown which border'd with
Flowers, was an agreeable sight; that consider'd rather
the Point and Center of it, whence the Lines of Labour
and Care are drawn. All Men propose something
that has the appearance of good, as the end of their
Actions<note n="2" place="bottom">Omnia namque ejus, quod speciem boni praefert gratiâ omnes agunt. <hi>Arist. Pol. 1. Cap.</hi> 8.</note>; but because we are deceived in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this Good, hence proceeds our Error. The
greatest thing imaginable when in our own Power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
little and inconsiderable, in others great and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.
Our own Faults we are not sensible of, those
of others we easily discover. Other Mens defects seem
like Giants, ours scarce so big as Dwarfs. Nay, further,
we know how to new-name Vices, and give them the
Colour of Virtue: Ambition we call greatness of Mind;
Cruelty, Justice; Prodigality, Liberality; Rashness,
Valour. In short, few can with Prudence distinguish
Honesty from its contrary, what's profitable from the
prejudicial<note n="3" place="bottom">Pauci prudentia, honesta à deterior<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. 'Tis thus, we are deceived when we
look on things by that end of the Prospective, which
Passions and Inclinations stop. I know nothing but
Benefits that are to be looked upon through both ends;
those we receive, ought to appear great to us; those
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56556:35"/>
we confer, little. This was King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's
Custom; nay, he seldom so much as remembred Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
he had done others; on the contrary, those he
had received, he never let slip out of his Memory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always careful the first opportunity to repay them
as a Debt. A Prince ought not to imagine that a
Courtesy is, as it were, a Mark of Slavery on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
gratified: I should not call that Generosity but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
rather, and a kind of Traffick for Mens Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which the Prince buys at the price of Favours,
as they do Slaves for Money on the Coasts of <hi>Guinea.</hi>
He who does a good Office should not think he lays
an Obligation; he who receives it ought to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
obliged. In a word, A Prince should imitate God
Almighty, <hi>who giveth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth
not</hi>
                        <note n="4" place="bottom">James 1. 5.</note>. In undertaking and carrying on Wars; in
procuring and establishing Peace; in Injuries as well
offered as received, let him always use the same Crystal
of right Reason, through which he may see every
thing equally without disguise or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>allacy. That Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Justice in giving a due Estimate of things,
becomes none more than a Prince, who ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same Office in his Kingdom, as the Tongue
of a Balance in a pair of Scales, and agreeable thereto
pass a true and sincere Judgment of all things, that his
Government may be just, whose Balance will never
hang even, if the Passions have place, or all things be
not weighed in the Scale of right Reason. Upon this
account Masters ought to come with singular Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
and Industry to instruct the Prince's Mind, discovering
those Errors of the Will, and the Vanity of its Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that free and disengaged from Passion, he may
pass an unprejudiced Judgment on every thing. For,
really if we throughly examine the fall of so many
Empires, so many Revolutions in States, such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Kings and Princes deposed and murthered, we
shall find the first Origin of these misfortunes to have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56556:36"/>
been, the Passions having shaken off their Obedience,
and their refusal to submit to Reason, whose Subjects
they are by the Law of Nature. Nor is any thing
more pestilent to a Commonwealth than those irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Appetites, or the particular Ends which every one,
as he pleases, purposes to himself. I don't hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have these Passions wholly razed or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in a Prince, for without them he would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
incapable of any generous Action; Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not furnished us with Love, Anger, Hope, Fear,
and other the like Affections to no purpose; for though
these are not Virtues, they are however their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and means, without which they are neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
nor practicable. 'Tis the abuse only, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy
of them, I disapprove of; those are to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
that a Prince's Actions be not guided by Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but his whole Government by Prudence and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.
Those things which are common to other Men,
are not allowable in a Prince<note n="5" place="bottom">Regum est ita vivere, ut non modo homini sed ne cupiditati qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem serviant. <hi>M. Tull. in Orat. Syll.</hi>
                        </note>. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, if
at any time he would indulge Anger or Indignation,
did it in private and remote from Company, not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
when he represented the Person and Majesty of
an Emperor; for in this Capacity, a Prince is rather
the Idea of a Governor than a Man, and rather his
Peoples than his own Man. Nothing is then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
out of Affection, but all things examined by
the Rule and Standard of Reason; not by his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but Art. A Prince's Behaviour should be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Political than Natural; his designs proceed rather
from the Heart of the Commonwealth than his own.
Private Persons usually make their own Interest and
Advantage the Measure of their Actions: Princes are to
have the Publick Good in view. In a private Man to
conceal his Passions, is look'd upon to be a sign of too
close and reserv'd a Temper; in Princes even Policy
sometimes require it. There appeared not the least

                        </note> of this Art, whose Mind it was not easy to
discover; he knew so well how to mingle the Symptoms
of his Anger and Satisfaction. A good Prince commands
himself, and serves his People; but if he neglect to
break, or conceal the natural Tendency of his Mind,
his Actions will be always uniform, whence every one
will presently see the Scope of his Designs, contrary to
one of the principal Maxims of Policy; which for this
very reason recommends variety of Methods in Acting,
that the Prince's Designs may not be known. Nor is
it by any means safe for him to let others discover his
Nature and Inclinations. For there's no easier access
to his Mind than that, which 'tis necessary he keep free
and reserved, if he desire to have his Kingdom well-governed.
For as soon as his Ministers have once disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his Inclination, immediately they flatter him, and
encourage the same in themselves. If in any thing the
Prince be obstinate and opinionative, they are so too,
and now nothing but perversness governs. But if it shall
be at any time the Prince's Interest to court the Peoples
Favour and Applause, let him rather so behave himself,
that what the People like or dislike, he may seem to
have a natural Inclination or Aversion for. <hi>Aristotle</hi>
puts Bashfulness in the number of the Passions, denies it
to be a Moral Virtue, because a fear of Infamy, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56556:37"/>
therefore seems incompatible with a great Man, whose
Actions being all squar'd by the Rule of right Reason,
he has nothing to be ashamed of. According to St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
however 'tis a Virtue which regulates our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<note n="10" place="bottom">Pulchra virtus est verecundia, &amp; suavis gratia, quae non solum in factis, sed etiam in ipsis spectatur sermonibus, ne modum praetergrediaris lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and liberal Shame, or rather Modesty, which like
a Bridle restrains us from the Commission of any igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
or unseemly Action, and is a token of a good
Genius, and no small argument that there remain in
that mind some Seeds of Virtue, though not yet deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted. I am apt to believe <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vitious and irregular Bashfulness, which is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
to Virtue; we may say of both, as of Dew, which
falling moderately nourishes and refreshes Corn; but
when thick like small Snow, burns up and kills it. No
Virtue can be freely exercised, when this Passion has
once prevailed, nor is any thing more Pernicious to
Princes, for this reason above all, that it has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Virtue, as if it were in a Prince a sign of
Candor, (and not rather of a mean and abject Spirit)
not to be able to deny, contradict, reprehend, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
without a Blush. Such as these straiten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too much in their Grandeur, are in a manner
afraid of Shadows; and what is worse, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Slaves to those they ought to govern. Besides,
how unbecoming is it to see in their Faces the colour
of Shame, which none but Flatterers, Liars, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
all profligate Persons ought to be stained with,
and for them so to forget themselves as to be governed
and cozen'd by others. Whatever is asked, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
offer, and give without any respect to Merit,
vanquished meerly by Petitions. They readily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to others Counsels and Opinions, though they
don't approve them, and had rather seem Conquer'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56556:37"/>
than Victors; which is the foundation of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Miscarriages in a Commonwealth; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedness
by no means becomes Princes, who should
always appear with a serene and steady Aspect<note n="11" place="bottom">Quorundam parum idonea est verecundia rebus civilibus, quae firmam frontem desiderant. <hi>Seneca.</hi>
                        </note>.
Princes therefore should make it their whole business to
correct this Passion, and moderate their natural Bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
with Valour and Constancy, with a Resolution
not only of Mind, but outward Demeanour to resist
Flatteries, Lyes, Frauds, and Malice, that they may
correct and amend them, and preserve a Royal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
in their Words as well as Actions. Which the
Two Kings, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,
having neglected to do; what wonder if their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Crowns were brought into such dangers? Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in curing this Passion, no small Discretion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
for whereas other Vices, like Thorns, are to be
utterly extirpated, this is rather to be pruned, and the
superfluity cut off; that part of Shame left which
guards Virtues, and regulates Mens Manners and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for without this restraint, the Prince's Mind will
be quite unruly; and except he now and then reflects
upon Infamy and Indecency, he will follow the force
of his Passions, and precipitate himself; especially
when there's Power to countenance them. If by good
Arts modesty is scarce to be preserved, what will be
the consequence if we wholly abandon that<note n="12" place="bottom">Vix artibus honestis retinetur pudor. <hi>Tac. 14. Ann.</hi>

for when it has once prevailed in the Mind, neither
Reason nor Justice perform their Offices. For out of
an extravagant fear of disobliging any by Reprehension
or Correction, they neglect to apply Remedies to
their Subjects Crimes, and suffer many to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
They are deaf to the Peoples Clamours, nor
do Publick Calamities affect them, while at the same
time they are sensibly touch'd with pity for three or
four Men who were the Promoters of them. They feel
themselves disordered at other Mens Crimes; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
for fear of any trouble upon their account,
chuse to connive at, or pardon, rather than punish
them. This is a weakness of Judgment, and defect of
Prudence, to be remedied with time; but that with the
same Moderation as we mentioned of Bashfulness, that
part only of Commiseration is to be retrenched which
so enfeebles the Mind, that it can't act with Vigour
and Constancy. Reserving that compassionate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

these Passions, as well that of Bashfulness, as Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration,
are corrigible, and to be subdued by some
contrary Actions, which may remove that too great
tenderness and imbecillity of Mind, and delivering it
from those servile Fears, render it capable of more mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Actions. If a Prince now and then endeavours
(though in matters of the least consequence) to keep
his Mind firm and resolute, and considers his Power
and Quality, he will easily afterwards be able to do
the same in Affairs of greater moment. All's done, if
he can but once acquit himself generously in it, and
make himself fear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d and respected. There remain two
other Passions considerably prejudicial to Youth; Fear
and Obstinacy. Fear, when a Prince is so timorous,
and in all things diffident of himself, that he dares nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
act nor speak. Never approves any Action of his
own <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ears to appear in publick, and Love's rather solitude
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56556:38"/>
and retirement. This proceeds generally from an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and retired Education; as also for want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
the only Remedy for this Distemper; that
is, the Prince should use himself to give Audience to
his Subjects as well as Foreigners; often appear in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
that he may learn to know Men, and in general
all other things as in themselves they are, not as his
Imagination, or Master has painted them. Let there be
always free access to his Apartments for those worthy
Persons, that are his Father's Chamberlains, and all
other Courtiers that are eminent for Valour, Ingenuity,
and Experience. Which Custom was observed in <hi>Spain</hi>
till the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who cautious of his
Son <hi>Charles</hi>'s underhand-dealings, abolished that Custom
of free Access and Communication, and so declining
one Inconvenience, fell into another equally danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Princes, for so is it to be too much abstracted
from Conversation; for this usually prompts them to
rely too much upon some particular Favourite.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Obstinacy arises partly from Fear, partly
from natural Slothfulness, when a Prince won't Act at
all, but resolutely rejects all Instructions that are given
him. That Coldness of Mind is to be cured by the Fire
of Glory and Incentives to it, as faults in Horses are
usually corrected by the Spur. The Prince therefore is
to be led gradually into the way, and the Progress he
makes to be commended; though at first those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
be above his merit, and only for forms
sake.</p>

'Tis not this fickle pettish Passion obtains Victories, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over Enemies, nor is that really Courage that is
without Reason provoked. In a word, no Vice is more
unbecoming a Prince, than that; for to be angry,
supposes contempt, or an injury received; nor is any
thing so disagreable to his Place and Office, in as much
as nothing so obscures the Judgment which should in a
Governor be serene and clear. A Prince that is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperated,
and passionate upon any slight occasion, gives
his Heart into the Hands of the Person who provokes
him, and is subject to his pleasure. If not a wrinkle in
a King's Coat can be disordered without offence, what
will it be if he suffer any one to disturb his Mind?
Anger is a kind of Moth which Purple breeds and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
Pomp engenders Pride; Pride, Passion; and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
is as it were a Propriety of Power. The Sense
of Princes is something too delicate a Looking Glass
which the least breath sullies, a Heaven that with the
least Vapour is clouded and breaks out into Thunder.
A Vice that generally seizes great and generous Spirits;
as the Sea, however vast and powerful, is with the least
blast of Wind raised into horrid Disorders and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,
with this only difference, that they are of much
longer continuance in Princes Minds than in the Sea;
especially if their Honour be concerned, which they
imagine 'tis impossible to retrieve without Revenge.
What a trifling piece of incivility was that, <hi>Sancho,</hi>
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> put upon <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the Third, after
the Battel of <hi>Arcos,</hi> in returning without taking leave of
him? Which however this so highly resented, that he
could never forget it, or rest till he had got him out of
his Kingdom. The Anger of Princes is like Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which no sooner takes Fire, but has its effect;
the Holy Spirit calls it the Messenger of Death<note n="3" place="bottom">The W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and barely on this account 'twere sufficiently reasonable
to curb and restrain it. 'Tis very indecent for one in
Authority to submit to this Passion. Let Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56556:40"/>
that nothing is put in their Hands for a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with which they can hurt. And if sometimes a
naked Sword is carried before Kings, 'tis in token of
Justice not Revenge; and then 'tis carried in another's
hand to intimate that between Anger and Execution
there ought to intercede a Command. The publick
Safety depends on Princes, which will easily be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if they hearken to so rash a Counsellor, as Anger.
Who can escape its hands? For 'tis like a Thunder-bolt
when it comes from Supreme Power. <hi>And because,</hi>
says King <hi>Alphonso, Anger is stronger in a King, and more
dangerous than in others; in that he can more readily satisfy
it, he ought to be more prepar'd to curb and correct it</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">L. 10. tit. p 2.</note>.
If Princes in a Passion could look upon themselves,
they would find a Countenance unbecoming such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
whose Tranquility and agreeable Harmony, both
of Words and Actions, ought to please rather than terrify,
to acquire Love rather than Fear. A Prince therefore
should quench the Heat and Violence of Anger; if he
can't do so, at least to defer the Fury and Execution of it
for some time: For as the same King <hi>Alphonso</hi> has said,
<hi>A King ought to keep in his Anger till it is over, this will
be of great advantage to him, for so he will be able to judge
truly, and act justly in all things</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">L. tit. 5 p. 2.</note>. The Emperor <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
experienced this in himself; and for this reason
enacted a Law, That Capital Punishments should not
be executed till thirty Days after Sentence passed. Which
<hi>Tiberius</hi> had before him decreed, though for only ten
Days, and without giving the Senate power to revoke
the Sentence once pronounced<note n="4" place="bottom">Idque vitae spatium damnatis prorogaretur, sed non senatui libertas ad poenitendum erat. <hi>Tac. 3. Ann.</hi>

to mature Deliberation; there is no better Antidote
against it than prudent Reflection; that the Prince be not

he had reason to think himself contemned, and highly
resented the Affront, yet would not be revenged till
he had first called a Council, and taken the Advice of

The Supreme
Authority and Power of Princes makes a part of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
so that they can't put up Affronts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
at all times.</p>
                     <p>That Anger too is praise-worthy in Princes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to a State, which kindled by Incentives of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
elevates the Mind to difficult and noble Enterprizes,
for without it nothing extraordinary, nothing great,
can be undertaken, much less perfected and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
That, that is it which nourishes the Heart of
generous Spirits, and raises it above its self to despise
Difficulties. The Academicks called it the Whetstone,
<hi>Plutarch</hi> the Companion of Virtue. But particularly,
in the beginning of his Reign, the Prince ought to lay
aside Anger, and forget past Injuries; as <hi>Sancho,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the Brave, did when the Succession of the
Crown of <hi>Castile</hi> fell to him. With Government, a
Prince changes as 'twere his Nature, why should he not
also his Affections and Passions? 'Twere an Abuse of
Government to take Revenge of one who already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
himself your Subject. Let the Person offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
think he has Satisfaction in having got Authority
over him, who before injured him. Fortune could not
give him a nobler kind of Revenge. So <hi>Lewis</hi> XII.
King of <hi>France,</hi> thought, and therefore when some
perswaded him to revenge the Injuries he had received,
while Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he made answer, <hi>That it did not
become the King of</hi> France <hi>to revenge the Quarrels of the
Duke of</hi> Orleans.</p>
                     <p>Particular Injuries done to his Person, not Dignity,
a Prince ought not to vindicate with his utmost Power;
for though they seem inseparable, yet 'tis convenient
to make some Distinction between them, least Majesty
become odious and too formidable. To this tended
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56556:42"/>
that of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he said, That if <hi>Piso</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no other Crime, but the rejoycing at <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>'s
Death, and his grief for it, he would revenge those
Injuries done him as a private Person, not as a Prince,
and in a publick Capacity<note n="15" place="bottom">Nam si legatus officii terminos, obsequium erga Imperatorem exuit, ejusdemque morte, &amp;c. luctu meo laetatus est, odero: seponamque <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. On the other side,
those done to his Dignity or Publick Station, he ought
not to vindicate as a private Person, so as in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
of Passion to think his Honour and Reputation
lost, except he have immediate Satisfaction, especially
when it were fitter to be deferred; for Anger should
not be a Motion of the Mind, but of the Publick Good
and Advantage. King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Catholick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
had this before him, when the King of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi>
refused to pay him Tribute, as his Ancestors had
done; and withal, insolently sent him word, that
they were long since dead; that in his Mints they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
not to Coin Silver or Gold, but Forge Swords
and Launces<note n="†" place="bottom">Marian. Hist. Hisp. lib. 24. cap. 16.</note>. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> concealed his Resentment
of this Liberty and Arrogance for a time, and
made a Truce with him, deferring Revenge till his
Affairs were more quiet and settled; in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
more the Publick Good, than his own Particular
Affections<note n="16" place="bottom">A Fool's wrath is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently known; but a prudent Man covereth shame. <hi>Lat. Vers. Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam dissimulat. Prov.</hi> 12. 16.</note>. Nor is it less prudent to dissemble
Anger, when one has reason to presume, that a time
will come when it will be for our disadvantage to have
shown it. For that reason, King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
though highly affronted by the Grandees of
his Kingdom; yet, when he abdicated that of <hi>Castile,</hi>
and retreated into <hi>Arragon,</hi> very discreetly concealed
that Indignation of Mind, took no notice of the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
he had received, but shewed himself friendly and
affectionate to all, as if he then foresaw he should be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56556:42"/>
sometime restored to his Kingdom, as indeed it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
happened. A generous Mind hides its Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Injuries, and strives not by the impetuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Anger, but rather by noble Actions to smother
them; the best certainly, and a truly heroical kind of
Revenge. When King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Holy, besieged
<hi>Sevil,</hi> a certain Nobleman reproached <hi>Garcias Perez
de Vargas</hi> for wearing a waved Shield, which was
not allowed his Family; he then pretended to take
no notice of the Affront, till the Siege of <hi>Triana,</hi>
where he fought with so much Valour, that he
brought his Shield back stuck with Darts, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his Rival, who was then in a secure Post,
and shewing him the Shield, <hi>You have reason,</hi> says he,
<hi>to think much that I wear this Shield, that expose it to
so many Dangers; without doubt no one deserves it beyond
your self, who would take so much care to preserve it.</hi>
Those ordinarily bear Affronts most patiently, who
are the least subject to give them; nor is it a less
Virtue to Conquer this Passion, than an Enemy.
To kindle a Prince's Anger is no less dangerous than
to set Fire to a Mine or Petard; and though it be
done in our own behalf, 'tis prudence to moderate it,
especially if against Persons in Power: for such An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
generally fall on the Author's own Head. This
was the reason the Moors of <hi>Toledo</hi> took so much
pains to pacify King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Sixth's Wrath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Archbishop of that place, and the Queen,
who had taken without his Order, their Mosque from
them. From which I draw two Precepts: One is,
that Ministers ought, when the Duty of their place
requires them, to tell the Prince of any thing that
may create Distast or Anger, to represent them in
the most softening terms imaginable<note n="17" place="bottom">Cuncta tamen ad Imperato<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

upon the Person who gave the first Information of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56556:43"/>
the thing, however Innocent he may be, however
good his Design was in doing it. The other is, That
they endeavour not only to moderate Princes Anger,
but cover and conceal it handsomely. Those Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims
(Ministers of Love) which stood above God in
<hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Vision, <hi>with two Wings covered his Face, and with
two covered his Feet</hi>
                        <note n="18" place="bottom">Isaiah 6. 1.</note>. Least his angry Countenance
should strike such as were guilty of any fault with such
Terror and Despair, that they would wish the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

cooled, but Princes are sorry and vexed to have had
any Witnesses of it, or Spectators of its Effect, for both
are equally disagreeable to the Dignity of a King. And
God himself for this reason turned <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife into a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

it attempt to bite his sharp pointed Club, but to make

All other Vices take their rise from some appearance of
Good, or from Pleasure; on the contrary this proceeds
from an inward Grief and Dissatisfaction at the good
of another. Other Vices their Punishment follows, this
it even preceeds. Envy sooner exerts its Fury upon its
own Bowels<note n="1" place="bottom">Envy is the rottenness of the Bones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 30.</note>, than on the Honour of its Neighbour.
'Tis the shadow of Virtue; he that would avoid that,

unworthy a generous Beast. Others envying us, shews
we excel them, but to be absolutely free from Envy is
a very ill sign. 'Tis assuredly better to endure it, than
be looked upon by all with indifferency. Envy is the
Sting of Virtue; as the Thorn preserves the Rose, so
does that Virtue. This would easily be neglected, were
there none malicious and detracting. Many has Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

higher till the envious Man's Eyes fail him, and he
lose sight of you. The Shadow of the Earth reaches
the Moon, that lowest of the Coelestial Orbs, so near
the Elements, and overcasts its Splendor; the higher
Planets it does not in the least injure: The force of
the Sun, when at height, scatters and dispels Clouds.
Where's great Inequality, there's no room for Envy,
and consequently this is the only remedy against it.
The more expeditiously a Man advances himself, the
less will he be exposed to Envy. No Smoak comes
from a Fire soon lighted. Whereas, while Merits wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
as it were, with one another, Envy grows and
takes up Arms against the Person preferr'd. Pride
and Superciliousness are things which in good Success
provoke Envy, and stir up hatred. On the other side,
Modesty quells it; for no one envies him as happy, who
looks not upon himself as such. For this reason, <hi>Saul</hi>
immediately after his being anointed King, betook
himself to his House; and to shew he was not exalted

They were however in my opinion in the wrong, for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56556:45"/>
this is rather to put the Sword in the Enemies hands,
and give further occasion to Envy; which when it
has once undertaken to persecute any one, never leaves
him, till it has driven him to the extremity of Misery.
The Sun casts no Shadows so long as 'tis in the Zenith;
but as it declines and comes nearer us, they proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
increase and grow longer. In the same manner
Envy pursues him with the greater force, who is near
ruin, or begins to fall; and as it generally lodges only
in mean spirited Persons, is always afraid he should
raise himself upon his Legs again. Even after <hi>Daniel</hi>
was thrown among the Lions, <hi>Darius</hi> thought him not
yet secure enough from those who envied him the
King's Favour; and so fearing more Mens Envy than
the Wild Beasts Cruelty, he sealed the Stone which was
laid upon the Lions Den with his own Signet, and
with the Signet of his Lords, that no mischief might
be done him<note n="9" place="bottom">That the purpose might not be chang'd concerning <hi>Daniel. Lat. Vers. Ne quid fieret contra Danielem,</hi> Dan. 6. 17.</note>. Sometimes to avoid Envy, and its

                     <p>Envy does not always gnaw lofty Cedars; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
she tires her Teeth, and bloodies her Lips with
the lowest Thorns, which Nature her self seems to have
in a manner hated. Insomuch as not to look on even
the Miseries and Calamities of others without Spite and
Indignation; whether it be, that her Malice is wholly
mad and unreasonable, or because she cannot endure
the Sufferer's strength of Mind and Constancy, or the
Fame Fortune's Injuries usually beget. There are to
be found in the Person of the present Author, many
things to make his Case deservedly deplorable; none,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56556:45"/>
or very few, to render him envied; nevertheless there
are some who envy him these continual Cares and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues,
though little acknowledged or requited. There
seems to be something of fatality in this Emulation
against him; it produc'd it self without any reason,
and often asperses him with things, he had by hear-say
from others, before he could have so much as imagined.
Notwithstanding his mind so full of Candor, and
mindful of his Duty, is so far from being disturbed at
these things, that he rather loves that Envy and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
perceiving it to awaken his Courage, and daily
excite it to make a further Progress.</p>
                     <p>Princes therefore, who are so far in Degree and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
superior to others, ought chiefly to endeavour to
despise Envy. He that has not Spirit enough for that,
how will he have enough to be a Prince? To go
to subdue it by kindness or rigour were plain Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

Obloquy and Detraction ought not to quench in a

his Enterprizes: Dogs bark at the Moon, but she
easily despises them, and proceeds in her Course. The
principal Art of Government is to be able to endure
Envy. Envy is not very prejudicial to Monarchies,
but rather generally enflames Virtue, and makes it more
illustrious; especially, if the Prince be Just and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and don<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

for the Publick Good, that even while under ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

for the Preservation and Welfare of his Country.</p>
                     <p>The most Sovereign Remedy against Envy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks,
is an Equality of all the Members of them, so
as that all Pomp and Ostentation be prohibited; for
nothing so excites Emulation as the Splendor and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Riches. This made the <hi>Romans</hi> take so much
care to regulate and reduce the superfluous Expences

                     <p>Envy in Princes is very unbecoming their Eminency

towards his Superiors, as because it must be but
a very inconsiderable Glory which can't shine without
obscuring others. The Pyramids of <hi>Egypt</hi> were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned

weakness to want that which we envy in others. But
nothing is more unworthy a Prince, than to envy the
Excellence and Prudence of his Ministers, for they are
in a manner Parts and Members of him; the Head
envies not the Feet for being so strong as to support
the Body, or the Arms, because they can labour; it
glories rather in being furnished with such Instruments

those who have to do with Princes, ought to be very
cautious, not to seem to enter into a Dispute with them
for Knowledge or Ingenuity; or if at any time they
are by some accident obliged to it, submit rather, and
voluntarily yield them the Victory; this being not only
Prudence, but Respect due to Princes. The Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
(those Spirits of Knowledge and Wisdom) which
stood before the Throne of God in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision,

Nobility be employed in Places that require Pomp and
Expence; the poorer sort in those by which they may

such as envies the Virtue and Merit of another, but

grieves to want them it self, and endeavours by all

this, I say, is commendable; nor is it to be reputed a
Vice, but a kind of spark of Virtue proceeding from

In short, nothing is so pernicious to Princes, nothing
more needs a Remedy. Nor is here connivance to be
admitted, but both are to be punished, as well he that
seems to be Innocent, as the Person in Fault. This
forgiving the occasion; that because he renounced not
his Right, and let slip an opportunity of managing
Affairs to advantage. Which Rigour, if it seems to
any one excessive, will be excused, by considering the
Emolument of the Publick Good, and of the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it will leave to Posterity. There's no great Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

ought to look upon the Duty he owes his Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his own Honour; let him demand Satisfaction
for the Injury received afterwards, and think he has
acquitted himself of his Duty to his Prince, in having
a little while put it up. Patience in such a Case, shews
extraordinary Courage; for a generous Mind ought

with his Beak to get off the little Bells that are

for their tingling shrill sound is like a Voice, which
with the least motion raised, presently calls the Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and so is the occasion that the poor Bird is brought
again to Confinement, how far soever it hid it self in
the thickest Woods. Alas! how many Men has the
noise of their Virtues, and brave Exploits, been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to? How many has Fame brought into Envy
and insupportable Slavery? Nor is great or good Fame

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56556:49"/>
his Days so unhappily in Prison, had his Valour been
conceal'd and unknown, or moderating his high Spirit,
he had been content with a fortune equal to that of
other <hi>Athenian</hi> Citizens. But the Reputation of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
increasing, and the Eyes of Envy being not
able to bear Fame's so bright Rays, this Republick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to mistrust what merited Esteem and Recompence;
they feared, forsooth, their own Necks might at length
be obliged to bear the Yoke he had put on that of their
Enemies; and dreaded more the future and uncertain
Danger of <hi>Miltiades</hi>'s Infidelity, than that present, and
far greater one which threatned them from those, who
openly designed the Ruin and Destruction of their
City. Suspicion never admits Reason into its Council, nor
does such fear stand to weigh the Importance of things,
or suffer Gratitude to get the better of it. That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
chose to let one, though the most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
of its Citizens lie in Prison and Infamy, rather
than all the rest should live in continual Jealousies.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> took the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> from
<hi>Sappho,</hi> under pretence, indeed, of administring the
Commonwealth at home; but the true Reason was,
that they could no longer suffer his Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Thus they banished his Successor, <hi>Hanno,</hi> who
was so eminent for his Navigations, only because he
had more Ingenuity and Industry than they thought
safe for a free People. He was the first Man they ever
saw stroke a Lion, and make it tame, and began to
apprehend he would at last subdue them, who had
vanquished the Savage Beasts. Thus Commonwealths
are used to recompence Services and great Actions. No
one of the Citizens takes himself in particular to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
or obliged by any good Office is done to the
Community; as to Offences and Suspicion, every one
thinks himself concerned. If any one's to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
very few give him their Votes; on the contrary,
to find a Man guilty all are zealous. He that is more
excellent than others, is thereby in danger; for his
Zeal for the Publick Good accuses their negligence;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56556:49"/>
his Prudence their Ignorance. Hence 'tis so dangerous
to be serviceable and obsequious to Princes; hence Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Industry become like Vices, odious. <hi>Sallust,</hi>
who had a Capacity fit for the most important business,
to avoid Envy, feigned himself to be idle and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
<note n="2" place="bottom">Cui vigor animi ingentibus negotiis par suberat, eo magis, ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiam amoliretur, somnum &amp; inertiam ostentabat. <hi>Tac. 5. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. But the worst of all is, that sometimes a
Prince is displeased at being awakened by a vigilant
Minister, whom he would rather have as careless as
himself. To remedy this, as there is an Hypocrisy
which counterfeits Virtues, and dissembles Vices; there
is need of another to conceal Valour and Excellency
of Mind, and to stop the mouth of Fame. 'Twas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
nothing but the fear of Envy made <hi>Agricola</hi>
so careful to hide his, that they who saw in him so
much Humility and Modesty, unless they had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

'tis the same thing absolutely whether the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be induced by Reason or by Force, constrained to
obey one only; for the first Tyranny, the juster 'tis,
the more dangerous and irresistible. This very thing
gave rise to the Ostracism, or Ten Years Banishment,
to which <hi>Aristides,</hi> among others, was condemned;
whose only Crime, was his having the Reputation of
a good and just Man. The Peoples Favour is a very

piece of great Prudence to know how to conceal ones
Fame, and consequently to beware of all Ostentation
of Wit, Valour, or Excellency, and cover all sublime
Thoughts, as they say, with Ashes; though I confess,
'tis difficult for a noble Mind to confine to the narrow
compass of its own Breast, a Flame that breaks out on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56556:50"/>
all sides, and daily requires new Fuel to increase it,
and make it shine with the greater Lustre. But this
we may be perswaded to by the Examples of these Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Heroes, who heretofore from the Dictatorship
returned to the Plough; and of those that after a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Entry into the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by Breaches,
because the Gates were not large enough; that after
the Conquest of whole Nations, have retreated to poor
despicable Cottages, whither afterwards the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
has come to find them out. Nor had that ever
brought them so soon into play again had it not seen
they were not ambitious of Honour; for that like a
Shadow flies him that pursues it, follows him that flies
it. His Fame and Reputation is greatest, who strives
to conceal it. <hi>Rubellius Plautus</hi> was thought to deserve
the Empire because he lived retired<note n="10" place="bottom">Omnium ore Rubellius Plautus celebratur, cui nobilitas per ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem ex Iuliâ familiâ, ipse placita majorum c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>; but 'tis not
so in Monarchies, where one ascends higher by having
begun to ascend. A Prince has Men of Courage and
Bravery in great esteem, Republicks fear them rather;
that animates them by Rewards and Presents, these
discourage them by Ingratitude: Nor is fear of their
Liberty always the reason of it, but 'tis also a pretence
to Cloak their Envy and Emulation under. If any one
be the Object of all Mens favour and applause, he is
usually suspected and envied; which rarely happens in
Princes, who don't easily envy their Subjects Glory;
but if they do any thing commendable, they attribute
it to themselves, as being the Execution of their Orders.
This has been observable in the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi>

to content, in a Community that care and trouble
ceases; for what it undertakes or does, is by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Counsel of all, and so every one is thought to be
concerned in it. And hence I imagine it comes to pass,
that Commonwealths (I mean not such as are in a
manner Kingly) are so unconstant and false in the
Observation of Treaties; for that only is just with
them, which seems to be for the Interest of their
Preservation, Grandeur, and the Liberty they so much
advance, in which they are extreamly Superstitious.
They imagine they worship true Liberty, and with
a servile Submission adore infinite tyrannical Idols.
Every one thinks he Commands, and all Obey; they
are all provided with an Antidote against the Poyson
of Monarchy, and the Sovereignty of many they
greedily and securely swallow; they fear nothing
more than the Tyranny of Foreigners, take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that at home. Liberty is talkt of every where,
found no where. All are possessed of it in Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

they have set up to Assert their Liberty, when there is
not one that really enjoys it in his Actions. They are all

You should use the Tongue as your Sword, that is,
not lay your self too open to your Adversary; he that
discloses his whole Mind, exposes himself to Danger.
Concise Discourses have the greatest Efficacy, and
leave most room for Reflection. Nothing's so like a
King, as to talk little, and hear much. Nor is it less
requisite for him to know how to be silent, than how
to speak. In this, Men are our Masters. In that, God

'Tis then only convenient to speak, when Silence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
either the Prince or Truth. Majesty by a Nod
only sufficiently explains its self. Silence well-timed,
is in Princes great Eloquence; and a grave and modest
Carriage are usually more significantly expressive of
one's Thoughts than Words themselves. But if one's
obliged to use these at any time, they ought to be
sincere, and with liberty in thinking becoming a
King.

Detraction has in it a great mixture of Envy and
Ostentation; it is always almost of an Inferior towards
his Superior, and consequently much below a Prince,
by whose Lips no Man's Honour ought to be brought
in question. If he sees Vices, he should punish them;
if other small Defects, correct or connive at them.</p>
                     <p>The praise of brave Actions and Services is a part of
their Reward; excites the Person commended to, as
it were an Emulation of himself, and is a Spur to
others. However, to commend all Subjects indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is not without danger. For the Judgment they
pass on them being various and uncertain, and that
Praise, a kind of definitive Sentence, time may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Prince's Honour will oblige him not to retract easily
what he has once approved. As well therefore for this

                     <p>THE Heart of Man, Nature, that skilful Architect,
has hid in the most retired part of the Breast;
however, least probably, seeing it self thus concealed,
and without Witnesses, it should do any thing against
the Law of Reason, she has withal given Man that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Colour or Fire of Blood, for Modesty to inflame
his Countenance withal, and accuse his Heart, if it
deviate from Honour in any thing, or think otherwise
than the Tongue speaks, both which ought always to
have the same Motion, and a mutual Agreement in all
things. But Malice by degrees effaces that Mark which
is used in Children to shew its self. Hence the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
well-knowing the importance of Truth for the
establishment of Society, and maintaining Commerce
in the Commonwealth; and desiring nothing more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56556:56"/>
than to preserve the shame of deserting it among Men,
hung about their Childrens Neck a Golden Heart,
(which they called <hi>Bulla</hi>) an Hieroglyphick, says <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonius,</hi>
invented by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to signify the Ingenuity
Men ought to profess in Conversation, and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
they should observe in Truth, wearing at their
Breast, a Heart uncovered, as it were, and open, the
Genuine Emblem of that Truth. And this we commonly
mean, when speaking of a Man of Veracity, we say
he carries his Heart in his Hands, or that he is open-hearted.
The same the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests signified by the
Sapphire they put upon their Princes Breasts, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
emblematically the same Truth; as their Ministers of
Justice also used to wear about them some Figure of it.
Nor should any one imagine, that for the Prince to be
so sincere, and professed a Lover of Truth, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
but give an occasion to Deceit and Cozenage; for
on the contrary, nothing is more effectual in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Cheats, and driving away Lyes, which never
dare look Truth in the face. The same Observation
I take that advice of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to allude to, never to
speak with one's Back towards the Sun; thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
that nothing ought to be uttered repugnant to
Truth; for a Liar can't bear the bright Rays of Truth,
signified by the Sun upon a double account, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Sun's Unity; as for that it disperses Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and drives away Shades, restoring to all things
their true Light and proper Colours, as the present Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
shews; where as soon as that Luminary is got
above the Horizon, the Obscurity of Night immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
flies, and the Nocturnal Birds retire to the Woods
dark Coverts, which in that's absence, and favoured
by the Silence of Night, use while others sleep, to seek
their Prey. What Confusion is the Owl in, if by
chance she comes into the Sun's presence? In that glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Light she Staggers to and fro, and is confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Splendor quite blinds her, and frustrates all
her Tricks. Can any one have so much Subtilty and
Craft, but they will presently fail him when he comes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56556:56"/>
before an ingenuous Prince, and one that is a particular
Friend to Sincerity and Truth<note n="1" place="bottom">Magni praesentia veri. <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                        </note>?</p>
                     <p>There's no force able to penetrate into the Designs
of a candid Mind, if that Candor want not some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
for Prudence. Is there any thing more open
and evident to the Eyes of the World, any thing more
resplendent, more opposed to Shadows and Darkness
than the Sun? Nevertheless, if any one will look sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
upon its Rays, he will discover I know not what
Abuses, as 'twere, and Obscurities of Light, which so
darken the Eyes, that what they saw, they can't tell.
Thus Knavery is blinded with the Light of Truth, and
its Foundations overturned, nor can it find any more a
way to delude with its Artifices. 'Tis a Victory truly
worthy a Prince, to conquer Frauds and Cheats with
Ingenuity, Lyes with Truth. To lye is a slavish Vice,
and consequently very unbecoming the generous Mind of
Princes, who above all Men should endeavour to render
themselves like God, who is Truth it self<note n="2" place="bottom">Excellent Speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not a Fool; much less do lying <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In great Empires all things have the worst Construction
put upon them, and are obnoxious to Reproaches.
What open Force can't do, Calumny by secret Mines
attempts, in which thing he that hath the Rule over
others, has need of great Courage, not to change his
Course, or suffer himself to be stopt by the Clamours
of Cavillers. This constancy and firmness of Mind
has always eminently appeared in the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi>
to whom it has been, in a manner, natural to despise
Envy and Calumny; by which means alone, many
Clouds of that Nature have been dispelled, which as
Majesty raises, so it also by the force of Truth dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates,
as the Sun's Heat does Vapours. What infamous
Libels, what manifest Falsities, what forg'd Stories,
what Calumnies have malicious Men often spread
against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy? Nor for all this, could
that Envy be able to cast the least Blemish upon its so
just Administration of the Kingdoms 'tis possessed of
in <hi>Europe,</hi> because that is open to the World, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all. Among other things, by new contriv'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and studied Lyes to render its Government odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so make the Rebellious Princes less desirous of
a Reconciliation: I know not what Author, under the
Name of the Bishop of <hi>Chapa,</hi> has published a Book,
wherein he gives a large Account of the Inhumane
and Barbarous Usage the <hi>Indians</hi> received from the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that those Lyes might have a more easy
Credit; the Book was first spread about in <hi>Spain,</hi> as
Printed at <hi>Sevil,</hi> afterwards Translated into other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
An ingenious Invention indeed, and accute
piece of malice, and of more consequence than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
can be believed, for upon some easy Minds it had
very ill Effect, though most of the more prudent so<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

soon discovered the Cheat; in as much as all those things
are abundantly confuted by the extraordinary Zeal
for Religion and Justice, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation always
with great Constancy exercises and maintains all over
the World, nor is it unlike its self in the <hi>Indies</hi> only.
I won't however deny, but at the first Invasion of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56556:57"/>
                        <hi>America,</hi> some things happened not altogether to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
but this was only by their fault, who thinking
this Known World too little for their vast Minds, had
the boldness by the Permission, rather than Command,
or Choice of their King to try their Fortune in other
Parts, and discover New Countries hitherto unknown,
where they found a barbarous People, Idolatrous to
Superstition, more Savage than Beasts, who brutally
lived on Man's Flesh, whose Inhumanity was incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
but by force and utmost rigour. But it was not
long before their Catholick Majesties provoided a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against these Disorders, for they sent to those
Coasts Commissaries to punish those severely they found
had been guilty; and to maintain entire Justice among
the <hi>Indians,</hi> they gave afterwards many Paternal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for their Preservation, of which it was none of
the least to exempt them from those severe Labours
they daily underwent in the Mines, and in other things
before the Discovery of those Countries. They sent
besides, Divines with great Zeal to teach them the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Christian Faith; founded Bishopricks at
their own Expences, and those of the Crown, and
maintained Religious Convents for the benefit of that
new planted Church, without suffering them from the
time those vast Countries fell into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands,
even in the absence of their new Masters, to want any
any thing which 'tis a King's Duty to supply his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
withal. In which the Government of this State,
and the Vigilance of its Ministers, may in a manner
seem to surpass that of the Sun it's self, of the Moon
and Stars, and the Influence they have over things
below; for but a few hours, in which the Sun's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
lightens one Hemisphere; the other is in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
while Malice cloaths and covers its self with the
Darkness of Night, and under the Mask, as it were, of
that Obscurity commits Murders, Robbe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and every thing that's ill, the Sun's providence not
being able to prevent them, though, indeed, even in the
Night he spreads some Twilight above the Horizon, or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56556:58"/>
in the interim leaves the performance of his Office to
the Moon as his Vicegerent, and the Stars as his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and communicates to them the Authority of his
Rays. From this our World, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> govern
that other in Justice, Peace, and Religion, with the
same Political Happiness the Kingdoms of <hi>Castile</hi> enjoy
to their satisfaction. But least the Envious and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy should triumph with these
their Artifices, and that all the Calumnies of that Book
may be entirely overthrown, let us suppose all those
Evils, which Malice has feigned the <hi>Indians</hi> to have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
to be true; and compare them to what have
been really undergone in our own time in several Wars,
as well against <hi>Genoa,</hi> as in <hi>Germany, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
and 'twill appear clearer than light, that that lye comes
far short of the truth of these. What cruel Torments
have Tyrants ever invented against Innocence, which
in these our times we have not seen put in practice, not
against inhumane and barbarous People, but civilized
Nations; and those not always Enemies, but even
their own Members, without respect to Propinquity
of Blood, or Piety towards their Country? How often
have we seen Auxiliary Forces turn their Weapons upon
them that sent them? Defence been more bloody than
open Offence? Protection become immediate Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Friendship, Hostility? Not a stately Edifice, not
a Sacred Place, has been spared by Fire and Sword:
In a little time we have seen an infinite number of
Towns, Forts, and Cities, buried in their own Ashes;
and Countries very populous changed into most Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Deserts. Nor yet, could that Thirst of Humane
Blood be quench'd or satisfied. 'Twas no new thing then
to try Pistols and Swords upon Mens Breasts, as Bodies
of Trees, and that not only in the heat of Battel, but
in cool Blood, 'twas then a very agreeable Spectacle to
see the deformed Looks, and trimbling Limbs of Men
exspiring. How often have Mens Bellies ript open
served for Mangers? Sometimes in those of Women
('tis dreadful to mention it) their tender Embryo's
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56556:58"/>
were mixt with Straw and Oats, and made Provender
for Horses. At the Expence of Life, 'twas try'd, how
much Water a Man's Body would hold, or how long
one could live without Sustenance. Nuns were viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Daughters of good Families dishonoured, Wives
ravished in the very sight of their Parents and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
Women, as all other Spoil or Plunder, were
either sold or exchanged for Cows or Horses, and
Labourers were put to Chariots, and compell'd to draw
them as Horses; and to make them discover where
their Riches lay, hung by the Feet and Members, and
thus let down into hot Furnaces. There Children
were barbarously murdered before their Eyes, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Affection might in the Grief of these their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Pledges effect what self-love could not oblige them
to. In Woods and Forests where Wild Beasts find
refuge, Men could not; for the Blood hounds chased
them thence, and brought them to the Stake. The
deepest Lakes we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ousness
and Rapine; the Effects of these wretched
People were rak'd thence with Hooks and Nets. Not
so much as dead Mens Bones were suffered to rest,
Tombs and Grave-stones were thrown down to search
under them for Treasures. There's no magical, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
Art which they put not in practice to discover
their Money. Many thousand Men perished by Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and Covetousness, not by their own Baseness, as
the <hi>Indians,</hi> whose Extirpation Divine Justice permitted,
for having been so many Ages Rebels to their Creator.
I mention not these things to accuse any Nation in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
for I am assured most, if not all, have acted
their Parts in this Barbarous and Inhumane Tragedy;
but only to vindicate that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.
The sweetest and best fram'd Mind is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                     <p>The Prince's Hand keeps time in that Musical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
which good and prudent Government makes; if
this time be not regular and even, there arises a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Voices, and the Harmony is disordered in
others, in that all follow the Motion of that. Hence
'tis, that States generally resemble their Princes, and
sooner the ill than the good; for as Subjects use so
carefully to observe their Vices, they make an Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on their Minds, and are easily afterwards imitated
out of Flattery. For Vicious Princes not only commit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56556:60"/>
Vices themselves, but infuse them into their People,
and are more blameable for the Example than the
Fault; and experience tells us, that bad Habits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do more mischief than the very best do good;
for such is the perverse Inclination of our Nature, that
it rather studies to imitate Vices than Virtues. How
Great, how Excellent, were those of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great? Yet, the Emperor <hi>Caracalla</hi> strove to resemble
him in nothing but that Habit he had of leaning hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Head on his Left Shoulder. Though, indeed, some of
a Prince's Vices prejudice himself only; others affect
also the Commonwealth, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> has observed in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi>

Commonwealth is disordered, and Virtue confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Princes should therefore lead such a Life, so form
their Manners, that all may learn by them to be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Honest; which advice they have given them
by King <hi>Alphonso,</hi> in the Sixth of his Law.</p>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:56556:60"/>
For if Vices extinguish the Lamp of Virtue in a
Prince, who ought like a Beacon to give Light to all,
and shew them the securest Course to Sail in, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid dashing against Rocks the Vessel of the
Commonwealth; it being impossible for that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be well ordered, where the Prince has aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
himself to Vice: <hi>For,</hi> says King <hi>Alphonso, the
Nature of Vice is such, that the more a Man uses it, the
more he loves it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The People easily slight and contemn Laws, if they
see him that is the very Soul of them not observe them.
Thus, as the Moon's Eclipses prejudice the Earth, so
the Prince's Faults are the Destruction of his Kingdom:
For the Punishment due to them, God Almighty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

                     <p>The bare Shadow of an ill Action, which obscured

Sun continued his Course, and preserved his Splendor;
that the Clouds should give Rain, and the Rivers Water,
and that the Earth should produce its Fruit plentifully.
For the Sun himself obeys a Holy Prince, as <hi>Ioshua</hi>
experienced for a Reward of his Virtue, and the Earth
is more than ordinary Fertile out of Gratitude, in a

will be less censured, for suffering them to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in others, or having them in common with the

love Libertinism, they hate the Author of it; which

What we usually Censure in others as highly Base and
Infamous, in our selves we scarce allow to be Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Nature. The greatest Defect in our selves we
easily connive at, but in a Looking-Glass can't suffer
the least Spot. Such a one is a Prince, in whose Person
his Subjects have a view of themselves, nor is any thing
more unpleasant to them, than to see him sullied with
Vice. <hi>Nero</hi> was not at all less infamous for having
many Companions in his Debaucheries; however he
thought thereby to avoid Scandal<note n="12" place="bottom">Ratusque dedecus emoliri, si plures <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Nor should Princes imagine themselves secure from
a self-consciousness of their good Actions; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56556:61"/>
the People can't inform themselves of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they begin nicely to examine them, and always
put the worst Interpretation upon them; wherefore 'tis
not enough for them to do well, but necessary, also,
that the means they use have no appearance of Evil.
And how will that Man have any thing secret, who
can't be without his own Grandeur, and a Retinue of
Courtiers, nor do any thing alone; whose Liberty
draws with it so many Fetters and Golden Chains,
whose noise every one hears? This was signified in the
Person of the High-Priest, by those little Bells that
hung round the bottom of his Garment, least he should
forget that his Steps were exposed to all Mens Ears<note n="13" place="bottom">And he compassed him with Pomegranates, and with golden Bells round about, that there might be a sound, and a noise made, that might be heard in the Temple. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 45. 9.</note>.
All the Guards both within and without a Prince's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
all the Courtiers that attend him in his Chamber or
Closet, are so many Spies of his Words and Actions; nay,
and very Thoughts, attentively observing all his Gestures,
and the Motions of his Countenance, that discoverer
of the Heart. Thus, according to the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Their Eyes look unto his Hands</hi>
                        <note n="14" place="bottom">Psal. 122. 2.</note>. But if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any failing in a Prince, though they pretend to
conceal it, yet they love to discover it, either to get
the Reputation of Persons discreet, and well acquainted
with the Government, or that of Zealots. Here they
look on one another, and no one daring to open his
Mouth, they speak most by their Silence. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
boils and bubbles within them, agitated by the
fervent desire they have of revealing it, till at last it
overflows<note n="15" place="bottom">His word was in mine heart as a burning fire sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

discloses it to that, having first obliged him by Oath
to Secrecy; that in the same manner to another; so
that while no body knows, 'tis known to all. Thus,
as 'twere in a moment Calumny passes from the Closet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56556:62"/>
to the Offices, thence to the Streets and Publick Places.
But what wonder is it, if this happens among Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
when Princes are not assured, even, of their
own faithfulness, however desirous they are to conceal
their Vices and Tyrannies; for their own Conscience
accuses them; as it happened to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who could
not forbear disclosing to the Senate the Miseries which
he suffered from his Crimes<note n="16" place="bottom">Quippe Tiberium non fortuna, non solitudines protegebant, qui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ought not to be discouraged, if by their Industry and
Diligence they seem not to satisfy every one; for that
is a thing impossible, nor will ever Passion, Envy, and
the so different Judgment of the Mob concur to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him, much less can this our frail Nature in all
things act without Fault and Error. Is any one more
careful and sollicitous in giving Light to this World,
any more perfect than that Eye of it, that Prince of
Light, the Sun, who gives Being, Colour, and Beauty
to all things? Yet notwithstanding the Splendor of his
Rays, Curiosity discovers therein I know not what
Spots and Obscurities. This care of the Prince to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
his own Life and Actions, ought to be extended
to those also of his Ministers, the Representatives of
him, in as much as both God and Men hold him to be
no less obliged to do the one than the other.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Tis not the
Moon's defect, what it suffers in an Eclipse, but that of
the Earth, which interposes its Shadow betwixt it and the
Sun; nevertheless every one imputes it to the Moon;
and this Shadow only is sufficient to darken its Rays,
and create so much prejudice to things here below.
Prince's Vices we only attribute to his depraved Will;
but to let Crimes in his Ministers go unpunished, is
esteemed baseness of Mind. The vehemence of the
Passions and Affections is some excuse for our particular
faults, but to indulge them in others, is wholly inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.
A Vicious Prince may have Virtuous Ministers;
but if he begin to connive with them, both he and they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56556:62"/>
will be bad. Hence it sometimes happens, that an ill
Prince's Government may be good, provided he take
care others follow not his Example: For that Rigour
suffers not any Action to be mimick'd out of Flattery,
nor lets that natural Inclination of the Will prevail,
by which every one loves to resemble Princes by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their Actions. Grant such a Prince bad for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he will be good for the State. To give absolute
Liberty to Ministers, is wholly to abandon the Reins
of Government. Wicked Princes are as difficult to be
cured as tainted Lungs; in that Remedies can't be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to them. For these consist in hearing and seeing,
both which they are equally averse to; nay, love not
that others should hear or see; at least, their Domesticks
and Ministers, who rather applaud. Princes Vices, don't
suffer it; but as the Ancients were used to make a
great noise with Brass and Cymbals, while the Moon
was in Eclipse<note n="17" place="bottom">Igitur aeris sono, tubarum, corn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That incites us to do well; this not to do ill, and the
Mind more easily abstains from what is Ignominious,
than it enterprizes a thing Difficult and Honourable.
In effect, 'tis with reason Honour is reputed to consist
in the Opinion of others, that we may dread that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and seeing our Actions depend upon each Man's
Judgment, make it our business to satisfy all. Thus,
although Murmur be bad in its self, 'tis however good
for the State; in that there's nothing has more Power
and Influence over Magistrates and Princes. What
would not Power dare, did not Blame resist it? What
Crimes would not that fall into, were there no such
thing as this? There's no better Counsellors in the
World than Murmurs, for they proceed from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Evils. Could Princes hear them, undoubtedly
things would succeed better. Satyrs and Libels I dare
not altogether approve, for they generally either exceed
the bounds of Truth, or give rise to Scandals, Tumults,
and Seditions; however possibly some allowance ought
to be made therein, in consideration of the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
they have. Obtrectation is a sign of Liberty in a
Commonwealth, for in that which Tyranny oppresses,
'tis by no means tolerated. 'Tis a happy time when
you have liberty to think what you please, and speak
what you think<note n="2" place="bottom">Rara temporum foelicitate, ubi sentire quae velis, &amp; quae sentias dicere licet. <hi>Tac. 1. Hist.</hi>

to be concerned or moved at all by Detraction, were
to have cast off all Sentiments of Honour; than which
nothing is worse in a Prince, for he then makes a Pleasure
of Infamy; he ought therefore so to resent them, as
thence to learn something, not with a design of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.

'tis true, can take care that Slanders come not to the

A Prince, who forbids his Actions to be spoke of,
renders them suspected; and as the Commonalty are
apt to presume the worst, they are published for bad.
Those things are least aggravated, which are not much
valued <hi>Vitellius</hi> forbad any one to mention his bad
Actions; hence many, who, if they had been at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would have said otherwise, meerly because of the
Prohibition, spoke more to his disadvantage<note n="6" place="bottom">Prohibiti per civitatem sermones, eoque plures, ac si liceret, vera narraturi, quia vetabantur, atrociora vulgaverunt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Prince ought to pass over Commendations and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
so as not to be tickled with them, nor by these
dejected. If Praises please him, and he give ear to
them, every one will try to make himself Master of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56556:64"/>
his Mind by Flattery; if Murmurers be a disturbance to
him, he will decline difficult and glorious Enterprises,
and become sluggish in his Government. To be vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puft up at ones Praises, is a sign of a slender Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
to be offended at every thing, is for private
Men. To connive at many things is the part of Princes;
to pardon nothing, that of Tyrants. This, those Great
Emperors, <hi>Theodosius, Arcadius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> very well
knew when they commanded <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> their Captain of
the Guards, not presently to punish the Peoples Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

from Inconstancy, they are to be despised; if from
Madness or Folly, to be pitied; if from Malice, and

him about the Sentence to be passed upon them; but he
inraged at the Person who presented it, threw the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
immediately into the Fire, by which he then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
stood and burnt it. It belongs, I know, to a
Prince to inform himself of all things, but nicely to
examine each Word, is unworthy a generous Breast<note n="8" place="bottom">Omnia scire non omnia exequi. <hi>Tac. in Vit. Agr.</hi>

Crown would be too Thorny, did the least thing prick
it thus. That Injury, which the Person against whom
it was designed, don't look upon as such, is very little,
if at all offensive. 'Tis too much easiness in the
Prince, and a sign he has a mean Opinion of himself,
to be moved at every trifling Report; and 'tis an ill
Conscience that incites Men to punish Detracters; a
Mind pure and undefiled despises things of that Nature.

for a Prince's advantage to know what Ill others speak
of him, so it is not a little prejudicial to be too ready
to hear Defamers: For as we easily believe what is
accused in others to be true; 'tis very obvious for the
Prince, either to be deceived, make some unjust Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
or err in giving Judgment. This is a thing
very dangerous, especially in Courts, where Envy, and
the gaping after Preferment, and the Favour of Princes,
are Whet-stones to Defamation; and Courtiers are
usually like those Locusts in the Revelations, having
Mens Faces, but Lions Teeth, with which they gnaw
and feed on Honour as Ears of Corn<note n="15" place="bottom">Rev. 9. 5.</note>. The Holy
Spirit compares their Tongues to a sharp Sword<note n="16" place="bottom">Psal. 56. 5.</note>;

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56556:65"/>
where they are tolerated, can be at rest; and their
Whispers will give the Prince no less trouble than Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs. The Remedy is, not to hear them, setting
two Porters at the Ears, Reason and Judgment, that
they be not opened without considerable occasion. A
Guard is no less necessary at the Ears, than the Palace-Gates;
and yet Princes are mighty sollicitous about
these, take little or no care about them. He that gives
ear too easily to Detracters, makes them audacious. No
one traduces others, but before one who loves to hear
it. It would do well also to bring these Bablers, and
the Person accused, face to face, telling him what
they say, that for the future they may be ashamed to
be the Authors of Discord. This, if I mistake not, is
meant by the Holy Spirit in these Words, <hi>Hedge thy

conceal abundance of Truths from the Prince, which,
indeed, 'tis for his advantage, there being many Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
things, 'twere better for him to be ignorant of
than to know, and the best way to banish all Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in general; yet, when Accusations proceed not
from Malice, but a kind of Zeal to serve the Prince, 'tis
by all means requisite to hear, and well examine them,
looking on them as Informations absolutely necessary,
not only for good Government, but his own Security
also. Hence the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> in a Law for that
purpose, assigns a Reward to those who would accuse
his Ministers and Domesticks of any real Crime<note n="21" place="bottom">Si quis est cujuscunque loci ardinis, dignitatis, qui se in quemcunque Iudicum, Comitium, Amicorum, &amp; Palatinorum meorum aliquid veraci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This is absolutely necessary, that the Prince may know
all that passes in his Palace, at his Council-Board, and in
the Courts of Judicature, where Fear stops the Mouth,
and the Favours of the Prince conferred by his Ministers
make the Persons gratified dumb, and not dare to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Faults, as if, forsooth, this were to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the good Office, and to shew their Gratitude,
which is rather to be esteemed Disloyalty and Treason:
For that Obligation they lie under to undeceive their
Prince, and if they observe his Ministers to be faulty
to inform him, is a natural Obligation of Fidelity, and
more binding than any other. 'Tis an infinite preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
for a Prince to distribute his Favours by the Hands
of his Favourites; for these buy, as it were, others a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
the price of them, who are assisting to the neglect of
their Duty, at least approve and defend it; and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
the Prince, are the reason he continues his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to them. The Ancient Republicks very sensible
how conducive Satyrs were to restrain Vice by the fear
of Infamy, allowed them upon Publick Theatres; but
these from a general Censure of Mens Morals insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
degenerated into particular Reflections, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considerable Injury to the Honour of some; hence
proceeded Factions, and from them popular Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For as the Holy Spirit says, a backbiting Tongue
disturbs the Peace, and is the Ruin of whole Families
and Cities<note n="22" place="bottom">Curse the whisperer, and double tongued; for such have destroyed many that were at Peace, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 28. 13.</note>. So, least the Correction of Manners
should depend on the Malice of the Tongue or Pen,
there were instituted Censors, who by Publick Authority
took cognizance of every one's Behaviour, and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Vices. That Office was in those times of great
use, and continued long in Vogue, because its Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was upheld by Modesty; however in ours 'tis
impossible to be executed: For Pride and Libertinism
would presently make all the Opposition to it imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as they now resist the Magistracy, however armed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56556:66"/>
with the best Laws in the World and Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and consequently Censors would be ridiculous,
not without great danger to the State; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more hurtful, nothing that makes Vice more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
and insulting, than for such Remedies to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to it, as Delinquents turn into Contempt and
Ridicule. But as the Office of Censor was introduced
for the Reformation of Manners, so was it also to
Register the Goods and Estates of every Citizen, and
to take the number of them; and although that Custom
prevailed a long time, both among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
with great Advantage to the Commonwealth, yet
at this day 'twould be very odious and subject to
vast Inconveniencies; for to know so accurately the
Number and Effects of Subjects, is of no use, but to
burthen them with more Taxes and Impositions. That
numbring of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> under King <hi>David,</hi>
God punished as a most heinous Crime<note n="23" place="bottom">2 Sam. 24. 10.</note>: For what

which no sooner begins, but begins to die too. Death
is naturally equal to all, but is distinguished by the
Glory or Oblivion we leave to Posterity. Who dying
makes Renown a Substitute for Life, lives still. Strange
force of Virtue, which even against Nature, makes
that which is of its self fading and perishable, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
glorious. <hi>Tacitus</hi> did not think <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Life

A generous Spirit knows no mean; 'twill be either
<hi>Caesar,</hi> or no body; either a shining Star, or a dark
Cinder; nor will this, if honourably extinguished,
shine less gloriously on Obelisks, than t'other. Nor,
indeed, is that Soul truly great, which, like the best

But if in the beginning of his Reign he loses his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he will very difficultly recover it; for what the

Honour can never be attained. This <hi>Tacitus</hi> observed

Let a Prince so stere his Course, be the Sea Calm or
Tempestuous, as still to keep his Eye upon that shining
Beacon of Glory; ever and anon calling to mind (that
he may admit, or think of nothing unworthy himself)
that History will publish his Fame, his Exploits and
Glorious Atchievements to all Ages, and to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Princes have no other Superior than God, and
Fame; they alone by the fear of Punishment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
oblige them to Act honourably; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they often fear Historians more than their Enemies,
and are more aw'd by the Pen than the Sword. King
<hi>Balthasar,</hi> though he saw only the Hand and Pen, as
yet not knowing what they would write, was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd,
<hi>That he quaked all over, and the Ioints of his
Back were loosened</hi>
                        <note n="12" place="bottom">Dan. 5. 6.</note>. But if they neither regard
God nor Glory, nothing Glorious or Honourable can
be expected. For who e're slights Honour, despises
Virtue. A generous desire of Glory avoids the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of Vice or Injustice. Nor is there a more Savage
Brute than that Prince, who is neither moved by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of Conscience, or desire of Glory. Nor is there,
nevertheless, no danger in Glory; for its brightness
often dazles Princes, and leads them headlong into
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56556:69"/>
Rashness and Temerity. That which seems Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Glorious to them, is Vanity or Folly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Pride or Envy, and oftentimes Ambition and
mere Tyranny. They propose great matters, egg'd on
by the Flatteries of their Ministers, who set before
them many things under the appearance of Glory,
concealing in the mean time the unjust and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Means by which they are to be attained; by which
being seduced, they oftentimes find themselves deluded
and ruined.</p>
                     <p>That Glory is safe which springs from a generous
Spirit, and keeps within the Bounds of Reason and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.
Since therefore Honour and Infamy are the
strongest Excitements to good Actions, and that both
are by History delivered down to Posterity; 'twould
be convenient by Rewards proposed to excite Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                     <p>'TIS an old saying, <hi>Purple is to be judged by Purple;</hi>
by which the Ancients signified, that things were
then best distinguished, when one was compared with
the other, especially if they were such as could not
easily be distinguish'd by themselves. Thus Merchants
do, who compare Colour to Colour, that they may
shew each other, and that a surer Judgment may be
given of both. In the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus,</hi>
there was a Cloak (a Present of some King from <hi>Persia</hi>)
of such an excellent Grain, that the Robes of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies, nay, even of the Emperor <hi>Aurelian</hi> himself,
compared with it, look'd as faint as Ashes. If your
Royal Highness, when raised to the Crown, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and know the true worth of the Royal Purple,
expose it not to the false Light of Flatterers and fawning
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56556:70"/>
Knaves, for that will never shew you its true Colour:
Nor rely too much upon self-love, for that is like an Eye,
that sees all things but its self. 'Twill be therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that as Eyes are known by their own Species,
like Forms represented in a Glass; so your Highness
would compare the Lustre of your Diadem to that of
your Glorious Predecessors, seriously reflecting if any
Virtues shine more bright in theirs than yours, by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self in them as in a Glass<note n="1" place="bottom">Tanquam in speculo ornare, &amp; comparare vitam tuam ad alienas virtutes, <hi>Plu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. Let your
Highness, I say, compare your own Actions to those
of your Ancestors, and you will easily see the difference
between yours and theirs, that you may either give a
true Colour to their Actions, or rejoyce in the Worth
of your own, if in any thing you happen to have
out-done your Predecessors. Let your Royal Highness
therefore please to consider, whether you Equal your
Father in Courage, your Grandfather in Piety; <hi>Philip</hi>
the Second, in Prudence; <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit; <hi>Philip</hi> the First, in Affability; <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Catholick, in Policy; in Liberality, that <hi>Alphonso,</hi>
who was Nick-named from his broken Hands; in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Eleventh; and lastly, King
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Holy, in Religion: And that moreover,
your Highness would be stir'd up by a generous Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
to a glorious Desire of imitating these Great
Men. <hi>Quintus Maximus</hi> and <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> were used
to say, that when e're they beheld the Images of their
Ancestors, their Souls were fired and excited on to
Virtue: Not that they were moved by the meer Wax
or Stone, but that comparing their own Actions to
those of others, they could not rest till they equall'd
them in Glory and Renown. Elogies inscribed on
Tombs, speak not to the Dead, but to the Living:
They are certain Summaries, which for Memory's sake,
the Virtue of the Predecessor leaves to the Successor.
<hi>Mattathias</hi> said, That by calling to mind the Actions
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56556:70"/>
of their Ancestors, his Sons should acquire present Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and eternal Renown<note n="2" place="bottom">Call to remembrance what Acts our Fathers did in their time, so shall ye receive great Honour, and an everlasting Name, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 2. 52.</note>. For which Cause also,
the High Priests, who were Princes of the People,

his Ancestors in Glory, not with his Inferiors, for 'tis
no praise to excel them, and to be out-done by them,
the greatest Scandal. The Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> observed

Moreover, let your Highness compare the Purple you
wear at present, to that you wore formerly; for we
are oftentimes desirous to forget what we have been,
for fear of upbraiding our selves with what we are.
Let your Highness consider, whether you are grown
better or worse, for we find it often happens, that at
the beginning of their Reigns, Princes minds are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
bent upon the Execution of their Office, in
which afterwards they grow more remiss. Almost all
begin their Reigns with Great and Glorious Spirits;
but at last by degrees, either they sink under the Weight
of Affairs, or grow Effeminate by Luxury and Ease,
with which they easily suffer themselves to be taken,
forgetting they are obliged to keep and preserve their
once gotten Glory. This very thing <hi>Tacitus</hi> remarks

                     <p>A Tree bedeck'd with Trophies, is still a Trunk as
afore; those which were an Honour to others,
are but a burthen to it. So truly, the glorious Exploits
of Ancestors are but a Shame and Disgrace to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
unless he imitates the same. Nor does he inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56556:72"/>
their Glory, but their Actions only, by an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which he will obtain the other. Just as light is
reflected from a Diamond, because it finds substance,
but quickly pierces Glass which is thin and transparent;
so if the Successor be Stout and Brave, the Glory of
his Predecessors adds yet a greater Lustre and Brightness
to him; but if like thin and paultry Glass, he can't
withstand the Lustre, it serves only to discover his vile
and abject Soul. The Actions of Ancestors, which
are only Examples to others, are Laws to the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
for the whole Esteem and Prerogative of Nobility
is grounded upon this Supposition, that the Descendants
will imitate the Actions of their Forefathers. He, who
vainly boasts of these without imitating them, only
shews the difference between himself and them. No
one is to be blamed for not equalizing the Actions of
them to whom he bears no relation. For this Reason,
the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> were wont to place before their
Doors the Statues of the Illustrious Men of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that they might shew to Posterity what Obligation
they lie under. <hi>Bodislaus</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
always wore his Father's Picture in Gold about his
Neck; and whenever any Affair of great consequence
was to be determined, he put it to his Mouth, and
kissing on't, with Veneration us'd to say, <hi>God grant I
may never do any thing unworthy your Royal Name.</hi> How
many such Medals of your Heroick Ancestors might
your Highness find? Which would never permit you to
act any thing beneath their Royal Blood; nay, would
rather encourage and excite you to out-do them in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Exploits? Now, if this Emulation of Ancestors
enflame the Minds of the Nobility, they certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the principal Employments in the State. For as

the Trophies and Glory of their Ancestors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Virtues, and are in all things wholly different
from them. Of this we have an Example in the Eagles

neither the generosity, strength, nor swiftness of an

'tis to the Publick Good, without any discretion or
regard to Merit, to elect only the Nobility into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Offices, as though the Experience and Virtue of
Ancestors ran in the Blood to Posterity. Industry will
languish, Virtue will grow sluggish and lazy, if only
grounded upon Nobility, which will look upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

and Virtue are in esteem, and in possession of the
greatest Posts in the Army; in which they may either
acquire Nobility, or enlarge and illustrate that which
they have already. The hope of this furnisht past Ages
with brave Heroick Generals; but where this is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Art Military is neglected and slighted; for nothing
but the Honour of Preferment in the Army can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the Inconveniences and Perils of War. Nor is it
true as some suppose, that the greatest Respect and
Obedience is paid to those of the noblest Families; for
if they are not qualified with these two great Qualities,
Conduct and Valour, all the deference paid to their
Blood will be only meer Ceremony, not real Respect.
The Heart values and admires only such a Virtue and
Greatness of Soul, as is the Maker of its own Fortune.

remedy excess of Riches, in giving opportunity of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying

Prodigality and Luxury are now grown to that height,
that there is no occasion for such means; for all the
Nobility are so much straitned by Debts, and necessary
Expences, that they want means to execute such

be great beyond what they can, they become even less

The Rays of the Sun never forsake the Moon; she,

he might turn it as he pleased, and hold that upwards
which tended most to his Preservation and Advantage.
For which reason, he thinks 'tis not necessary for a
Prince to be Virtuous, 'tis enough if he pretends to be
so; for to be really so, and to act according
to the Dictates of Virtue, would, he says, be perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
but that 'tis most advantageous to be thought
so; for by this means he will be so disposed, as to
know how to shift upon occasion, and so to act in all

to spread their Sails to every breath of Fortune, and

that would insinuate that Virtues need not be real and
genuine, but only counterfeit and imaginary, for how
can the Shadow be as effective as the Substance? What

of him, but not so when he dissembles. Open Vice

Virtue is only Cheat and Design; not accidental,

Men more easily dispence with other Vices, but
all loath Hypocrisy; for by them we only deceive our
selves, but by this, others too. Nay, good Actions are
despised if artificial, and not the Product of Virtue.
<hi>Vitellius</hi> did many things to curry favour with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but those things which would have been really
acceptable, had they proceeded from a Principle of
Virtue, were (by the memory of his former Course of
Life, and because every one saw that they were feigned
and forced) look'd upon as base and vile<note n="20" place="bottom">Quae grata sane &amp; popularia, si à <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                        </note>. And,
pray, who would dissemble Virtue, if it cost the same
pains to do so, as to be really virtuous? If Virtues
themselves, by reason of the wickedness of Manners,
have scarce strength and power to subsist, how then
should the false and counterfeit? Who e'er puts more
confidence in these Tricks than in Divine Providence,
denies that he receives his Crown and Preservation from
God, and that he is the Disposer of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
If a Prince's Vices proceed from Weakness,
and not from Affection, 'tis best to conceal them, that
they may not give ill Examples; for to conceal them
on that account, ought not to be accounted Hypocrisy,
or a design to Cheat others, but rather Prudence, and
an Esteem and Respect due to Virtue. There's no
curb or restraint to that Power which does not veil its
Tyrannies with some pretence or other. The Senators
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56556:78"/>
never feared <hi>Tiberius,</hi> more than when they saw him
without Dissimulation<note n="21" place="bottom">Penetrabat Pavor, &amp; admiratio, callidum olim, &amp; regendis scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus obscurum, huc confidentiae venisse, ut tanquam dimotis parietibus ostenderet Nepotem sub verbere Centurionis, inter servorum ictus, extrema vitae alimenta frustra orantem. <hi>Tac. 6.

                        </note>. I don't mean by
this, that Virtues are the same in a Prince, whether
feigned or real; but that the People are sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and take Hypocrisy for Virtue. Therefore how
much more firm and lasting would <hi>Piso</hi>'s Fame have
been, had it been supported by real and solid Virtues.
The same inconveniences arise if a Prince is possest of
real Virtues, but such as he will easily change for his
conveniency; for that cannot be Virtue, which is not a
firm and constant habit of the Mind, nor will it inhabit
such a Breast with fears, not upon any prospect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to turn it into Vice, and joyn with Villainy.
And how can this ever be convenient for a Prince?</p>
                     <p>And what Case or Circumstance can require it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in these our times, when Rule and Empire are
established upon sure Laws; not depending as in the
<hi>Roman</hi>'s time, upon the Election and Insolence of the
Soldiers. No danger can be so great, that a Prince by
prudent Virtue may not avoid without having recourse
to Vice. If at any time a Prince renown'd for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
be vanquished, 'tis not because he was good, but
because he knew not enough how to be good. A Just
Prince is not obliged hastily and rashly to confront and
oppose Vice, where there is no prospect of Advantage,
but certain and manifest Danger from this over-dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
nay, 'tis a piece of great prudence to permit
and suffer that quietly, which by Opposition can't be
prevented<note n="23" place="bottom">Permittimus, quod nolentes indulgemus, quia pravam hominum volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem ad plexum cohibere non possumus. <hi>S. Chrysost.</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56556:78"/>
them; and in the mean time reward the Good, and
punish the Bad, and use such other means as prudence
shall suggest; but if these are not sufficient, let him
leave it to his Successor, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did, when he saw
he could not reform the Manners of his time<note n="24" place="bottom">Non id tempus censurae, nec si quid in moribus laboret defuturum corrigendi authorem. <hi>Tac. 2. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>.
For if through fear, a Prince should by doing ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himself to the Life and Manners of ill Men, he
would not only not bring them into the way of Virtue,
but would at the same time mislead the Good, so that
both would grow worse; Virtue in a Prince is never
dangerous, but rash Zeal and Severity often is. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
don't hate a Prince for being good, but, because,
for his too strict Severity they can't be wicked and
lewd. There's no body but desires a Just Prince; the
worst have need of such a one, that Justice may flourish,
by which they may live not only secure from others, but
from one another too. This <hi>Seneca</hi> meant, when, that
he might perswade <hi>Nero</hi> from incestuous Conversation

which make him timorous, slow, and unsteady in his

establish a sort of Policy upon Vice, by shewing how
by help of this, the other may be advanced to the
highest pitch; and by asserting that Men are ruined,
because they know not how to be wicked; as if there
might be a certain Science to be form'd of it. This
Doctrine has made many Princes Tyrants, and ruined
them. Men are not ruin'd, because they know not
how to be wicked, but because wickedness it self can't
long defend its self; for there is no Villainy so cunning
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56556:79"/>
and cautious, as to prevent its self from being caught
at last in its own Snares. What skill can instruct a
Man to keep a sound Judgment in his Vices, whose
Sins trouble his Conscience, which though 'tis in
us, yet by a certain Divine Impulse operates without
us, being both Judge and Executioner of our Actions:

opposed to Prudence; 'tis a Violence that toils to its
own Ruin; 'tis a dangerous Building which falls upon
his Head who built it. No Judgment is so great as to
correct lesser Tyrannies by greater; and to what a
vast Bulk might Men raise it? That very Example of

The same also befel D. <hi>Valentine,</hi> whom he proposes

<note n="33" place="bottom">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise, <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 12.</note>: 'Tis Virtue only that has the Power to

effect of some eminent Virtue or Natural Endowment,

But Malice ascribes this to tyrannical Artifices, and
from Examples of that Nature, picks out some impious
and erroneous Maxims of State, to the ruin both of
Princes and Empires. Besides, all don't Reign, who
have the Scepter in their Hands, or the Crown upon

the Kingdom, takes away the Command, by permitting
them to be Slaves to their Passions, and their Ministers,
and to be oppressed by Misfortunes and Seditions. So

                        </note> What else is a Scepter, but such a Torch
as this, which passes by Succession from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
What is it therefore that Majesty assumes to
its self in this so short and transitory Greatness? Many
things are common to a Prince with other Men, there's
but one thing, and that accidental too, which makes
the difference. All those don't humble his Mind, yet
does this single accident puff him up above others. Let
him think that he is a Man, and that he governs Men;
let him consider well that he comes upon this great
Theatre of the World to act the part of a Prince; and
that he having his discharge, another shall succeed to
those Robes which he shall leave; and that of both of
them only this will remain, that they once were. Lastly,
Let him know that these Robes wherewith he is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are not his own, but the States, which that only
lends him, that he may be a while its Head, and may
consult for the Preservation, Increase, and Prosperity
thereof, as we have said before.</p>
                     <p>When therefore a Prince has once begun to run the
Race of this Life, furnished with the lighted Torch of
his State; let it not be his only business to prolong his
Race, for the Goal is already fixt beyond which he
can't go; and who knows but that he may be now
very near it, the Flame being exposed to every blast of
Wind. One single Gale wrenched it from the Hands of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the First, er'e he was fourteen Years old.
Also a fall from a Horse prevented Prince <hi>Iohn,</hi> Son
of their most Catholick Majesties from taking hold
on't.</p>
                     <p>Let a Prince consider also the fitness of his hand,
the occasion and right, that he mayn't rashly grasp at
more of these Torches, than either Succession or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Election shall grant him. Had <hi>Frederick,</hi> Count
<hi>Palatine,</hi> considered this, he had never lost his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dignity, his Places, and Titles so unfortunately,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56556:81"/>
for being ambitious of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And
truly <hi>Charles,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> had ended his Race
more successfully, had he been contented with the
Torch of his own Kingdom, and not attempted to
grasp at that of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he was therefore poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Prince too readily trust his Torch to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor suffer any one to touch it with so great
Authority. For Empire admits of no Companion. The
Infant <hi>Sancho</hi> attempted to snatch this Torch from his
Father, King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise, by the same Power
and Authority which he receiv'd from him. Nor were
there wanting Pretences for the Infant of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to
attempt the same against his Father, <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Torches of Kingdoms lighted by ill Methods,
are commonly soon extinguish'd, for no Power acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by wickedness is lasting. King <hi>Garcias</hi> forc'd his
Father, <hi>Alphonso,</hi> to quit his Kingdom, but could not
enjoy the Crown so gotten above three Years. <hi>Fruela</hi>
the Third, possess'd but fourteen Months the Kingdom
which he had attain'd rather by Force than Election.
Violent Counsels h'an't always their desired Success.
<hi>Ramon</hi> hop'd certainly to inherit the Throne of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
if he could make away with his Brother <hi>Sancho;</hi>
but the People abhorr'd him who had conceiv'd such a
horrid Villainy, and so offer'd it to <hi>Sancho,</hi> King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> his Uncle.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Prince unadvisedly trust his Torch out of
his own Hands in his Life-time, least, if he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
repent, it should befal him, as it did King
<hi>Alphonso</hi> the Fourth, who having once resign'd his
Kingdom to his Brother <hi>Ramiro,</hi> could never afterwards
retrieve it, though he desir'd it. Ambition while in
Possession regards not Justice, having always Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Pretences at hand to defend it self. And
who will not be mov'd by the difference between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
and obeying.</p>
                     <p>Though these Torches do pass from Father to Son,
yet let Kings remember that they receive them from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56556:82"/>
God, and that when he pleases they are to Surrender
them to him, that they may know to whose Gift they
ought to ascribe them, and how strict an Account they
are to give of them. This King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Great
did, who with his last Breath pronounc'd these Words,
<hi>Thine, O Lord, is Power, Empire is thine; Thou art Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
King of Kings; all things are under thy Providence.
The Kingdom which from thy Hand I receiv'd, unto thee I
resign.</hi> The same Words did King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Holy,
use at the point of Death.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a glorious, though laborious Race which Heaven
has design'd for your Royal Highness, which must be
run not with one, but with several Torches of shining
Diadems, which like the Sun, but without ever leaving
us in the dark, will diffuse their extended Light from
<hi>East</hi> to <hi>West.</hi> Furious Winds rising from each part of
the Horizon, will perhaps threaten them; but since
God has lighted them to preceed the Standard of the
Cross, and to give light upon the Holy Altars of the
Church, it may well be hop'd that these may shine
like that<note n="2" place="bottom">I will also give thee for a light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that thou maist be my Salvation to the end of the Earth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 6.</note>; especially if your Highness's Faith and

their Flame burn more clear and bright, its natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
being towards Heaven; and he who holds them
obliquely, will make the Flame its self feed upon and
wast them, but he who turns 'em directly downwards,
opposite to Heaven, will immediately extinguish them;
for the Matter which would else nourish them, will
then extinguish them. Let your Highness therefore
take care with these Lights to finish your Course with
Glory, and Surrender them bright and flaming to your
Successor, not meerly such as you receiv'd them, but
illustrated and augmented with new Rays: For God

Reign, that he may afterwards require a just Account

your Highness must acknowledge no less an

So the Emperor, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, resign'd his
while he was yet living, to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the Second:
And though the wickedness of some can't attend the

rais'd, as was the Case of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi>
who seeing he could not resist <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth of
<hi>France,</hi> surrendred the Crown to his Son <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Calabria;</hi> yet certain 'tis, that his design was

                     <p>AMONG the Ceremonies of the <hi>Athenians</hi> at their
Marriages, a certain little Boy, with a Basket of
Bread in his Hand, and a Crown of Thorns upon his

they intimated that Matrimony was not institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Pleasure only, but also for Cares and Labours.
By the same (if Emblems will admit Human Figures)
might also be meant a Prince. For what thorny Cares
does not he feel, who endeavours to maintain his State
in Justice, Peace, and Plenty. What Difficulties does
he experience? What Dangers is he liable to, who
commands other<note n="1" place="bottom">Quam arduum, quam subjectum fortunae regendi cuncta onus? <hi>Tac. 1. Ann.</hi>

Rest, his Dangers their Security, his Vigilance their

by a Crown, fine, indeed, and charming to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight, but

Who viewing those Pearls and Diamonds, and those
Flowers which adorn a Crown, would not fancy that
the inside was much more fair and beautiful; yet is
there nothing but sharp Thorns, which continually
prick and scratch the Head and Breast? There is not a
Pearl in a Crown, but which is Sweat; nor a Ruby, but
which is Blood; nor a Diamond, without some asperity
or roughness; 'tis a Circumference without a Center of
rest, a perpetual Motion of Cares<note n="*" place="bottom">S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rabo.</note>; for this reason
Kings anciently wore a Crown made like a Ship, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
its Inconstancy, Trouble, and Dangers<note n="†" place="bottom">Valer. Max.</note>. This
he well knew, who, when a Crown was offered him,
laid it down, with these Words, <hi>Let him take thee up,
who does not know thee.</hi> Instead of Crowns they at first
us'd Fillets, not as a Badge of Majesty, but only to bind
and preserve the Head<note n="2" place="bottom">Let them set a fair Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

of a Crown'd Head, that it had need to be fore-arm'd;
for to Reign is nothing but three continual Sighs and
Toils, in preserving, acquiring, and losing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did the Emperor, <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> say, That <hi>Empire
was the greatest of Troubles.</hi> Princes are born to labours,
let them therefore inure themselves thereto. The Kings
of <hi>Persia</hi> had a Chamberlain, who wak'd them betimes
in the Morning with these Words, <hi>Arise, O King, to
look after the Affairs of your Kingdom.</hi> Some Princes
now-a-days would not endure such disturbance, for
they perswade themselves that Ease, Voluptuousness,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56556:84"/>
and Vices, are the Rewards of Princes, but that the
Shame and Disgrace thereof belong to others. Whereas
some Princes shamefully neglect their Duty, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as we shall mention elsewhere) they take the
Kingdom for their Inheritance and Propriety, which
they may use as they please, and think that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Sovereign Power is subject to no Laws, but
altogether free to act as it list; in which Flattery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
them, insinuating that without that freedom
and liberty of living, a Kingdom would be the worst
of Slavery, more intolerable than the meanest Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Subjects. Whence resigning themselves to
Luxury and Pleasure, their Strength and Spirits flag,
and themselves become wholly unfit for Government.
Hence, I believe, it is, that among so many Princes, there
are so very few good Governors, not that they want
Natural Parts, for in those they usually exceed others,
as being born of better Blood; but because that through
Ease and Luxury they don't make use of them; nor
do their Courtiers suffer it, for they make their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with more ease under a negligent than careful
Prince. The Remedy against these Inconveniencies
consists chiefly in two Things; The first is, That a
Prince, should from his Youth, as soon as he has the
use of Reason, be accustomed to the Management of
Affairs, even before the Death of his Predecessor; thus
God did with <hi>Ioshua.</hi> And if in Matters of Concern and
Trust, it be not convenient, for Reasons which I shall
shew in the last Emblem but one; yet in other things
it is, that his Mind may be diverted from Debauchery.
This made the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate introduce their Youth to
their Consultations. By the benefit of this many Popes
Nephews, though they have been admitted very young
to the Administration of Affairs, have in a few years
made experienc'd Statesmen. The other is, That those
that are near the Prince, should dexterously endeavour
to root out of his Mind certain vain Opinions of his
Greatness, and let him know that 'tis the common
Consent of all that gives Power and Authority to the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56556:84"/>
Scepter, for Nature made no Kings. That his Purple
is an Emblem of Blood, which he should be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

an Authority of a Father over his Children<note n="9" place="bottom">Vt enim gubernatio patrisfamilias est Regia quaedam potestas domi; ita Regia potestas, est civitatis &amp; gentis unius aut plurium quasi domestica quaedam gubernatio. <hi>Arist. Polit. 3. cap.</hi> 11.</note>; and

In the first Age there was no need of Punishment, for
there were no Crimes; nor of Rewards, for Virtue and
Glory were belov'd for their own sakes. But as the
World grew older, Wickedness encreased with it, and
made Virtue more reserv'd, which before liv'd freely
and carelessly in the Fields. When Equality was laid
aside, and Ambition and Force suppli'd the place of
Modesty and Shame, then Government was also intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56556:87"/>
For Prudence urg'd by necessity, and Common
Prudence oblig'd Men to Civil Society, that they
might exercise Virtues, which Reason prompted them
to, and make use of Speech which Nature gave them,
that by revealing to one another the Sense of their
Minds, they might inform, assist, and defend each
other<note n="1" place="bottom">Sermo vero datus est homini, ad utile &amp; inutile, ac proinde justum ac injustum declarandum. <hi>Arist. Pol. 1. cap.</hi> 2.</note>. Society being thus by common Consent
establish'd, there arose at the same time a certain Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power necessary to the Preservation of its Parts,
which by punishing Vice, and rewarding Virtue, might
defend them in Peace and Justice. And because this
Authority could not be diffused through the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by reason of the Confusion which would arise in
the Execution thereof; and because 'twas also necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that some should Command, and the rest Obey,
they quitted their Pretensions to it, conferring it either
upon one, few, or many, which are the three sorts of
Government; Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The first of which was Monachy; for originally
Men were govern'd by one in each Family; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they chose from among the People, one, who
excell'd others in Goodness and Virtue, whose Hand,
as his Authority encreas'd, they honour'd with a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and his Head with a Diadem, as a Badge of the
Power and Sovereignty which they had conferr'd upon
him, which should principally consist in Justice, by
which he should preserve and defend his Subjects in
Peace; so that without that there is no Order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<note n="2" place="bottom">Nam Respub. nulla <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Justice could not be well administer'd by the
mere Law of Nature, without imminent Danger to the
Commonwealth; for since 'tis defin'd to be a constant and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56556:87"/>
perpetual desire of giving to every one their own<note n="3" place="bottom">For Justice is immortal, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 1. 15.</note>,
it would be very dangerous if it should depend upon
the Opinion and Judgment of the Prince, and not be
written; nor can mere natural Reason, though free
from Affections and Passions, give true Judgment in
such variety of Cases as happen continually. So that
'twas necessary for States to arm themselves with Laws,
deduc'd from long use and experience, as well Penal
as Distributive; these to punish faults, and those to
give every one his own. Penal Laws are represented
by a Sword, the Emblem of Justice, as <hi>Trajan</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reaching a Sword to the Captain of his Guards,
with these Words, <hi>Take this, and if I govern well, use it
for me, if not, against me.</hi> Equally sharp on both sides,
as well for the Rich as the Poor; not with one Edge
blunt, and t'other sharp; to spare one, and hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Distributive Laws are represented by a Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Square, which measures indifferently the Actions and
Rights of all<note n="4" place="bottom">Leg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </note>. By this Rule of Justice things ought
to be measured, not this Rule by things, as the <hi>Lesbian</hi>
Rule was, which being made of Lead, easily adapted it
self to all shapes of the Stone. The Prince ought to give
Life and Vigour to both. King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise said,
That a King was the Heart and Soul of the State. And
in another place he says, That <hi>Rex</hi> a King is the same
with <hi>Regula</hi> a Rule. <hi>Rex</hi> a King, and <hi>Lex</hi> a Law,
differ but in one Letter; and what else is a King but
the Speaking-law, and the Law but a dumb King;
so much King that could it exert it self it should govern
alone. Prudence has as it were divided the Power of
Princes, and yet in their Persons it remains whole,
yet it has subtilly transferr'd part thereof to Paper, so
that it has left Majesty written and expos'd to the view
of all, for the exercise of Justice, so that Justice and
Chastisement, by means of the Law, anticipating
Crimes, the Sentence might not be ascrib'd to the Will,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56556:88"/>
Passion, or Interest of the Prince, and that he might
avoid the Odium of his Subjects. The Law is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for Rigour, a discountenancer of Favour, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Arm of the Prince, with which he holds the
Reigns of the Government. There is no better way
to make Authority respected and obeyed; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Law should be punctually observ'd, nor should
force be us'd in any thing which may be decided by
Law<note n="5" place="bottom">Nec utendum imperio, ubi legibus agi possit. <hi>Tac. 3. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. When once a Prince proceeds that way,
the Laws will soon lose their force and efficacy<note n="6" place="bottom">Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui jura quoties gliscat potestas. <hi>Tac. 3. Ann.</hi>

no difference between Subjection and Command. True
Policy is founded upon the Law, not upon Arbitrary

Roads of Policy, by them as by certain Lines the Ship
of the State fails securely; they are the Walls of Civil
Power, the Eyes and Soul of the State, the Fetters of
the Mob, and the Bridle (the present Emblem) which
Guides and Curbs it<note n="9" place="bottom">Factae sunt autem leges, ut eorum metu humana coerceatur audacia, tutaque sit inter improbos innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp; in ipsis improbis reformidato supplicio refraenetur audacia &amp; nocendi facultas. <hi>Isid. lib. 2.

                     <p>The Determination of Justice could not be safely
committed to the inconstancy of the Will, which is
subject to so many Affections and Passions, and of it
self perfectly blind; but it was necessary that it should
be restrain'd by certain fix'd Decrees and Statutes,
founded upon Reason and Prudence, which should
without distinction be Obligatory to all. Such are the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56556:88"/>
Laws which experience of past Accidents has provided
for future ones; and since they can't explain themselves,
but are mere Bodies which receive Soul, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
from the Judges, with whose Tongues they
speak, and by whose Pens they are explain'd, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to particular Cases, it being impossible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all; let a Prince be very careful to whom
he commits them; for in them he entrusts his very
Being, and the chief Instruments of Government; but
the choice being once rightly made, let him not hinder
the free exercise and ordinary course thereof, but leave
it wholly to the Magistrate; but if Princes will through
Clemency or Arbitrary Power, intermeddle with the
Exposition of the Laws; all this Politick Structure will
fall, and those Laws which should prop and support it,
rather cause its ruin. Tyranny is nothing else but an
ignorance and contempt of the Laws, assuming to it

not less a Restorer than <hi>Pelagius,</hi> would abbreviate all
Processes, and leaving the Civil Law, would make use
only of those of the Kingdom, which are not less pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and learned than just and reasonable. This King
<hi>Recesewind</hi> meant, when in one of his Laws he said,
<q>Also King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the Wise, commanded his Iudges.</q>
This their Majesties, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Ioan,</hi> afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
as did King <hi>Alarick,</hi> who laid severe Penalties
upon the Judges for admitting the Pleas of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws. Nor does it a little derogate from Supream Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
to be govern'd by Foreign Laws. To this I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56556:90"/>
foresee two Objections; first, that if these Laws were
written in <hi>Spanish,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue would be lost,
and the Lawyers would apply themselves wholly
to the Study and Explanation of them only; besides,
that without the knowledge of the Civil Law, from
whence they are deriv'd, they could not be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
The other is, that since the Civil Law is
Common to almost all <hi>Europe,</hi> according to which
causes ought to be decided, and that the Rights and
Privileges of Princes are often to be determin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d in
Foreign Parliaments, and Courts of Judicature; it will
be very necessary to have Men well vers'd in the said
Law. Which inconveniences will be easily remedied
by erecting and indowing some places for Civil Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
in the Universities; as (though upon different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives)
King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>But if this can't be effected, the foremention'd incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
may be thus remedied; first by prohibiting
such a vast number of Books to be imported, which
serve only to clear the Pockets, not the understanding,
nor is Printing any thing else now-a-days, but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
and Trade. This variety confounds the
Senses, embarrasses and puzzles the Judgment. 'Twould
be more adviseable, where the written Laws are not
full enough for the Decision of any Controversy, to
be guided by Reason, that living Law, rather than
to grope for Justice in the obscurity of such diversity
of Opinions, equally favourable to each side, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Subornation and Passion. Next, by shortening
the tedious Methods of the Law, as King <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
design'd to do at <hi>Milan,</hi> when he consulted with
the Senate about that Affair. In which he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
the good of the Subject, but also that in that
State, which is the Bullwark of the Kingdom, there
might be more Men of the Sword than the Gown.
The same was attempted by the Emperors, <hi>Titus</hi> and
<hi>Vespasian, Charles</hi> the Fifth, their Catholick Majesties,

whose Interest it is to prolong Suits, as 'tis that of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

the most Serene Queen <hi>Isabel,</hi> of her own accord, to

has shewn. The Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> are very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
govern'd, because there are no Lawyers among
them; the Witnesses are heard, and without writing
down any thing, except the Judgment, the Causes are
immediately decided. A quick Condemnation is more
expedient for Client, than a favourable Judgment
after a tedious dependance. He who commences a

Let there therefore be few Counsellors, Attornies, and
Sollicitors. How can that Government be quiet, in
which there are so many who get their living by raising
and promoting Feuds and Law-suits? What hopes of
Restitution to the injur'd, when there are so many
ready to fleece and strip him? Suppose them to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Worth and Integrity, yet is Justice ne'er the
better administred for their number; no more than a
Disease is better cur'd by many Physicians. Nor would
it redound to the Common Good, if with the loss of
the Publick Tranquility, and the Estates of the People,
there should be made too nice a scrutiny into every

not better to wink at old and settled Vices, than by

Customs are Laws, not written upon Paper, but in the
Mind and Memory of all, and are more grateful when
not forc'd, but a free choice and sort of liberty; and
the same common Consent, which first introduc'd
them, still observes them so strictly, that it won't per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to be altered though they are bad, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion, by which, after they have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

they are just and reasonable, does prevail more in this
matter than the strongest Arguments; nay, than the
Inconveniences themselves which are found in them.
'Tis therefore more prudent to bear with them, than
wholly to remove them. A prudent Prince governs
his State without altering its Customs<note n="22" place="bottom">Mos hominum tutissime agere, qui praesentibus moribus, legibusque etiam si deteriores sint, minimum variantes Rempub. administrant. <hi>Thucid.</hi>

always fear'd such a surprise? One such as this would
frighten and reform a whole Kingdom. But it is not
always expedient for Majesty it self to imitate such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
When the State of the Kingdom is well
settled, when the Courts of Judicature are open, and
the fear of the Law is fresh and lively, 'tis sufficeint for
a Prince to see Justice administer'd by his Ministers.
But when all is in Confusion, when Obedience stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
when the King's Authority is slighted, as 'twas
in those times, then some such suddain and severe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
will be seasonable, that the People may
know the Power of their Prince, and understand, that
as in a Humane Body, so in a Kingdom, the Soul of
Majesty is all in all, and all in every part. Yet 'twill
be very necessary to moderate this severity, when the
Distemper is inveterate, and the Kingdom confirm'd
in Vice; for if Virtue should be too severe upon Vice,
and endeavour to reform all at once, 'twould be
esteem'd rather Cruelty than Justice. Time must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
that which time has weakned; to precipitate a
Cure is dangerous, and may make the Prince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the Rage of the incens'd Multitude. Connivance
and Dexterity is often more effectual than force. In
this King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick was excellent; and
by this King <hi>Peter</hi> was deceiv'd, who relying wholly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56556:93"/>
upon Severity, got the Name of Cruel. Though Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be one single Virtue, yet has it various Effects,
according to the difference of time. Sometimes the
People wholly reject it, and become more Insolent;
sometimes they acknowledge the damage of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and co-operate with the Prince to remedy it, and
suggest the most severe means against their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by which the Prince acquires the Name of Just
without danger.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Prince remit the Punishment of such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
against the Government, in which few are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,

doing it. To punish for Example, and amendment is
Mercy; but to do it through Passion or Avarice is
Tyranny. Let not a Prince suffer any one to think
himself so great, and free from the Laws, as to dare
to oppose the Ministers of Justice, and those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present

takes place, contempt will by degrees undermine it,
and bring it to the Ground. The chief Foundation
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, and that which has rais'd it
to such an height, and keeps it so, is the inviolable
Observation of Justice and Rigour, by which its Kings
have always taken care to make it respected and
esteem'd of all. No Violation of it goes unpunish'd,
though great be the Dignity and Authority of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent.
A certain Judge at <hi>Corduba,</hi> was by the
Command of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, enquiring
into some Misdemeanor, whom when the Marquiss of
<hi>Puego</hi> had arrested, the King so resented it, that all
the Signal Services of that Family of <hi>Corduba,</hi> could
not hinder him from punishing him very severely;
afterwards he put himself wholly into his Majesty's
Hands, by the Advice of the Great Captain, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heinousness of the Crime, which would not
admit of Pardon, wrote to him to cast himself at the
King's Feet, by which he might perhaps expiate
his Crime, but if not he would certainly be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note n="6" place="bottom">Mar, Hist of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <p>Nor ought a Prince only to punish Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against his own Person, or during his Reign; but
those also which were acted in the last, though the
State were then under the Power of an Enemy. For
Presidents of Disobedience and Contempt of Authority
being conniv'd at, or rewarded, are dangerous even to
Successors. Dignity is ever the same, being always
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56556:94"/>

                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56556:95"/>As in time of Peace, Justice and Mercy are very
advantageous, so in War are Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
because there the Dangers are so great, as
would not be attempted without great hopes, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fear could restrain the Licentiousness of the
Soldiers. In so much as without these two things, says
King <hi>Alphonso, The Faults which are committed<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>in War
are much more dangerous; for if Men have so much to
do to defend themselves from the Mischief of their Enemies,
how much more have they from that which accrues from their
own Faults?</hi> For which reason the <hi>Romans</hi> inflicted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
sorts of Infamy and Punishment upon the Soldiers
who fail'd in their Duty, or in any dangerous Attempt
or Military Affair; whence they were less afraid of the
Enemy than the Punishment, and chose-rather to die
bravely in Action, than to lose their Honour or Lives
afterwards with perpetual Ignominy and Disgrace.
In those times none durst Desert, because he could
not shelter himself in any part of the Empire. Now-a-days
Deserters are not only not punished when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their own Country; but sculking from Battel,
they March from <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> where as if they had
serv'd under some other Prince, they are again listed
into his Majesty's Service, to the great detriment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
In which the Vice-Roys should follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, who after the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi>
though they were in extream want of Soldiers, could
not be induc'd to redeem six thousand Prisoners which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> offered them, thinking them not worth
Redemption, who suffer'd themselves ignominiously to
be taken Prisoners, when they might have died glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
                     <p>The Errors of Generals committed through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
ought rather to be conniv'd at than punish'd,
least the fear of being punished or reprimanded should
make them too timorous. Besides the greatest Prudence
may be confounded in Accidents of War, whence they
deserve Compassion rather than Punishment. <hi>Varro</hi>
lost the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> and at his return the whole
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56556:95"/>
Senate went out to receive him, thanking him for that
in such a total Defeat he had not wholly despair'd of
Affairs.</p>
                     <p>When connivence is not convenient, but the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Justice is required, let it be done with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
and resolution. He who does it privately and
by stealth, is more like an Assassine than a Prince. He
who checks the Authority which the Crown gives
him, either doubts his Power or Merit; from the
Prince's distrust of himself proceeds the Peoples disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
Whose Opinion of him is answerable to what
he has of himself. King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise lost the
esteem of his People, by doing Justice in private.
This can be convenient only in troublesome times,
when greater Dangers may be fear'd, if the People
don't see the Authors of Seditions punish'd e'er
they know they are taken. Thus <hi>Tiberius</hi> acted for
fear of this Inconveniency<note n="9" place="bottom">Nec Tiberius poenam ejus palam ausus, in secreta palatii parte interfici jussit, corpusque clam auferri. <hi>Tac. 2. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. In other Cases let
a Prince execute that Office boldly and vigorously,
which he holds in the Name of God and the People;
for 'twas Justice that at first gave him his Scepter, and
'tis that which must preserve it. 'Tis the Will of God,
the Harmony of Government, and the Protection of
Majesty. If the Laws be once suffer'd to be broken
unpunish'd, there will be neither Fear nor Modesty,
and without them no Peace nor Quiet<note n="10" place="bottom">Si prohibita impunè trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenderis neque metus ultrà neque pudor est. <hi>Tac. 3. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. Yet let
Princes consider that they are like Masters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
nay, that they really are such in respect to their
Subjects, and therefore let them temper Justice with
Clemency. They ought to drink the Sins of the People,
as God intimated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by that Vessel of unclean
Animals, out of which he commanded him to eat<note n="11" place="bottom">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted Beasts of the Earth, and wild Beasts, and creeping Things, and Fowls of the Air; and there came a Voice unto him, Rise, <hi>Peter,</hi> kill and eat, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> 10. 12, 13.</note>.
A Prince should have the Stomach of an Ostrich, so
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56556:96"/>
hot with Mercy as to digest Iron, and should be also
an Eagle with the Thunder of Justice, which by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one terrifies all. For if all were to be punish'd
who transgress'd, there would be none left for the
Prince to Command, for there is scarce any Man so
just, as not to have one time or other deserved
Death<note n="12" place="bottom">Vix enim quisquam adeò mali expers, ut non aliquam mortem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeatur. <hi>Tac. 2. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. The Rigour of Justice is not less dangerous
to the Crown, Life, and Empires, than Injustice. Of
this King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second is an Example, who for his
great Severity became odious to his People: And
King <hi>Peter</hi> the Cruel, lost thereby his Kingdom and
Life too. Let Justice and Mercy walk hand in hand,
so link'd together, as if they were Parts of the same
Body, yet so that one may be us'd without Offence
to the other. For this reason God gave not the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Sword, which guarded Paradise, to a Seraphim,
which is all Love and Mercy; but to a Cherubim, a
Spirit of Knowledge, who knew better how to temper
Justice with Clemency<note n="13" place="bottom">And he plac'd at the east end of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> Cherubims, and a flaming Sword, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24.</note>. Nothing is more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than a Prince over-merciful. In the times of
<hi>Nerva</hi> they us'd to say, That 'twas more difficult to
live under a Prince who bore with all, than one who
bore with nothing. For he is not less Cruel who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
all, than he who forgives none, nor is excessive
Mercy less prejudicial to the People than Cruelty<note n="14" place="bottom">Faliciores sunt impr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

and sometimes Indulgence and Forbearance does
more mischief than the Crime it self. For wickedness
grows bolder, when it can promise it self pardon.
'Twas the Clemency, or rather Negligence of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, that made his Reign as Bloody as that
of King <hi>Peter</hi> was by his Cruelty. Clemency and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
the one profuse, and the other moderate, make
the Prince beloved<note n="15" place="bottom">Mirumque amorem assecutus etat effuse clementiae, modicus severitate. <hi>Tac. 6. Ann.</hi>
                        </note>. He who can neatly and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

well; nay, his whole Reign will be a tuneful
Harmony, like that which proceeds from a Base and
Treble<note n="16" place="bottom">I will sing of Mercy and Judgment, unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.</note>. Heaven produces Corn by the mildness
of its Dew, and preserves it by the rigour of its Frosts
and Snows. If God were not merciful, we should fear
him, but not adore him; both these Virtues make him
both fear'd and lov'd. Therefore <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> us'd to say, by Justice I oblige the good, the
bad by Clemency. The one compels their Fear, the
other engages their Love. Confidence of pardon makes
Subjects arrogant, and excessive Clemency creates Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Disrespect, and occasions the Ruin of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>

these were finish'd, some time might interfere between
the Fault and the Punishment, between the Desert and

merit thanks. He soon repents, who bestows them rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

by length of time, or as not being now exemplary to

Sometimes 'twill be convenient to defer the distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Parts, though they cannot injoy his Presence, should
nevertheless participate of his Favours.</hi> Princes are seldom
mov'd by this consideration. They usually Reward
those only who are about them, being overcome either
by the importunity of Petitions, or by the flattery of
their Courtiers, or through want of Resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
them. And so as Rivers only refresh the Grounds
through which they run; so they gratify and reward
those only who are near them, unmindful of the Pains
and Perils their Foreign Ministers undergo to preserve
their Authority, and to do that which they themselves
cannot. All Favours are shared among Courtiers and
Parasites; those Services are most valued, which smell
of Civet and Pulville, not those which are smear'd
with Blood and Dust; those which are seen, not those
which are heard of at a distance; as well because flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
sooner strikes the Eyes than Ears, as because the
Mind is tickled with the vain Glory of present Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Acknowledgements. For these Reasons Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Services
are sooner rewarded than Desert, Ambition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Zeal, and Complaisance before Fatigue and Toil.
A Splendor which pays it self.</p>
                     <p>He, who does Absent Services may perhaps be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
not rewarded. He will be for a while fed
with vain Hopes and Promises, but will at last die
starv'd with Despair. The Remedy is coming some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to Court, for no Letters or Memorials are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive
as Presence. The Buckets of Pretention are not
to be fill'd, unless they are dipp'd into the Court-waters.
The Presence of Princes is as fertile as that of the Sun.
All things flourish when that shines, but fade and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in its absence. To him who stands under the Tree,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56556:100"/>
the Fruit drops into his hand. Whence all covet to live
at Court, and decline Foreign Employments, in which
the Prince has most need of Ministers. This would be
remedied, if the Bait of Rewards was thrown farther
off, if they were bestow'd where deserv'd, not where
they are begg'd; without need of Petitions or Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.
King <hi>Theodorick</hi> comforted the absent, saying,

to repair sometimes to Court, ought not to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
by desiring to be dismist from their Offices, but
still retaining them, by giving several Reasons to get
leave of the Prince to be sometimes with him; for so
they may obtain what they desire, still retaining that
which if they should quit, might be confer'd upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Many either dissatisfied with their present Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Ambitious of greater, resign it, and afterwards
repent, finding their Hopes and Expectations frustrated,
for the Prince looks upon it as a Slighting and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Favour. Let no man presume so much
upon his own Person and Parts, as to think the Prince
can't Live without him. For Princes never want Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and being once Slighted, they often forget their
Chiefest. This I speak to those who canvass for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employs, not those who knowing the Vanity of

they live and die miserable.</p>

                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:56556:100"/>Modesty in receiving Rewards and Gratuities, is of
great use, together with such a prudent Carriage, as
may make them appear Obligations to farther Services,
not to drain the Prince's Liberality, for this obliges him
yet more: As God, when <hi>Solomon</hi> ask'd for nothing
but an understanding Heart, not only gave him that,
but also Riches and Glory<note n="13" place="bottom">And I have also given thee that which thou hast not ask'd, both Riches and Honour; so that there shall not be any among the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ings like unto thee, in thy days, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 13.</note>. They ought not to be
demanded as a Debt, for Virtue is to it self a fair and
large Reward; and though some acknowledgement be
due, yet does it depend upon the Prince's Favour.
And all had rather it should be receiv'd as their
Bounty, not a just Debt to desert. Whence Princes are
more inclin'd to Reward liberally small Services, but
great ones more sparingly, for they think they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more acknowledgments from the one, than
the other. Whence he who has receiv'd many favours,
may expect to receive more, for Bounty once bestow'd
causes farther Benefits. For a Prince had rather ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should acknowledge himself his Debtor, than he
his, the first being the more honourable. <hi>Lewis</hi> the

but small Reward.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Theodorick</hi> owning
this failure, confess'd, <hi>That 'twas from Ambition that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

they did not confine themselves to the strict Rules of

which consists in Virtue, and in this Foundation and
Bulwark of Religion, which sustains and defends the
Civil Power, if the People did not think that there was
another Supream Tribunal to Judge the Thoughts and

many like Examples, there are some who dare impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

He who dissembles it, does not believe it. And
if this Dissimulation be a politick Artifice to unite Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Minds, and to maintain the State, true Religion
would better do it than false, for this is fading, that
Eternal. Many Empires founded upon false Religions,
proceeding from Ignorance, God has preserv'd a long
time, rewarding by that means their Morality, and
blind Worship, and barbarous Sacrifices, with which
they fought him; not that they were acceptable to
him, but for the religious Simplicity wherewith they
were sometimes offer'd. But has never preserved those
Empires, which counterfeited Religion more through
Malice and Artifice than Ignorance. St. <hi>Isidore,</hi> at his
Death, foretold the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that if they stray'd from
the True Religion they should be subdu'd by their
Enemies; but if they persisted in it, their Grandeur
should be rais'd above all Nations. Which was verified
by the Yoak of the <hi>Africans,</hi> which began from the
time that <hi>Witiza</hi> deny'd Obedience to the Pope, after
which liberty of Worship, and licenciousness of Vice
disturbed the Publick Peace, and ruined Military Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,

Of which Piety your Royal Highness's Father, <hi>Philip</hi>
the Fourth of glorious Memory, is a signal Example
to your Royal Highness. In the beginning of whose
Reign it being argu'd in Council, whether the Truce
should be continued with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and some of his
Counsellors urging that it was not Policy to begin War,
or any change of Affairs, in the beginning of a Reign;
he oppos'd them, saying, <hi>That he would not have his
Name branded with the Infamy of having maintain'd one
hours Peace with the Enemies of God and his Crown;</hi> and
so immediately broke the Truce. For this ardent Zeal
and Constancy in the Catholick Religion, King <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redus</hi>
merited the Name of Catholick, (as long before
the Kings of <hi>France</hi> that of most Christian). In the

                     <p>Though 'tis a King's Duty to maintain Religion in
his Realms, and to promote the Worship of God, as his
Vicars in Temporal Affairs, that they may Govern to
his Glory, and their Subjects Safety; yet they ought
to know that 'tis not in them to decide Controversies
in Religion and Divine Worship, for the care of this
belongs directly to the Spiritual Head of the Church,
to whom alone Christ has given this Authority, the
Execution, Preservation, and Defence thereof only is
committed to Kings, as that Head shall order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.

'Tis necessary for the Preservation of the Purity of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56556:103"/>
Religion, that it be the same in all the Parts of the
Christian World. True Worship would soon be lost,
if each Prince might accommodate it to his own Ends
and Designs. In those Provinces and Kingdoms where
this has been attempted, there searce remain any Tracts
thereof, so that the poor distracted People are wholly
ignorant of the True Religion. The Spiritualty and
Temporalty are two distinct Jurisdictions; this is
adorn'd by the Authority of the other, and that is
maintain'd by the others Power. 'Tis an Heroick Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which submits to the Vicar of him who disposes
of Crowns and Scepters. As arbitrary and free from
the Laws as Princes pretend to be, they must still pay
Obedience to the Apostolick Decrees, and are oblig'd
to give force to them, and see them strictly observ'd in
their Dominions; especially when 'tis not only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for the Spiritual, but also the Temporal Good,
that those Holy Decrees be put in Execution, nor
should they suffer any one to violate them, to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and prejudice of their Subjects, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

Hund<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

wooden Wall they should get the better; <hi>Themistocles</hi>
interpreted <hi>Apollo</hi>'s meaning to be, that all the Citizens
should go on Ship board; which done they obtain'd a
Victory over that prodigious Fleet. The same Success
will attend a Prince, who shall embark his Grandeur
in the Ship of the Church; for if this by the Testimony
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56556:104"/>
of another Oracle not fabulous and uncertain, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
and divine, cannot be sunk, neither can that
which is embark'd in it. For this reason your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's
glorious Ancestors, were us'd to consecrate part
of the Spoils they took in War from their Enemies,
to God, as the Lord of Victories who fought for them,
offering for his Worship very considerable Revenues
and Possessions, whence innumerable Foundations and
Endowments of Churches, Cathedrals, and Convents,
took their rise; having built in <hi>Spain</hi> above Seventy
thousand Churches. Of which <hi>Samy,</hi> the first King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> alone, built a Thousand, consecrated to the
Blessed Virgin, which his Munificence was amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the many Conquests he made, and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
he won, having fought Thirty three Battels, in all
which he came off victorious. These pious Works
were like Religious Colonies, render'd by their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Arms not less powerful than Military ones; for
Artillery make not so great Breaches as Prayer. The
Prayers of the <hi>Israelites</hi> for seven Days beat down the
Walls of <hi>Iericho</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">And the People shouted with a great shout, that the Wall fell down flat, so that the People went up into the City, every Man strait before him, and they took the Ci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

asserted the Heathens to have had more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
than the Christians; upon this ground, that their
Superstition strengthned their Minds, and render'd them
more fierce and manly by the dismal sight of so many
bloody Victims, as they offer'd to the Gods in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices;
and held them only to be Men of Courage
and Magnanimity, who got the better of other Nations
rather by force than reason: Accusing on the contrary
the Institution of our Religion for recommending Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Meekness; Virtue is good for nothing but
to make Men mean spirited. What an impious and
unreasonable Opinion this! The spilling of Blood may
indeed make the Mind more barbarous and cruel, more
valiant it never can. Fortitude and Magnanimity enter

not at the Eyes, but are born within the Breast; nor
are those the most generous, who are most pleas'd
with the Blood and Slaughter of Beasts, or who live
on Man's Flesh. Our Religion does not contemn
Magnanimity, but rather promotes it, not by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to us temporary and corruptible Rewards, as the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition does, but eternal ones never to have
an end. And if a simple Crown of Lawrel, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

and could not be clear'd from the Imputation of Fraud,

whose Idolatrous Sacrifices all tend to procure their
favour. But if he sometimes also permit them to be
Victorious, 'tis not to be ascrib'd to their Devotion,

the Thirst which the <hi>Roman</hi> Army suffer'd in the

If that Faith were still, it would still work the same
effects; but whether through want of that, or for some
other secret Ends, God does sometimes permit those to
be triumph'd over, who pay him true Adoration; but
then the Victory is not a Reward to the Conqueror,

under pretence of Religion, the <hi>Graecians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
their Arms into the City within the Body of
a Wooden Horse, under pretext of a Vow to <hi>Minerva.</hi>
Neither the clattering noise of the Weapons, nor the
Advertency of the most prudent Citizens, nor the
Consideration that it could not be brought into the
City but by a Breach, nor that of its being to continue
within the Walls a considerable time, were sufficient
to open the Peoples Eyes, and to discover the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery:
Of such Influence is Religion. This <hi>Scipio
Africanus, Sylla, Sertorius, Minos, Pisistratus, Lycurgus,</hi>
and many others, have advantageously made use of to
authorize their Laws, and impose upon the People.

The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> built, where <hi>Medina

commanded in a Dream. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> believ'd that
to be Devotion which was Stratagem, that to be Piety
which was a Trick, whereby religiously to enslave and
plunder the People. By means of another Temple on
the promontory <hi>Dianea,</hi> (now <hi>Denia</hi>) the Inhabitants of

                        </hi> Malice well knows what
effect Religion has on Mens minds, and therefore
makes that the principal Instrument to execute its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
which easily impose upon the simple Vulgar, who,
poor Souls, not being able to penetrate all their ends,
believe their only tendency is to render God propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to make him prosper their Temporal Affairs here,
and reward them Eternally hereafter. What nauseous
Delusions have Nations swallow'd when gilt with
Religion, miserably abandoning themselves to Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
What servile and barbarous Custom has not that
introduc'd, to the prejudice of Liberty, Life, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
Let Princes therefore be upon their Guard, in
these times particularly, when Policy puts on the Mask
of Piety, and not easily admit those Stalking-horses of
Religion, which have ruined not only Cities, but whole
Countries and Kingdoms. For, if under that Title,
Ambition and Avarice creep in, and the People be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
they will renounce God's easy Yoak, and will
look upon this Natural and Divine Law of Religion
to be nothing but a piece of State Policy; and that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56556:110"/>
Princes under that Veil conceal their Methods to keep
Subjects in Allegiance, and strip them of their Fortunes.
Let Princes therefore throughly examine, whether the
Novelty introduc'd be really upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or meerly a specious pretence to the prejudice of
their Power and Authority, to the detriment of their
Subjects, or the Publick Peace; which they may find
out by the ends it proposes, by observing to what such
Innovations tend, whether to Interest or Ambition,
whether they conduce to the Spiritual Good or not;
or if this can't be procur'd by other means less prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.
In such cases an Evil is with less danger prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than afterwards remedied; and the only means to
prevent it, is not to give place to these Pretexts and
Abuses; however, if they be already introduc'd, they
ought to be corrected with all the mildness imaginable,
not rashly, nor with Violence or extream Rigour;
especially, if the Case fall not under the Prince's Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but with extraordinary address, having du<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and Civil Power disagree, they will throw off all

Inconveniencies of these Contentions extend even to
the Substance of Religion, which will easily bring them
to change their Opinions, and that too. And by this
means, the Prince being engag'd in Civil Broils and
Dissentions with the Clergy, and the People in new
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56556:111"/>
Opinions, all respect for things Sacred will cease, and
Errors arise upon the Eclipse of that Divine Luminary
which before enlighten'd and united their Minds;
which is the scource of the Ruin of many Princes, and
of the Revolutions of States<note n="2" place="bottom">Nullae res multitudinem efficacius regit, quam superstitio. <hi>Curtius.</hi>
                        </note>. Great prudence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to govern the People in such matters, for 'tis
equally obvious for them to despise them, which is
impious; and to be over credulous in them, which is
Superstition; this last most frequently happens, in that
their Ignorance is presently taken with appearances of
Devotion, and new Opinions, before Reason has had
time to examine them; wherefore 'tis very necessary
gradually to remove from them all occasions of Ruin,
those particularly which usually arise from frivolous
Disputations about too subtle Points, such as very little,
if at all promote Religion, not suffering them to be
defended or printed; otherwise they will be divided
into Factions, and every one's maintaining his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
with as much Heat and Obstinacy, as if they
were Matter of Faith, may occasion no less Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
than even a difference of Religions, or a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of them. It was an Apprehension of this made
<hi>Tiberius</hi> forbid the Books of the Sibyls to be seen, whose
Prophecies might cause Seditions<note n="3" place="bottom">Censuit Asinius Gallus, ut libri Sibyllini adirentur, renuit Tiberi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>An appearance often miserably deludes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, who blindly follow any Superstitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
with a Submission wholly effeminate, which
renders them Melancholy, Cowardly, and very Slaves
to their own Imaginations; which debase their Spirits,
and prompt them to idle away their time in Convents
and Pilgrimages, where oft-times many Abuses and
Vices are committed. This is an Infirmity of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56556:111"/>
and not a little prejudicial to the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Publick Safety; and unless nipp'd in the
Bud, creates great Inconveniencies and Dangers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a kind of folly that under the appearance of Good
does every thing hand over head, following new
Notions of Religion, and devilish Inventions. Some
Submission is requisite, but that without base and ssa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Bigottry; such I mean as has Virtue in esteem,

more agreeable to God and the Prince, than Convents
and Pilgrimages, this Devotion being usually celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Banquets, Balls, and Plays; like that of the

But if Malice have already got footing, and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be too weak to resist the Multitude, 'tis necessary
that Discretion perform the part of Fire and Sword:
For obstinacy in Faults sometimes increases by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely

                     <p>Great Men have anciently made use of Superstition
(as we have before intimated) to authorize their Laws,
animate their People, and keep them in Subjection and
Obedience; to this end they feigned Dreams and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations, and pretended to have private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Gods; but although these Artifices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
influence the simple People, whose Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Humour is easily affected with things that have an
appearance Supernatural: 'Tis not however allowable
for Princes to delude them with counterfeit Miracles,
and a false shew of Religion. Of what use is the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
where one may enjoy the Light it self? To
what purpose those Divine imaginary Prodigies of
Heaven, since it gives, as we see, so many real ones
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56556:112"/>
to those who with a firm Faith and Assurance expect
them from Divine Providence? How can an infinitely
Just God give success to these Arts which seem to call
in question his Care and Concern for things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that counterfeit his Omnipotence, and ascribe to
him what he is not the Author of? What certainty
in Religion can the People promise themselves, if they
see it wrested to serve the particular Ends of Princes,
and that 'tis nothing but a Veil with which they cover
their Designs, and give Truth the lye? That Policy is

                     <p>PRudence is the Rule and Measure of Virtues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that these degenerate into Vices. Wherefore
as other Virtues have theirs in the Appetite, this has its
residence in the Intellect, from thence presiding over
them all. <hi>Agatho</hi> calls it a great Goddess. This it is
which constitutes the three Forms of Government,
Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and assigns
each of them their Parts conformed to the Subjects Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
having its Eyes always intent upon their Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
as the principal end of Politicks. Prudence
is the State's Anchor, the Prince's Compass. Where

above all others renders a Man compleat, which
makes Nature so sparing in her Dispensations of it;
having given many great Wit and Capacity, very few
great Prudence; for defect of which, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Men are in Dignity, the more dangerous is their
Government; for as much as they easily transgress the
limits of Reason, and are ruined; besides, that one of
Command requires a clear Judgment to discern all
things as they are in themselves, to weigh and give
each thing its just value. This nice Examination is of
very great consequence in Princes, and as Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes

                     <p>The Virtue of Prudence consists of several Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible

Knowledge of present, and the Prospect of future times.
All these differences of time are represented in this

by private and acquired Experience: Of the former I
treat in another place. The acquir'd is either attain'd
by Conversation or History. Conversation is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56556:114"/>
with less difficulty, abundantly more satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of all Doubts and Questions, and consequently
more improving. History is a general Representation
of all the Ages of the World, and by the benefit of
that the Memory recals the Time of our Ancestors.
The faults of those who were, instruct them that now
are. Wherefore 'tis necessary that the Prince search
for true Friends, such as will relate with sincerity
things both past and present: And since they are, as
<hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> us'd to say,
Like Histories that neither flatter, nor conceal, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Truth; let him admit them particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Council, carefully observing the neglects and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Predecessors; by what Tricks they have
been put upon; the Court Artifices; the intestine and
foreign Ills of Kingdoms; and examine whether he be
not in danger of the same. Time is the best Master
of Princes. Past Ages are a kind of Hospitals, where
Policy Anatomizes the Carcasses of Monarchies and
Commonwealths which once flourished, thereby the
better to cure the Ails of the present. They are the
Sea-Charts, wherein by the Wrecks, or prosperous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations
of others, Shores are discover'd. Seas sounded,
Sands and Rocks found, and all the Lines of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
marked out; yet, are not all Books good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors;
for some advance Knavery and Deceit, which
because more practised than truth, many have recourse
to<note n="2" place="bottom">Who seek Wisdom upon Earth, the Merchants of <hi>Merrhan</hi> and <hi>Theman,</hi> the Authors of Fables, and Searchers out of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; none of these have known the way of Wisdom, or remember her Paths, <hi>Baruch 3. v.</hi> 23.</note>.

Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded to have always by

conceives an Aversion for it, as an intolerable weight,
and so chuses to leave all to the Care and Industry of
others. And if their Opinion upon any Subject be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
told him, he is in the dark, not being able to
discern whether they have determined well or ill; in
which Confusion he must necessarily be ashamed of
himself, seeing how like a dumb Idol he is, to whom
Adoration is paid, while another renders the Oracles.
For this reason, the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> calls that Prince
an Idol, who like a Shepherd that leaveth his Flock,
forgets his Duty<note n="8" place="bottom">Wo to the idle Shepherd that leaveth his Flock, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 17.</note>. He is Statue which represents,

where the Web of Affairs begins, 'tis impossible he
should finish it with success.</p>
                     <p>To avoid these and the like Inconveniences, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
requisite for the Prince at the beginning of his
Reign to apply himself to the Administration of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, that by use he may gradually learn the
Art of Government. For though they at first seem
terrible and difficult, Ambition and the Glory which
may be expected thence, will afterwards make them
pleasant and delightful. Let not fear of doing amiss
be any obstacle to him, for there's no Prudence so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but it may sometimes err. From Errors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
Experience, and from thence the best Maxims of
Government. And if at any time he happens to be in

less dangerous to miscarry himself, than succeed by

to many in that it disarms Prudence. This World is a
vast Sea of Events, tossed by various and unknown
Causes. Let us not be too much elated, if by chance
we bring our Nets to shore full with the Success of our
Wishes; nor on the other side, dejected if they prove
empty; we ought always to cast them, and expect the
Consequence with the same equality of Mind. 'Tis
impossible for that Man to enjoy any Rest, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising

Misfortunes cannot surprize one that expects the worst,
nor will disappointed Hopes expose him to Ridicule, as
they did the <hi>Persians</hi> in the War against the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
who had a great while before furnished themselves with
Marble from <hi>Paros</hi> to inscribe the Victory on, which
their hopes had long ago anticipated; but being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
overcome, the <hi>Athenians</hi> made use of that very
Marble to erect to Revenge a Statue, an everlasting
Monument of the <hi>Persian</hi> Folly. To presume to know
things to come, is in a manner a Rebellion against God,
and a foolish Contention with Divine Wisdom, which
has indeed permitted Human Prudence to guess at, but
not foretel things of this Nature, that in this uncertainty
of Accidents it may acknowledge it self more subject
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56556:118"/>
to, and dependent on its Creator. This makes Policy so
cautious and provident in its Resolutions, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how short sighted the grea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ncertain those Judgments are,
which are grounded upon Presumption. If Princes
could foreseeu future Contingences, their Councils would
not so often miscarry. And this I take to be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that as soon as <hi>Saul</hi> was elected King, God infused
into him the Spirit of Prophecy<note n="3" place="bottom">1 Sam. 10. 6.</note>.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been said, may be gathered, that
although Antiquity be venerable, and there be really
something Royal in the ways she hath opened to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
for Experience to pass more securely; yet 'tis
visible many are ruined by time, so that they grow,
impassable; and consequently the Prince ought not to
be so diffident of himself, so religiously to tread his
Ancestors Steps, as not upon occasion to venture to go
another way of his own. Innovations are not always
dangerous; it is sometimes convenient to introduce
them. Were there no Alterations, the World would
never be perfected, which advances in Wisdom as it
does in Age. The most ancient Customs were new.
And what we now see without Example, will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
a Precedent. What we now follow by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
was begun without it. Our Age also may leave
many glorious Inventions for Posterity to imitate; nor
is every thing the Ancients have done the best, no
more than all the Moderns do now, will be approved
by After-ages. Many Abuses have descended to us
from our Ancestors, and many severe Savage Customs
of the Ancients time has mitigated and changed for the
better.</p>

King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, used on some Occasions
the Ministery of the Religious; but whether to manage

the Inconveniences usually arising from Disputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Nobility about Precedency. However Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
are not securely intrusted to them, they depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more upon the Obedience of their immediate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
than that of Princes; and if they accidentally
die, into their Hands will fall all private Letters and
Papers. Besides, for Neglect of Duty they are not
punishable, and their Example is a Disturbance to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Tranquility, and the Practices of Policy infect
their Candor and Simplicity. They are better Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
for Spiritual than Temporal Distempers. Every
Sphere has its peculiar Activity. I don't in the mean
time deny that sometimes there are to be found among
them, Persons who have had their Education in
Courts, without that Narrowness of Soul which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accompanies a monastick and retired Life, Wits so
cultivated by Learning and Observation, that Affairs
even of the greatest Consequence may be safely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, especially such as respect the Publick

in Conversation, well ordered Virtues, the Gravity

no small Recommendations in Prince's Courts to

                     <p>Experiences drawn from others Misfortunes and
Dangers, are indeed happy, but not so effectually
persuasive as our own; the former we see or hear
only; these we sensibly feel too. They are too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engraved, as I may say, on our Breasts to be soon
effaced. Shipwrecks descried from Shoar, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more affecting than anothers Relation of them;
but he who has had the Fortune to escape them,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56556:120"/>
hangs up his Rudder in the Temple of Experience for
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> perpetual Memorial of it. So that though a Prince
will improve by both, yet his own private ones he
ought most to regard, particularly observing this,
that if they proceed from any fault, Self-love is too
apt to excuse them; and that Truth late or never
comes to his Ears to undeceive him, being either stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the Palace-Gates by Malice, or concealed by
Flattery, which makes Virtue not dare to unmask it
for fear of bringing it self into Danger, because it
belongs not to it, or at least it sees all would be to
no purpose. And thus Princes ignorant of what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
they have been guilty, how and where they
have done amiss in their Councils or Actions, cannot
correct their Errors, nor by their Experience prove
more cautious and prudent for the future. There
ought to be no Fault committed, no Miscarriage
happen in the State, whereof there should not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
faithful and sincere Information given the Prince.
There's no Sensation or Pain in any part of the Body,
but immediately is carried to the Heart, as the Prince
of Life, where the Soul has its chief Residence, and
as that whose principal Interest it is to preserve the
other Members intire. How happy were it, if Kings
well knew what Evils their Kingdoms laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
we should not see them so inveterate. Whereas
the only thing now aimed at in Courts, is to divert
the Prince's Ears with Musick, and such like Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he may not hear his Subjects Complaints,
nor say with <hi>Saul, What ail<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Thus it generally happens, the Prince first discovers
Faults, when there's either no Remedy for them, or
at least it cannot be applied without great Difficulty.
His Ministers perswade him all things succeed well,
which makes him negligently lose all Experience,
and the Instructions of Necessity, the best Mistress
of Prudence. For although Prosperity proceed from
Prudence, this does not from Prosperity. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Office of Prudence in Princes, or others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

all Mens Humours, which are discernible

which God Almighty thought so necessary to Human
Commerce, that he has wrote them visibly upon
every one's Forehead<note n="5" place="bottom">Eccl. 19. 26.</note>. Without them neither the
Prince would know how to Govern, nor Men of
Affairs obtain their Ends. Mens Minds are as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

in the research of it, are widely different; and the

Delusions of the Imagination usually are so great, that
some Men appear as irrational as the very Brutes.
Wherefore all are not to be treated with in the
same Method, but this must be varied, suitably to
the Person's Nature, as they change the Bit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Horse's Mouth. Some Tempers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and exalted, with these Reputation and Honour
are most prevaising: Others mean and abject, which
are wholly lead by private Interest and Advantage.
Some are bold and enterprizing, these are to be
gently turned from the Precipice: Others slothful
and timorous, which should be so lead by Business, that
they may see the Vanity of Danger. Some are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

and are tamed by Authority, being by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
ruined. One is full of Fire, and so quick at
Business, that with the same Expedition he dispatches
it, he immediately repents; this Man 'tis hard giving
Counsel to: Another is slow and irresolute, whom
time must teach at his own cost. Some are ignorant
and stupid, these are not to be convinced by subtle
and refined Arguments, but palpable Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Others sceptically dispute every thing, and are
guilty of an Excess of Subtilty, these must be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

in hand. Some refuse all Mens Counsel, are
wholly guided by their own; to these you are not
to give any, but so point as it were to them, and
give such Hints in a large Discourse upon the Matter,
that they may of themselves light on them, which will

executed; others know neither how to act
nor resolve without Counsel, with such as these all the
Persuasion in the World is to no purpose, so the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

be better transacted with their Counsellors.</p>

The same Variety which is visible in Dispositions,
is found also in Affairs; some are easy at first, but
afterwards increase as Rivers by the Affluence of
Rivule<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Difficulties, these are overcome by Expedition in not
giving time to their Increase. Others on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
like the Winds rise in Storms, but end calmly,
which require Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ience and Constancy. The Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of some is full of Uncertainty and Danger, in
that when one least thinks the Depth of Difficulties
appears, here one must proceed with Caution and
Courage, with Care, and a Mind provided to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
any Accident. Some require Secrecy, these
are to be carried on by Mines, that the happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
may break out before one can perceive it: Others
can't be obtained but at certain Times, in these you
ought to have all the Means ready immediately to
hoist Sail upon the first favourable Blast of Wind.
Some take Root gradually; and demand Time to come
to Maturity; here the Seed of Diligence is to be
Sowed and the Fruit waited for: Others except they
succeed presently never do at all, which must be
taken by Assault, by employing all Methods at once.
Some are so delicate and brittle, that like Glasses
they are with a Blast formed and broken, these are
to be tenderly handled: the Difficulty of others is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced
by being too much desired and pursued, here
the Arts of Lovers are useful, whose Passions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
by Slight and Disdain. In a word the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a few Affairs demands Precipitation; in more
Force prevails; in many Patience, and in almost all
Reason and Interest. Importunity has spoil'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Affairs, but it has also furthered many, as
St. <hi>Ierome</hi> said of the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>
                        <note n="7" place="bottom">Quod precibus non potuit t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56556:122"/>
Management of Affairs; he who knows how to use
this shall scarce ever Miscarry. The Husbandman
that is well acquainted with the Nature of his Soil,
and knows the proper Seed-time, may expect a
plentiful Harvest. There's a time when all things
are granted, another wherein all are denied, according
as the Mind shall be disposed, in which you may
easily see the Increase and Decrease of Business,
for being lopped like Tre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s in a proper Month,
they sprout out the more. Some Address in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and persuading by Honesty, Profit, and Ease;
Prudence in the Choice of Means, and some other
natural Endowments infinitely conduce to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefs
of Affairs, provided those Gifts of Nature be
accompanied with a discreet kind of Complaisance
and natural Grace that captivates the Mind; for
some Mens Looks and Behaviour are so disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and ungenteel, that they even shew one how
to refuse their Petitions; but although these Means
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oyned with good Judgment and Industry have a
strange Effect on Business; yet too much Confidence
ought not to be put in them, not yet should they
be despaired of. Light Affairs sometimes breed great
Difficulties; and on the other side, the lightest
Causes often obstruct the most weighty. The greatest
Prudence is sometimes blind in a Matter as clear as
the Sun; Divine Providence that has already long ago
determined in his eternal Decree, what shall become
of every thing, being thus pleased to sport with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

who can never serve the times, nor adapt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to others Natures and Customs, rather spoil
Affairs than compose them; are readier at making,
than reconciling Enemies, fitter to be Informers
than Mediators. Affairs require Persons of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Qualities to Administer them. That Man is
above all the most proper, who in his Air and Words
discovers a Soul of Candor and Veracity, whose
private Person procures him Love and Esteem; in
whom Jealousy and Cunning are from Art not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who can keep them in the most secret Place
of his Breast when they require Concealment; who
proposes with Sweetness, hears with Patience, replies
with Force, dissembles with Discretion, urges with
Attention; who obliges by Liberality, persuades by
Reason, and convinces by Experience; who in a
word designs prudently, and executes effectually. It
was with these Ministers, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
was able to succeed in all his Enterprizes.
The good Choice of these is of no le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

than the Conservation and Enlargement of any
State, for as much as all depends upon their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration;
more Kingdoms having been destroyed
by their Ignorance than by that of Princes. Let
this therefore be your Highness's chiefest Care to
examine diligently all the Qualities of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and after having given them any Place, look
now and then into their Actions, and not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
taken with, and deluded by the Draught
of their Memoirs. There being very few Ministers,
who in them draw themselves to the Life? In Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
who will be so candid, so much a Stranger to
self-love, as to confess what good he has neglected
to do, what Evil to prevent? It will be much if he
with Sincerity relate what he has actually done; some
using to write to the Prince not what they have
done or said, but what they ought to do or say.
They have thought of, and designed every thing

their Value. There Judgments are form'd, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Preventions devis'd ever after the Success;
there they are more powerful than God himself; make
the past Time present, and the present past, by
changing the Date of their Actions, as they see con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
They are Ministers who transact Affairs in
Imagination only; Men that court Applause, and
steal Rewards by their false Letters: Whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the greatest Inconveniences in the World, in
that the Prince's Privy Counsellors being directed by
those Intelligences and Advices, if they are false, the
Orders and Resolutions founded upon them will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be so too. The Holy Scripture teaches us how
Ministers, and particularly Ambassadors are oblig'd
punctually to execute their Commissions; for we see
in that <hi>Hazael</hi> had from <hi>Benhadad,</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> to
consult the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> about his Disease, he chang'd
not one word, nor dared so much as to speak in the
Third Person<note n="8" place="bottom">2 Kings 8. 9.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Ministers of extraordinary Experience are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dangerous, either for that the Prince puts too
much Confidence in them, or because biassed by
Self-love, or presuming upon their own Abilities, they
seldom think thoroughly of Affairs, and born as
'twere to overcome the most violent Tempests, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the small Storms of Inconveniences and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whereby they evidently expose themselves to
Danger. Those are in some Cases much safer, who

                     <p>A Pillar supports it self, balanced by its own weight.
If it once leans on either side, it presently falls,
and that the sooner the heavier it is. Thus Empires
stand, and are preserv'd by their own Authority and
Repute; when they begin to lose that, they begin to
fall; nor is any Earthly Power sufficient to strengthen
and prop them<note n="1" place="bottom">Nihil rerum mortalium tam instabile ac fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. Let no one trust too much to
a streight Pillar, when it inclines never so little, the
weakest Hand promotes its Ruin; that very leaning I
know not how inviting to push it; but when falling,
the strongest is unable to uphold it. One single Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sometimes overthrows the best establish'd Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56556:125"/>
which a great many can't erect again. For scarce
any Stain can so thoroughly be washed out, but some
sign of it will remain, nor any Opinion in Mens
Minds that can be entirely effaced. Dress the Infamy
as carefully as possible, it will still leave some Scars.
Wherefore, if the Crown stand not fixed and firm
upon this perpendicular Pillar of Reputation, it will
soon fall to the Ground. <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Fifth, King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> by his Credit not only preserved his own
Kingdom, but conquered that of <hi>Naples.</hi> At the same
time <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Castile,</hi> for his mean
Spirit was so far the Contempt of his Subjects, that he
admitted what Laws they thought fit to impose. The
Provinces which under <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> Princes
of great Esteem, were Firm and Loyal, rebell'd in
the Reign of <hi>Galba,</hi> a Man slothful, and universally
despised<note n="2" place="bottom">Melius Divo Iulio, Divoque Augusto notos eorum animos Galbam, &amp; infracta tributa, hostiles Spiritus induisse. <hi>Tac. 4. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>. Royal Blood and Large Dominions
are insufficient to maintain Reputation, where private
Virtue and Magnanimity are wanting; as it is not
the Frame of a Glass, but its Intrinsick Excellency
makes it valuable, Regal Majesty has not more Force
than Respect, which usually arises from Admiration
and Fear, and from these Obedience and Subjection,
without which the Princes Dignity cannot long main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it self, being founded upon the Opinion of
others; and the Royal Purple will be rather a Mark
of Derision, than Eminence and Majesty, as was visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. It is the Spirits and Native
Heat that keep the Body upright; the Legs alone
would not be a sufficient Basis. And what is Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but a kind of fine Spirit kindled in all Mens
Opinions, which raises and supports the Scepter. Let
the Prince therefore take all possible care that his
Actions may be such as will nourish and foment
these Spirits. The <hi>Parthians</hi> grounded their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56556:125"/>
upon Reputation, when they asked <hi>Tiberius</hi> to
send as of his own accord, one of <hi>Phraates</hi>'s Sons to
<hi>Rome</hi>
                        <note n="3" place="bottom">Nomine tantum, &amp; auctore opus, ut sponte Caesaris, ut genus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacis, ripam apud Euphratis cerneretur. <hi>Tac. 6. Ann.</hi>

                     <p>This Repute and Authority has yet greater Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in War, where Fear is of more Efficacy than the
Sword, and Opinion than Strength, whether of Mind
or Body, and therefore to be taken no less Notice
of than Force of Arms. This made <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi>
very prudently advise <hi>Otho</hi> to endeavour always to
keep the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate on his side, whose Authority
could never be wholly Darkned, though it might be
sometimes Eclipsed<note n="4" place="bottom">Nunquam obscura, nomina, etsi aliquando obumbrentur. <hi>Tac. 2. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>. This also made many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
submit to it, and seek its Protection<note n="5" place="bottom">Erat grande momentum, in nomine Vrbis, &amp; praetextu senatus. <hi>Tac. 1. Hist.</hi>

Differences that were between those Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> each his principal Aim was
to Conquer rather the Reputation than Arms of
his Rival; well knowing that Minds and Forces
follow more the noise of Fame, than that of the
Drum. King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second was eminently skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in this Art of preserving Reputation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

of <hi>Venice</hi> saw it self lost in that violent Storm
of the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi> yet that most Prudent
and Valiant Senate thought it better to shew their
Constancy on that Occasion, than to betray any
Cowardice by using dishonourable Means. Desire of
Dominion makes Princes mean. For want of this
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56556:126"/>
Consideration, <hi>Otho</hi> with stretch'd out Hands seem'd
to adore the People, he embraced every one, and
shewed all the servileness imaginable to gain them
to his Party, and so procur'd the Empire by those
means which declared him unworthy of it<note n="6" place="bottom">Nec d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in Indigence and Necessity it is not fit to use means
violent and inglorious, or seek the Assistance of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners;

                     <p>The Authority and Reputation of a Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from several Causes; some of which respect
his Person, others his State. The former sort are
either of Body or Mind: Of the Body, as if it
be of a suitable Frame, and a Disposition capable of
maintai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning Majesty; though the natural Defects of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56556:126"/>
Body are often supplied by Virtues of Mind. <hi>Charles
Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> had no small Imperfections
of Body; yet his great and generous Soul, his lively
Wit, his Complaisance, and other Courtly Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
made him admired by all. A grave and
austere Carriage make him pass for a Prince, who
without that would be but very contemptible; yet this
Air ought to be temper'd with Courtesy and good
Humour, that Authority may be supported without
incurring Hatred, or the Character of Arrogant; a

Thus, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> by divers Names and Titles declares the
Majesty of the Supream Creator, and Prince of all
things<note n="21" place="bottom">Isaiah 9. 6.</note>. By these therefore your Highness is to
study to enhance the Lustre of your Royal Person,
provided however they be not ascrib'd out of Levity
or Flattery, but from an universal Applause founded
upon Virtue and true Valour, such as were those of
your Highness's Ancestors, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Holy, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi>

                     <p>The Excellency of Virtues, and in general all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perfections requisite in a good Governor, procure
a Prince Esteem and Authority. One alone that shall
shine in him, whether it respect Peace or War; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
supplies the defect of all others, as if he apply
himself to Business, though not with absolute suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;
for to leave all to the Care of Ministers infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
diminishes the Force of Majesty. This was <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi>'s

                        </note>. Any one Resolution the
Prince shall have taken very opportunely without

does Constancy of Mind in both Fortunes, for the

                     <p>Equality in Actions is another thing that greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
a Prince's Character, it being a sign of a serene

                     <p>Farther to maintain Reputation, Prudence not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

For so his Power will seem infinite, if the Prince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

nothing of his Subjects but what is just and feasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

                     <p>Princes are valued at the same Rate they set upon
themselves. For altho' Honour consists in the esteem
of others; yet this is generally form'd out of a precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Opinion of every one, which (at least if pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
is greater or less, according as the Mind gathers
strength from the Valour it finds in it self, or loses it,
if without Merit. The greatest Souls are most aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

always a virtuous Humility and Modesty in this sort
of Men, but a baseness of Mind, which renders them
deservedly contemptible to every one, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

this latter is accounted Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>In these Endowments of the Mind, Chance also has
place; for a Prince happens often, even with them to
be despised, when Prudence is unhappy, or Events an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not Designs. Some Governments, good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are notwithstanding so unfortunate, that nothing
succeeds under them; which is not always the Fault
of Humane Providence, but the Divine so ordains,
when the particular Ends of this Inferior Government,
agree not with those that Superior and Universal one
proposes.</p>
                     <p>This I add withal, that all these good Qualities of
Mind and Body, are not sufficient to maintain the
Prince's Reputation, if his Family be dissolute; it is on
that depends all his Authority, nor is any thing more
difficult, than a regular Management of a Family. It
usually seems easier to Govern a whole Country than
one House; either because a Prince intent on greater
things is negligent of this, or Self-love is an Obstacle,
or for want of Courage, or out of a natural Slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or at least, because his Attendants so blind his
Eyes, that his Judgment can't apply Remedies. It was

too. From them the Prince's Actions have their value,
on them depends his good or ill Character; in as much
as others Virtues and Vices are wont to be imputed to
him. If his Domesticks are prudent, they conceal his
Faults; nay, as much as possible vindicate every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

they relate them with a Grace that challenges

It is thus, the Senses are usually deceiv'd in their
Censure of Exterior Actions, when they judge only by
the outward appearance of things, without searching
the inside. Truth depends not upon Opinion: Let the
Prince despise that, if he be sensible he act agreeable
to Reason. He will never dare enterprize any thing
difficult or extraordinary, if Fear prompts him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

look for himself, not in others. The Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

The greater a Monarchy is, the more exposed it is to

Did not the Prince prosecute Affairs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

and Constancy, he would lead but an unhappy
Life. If he at any time chance to err, Courage is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,

contracts too much the Limits of his Power, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
himself to a thousand Terrors of Imagination, which

to prevent the loss of this, or at least to preserve it,

Passion than Honour. Anger, 'tis true, has Satisfaction,

imagining he aspires to be his equal, or disparages him;
and on the other side, is very apt to slight one he sees too

necessary, that Innocence defend not it self by
Excuses, for fear of betraying Timorousness; nor good

                     <p>Nor should the Prince's Person only be a Looking-Glass
to his Subjects, but he is to shew himself such by
his State also, which is as it were his Picture, and so
in that no less than his own Person, Religion, Justice,
Clemency, and all other Imperial Virtues ought to be
conspicuous. And in as much as Councils, Seats of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Courts of Chancery, are Parts of this Glass,
in them the same Qualities should be found as are in
the whole; nay, in all particular Ministers who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it; for it very much lessens the Prince's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to appear favourable to every Pretender to dismiss
them with fair Promises, and give Incouragement to
their Hopes; and on the other side, put off his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
and other Ministers, to deter them by rough
Usage from pursuing their Petitions. An Artifice that
will soon discover it self to be unworthy a Generous
and Royal Breast. The Minister is a piece of publick
Coin, stamp'd with the Prince's Image, which, except
it be of good Allay, and represent him to the Life, will
be refused as Counterfeit<note n="24" place="bottom">Praefectus nisi formam suam refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, mali fati instar subditis efficitur. <hi>Them. Orat.</hi> 17.</note>. If the Head, which
Governs, be of Gold, the Hands also which serve should
be so too; as were those of the Spouse in the Holy

                     <p>Farther, Ambassadors are also principal Parts of this
Glass, as Persons in whom the Prince's Authority is
lodged. And certainly it would infinitely prejudice the
Publick Faith to have his Words and Veracity not
found in these: And as they are the Lieutenants of his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56556:136"/>
Power and Courage, so ought they on all Occasions
to manifest them, as if the Prince were present in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

that the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> should not be invaded, till
it had been judicially determin'd whose Title was best,
and saw it came to nothing; with singular freedom of
Mind he openly declared his King had now satisfied his

he thought most just, and immediately in the presence
of the King and Council, broke the Treaties of Peace
before made between the two Crowns. As the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

with Verdure, and blossom into that wonderful pomp
of Flowers, of so delicate a Smell. Yet by Patience and
long Expectation, we at length find the labour not lost,
nor that Care ill imployed which has produced such
Beauty and Fragrancy. The first Branches of Virtue
are harsh and thorny to our depraved Nature, but after

<hi>Theobald,</hi> Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> put his Succession to the

Steps, and steals from the Year its Days, from the Days
their Hours; his Needle wants the Pole, his Charts the
lines, his Companions patience; all things conspire
against him, but his Hope and Patience rub through
all Difficulties, till at length a new World recompences
his invincible Constancy. <hi>Ferendum &amp; Sperandum,</hi> was
a saying of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and afterwards the Emperor
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56556:138"/>
                        <hi>Macrinus</hi>'s Motto, whence that of this Emblem is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.
Some Dangers are more easy to surmount than
avoid: As <hi>Agathocles</hi> well knew, when being beaten,
and besieged in <hi>Syracuse,</hi> he did not basely Surrender
to the Enemy, but leaving a sufficient Body of
Men for the Defence of the City, marched with the
rest of his Army against <hi>Carthage,</hi> and he who could
not be victorious in one War, by this means obtain'd
a double Triumph. Rashness frequently overcomes a
Danger, and despising it often confounds an Enemy.
When <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw the <hi>Romans</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Cannae</hi>
send Succours into <hi>Spain,</hi> he began to fear their
Power and Strength. No one ought to trust Prosperity
too much, or despair in Adversity. Fortune lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both, as ready to advance as depress. Let the
Prince therefore keep in the one, and the other, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Strength of Mind, prepared to encounter
any Accident, and not suffer the Threats of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Tempest to disturb him: For sometimes the Waves
have cast a Man out of one Ship that is to be wreck'd,
into another that is to be saved. A great and generous
Soul Heaven it self favours. Let not the Prince rashly
despair for anothers Dangers, or those which Chance
brings with it. <hi>He that observeth the Wind shall not sow,
and he that regardeth the Clouds shall not reap</hi>
                        <note n="2" place="bottom">Eccl. 11. 4.</note>. Let
him not imagine he obliges any one by his Afflictions.
Tears are Womanish, nor is Fortune appeased with
such Sacrifices. A great Soul endeavours to give it self
Satisfaction or Comfort by some heroick and generous
Action: <hi>Thus</hi> Agricola, when he heard of his Son's
Death, <hi>took not the Accident as generally Men do, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously;
nor in Tears like Women; but by War diverted his
Grief</hi>

                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:56556:138"/>In suing for Offices and Honours, the Design of this
Emblem is very useful. He that can bear and hope,
knows how to get the better of his Fortune. Whereas
one that impatient of delay, thinks it base to be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and submit, shall be despised and abandon'd by the
whole World. To look on it as a point of Honour
not to obey any, is the way to command none. The
means are to be measured by the end; if in obtaining
this there be more Honour got, than is lost by them,
certainly they ought to be used. Impatience of Sufferings
we take for Generosity of Mind, when it is imprudent
Haughtiness. Honour once attain'd, the Tracks made
in ascending them, presently wear out. To endure
much in order to Advancement, is not base Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but extraordinary Strength of a Mind elevated and
aspiring. Some Tempers there are which can't abide
to wait, that would have all things ended in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
desiring now to exceed their Equals, by and by
their Superiors, and in a little while, even their own
Hopes. These hurried by this Violence of Ambition
despise the most secure means as slow, and choose to
employ the shortest, though most hazardous. But it
usually fares with them, as with Buildings raised in
haste, before the Materials have had time to dry and
settle, which immediately fall down again.</p>
                     <p>The Master-piece of Government consists in hoping
and enduring, in that these are the only means to do
things in time, without which nothing can possibly
come to maturity. Trees that at the Springs first
warmth bear Flowers, soon lose them for not wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till the Winters cold was quite gone. He, who
would ripen Affairs with the Hand, cannot have the
Satisfaction of tasting the Fruit of them. Impatience is
the cause of Miscarriages and Dangers<note n="4" place="bottom">Prov. 14. 17.</note>; it creates
Peri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

escape, we augment. Therefore for those Evils, as
well Internal as External, which have by our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56556:139"/>
been increas'd in the Commonwealth, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to let them take their Course, and be sensibly cured
by Time, than precipitate a Remedy, wherein there is
more Danger. If before we could not foresee and
prevent; at least let us learn to bear them after:
They are increas'd by Opposition. A Danger conceal'd
or not taken notice of, thereby becomes publick, and
lays greater Impediments in his way, who thought to
stop it. Fear imprudently arm'd against a Superior
Power, does but find it Exercise, and render it more
powerful by the Addition of its own Spoils. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<hi>Cerealis</hi> took to compose the Minds of those of
<hi>Treves,</hi> least they should take up Arms against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
saying, <hi>A Fabrick, as that was, which had been
the Product of Eight hundred years Success and Industry,
could not be pull'd down, but its Ruin must of necessity

Cases, 'tis a piece of no less Courage to know how to
dissemble, than to be too rash in remedying. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

the Result of Fear.</p>

                     <p>THE closer the Breath is pressed in a Trumpet,
with the greater Harmony and Variety it goes out

in a Sea-fight with the <hi>Genoeze;</hi> and that, which in all
probability was like to retard his Expedition against the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> was the very thing that furthered
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56556:140"/>
it with greater Happiness and Power; for by making
a League with <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who retain'd
him Prisoner, he obtain'd both his Liberty, and Forces
for the Conquest of that Kingdom. Necessity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
him to get his Host of his side; for in Prosperity,
indeed, every one lives to himself alone, but in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
for himself and others. Those disclose the Passions
of the Mind, otherwise forgetful of it self: Whereas,
by this it learns Caution, and arms it self with Virtues,
as means to attain real and lasting Happiness<note n="2" place="bottom">Secundae res acrioribus flimulis animum exploravit; quia miseri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Whence it is not a little easier to escape bad, than be
continued in good Fortune. In Prison first appeared
<hi>Alphonso</hi>'s extraordinary Endowments and Ornaments
of Mind, which till then had lain hid; and the Duke
of <hi>Milan</hi> charm'd with them, was ambitious of his
Friendship, and laid these Obligations upon him. He
obtain'd more by losing the Victory, than he could
have expected had he been Victor. Fortune sports be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Extreams, and takes delight in shewing her
Power, in skipping from one to another. There is no
Virtue but will shine in Adversity, as no Star but spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
with greatest Lustre in the darkest Night. Then
the weight shews the Palm's Strength when this is
raised higher under it. The Rose preserves its Leaves
longer fresh among Nettles than Flowers. Did not Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
exert it self in Adversity too; it would not deserve
Victories or Truimphs. 'Tis its Property to Conquer
by suffering. Whence it evidently appears, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
the Error (confuted by us in another place) of
those is, who advise the Prince not to be bigotted to
Virtue, but to comply with Vice when necessity shall
require; a time in which he ought more particularly
to approve himself constant in it, with greater hopes of
Success: As it usually happned to the Emperor, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
the Second of Blessed Memory; who in his
greatest Dangers would resolutely affirm, <hi>He'd rather
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56556:140"/>
lose the Empire, and all he had, and with his whole Family
beg from Door to Door, than to commit an unjust thing
to maintain his Grandeur.</hi> Words truly worthy so Pious
a Prince, whose exemplary Piety and Faith were so
acceptable to God Almighty, that he vouchsafed to
take the Imperial Scepter, and perform his Office here
on Earth, giving him several signal and miraculous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.
In the greatest Dangers and Distresses, when
all hope fail'd, and humane Prudence and Valour were
destitute of means, he always came off with most Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and greatest Triumph. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors of
old lived in Affluence of Peace, and all manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
yet were tyrannized over by their own Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and rack'd by a thousand Fears. But this Pious
Hero found Repose and Tranquility of Mind amidst
the raging Tempests, which the Fury of Rebels raised
against his Empire, and most August House The just
sings amidst Misfortunes, and the wicked Man weeps
in his Impiety. Thus the fiery Furnace was as a Choire
to the three Children<note n="3" place="bottom">Dan. 3. 50.</note>. Miseries and Hardships are
attended with great Advantages; they correct the
Prince's Pride, and reduce him to Reason; with what
fury does the Wind sometimes storm? How arrogantly
does the Sea swell and rage, its foaming Billows like
Mountains threatning Heaven and Earth! And yet a
small Shower composes and calms it. Thus Misfortunes
raining from Heaven allay the Prince's Pride and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
They make a just Governor of a Tyrant,
of a Prince careless and negligent of his Affairs, one
careful and circumspect. For, then even Necessity
obliges him to take Care of his People, to esteem No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
honour Valour, do Justice, and respect Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Power is never in greater Danger than when all
things flow prosperously. For Cares being then laid
aside, too much Security is apt to stifle Counsel and
Prudence. Ease and Idleness has been the Ruin of more
Princes than Labour. 'Tis with them as with Bodies,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56556:141"/>
which are kept in Vigor by Motion, without which
they languish and decay. Whence it appears farther,
how erroneous we are in our Judgments of Good and
Evil, scarce ever knowing what is most for our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Adversity we look on as Rigour and Cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when it is really Warning and Instruction. The
Present of Ear-rings and a Sheep, which <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends
and Relations made him, seems to intimate, that he
should endure all things with a patient, even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note n="4" place="bottom">Job 42. 12.</note>,
and that those Afflictions were precious Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of God whisper'd in his Ear. God's afflicting
us sometimes is wonderful Mercy, and on the contrary
his Recompences are Punishments; for by these he
clears, as it were, the Bill of our Debts, and by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for some of our Merits, remains Creditor to our
Offences; whereas by afflicting us, he at once pays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and excites us to Amendment.</p>

He is a Pilot, to whose Conduct the Life and Safety
of all is committed; nor is any Ship more hazardous
than a Crown exposed to so many Winds of Ambition,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56556:142"/>
so many Rocks of Enemies, and Storms of People.
King <hi>Sancho</hi> the Brave needed all his Industry to arm
himself against Fortune, and secure the Right of his
Crown. Almost the whole Science of Politicks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in knowing how to discern Times, and make use
of them: A Storm sometimes bringing a Ship sooner
into Harbour than a Calm. He, who can break the
force of ill Fortune, renders it favourable; and one
that knowing a Danger yields to it, and gives it time,
at length surmounts it. When the Sailor finds there
is no contending with the Billows, he strikes Sail and
abandons himself to them; and because his Resistance
would rather add force to the Wind, uses some nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Creek to rest his Ship in, and shelter it from the
Waves. Something must be granted Dangers, if one
would escape them. <hi>Iames</hi> the First, King of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
was sensible of the Aversion his Nobl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

had to him, and that it was by no means convenient
to increase their Fury by an untimely Opposition, but
rather to give it time to sink of it self; as Rivers do,
whose Waters in a Tempest swell and overflow their
Banks, voluntarily suffer'd himself to be play'd upon,
and as it were imprisoned, till he restored all things to
their former Calmness and Tranquility, and reinsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself in the Throne. The same discreet Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> used, when by siding with the
Grandees, and satisfying their Ambition, she preserved
the Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> during the Minority of her Son.
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Fourth<note n="†" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp.</note>. Did the Sailor think it a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to yield to a Storm, and were resolved with Sails
and Oars to withstand it, his Ruin would be inevitable.
Constancy consists not in unseasonable struggling, b<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
in hoping, and so enduring Danger, without letting
Fortune get the upper hand of one. In such Cases the
Glory is to escape safe. What seems Baseness of Mind
in them, is afterwards Magnanimity crown'd with
Success. When King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise, saw himself
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56556:142"/>
deprived of his Kingdom, putting his whole Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Assistance, made no
difficulty to beg of <hi>Alphonso de Guzman,</hi> Governor of
St. <hi>Lucar de Barameda,</hi> who upon some Disgust had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to that Prince's Court, that forgetting all former
Injuries, and remembring their ancient Amity, and his
Nobility, he would stand his Friend, and endeavour
to be an Instrument of that King's supplying him with
Men and Money. Which Letters are to this Day kept
in that most Illustrious and Ancient House.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless Kings ought not to yield to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
violence, unless in Cases of Extremity, for he
very little consults his Authority, who debases himself
by too much Condescention. The dishonourable Terms
King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Holy, constrain'd by his Non-age,

confess in desperate Cases, prudence is wont to try
all ways that Chance can render possible. It is great
Courage and Strength of Reason, on Occasions of that
Nature to restrain the Spirits, and weigh the present
Necessity, and greatness of the Danger against such
means as may contribute more to the State's Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Odium; that he was now in Years, and in a State where
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56556:143"/>
his Affairs depended more upon Reputation than
Strength. Subjects would be little beholding to the
Valour of the Prince who governs them, if he should
presently in ill Fortune submit to Necessity; and on
the other side as little to his Prudence, if when that
Fortune can't be overcome, he will however withstand
it. Courage should be moderated by Prudence and
Address, and what cannot be effected by Strength,
should be the Work of Art and Industry. 'Tis no less
glorious to avoid than to surmount a Danger. To fly
it always is Sloth; to expect, Ignorance or Surprize; to
despair Cowardice. Men of Courage make Head
against Fortune her self. The Prince<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Duty and End
is not lightly to contest with his State upon the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
but to conduct it to the Haven of Preservation
and Safety. That is esteemed valiant Wisdom, which
draws Benefit out of Adversity; as also, that which by
struggling compasses its Ends sooner. Kings, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Times and Things, are always followed, never
led by them. There's no Building, but whose Ruins,
with what Addition Industry is wont to make, may
Erect a more stately Fabrick: Nor any State so intirely
abandon'd by Fortune, that Valour cannot preserve,
and even advance, provided it consult Prudence upon
Events, and know how to make right use of them,
or at least to turn them to its Advantage. <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Catholick, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> had
divided between them the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and
the great Captain knowing the Circle of a Crown to
have but one Center, and that Empire admits of no
Companion, endeavoured immediately to get his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Share into his Hands; that in Cafe of after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
which he foresaw would arise between those
two Kings, he might be the more at leasure, and use
them afterwards to disposses the King of <hi>France</hi> of his
Part, as in Effect it happned. Accidents, it is true,
have some force; but we increase or diminish them
according to our Carriage under them. Our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
gives Divinity and Power to Fortune, in that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56556:143"/>
we lightly resign our selves to her Vicissitudes. Did we
change our Customs and Measures as oft as she does
the Times, she would not be so powerful, nor we so
subject to her Empire. The Make of our Cloaths
we alter with the Mode, but neglect our Mind and
Manners. What Wind does not the skilful Pilot make
serviceable to his Voyage? As that veres he trims his
Sails, and thus all conduce to the end he proposes.
We refuse to shake off the ill Habits of our Nature,
either out of Self-love or Imprudence, and afterwards
lay the fault on Casualty. We grow desperate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we seek to remedy our Misfortunes, and through
Obstinacy or Inadvertency, let Despair get the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over us. We cannot in Adversity lay aside that
Pride, Anger, Vain-glory, Detraction, and those
other Vices which Prosperity bred in us; nor are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great difficulty induc'd to acknowledge them that
have brought us into that unhappy Condition. Every
moment in every Affair, with whomsoever of his
Subjects the Prince shall have to do, he ought to
differ from himself and change his Nature. Nor does
this require any extraordinary Knowledge, but a
certain Disposition only, and Capacity to adapt ones
self to all Contingences, and Prudence to foresee
them.</p>
                     <p>Now, as we are lost in Adversity for want of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Sails of our Passions, and submitting to it for a
time; so also do we bring Destruction upon our selves
and Princes, when we indiscreetly and conceitedly
go about to measure their Interest, Passions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
by our own Natures and Advantages: It
being impossible for a Minister of a liberal Temper
to exert his Generosity under a Covetous, Griping
Prince; or one Valiant and Active with one Slothful
and Cowardly. Our Motions should be regulated by
the Activity of the Prince's Sphere. This was a fault
in <hi>Corbulo,</hi> who serving <hi>Claudius,</hi> a pusilanimous,
mean-spirited Prince, made many rash Attempts, by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56556:144"/>

some Ministers an imprudent Zeal is the cause of this
Error; in others, which is most frequent, Self-love
and Vain-glory, which makes them desirous to appear
prudent in the Eyes of the World, and shew their
Ability, as if, forsooth, by their means alone the
Prince succeeded; but that whatever he undertakes by
himself, or others, is faulty; and thus under Colour
of Zeal they pub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

their Prince: Artifices which generally the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
himself feels the Effect of afterwards by the loss
of his Prince's Favour. He that consults his Interest,
and would establish his Fortune, must with all possible
speed fly such Affectations, as odious to the Prince and
whole World; he should be more serviceable in Deed
than in Word; he should conform to the Prince's
Nature and Condition, reducing him to Reason, and
his Duty, under Colour of Service, with Humility and
a quiet Industry, without Noise and Arrogance<note n="5" place="bottom">Tac. 3. Ann.</note>.
It is the ruin of Valour and Virtue to be too nice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of Constancy, and to think that their whole
Reputation depends upon it; for in the mean time
others more various, who can transform themselves into
any Shape, and suit theirs to the Prince's Nature, carry
away the Gratuities and Preferments.</p>
                     <p>But these are not to be used with <hi>Aleto</hi>'s Design, to
deceive; but to prevent being unadvisedly ruined at
Court, or to render one more serviceable to the

                        </gap>e are some of such a Make, that it is
absolutely necessary for the Minister to put on their
Nature; and as I may say, to creep into them, to
make them move and act; as Men, who neither will
be directed by others Counsel, nor can dispatch their
own<note n="6" place="bottom">Neque alients consilis regi, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sua expedire. <hi>Tac. 3. Hist.</hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56556:144"/>
expedient is to be advised a Prince, but what he is in
Duty oblig'd to execute. Those courageous Counsels
which were given <hi>Vitellius,</hi> though the best in the
World, were useless because he wanted Resolution to
put them in Practice<note n="7" place="bottom">Surdae ad fortia consilia Vitellio aures. <hi>Tac. 3. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>; he was usually deaf to them.
Ministers are as it were the Prince's Sails. Now, if
they are large, and the Prince a shallow Vessel, if they
are always loosed without Consideration of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the Boat, they will certainly overset it.</p>

Thus the Pilot, when he has<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in weighing Dangers, and submitting to the less, when

than escape in the lesser. He consults more his
own Fame than the Publick Safety; or rather wants
Courage to despise the Opinions of the Multitude,
who inconsiderately, and without any knowledge of
the Accidents, condemn prudent Resolutions; and
when in Danger, are against having recourse to Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

like Courage is Cowardice; where presence of Mind
is wanting to hope in danger, the Confusion of Fear
casts us into it. When Prudence and Fortitude go hand
in hand, then Consideration takes place; and if it find
not safety in the lesser, is not affraid to encounter the
greater Danger. 'Tis a base weakness to die with fear.
There is no Valour like what necessity inspires. 'Tis
commonly the last Remedy in desperate cases, neither
to hope nor quite despair. Thus a Ship not daring to

who admiring his Bravery and Resolution, by a

of Valour, that it captivates even Enemies. Courage
has given life to more than Fear. I know not what
Divinity attends and rescues it from Dangers. When
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Holy, besieg'd <hi>Sevil, Garcias Perez de
Vargas,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Toledo,</hi> with another, being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from their Company, were passing along the

of Cowardice by a dishonourable Flight, pulls
down the Vizer of his Helmet, brandishes his Sword,
and advances by himself: The <hi>Moors</hi> knowing his'
Person, and admiring his Resolution, let him pass
without attacking him. Thus his Heroick Valour sav'd
him; for had he fled with his Companion, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had in all probability pursued and took him Prisoner.
It requires a Mind free and disingag'd to examine
Dangers; first in the Report, and afterwards in the
Quality of them: In the Rumour, because those are
generally esteem'd greatest which are farthest off. The
People hear and tremble at them, and seditiously
spread and increase them, rejoycing at their own Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
because unusual, or out of Disaffection to the

to appear firm, and to disperse such idle Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

less treacherous, when to decline one Danger we
fall into a greater, as when we surrender our selves at
Discretion to an Enemy; we consider in him only
the generosity of Pardon, not the force of Revenge
or Ambition; we measure his Compassion by our
Grief and Affliction, and are apt to persuade our
selves that we can move him to relieve us. When
<hi>Iames</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Majorca,</hi> was too weak for
his Brother-in-Law, <hi>Peter</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who
upon I know not what pretence would dispossess him
of his Dominions; he put himself into his Hands,
thinking this Submission would obtain what his Arms
could not; but that King was more influenc'd by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
than Clemency, so that he deprived him of his
Kingdom and Title. Thus Dangers deceive us, and
we find that to be the greater, which we chose as the
lesser. There can be no assurance in Counsel ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Principles that depend on anothers pleasure.
We deceive our selves in supposing others will act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is agreeable to Religion, Justice, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Friendship, or but what is consistent with
their Honour and Interest. Not considering that Men
are not always guided by their Advantage or Duty, but
rather by their private Passions and Sentiments; and
consequently their Actions are not only to be examined
by the Rule of Reason, but also by that of Malice, and
the Experience of the ordinary Injustices and Tyrannies
of the World.</p>

the Bees elect a King without a Sting, for he has no need
of Arms, who is beloved by his Subjects. Nature would
by no means have it in his power to hurt, whose duty 'tis

the threatning blow. Who would expose himself to
Hazards, except he had a Love for his Prince? Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

sided with the Infant <hi>Henry,</hi> against K. <hi>Peter</hi> the Cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one was beloved by all, the other as universally
hated. The first Principle of the ruin of Kingdoms, and
all the Revolutions in States is Hatred. The Kings <hi>Ordonno</hi>
and <hi>Fruela</hi> the Second were so abominated by their Subjects,
that the very name of King became odious; <hi>Castile</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into a Commonwealth, and the Government divided
between two Judges, one of which administred affairs of
Peace, the other those of War<note n="†" place="bottom">Mar. hist. Hisp.</note>. <hi>Portugal</hi> never took up
Arms against its Kings, nor revolted from its obedience;
the reason is, it bears a sincere affection towards them; and
if at any time it has excluded one and admitted another,
'twas, because one was belov'd, the other for Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
hated. It was the advice of <hi>Iames</hi> the First of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>

Fear of his Subjects, and to ingratiate himself with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy

A King's Power and Majesty consist not in his own Person,
but in the Affection and good Will of his Subjects. If they
be disaffected, who will oppose his Enemies? 'Tis Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
makes the people want a King, but that can never be
expected from one, who makes himself hated. The <hi>Arrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
prudently foresaw this, when having call'd to the
Crown <hi>Peter Altharez</hi> Lord of <hi>Borgia,</hi> from whom the
most ancient and illustrious Family of the Dukes of <hi>Gandia</hi>
is descended, they afterwards repented, and would not have
him for their King, because they saw he us'd them with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
and Rigour, even before his Election. Contrary to
what <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the First, King of <hi>Arragon</hi> did, who by
Love and Benevolence, engag'd the hearts of all in that
Kingdom, as also in <hi>Castile</hi> during his Reign there. We
have seen many Princes ruin'd by Fear, none ever by Love.
If therefore a Prince would be formidable, let it be to his
Enemies, but let him endeavour to be belov'd by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
without which, though he come victorious over
them, he will at last fall by the hands of these. As it befell
<hi>Bardanus</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi>

through Fear, and govern Bodies rather than Minds?
The difference between the just Prince and the Tyrant is,
That one uses Arms to maintain his Subjects in Peace, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to protect himself against them. If the strength and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56556:150"/>
power of a Prince hated, be small, he is much exposed to
danger from his Subjects; if great, yet much more. For
the greater their fear is, the more sollicitous are they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their Security, as apprehending his cruelty will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
with his Grandeur, as in <hi>Bardanus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi>

his Subjects<note n="5" place="bottom">I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. If not for fear of danger, at least in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
a Prince should avoid being terrible to those by whom
he reigns. Whence that was a very unworthy saying of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,
Let them hate me, so they fear me;</hi> as if the security
of Empire consisted in Fear: Whereas no power can be
lasting where fear bears the sway. And though <hi>Seneca</hi> said,
<hi>He knows not how to govern, who is too fearfull of Hatred;
Fear defends Kingdoms:</hi> 'Tis a Tyrannick Maxim, or is to
be understood of that vain Fear which sometimes Princes are
in of offending others, even when their Commands are just,
which doubtless is dangerous, and not a little derogatory
from their Authority. He can never reign, who wants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Courage to despise the Hatred of ill men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the good. Nor is <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Sentence justifi'd by that
of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius; Let them hate me, so they approve
me.</hi> For no action of a person hated is ever approv'd. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
blames all, and puts the worst Construction on every
thing. When once a Prince is hated, his good actions as
well as bad are interpreted against him. It seems necessary
for a Tyrant to keep his Subjects in awe, in as much as his
Empire being violent, must be supported by violent means,
there wanting those two Obligations of Nature and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subjection, which, as <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise says, <hi>are the
greatest Debts a man can owe his Lord.</hi> And the Tyrant
sensible, that without these bands 'tis impossible there
should be real Love between him and his Subjects, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
by force to make Fear effect what ought to proceed
from natural Affection; and as his disturbed Conscience
fears Cruelty against it self, it exercises it upon others<note n="6" place="bottom">Wisd. 17. 11.</note>.
But the lamentable examples of all Tyrants abundantly shew
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56556:150"/>
how short-liv'd this method is. For though we see the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
of the <hi>Turks, Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for many Ages by Fear alone, yet these barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought not to be made a Precedent: Their Manners are
so savage, that they seem to have more of the Brute than the
Man, being commonly led more by Punishment than reason,
and consequently by that only can be kept in subjection, as
Brutes are not tamed but by Force and Fear. Yet generous
Spirits suffer not themselves to be compell'd or cheated into
Obedience, but are induc'd thereto by sincerity and reason.
<hi>For,</hi> says King <hi>Alphonso, our people being loyal and couragious,
their Loyalty ought to be maintain'd by truth, and their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
by right and justice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is usually 'twixt the Prince and his Subjects such a
kind of inclination and natural Sympathy, as renders him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
without any more care; for a Prince who deserv'd
Hatred is sometimes lov'd, and on the contrary one hated
who merited Love. And though eminent Vertues and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
of Mind and Body are wont of themselves to
challenge Love, yet they have not always this effect, unless
accompained with an agreeable kind of Humour, a sweet,
obliging Air, which through the Eyes, as Windows of the
Mind, shews the inward Goodness, and engages mens Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Besides that, accidents which could not be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or some sinister apprehension may so break this Love
and good Will between the Prince and Subject, that it can
never after be re-united; yet much may be done in that case
by skill and address, in knowing how to govern to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Nobles and Commons, avoiding giving them
any occasion of displeasure, and behaving himself in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
so as to create a good opinion of his Government.
But since the means whereby the Affections of Subjects may
be procur'd, are every where scatter'd through this Book,
I shall only say here in general, that nothing contributes
more to the obtaining it, than Religion, Justice and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>But because without some Species of Fear, Love would
be soon turn'd to Contempt, and the edge of Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                        </gap> which is the result of danger from Injustice and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
So necessary it is for a Prince to make himself feared by
not suffering Indignities, maintaining Justice, and abhorring
Vice, that without such an awe in Subjects, 'twould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be long secure: For all naturally desire Liberty,
and the inferior part of man rebells against Reason, and is
incorrigible but by Fear. The Prince must therefore tame
his Subjects as the Horse-courser breaks his Colt, (the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the present Emblem) who with the same hand
strokes and curries him and threatens him with the Whip.
Both the Rod and the Manna were kept in the Ark of the
Tabernacle, to intimate, as I imagin, that Rigour and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
should be joyn'd in the Prince's person. God's Rod
and Staff comforted <hi>David;</hi> for if that wounded, this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him<note n="8" place="bottom">Ps. 22. 4. Exod. 19.</note>. When God gave the Law of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
to the <hi>Israelites</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he at once terrified
them with Thunder and Lightning, and pleasing, allur'd
them with Heavenly Musick; both the one and the other is
necessary to preserve a Love and Veneration in Subjects. Let
this therefore be the Prince's Study, to make himself at
once lov'd and fear'd: lov'd, as the Protector of his People;
fear'd, as the Soul of the Law, upon which all their Lives
and Estates depend: lov'd for his Rewards, fear'd for his
Punishments: lov'd for his Goodness, fear'd for his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
lov'd as a Promoter of Peace, fear'd as Arbiter of War.
So that the good in loving him may find cause to fear:
the Bad in fearing him may find something to love in him.
This Fear is as necessary to the preservation of the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptre,
as that which proceeds from the Pride, Injustice, and
Tyranny of the Prince, is prejudicial and dangerous to it,

Whereas the other by conforming himself to Reason,
studies to avoid his Anger and Punishment. This Fear is
of the same brood with Love. For there can be no Love
without fear of losing the Object lov'd, and care to continue
in its favour. But since 'tis not so much in the Prince's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to beget Love as Fear, 'tis better for him to ground his
security on this than that alone, which as the product of the
Will is various and inconstant; nor is any artificial Flattery,
any forc'd Complaisance sufficient to gain the Hearts of all.
That Prince I take for a great Governour, who alive is
fear'd, and dead, lov'd by his Subjects; as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the
<hi>Catholick</hi> was, for if he be not lov'd, 'twill suffice that he is

                     <p>THere is an ancient Medal to be seen, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of which is engraven a flash of Lightning
upon an Altar, to signifie, that a Prince's severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56556:152"/>
ought to yield to Prayers: an Emblem offensive to the Eyes,
the Lightning of Punishment being represented so lively and
so near to Pardon, that fear may be apt to dash all hope in the
goodness of the Altar. And though it be fit sometimes,
that the looks of the Prince before whom the criminal bends,
should at once represent the Terror of Justice, and Mildness
of Mercy; yet this is not always proper, for that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the advice of the H. Spirit, who would have Life
and Clemency shine in a King's Countenance<note n="1" place="bottom">Prov. 16. 15.</note>. In this
Emblem therefore, instead of the Lightning I have plac'd
upon the Altar the Golden Fleece, introduc'd by <hi>Philip</hi> the
Good Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> not to signifie, as many imagin,
the fabulous Fleece of <hi>Colchos,</hi> but that of <hi>Gideon,</hi> which
for a token of Victory was moistned with the Dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when all the Country about it was dry<note n="2" place="bottom">Jud. 6. 37.</note>. A Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
whereby Meekness and Humility is express'd, as the
same is signified by that immaculate Lamb the Son of God,
offer'd for the World's Salvation. The Prince is a Victim
devoted to Fatigues and Dangers for the common good of
his Subjects. A precious Fleece, rich in Dew and other
Blessings of Heaven. Here they ought at all times to find
wherewithal to quench their Thirst, to redress their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;
let him be always affable, always sincere and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
towards them, which will be more effectual than seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Upon the sight of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s pleasing Looks, the
Conspirators immediately threw down their Arms. The
serenity of <hi>Augustus</hi> tied the hands of the <hi>Gaul,</hi> who went
to throw him down a Precipice in the <hi>Alps.</hi> The modest
and sweet Temper of King <hi>Ordonno</hi> the first strangely won
the Hearts of his Subjects. <hi>Sancho</hi> the Third was called the
<hi>Desired,</hi> not so much for the shortness of his Life, as for
his Affability. And the <hi>Arragonians</hi> received <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Infant, King <hi>Martin</hi>'s Nephew to the Crown, upo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a
liking they took to his obliging Demeanour. Modesty and
good Humour all must love. Obedience is sufficiently hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and odious of it self; let not the Prince add Rigour to
it; for that is a File, wherewith natural Liberty generally
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56556:152"/>
cuts the chains of Slavery. If Princes in Adversity think
Complaisance and Humanity to be used for a remedy, why
should it not as well in Prosperity for a Preservative? The
benign Aspect of the Prince gains a pleasing Empire over
mens minds; 'tis a dissimulation of Sovereignty.</p>
                     <p>By Complacency, I do not here mean that which is so
vulgar, that it begets Contempt, but which has so agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a mixture of Gravity and Authority, as leaves room for
Love, but a Love attended with respect: for where this is
wanting, that is apt to turn too familiar and aspire to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
And if the august part of Majesty be not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,

what is common, no one admires, and respect is the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

in the Prince's face, and something extraordinary in his

severity should be so qualified by Sweetness, that jointly they
may beget Love and Reverence in the Subject, not Fear<note n="5" place="bottom">Et videri velle non asperum, sed cum gravitate honestum, &amp; talem, ut eum non timeant obvii, sed magis revereantur. <hi>Arist. Pol. lib. 5. c.</hi> 11.</note>.

a divine Impression<note n="10" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, held out the Scepter<note n="11" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, to shew
her it was but a piece of gilded Wood, and himself a Man,
not a Vision as she imagined<note n="12" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. If Majesty too severe and
disorderly could produce this Effect in a Queen, what will
it in a private person oppressed with Poverty and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
The Holy Scriptures call a Prince Physician<note n="13" place="bottom">Isai. 3. 7.</note>, and
Father<note n="14" place="bottom">Eccl. 4. 10.</note>, and neither this cures nor that governs with
Inhumanity.</p>
                     <p>But if upon occasion, the Prince frowns upon a Subject,
let his Reprimands begin with an Encomium on his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
afterwards laying before him the Deformity of his
Crime, and thus strike him with a generous Fear, in as much
as the shadow of Vice is most conspicuous when oppos'd to
the light of Vertue; care also should be taken, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
be not so harsh and publick, that the Subject losing
his Reputation, shall withal, lose all hopes of retrieving it,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56556:153"/>
and so obstinately persist in his fault. Let Anger therefore
and Mildness, Punishment and Rewards be so intermixed,
as in the Golden Fleece, the Steels and Flints are knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and between them Flames of Fire, to signifie that
the Prince's Heart should resemble the Fire-stone or Flint,
which keeps the sparks of its Anger shut up, least they
should hurt any one rashly; yet in such a manner, that if it
happen to be struck by Injury or Contempt, it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breaks out into fire of Revenge and Justice, yet those not
so quick in execution, but it has the Dew of the Fleece at
hand to extinguish, at least to moderate them. God said to
<hi>Ezekiel, as Adamant and Flint have I made thy fore-head</hi>
                        <note n="15" place="bottom">Ezek. 3. 9.</note>,
signifying by that the constancy of Justice, and by this
the fire of Piety. But if the Prince cannot break his rough
and savage Nature, let him at least keep an obliging Family
to supply his place, giving a courteous reception to all Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Petitions. A Prince is often beloved or hated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
account of his Servants; they very much cloak their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
roughness, if they have the skill to moderate it, or to
excuse it by their Affability and Discretion.</p>
                     <p>Some Nations hide the Royal Majesty behind Veils and
Curtains when he gives Audience, without exposing him to
the people. A Custom inhumane to the Prince, severe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
to the Subjects, who usually find comfort in their Prince's
presence, if not in his hands. This Retreat may make the
Prince more fear'd, but never more beloved. 'Tis through
the Eyes and Ears that Love strikes the Heart. What we
neither see nor hear, we can't love. A Prince who refuses
the sight and speech of his Subjects, refuses to hear their
Necessities and to remedy them; the Tongue is an easie
instrument, that ought to reconcile the Minds of all: let
not the Prince make it harsh and dis-agreeable. King <hi>Iohn</hi>
the First, because he was short, and had an impediment
in his Speech, lost the <hi>Portuguese</hi> in his Pretension to that
Crown, upon the death of King <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis not sufficient for the Prince to dispatch business by
Memorials and Petitions, for by them the Sentiments are
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56556:154"/>
not so well express'd. They not being attended with Sighs
and other moving Actions, they are but dry Tears, and
have not that force upon the Prince.</p>
                     <p>The doors of Temples are always open, so also should be
those of Palaces; for Princes are God's Vicegerents, and
the Altars (as we have said) which the people fly to in their
Afflictions and Calamities. 'Twould be a scandalous thing
for a Soldier to find it more easie to charge through a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of Pikes, than to come to the presence through the
midst of <hi>Swiss</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, who, like armed Hedg-hogs,
are neither gain'd by Prayers nor Civility. <hi>Let peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                        </note>. Attention to Government, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
soften the temper and render it easie. Princes,
like Hawks, are tam'd by the assiduity of Affairs, and by
familiarity with Men. The Kingdom of <hi>Leon</hi> rebell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
King <hi>Ramirez</hi> the Third, for his difficulty of Access.
King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Holy was deny'd to none, and every
one had admittance even to his most private Apartment:
The Kings <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Twelfth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
gave publick Audience three times a Week, as did also their
Catholick Majesties, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Mar. hist. Hisp.</note>. Nature has
put doors to the Eyes and Tongue, but has left the Ears
open, that they may be ready to hear at all times. Let not
a Prince then stop 'em, but hearken favourably to those
that would speak to him. Let him comfort either by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or Hope, for that is one kind of satisfaction which
supports Merit. Let him not always use set Forms and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

King to give, and to measure his Authority by the publick
Good, not his own particular, which is the true fruit of Riches.
To some we give because they are good, to others, that they
may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

guided by these considerations, but his gifts were always
excessive and without order, without the least regard to the
Merit of the Party, as his Brother-in-law King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
observed in one of his Laws, saying, <hi>That he gave Rewards
for Shew not for Merit.</hi> Whence we may observe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
a Prince ought to observe in his Liberality,
for fear of giving occasion to his Subjects to acknowledge his
Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only to receive from him, not to obey him. An
extravagant Subject ruins only himself. But a Prince, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and State too. The Treasury would be soon at an ebb,
if the Prince should be extravagantly liberal, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that they are the Magazines for publick Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The Mountains don't squander away the Snow which
the Vapours of the Fields and Valleys heap upon its top, but
on the contrary, preserve it against Summer, and then in
gentle Streams returns it upon the same grounds it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from. They don't descend all at once, for so they
would not answer their design, and would be slighted as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
for Liberality is the greatest Enemy to Liberality; nor
do they immediately mix with the Rivers leaving the Plains
and Vallies dry, as Princes usually do, who give to the
Rich what ought to be distributed among the Poor, and
drain the thirsty sands to supply the brimfull Lakes, which
have no need of it. 'Tis a great fault to gain the favour of
the Rich at the expence of the poor; and by vain extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
to oppress the body of the State, whose ruin is always
promoted by the pride and vanity of a few. The people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
brook to see that power vainly squander'd away, which
ought to be employ'd to the preservation of them, and the
Prince's dignity. The rewards of a Prodigal are not esteem'd,
because they are common, and proceed from the vice of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance,
not the vertue of Liberality, and by giving all
to a few he offends many; that which is given to some
particular ones, being wanted in general by all. He who
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56556:156"/>
gives without care or choice, enriches indeed, but rewards
not: to give to those who deserve, 'tis necessary to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to others. So that a Prince ought to use great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Judgment in the Distribution of Rewards<note n="6" place="bottom">Psal. 98. 4.</note>.
For when they are well distributed, though they fall on but
few, they affect many. The Scriptures command all Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
to be made with Salt, which is the same as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<note n="7" place="bottom">Levit. 2. 14. Eccl. 35. 11.</note>, equally distant from Prodigality and Avarice. But
because a Prince ought to be generous to all, let him imitate
<hi>Aurora,</hi> which, as it passes, always leaves something, tho'
but Dew and Flowers. Nay often satisfies only with its
Beauty and Pleasantness. Let him give to all, but with
such Moderation, that without putting it out of his power
to give more, he may content them. Some by Presents,
some by Words, and some by Affability<note n="8" place="bottom">Eccl. 35. 11.</note>; for oftentimes
the Eyes give more than the Hands. Liberality is the only
Vertue, which should be sometimes in the opinion of others,
more than in the person of the Prince; Experience teaching
us, that 'tis sufficient that he express some Demonstrations,
with such Address, that he may be generally esteem'd libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
so that he must avoid Refusals, for 'tis a great trouble
to receive them from a Prince. What he cannot give to
day, he may give to morrow; and if he cannot, 'tis better
to let time discover it than to tell it himself. He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses,
either does not distinguish Merit, or shews his want
of Power or Will, and neither of these Declarations become
a Prince, whose Power and Grandure the Petitioner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.</p>
                     <p>Let a Prince be generous in the Reward of Vertue, but
let it be with Offices and Imployments, and other Revenues
already allotted to Liberality, not with the Crown-Rents,
and Treasury reserv'd for greater uses. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the
Catholick was very liberal, but not to the Prejudice of the
Crown. He was (at his first coming to the Crown) slow
in the Distribution of Offices, the better to gain mens minds,
and to reward those who had followed his Party. He knew
with great Prudence to mingle Liberality with Frugality.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56556:157"/>
Of which he has not only left us an Example but also a
Law, in these words: <hi>Kings ought not to be so generous and
bountifull, as that it may be term'd Extravagance; for this
vertue of Liberality ought to be used with order and measure,
without Detriment to the Crown and Royal Dignity</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">L. 3. tit. 10. lib. 5. Recop.</note>. To
lay up the better to employ, is not Avarice, but premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Liberality. To give inconsiderately, is either Vanity
or Folly. By this Parsimony King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise rais'd
the Monarchy, and lost the Crown by his profuse Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance;
one of the principal Complaints the Kingdom made
against him, was, That he had given the Empress <hi>Marth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi>
thirty thousand Marks of Silver, to redeem her Husband
<hi>Baldwin,</hi> whom the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt</hi> retain'd Prisoner; in
which he was more vain than prudent. King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second found the damage of having weakned the power
of his Crown by his too great Bounty, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
it by his last Will. Time and Opportunity ought to
guide Princes in their Liberality; sometimes it ought to be
moderated, when the Expences of War, and the publick
Necessities are great, and to be apply'd to avert Dangers,
and to facilitate Designs; in which he saves most, who spends
most: for he who gives by little and little, spends his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
without attaining his end. War is avoided, and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Peace purchased by Liberality<note n="9" place="bottom">Prov. 22. 9.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The Prodigality of a Prince may be corrected by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the management of his Treasures to thrifty frugal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
as may his Avarice by generous ones. 'Tis necessary
sometimes to let a Prince see the summ of his Liberality;
for Grants are made sometimes without consideration; and
if the Prince kept an account of his Expences he would
doubtless moderate them; and 'tis not always Liberality to
grant Gratuities, for Avarice is often vanquish'd by Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
or sometimes weary with contending, grants them
through Despair.</p>
                     <p>'Tis natural to all Princes to give to those who have most;
I know not whether through Fear or Esteem of Power.

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Motto of this Emblem has been famous to all
Antiquity. Some attribute it to <hi>Bias,</hi> to <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,
Thales</hi> and <hi>Homer;</hi> but I think 'tis more
reasonably ascrib'd to the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracles, for it seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Divine than Humane Sentence, fit to be engraven on
all the Crowns, Sceptres, and Rings of Princes. To this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56556:158"/>
is reduc'd the whole Science of Government, which consists
in avoiding Extreams, and loves the middle, where Vertue
keeps its Sphere. 'Twas ask'd <hi>Socrates,</hi> Which was the
properest Vertue for a young Man, and he answer'd, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Excess,</hi> by which he comprehended all. To this
Motto the body of the present Emblem seems well suited;
Corn lay'd by the violence of unseasonable Rain, when gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Dews were sufficient<note n="1" place="bottom">Magni animi est magna contemnere, prudentis est mediocria malle, quam nimia; ista enim utilia sunt: illa quòd superfluunt nocent. Sic s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

suit ill with Subjects, and rather disgrace than adorn them.
There are some favours so out of season, that they pass for
Injuries; What avails it for the Prince to do a benefit, if by
his austere Looks and rugged Words, he seems, as 'twere,
to throw it at one, or does it so unseasonably, that it does no
kindness. The Benefit and Favour is lost, and the hand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
that gave it. Which made King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise
say, <hi>That Rewards should be given so</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As there are errors in Excess of Rewards and Favours,
so there is also in Punishments. Such an exact Rigour
better becomes a Minister of Justice than a Prince; he is
not at his Liberty, but the Prince has the Keys of the Law
in his own hand. 'Tis not Justice which is too severe, nor
Mercy which is not moderate, and so of other Vertues.</p>
                     <p>The same Moderation a Prince out to observe in the arts
of Peace and War, so guiding the Chariot of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they did in the Games of old, that the Wheels
may not touch the Goals, for so they would be broken;
the art of the ancient Racers consisted, in measuring the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
so exactly, as to pass as near as possible, without
touching eithe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> end.</p>
                     <p>What a Prince ought to take most care of, is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of his Passions, governing them with such Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that he may neither desire, hope, love or fear with
too much Ardour and Violence, rais'd by the Will not by
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56556:158"/>
Reason. The desires of private persons may be easily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd,
but those of Princes not, for those are proportion'd
to their conditions, and these are usually greater than the
force of their Grandure, tending always to Extreams. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Princes either ruin themselves, or run into great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
through Excess of Ambition, mans desire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unlimited, and the possibility of things very narrow, it
rarely happens that the first are measured by the latter, or
that there is any Justice between them. Hence Princes
seek pretences to rob their Neighbours, nay their greatest
Friends, aspiring ever at the enlargement of their State,
without measuring their bodies with their Strength, and
their Government with Humane Capacity, which cannot
maintain all that may be acquired. The Grandure of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
lies upon their own Shoulders, and are always ready
to fall; oppress'd with their own weight. Let Princes therefore
endeavour to maintain their States, which either Succession
or Election has given them; and if any just occasion shall
offer of enlarging them, let them make use of it a God's
name, but with such caution, as the Event shall shew to
Prudence.</p>
                     <p>Ambition is not less dangerous in the Excess of its Fears
than of its Desires, especially in that which is acquired by
Violence. Fear suggests no means which are not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
made use of for its preservation. There is none of the
line of the party wrong'd, or any one who has the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
to the State, though never so remote, but is fear'd.
Tyranny usually proposes nothing less than a general ruin.

hatefull to God and Man; nor are there wanting in
such cases, some mild means, by which the mind may be
diverted, from shedding Blood, from breaking the Line of

never revolted.</p>
                     <p>When the danger is so evident, that it obliges to Defence

                     <p>These disorders of Ambition proceed from a long use
and abuse of Dominion, which covets all for it self; in
which 'tis necessary Princes should conquer themselves, and
submit to reason, however difficult the attempt appear; for
many can conquer others, few themselves. This Victory is
of Force, that of Reason. 'Tis not Valour to conquer in
Battle, but to subdue the Passions. Obedience and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
make Subjects humble and modest; Superiority and
Power render Princes proud; Pride has destroy'd more
Kingdoms than the Sword; more Princes have ruin'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
than have been undone by others. The remedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the Prince's knowledge of himself, by retiring within
himself, and considering, that though the Scepter distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
him from his Subjects, they much exceed him in
endowments of Mind, more noble than his Grandure. That
if Reason might take place, the most accomplish'd man
would be King. That the hand with which he governs the

Let all Princes learn Modesty of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the
Second, who was so familiar and affable to all, that he made
himself lov'd rather than reverenc'd. In him Goodness and
Modesty were conspicuous, and Majesty found but by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
He was not the Imperial Eagle with a sharp Beak,
and bare Talons, threatning all, but the tender Pelican,
continually digging his own Intrails to feed his people as
his own young. It cost him no pains to humble his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and make himself equal to others. He was not the
Master but Father of the World, and the excess of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
often causes Contempt, to the ruin of Princes, to him
it created more Respect, and oblig'd all Nations to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Defence. See the force of true Goodness, and of

to Fortune! He has left us in the present Emperour his
Son, the lively Portraicture of all these qualities, with
which he steals the Hearts both of Friends and Enemies.
There is no vertue more agreeable to a Prince than Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
all others would be foolish in him, if that did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
his Looks and Actions, not permitting them to exceed
themselves.</p>

remedy this contention in States, because of the difference
of condition of the parts of which they consist, yet are
they preserv'd if it be moderate, and ruin'd if excessive. As
it happens in the four Humours of the Body, though the
Blood be the most noble, and the Choler the most potent,
yet do they mutually preserve one another, while there is no
great Inequality between them; so that State will continue
long, which consists of moderate parts, and not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
between themselves. 'Twas the extravagant Riches
of some of the Citizens which caus'd the ruin of the State of
<hi>Florence,</hi> and is at present the cause of the troubles of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua.</hi>
Because in <hi>Venice</hi> they are better divided, it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
so many Ages, and if there happen any danger or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
in the Government, 'tis through the too great
poverty of some of its Magistrates. If any Republick has
been preserv'd for all these disorders and excess of its parts,
'tis through the Prudence and Industry of the Governour,
who keeps it in its Devoir, by the fear of the Laws, and
other discreet means, such as not to wrong any one, nor vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
the Privileges and Conveniencies of the Poor, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the great ones in the Administration, and in Offices; in
fine not to oppress, but rather to encourage the hope of
those who are of an high and enterprising Spirit. But this
will continue no longer than it has prudent Governours;
and because States can't be sufficiently provided for by these
temporal Remedies, which depend upon chance, 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in their first Institution, to provide means to correct
these Excesses, before they happen.</p>

Faith, or Religion it self, when for the Preservation
or Augmentation of Empire. Upon these false foundations
Duke <hi>Valentine</hi> endeavour'd to raise his Fortune, but before
he had finish'd it, it fell with that violence upon him, that
the very Fragments and Ruins of it were lost. How can
that last which is founded upon Deceit and Lyes? How
can that subsist which is violent? What force can there be
in Contracts, if the Prince, who should be their security, is
himself the first that breaks them? Who will put any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him? How can his Empire stand, who trusts more
to his own Artifices than to divine Providence. Nor for all
this, would I have a Prince so mild, as never to use force,
nor so candid and sincere, as not to know how to dissemble,
nor provide against Deceit, for so he would live exposed to
Malice, and be play'd upon by all. My design in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56556:164"/>
is, that he should be indued with Valour, but not
with that brutish and irrational Courage of Beasts, but that
which is attended by Justice, signified by the Lyon's Skin,
the Emblem of Valour, and therefore dedicated to <hi>Hercules.</hi>
Sometimes 'tis necessary for a Prince to cover his Face with
a Frown, and to oppose Fraud. He should not always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
mild. There are occasions when he must put on the
Lion's Skin, that his Subjects and Enemies may see his
Claws; and that he may be thought so severe, that Fraud
may not have the boldness to attack him with Flattery,
which way it uses to tame the minds of Princes. This, it
seems the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> would intimate, by putting a Lion's
Skin upon their Prince's head. There is no Respect nor
Reverence, where there is no fear. The People perceiving
their Prince can't be angry, and that nothing can alter his
mild Temper, always despise him; but this Severity need
not immediately come to Execution. 'Tis not necessary for
a Prince to be really angry, but only to appear so. The
Lion without discomposing himself, or thinking of hurting
any other Animals, with his very Looks infuses dread into
all; such is the Majestick force of his Eyes<note n="5" place="bottom">A Lion which is the strongest among Beasts, and turneth not away for any. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 30.</note>. But because
'tis convenient sometimes to gild force with craft, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
with mildness, to dissemble a little, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
himself to the times and persons: therefore in the
present Devise, the Lion's head is not crown'd with the
little tricks of the Fox, which are mean and base, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Generosity and Magnanimity of a Prince, but with
Serpents, the Emblem of carefull and prudent Majesty, and
in the sacred Writs the Hieroglyfick of Prudence, for their
cunning in defending their heads, in stopping their Ears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Inchantments, and in other things only tending
to their own preservation, not the prejudice of others. For
the same reason, and the like accidents, I have made use of
these words as a Motto to the present Devise, <hi>that he may
know how to reign,</hi> taken from the Motto of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
King of <hi>France, who knows not how to dissemble, knows
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56556:165"/>
not how to reign.</hi> In which the whole art of Government is
briefly comprehended; but there is need of great Prudence
and Circumspection, least this Power should turn to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and this Policy to Fraud: These Mediums nearly
bordering upon Vices. <hi>Iustus Lipsius</hi> defining Fraud in
matters of Policy, says, <hi>'tis shrewd Counsel, deviating from
Vertue and the Laws, for the good of the King and Kingdom;</hi>
by which avoiding the Extremes of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and finding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that 'tis impossible for a Prince to govern without some
Fraud and cunning, he advises a little, tolerates Mediocrity,
but forbids Extremes; bounds very dangerous to a Prince.
For who can exactly describe them? there ought not to be
such Rocks so near politick Navigation. The malice of
Power, and ambition of Rule, act sufficiently in many; if
Fraud be vicious, 'tis vicious in its least parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unworthy of a Prince. The worth and dignity of the
Royal Purple, disdains the least <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

is visible, and blemishes the Rays of these terrestrial Suns.
And how can it be suffer'd that his actions should deviate
from Vertue and the Laws, who is the very Soul thereof?
There is no Fraud without a mixture of malice and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
both opposite to Royal Magnanimity; though <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
says, That Falshood is superfluous in the Gods, they having
no need on't, but not in Princes who have great occasion for it,
and that therefore it may be allow'd them sometimes.</hi> That
which is unlawfull ought not to be allow'd, nor ought we
to make use of means in their own nature wicked, to obtain
just and honourable ends. Dissimulation and Cunning are
then only lawfull, when they don't drive to Knavery, and
prejudice the Authority and Reputation of the Prince; in
which case I don't esteem them as Vices but Prudence, or
the Daughters thereof, being both advantageous and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to a Commander: which would be, if Prudence respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
its own preservation, would make use of Fraud accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

nor are they the less allowable, because one foresees that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

not from malice, but a kind of caution.</p>
                     <p>And these arts and practices are then chiefly to be made
use of, when we treat with designing and crafty Princes;
for in such case, Distrust, Cunning, Hypocrisie, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Replies, prudent Equivocation, least a Prince should be
ins<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ared, and give occasion for others Plots and Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
defending himself with these arts, and not offending or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating
his publick Faith, what is this but being upon his
Guard? That Ingenuity is foolish, which frankly discovers
its secret Sentiments; and the State would be in danger
without some caution. 'Tis a dangerous sincerity to speak
truth always, since secrecy is the chief instrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Whatever Prince intrusts a secret to another,
at the same time intrusts his Sceptre too: It does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prince to lye, but it does to be silent, or to conceal
truth; not to trust or confide in any one rashly, but
to be wary and circumspect, that he mayn't be cheated.
This caution is extremely necessary for a Prince, without
which he would be expos'd to many and great dangers. He
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56556:166"/>
who knows and sees most, believes and trusts least, because
either Speculation, or Practice and Experience renders him
cautious. Let a Prince's mind therefore be sincere and
pure; yet skill'd in the arts and practices of others. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will shew in what cases it becomes a Prince to use
these arts, that is, when he shall observe that the Malice
and Stratagems of those with whom he deals requires it.</p>
                     <p>In all other actions a Prince ought to discover a Royal
Candor, sometimes even to those who would deceive him;
for if they interpret it favourably, their designs are broken
and begin to flag: besides no Fraud is so generous as
Truth, of which, if they can be sure, they make him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the most private secrets of their Souls, without arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with the like practices for the future. What
Nets are not spread, and what Stratagems contrived for the
Cunning and Subtilty of the Fox? who ever set snares for
the tame innocence of the Swallow?</p>
                     <p>Those Princes whom the world admires for their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Conduct can't make use of this art; for none
will believe that their actions are guided by chance or since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
the demonstrations of their truth are taken for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit:
In them Caution is accounted Malice; Prudence,
Dissimulation; and Circumspection, Deceit. Some charge
his Catholick Majesty with these Vices, because that by the
natural Vivacity of his Judgment, and his continual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in War and Peace, he was well acquainted with the
treacherous dealing, unsincerity of the times, defending
himself with so great Prudence, that his Enemies were either
taken in their own Snares, or wholly broken by Counsel and
Time. For this reason some Princes feign Sincerity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
the better to palliate their intentions, or that Malice
may not so easily trace them. So <hi>Domitian</hi> did<note n="10" place="bottom">Simul simplicitatis, ac modestiae imagine conditus, studiumque lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum, &amp; amorem carminum simulans, qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. A
Prince who would be thought wise in all things, is for that
reason not so. To know how to be ignorant seasonably is
the greatest Prudence: there's nothing more advantageous,
nothing more difficult than to be wise with Moderation:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56556:166"/>
this <hi>Tacitus</hi> commends in <hi>Agricola</hi>

                        </note>. All conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the most knowing, either through Envy, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own ignorance; or perhaps, because they suspect
that which they cannot comprehend. <hi>Saul</hi> seeing that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was too wise, he began to be cautious of him<note n="12" place="bottom">Wherefore when <hi>Saul</hi> saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 15.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Other Princes appear diverted in their actions, that they
may be thought to act casually and without design. But
such is the Malice of Policy now a days, that it not only
penetrates those arts, but cavils too at the most plain since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to the great prejudice of Truth and Publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
There being nothing that is interpreted rightly; and
Truth consisting in one point, and those in the circumference,
from whence Malice may take aim, being infinite, they fall
into great errors, who will wrest from anothers words and
actions a different sense from what they appear; and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
others Designs in the worst sense, cause both parties
to arm themselves, and so to live in continual Distrust and
Jealousie of each other. He who is most ingenious in these
Suspicions is farthest from Truth; for by the acuteness of
his wit he penetrates farther than what is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended;
and we are often positive of that in others which
is only a deceit of our own imagination. So to a Sailor the
Rocks seem to run, when 'tis only the Ship that is in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The shadows of Policy are usually greater than the
Body it self, and some times this is neglected, and this made
use of, so that there often arises greater Damage from the
prevention, than could arrive from the thing fear'd. How
oft has a Prince, through a groundless Jealousie, declared
War against him who never thought of offending him? and
both taking arms, that which was at first but a slight and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
presumption, ends in a bloody War: 'tis the
same with such, as with ill built Ships, which the more
they sally from side to side, are the sooner lost. I don't
blame Diffidence, when 'tis the Daughter of Prudence, as
we said elsewhere; but a total defect of good faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56556:167"/>
which, neither Friendship, Society nor Covenants can
be lasting. The Law of Nations would be invalid, and all
things would be expos'd to Fraud and Deceit. All things
are not acted with an ill intention. The greatest Tyrant
sometimes proposes just and honourable ends.</p>

ought so carefully to conceal their designs, that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
themselves should not penetrate them; nay, that they
should be the first that should believe otherwise and be deceiv'd,
thereby the more naturally and effectually, without the
danger of Dissimulation, which is easily discover'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and secure their real intentions, instilling the same error
into others, that so it may pass current, and be believed on
all sides. Thus <hi>Tiberius</hi> did, when some murmur'd that
he did not go to pacifie the mutinous Legions in <hi>Hungary</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> he pretended he would go with all speed, by
which deceiving the prudent, he deceiv'd also the People
and Provinces<note n="4" place="bottom">Primo prudentes, dein vulgum, diutissimè Provincias fefellit. <hi>Tac. 1. ann.</hi>
                        </note>. The same also did King <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who conceal'd his designs from his own Ambassadors,
pretending others, when 'twas convenient for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and perswade others to do so. A Prince can by
no means use these arts, if his ingenuity be not so cautious
and circumspect, as not to discover the real motions of his
mind by his manner of Government, and let his Rivals and
Enemies penetrate his heart and thoughts; that he may slip
out of their hands, when they think they have him secure.
This method by which another is deceiv'd is rather a sort
of self defence than malice, where it is used according to
reason, as the greatest Heroes have always done. What
necessity is there of discovering the heart, which nature has
on purpose hidden within the breast? even in the most slight
and frivolous affairs, 'tis pernicious to divulge them, because
it gives occasion by way of discourse to discover farther.
Yet though the heart be hid within the breast, its ails
and distempers are discover'd by the Arteries. Execution
loses its force, not without loss of the reputation of a Prince's
prudence, if he divulges his designs to the people. Secret
and unknown designs threaten all, and distract and puzzle
an Enemy. Secrecy in War is more necessary than in other
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56556:168"/>
Affairs. Few Enterprises unseasonably detected succeed well.

The method of our times is not so humane and generous.
We experience the effects of War before we know the cause

not to satisfie Injuries, or atone for Damages receiv'd, but

person, and though he well knew he sided with <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
he call'd him to him, told him, how his Vertue and Valour
were esteem'd by all, particularly by the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals,
who were Witnesses of his Bravery at the Battle of <hi>Cannae:</hi>
he honour'd him with words, supported with hopes and
promises; gave him at all times free access to his presence, and
by this courteous usage so oblig'd him, that from that time
the <hi>Roman</hi> State had not a more faithfull Friend than he.
This Dissimulation requires great care and prudence, for if
the Offender should mistrust it, he would interpret it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to bring him to Punishment, and so would sooner fire
his Mines, or endeavour to preserve himself by other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
means. Which is chiefly to be fear'd in Tumults and
Crimes of the Multitude. Thus <hi>Fabius Valens,</hi> though he
would not punish the Authors of a certain Commotion, yet
did he permit some of them to be tried<note n="7" place="bottom">Ne dissimulans suspectior foret. <hi>Tac. 2. hist.</hi>
                        </note>. But since 'tis
very difficult to purge the mind of Treason once conceiv'd,
and since such crimes ought not to go unpunished, 'tis then
only fit to connive, when greater danger attends the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or the number of Offenders makes the punishment
impracticable. This <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> consider'd, when he
commanded some Letters from <hi>Pompey</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
against him, which he had intercepted, to be burnt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open'd,
thinking 'twas the mildest method of pardoning, not
to know the crime. A piece of true Generosity and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Prudence, since 'twas impossible to punish all, not to
oblige himself to the inconveniencies of connivance. Those
of mean condition may be made examples, and the great ones
conniv'd at, till a more convenient opportunity. But where
the Delinquents may be punished without danger, 'tis safer,
by punishing them, to consult self-security, than to trust to
Dissimulation; for this often emboldens great Spirits. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
plotted to poison the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Senate, and upon
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56556:169"/>
the discovery of the Treason, the Senators thought it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a Law to regulate the Excels and Expences of
Feasts, which gave <hi>Hannibal</hi> occasion to plot afresh against
them.</p>
                     <p>That Art and Cunning most becomes a Prince, and that
Dissimulation is most allowable and necessary, which so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and forms the Looks, Words and Actions towards
him whom it would deceive, as that he mayn't mistrust
that his designs are discover'd: for by that means there will
be time to search farther into them, and either to punish or
elude them, while the party is not so sollicitous in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
of them; but if he once find himself betray'd, he
begins to tremble, and thinks himself not secure, till he has
put his designs in execution. This oblig'd <hi>Agrippina</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to understand the Murther which her Son <hi>Nero</hi>
design'd her<note n="8" place="bottom">Solum insidiarum remedium esse si non intelligerentur. <hi>Tac. 14. ann.</hi>

                     <p>THE Lion, the body of this devise, was among the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> the Emblem of Vigilance, and us'd to
be set in the Frontispieces and Porches of their
Temples. Hence <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was engraven upon
his Coin with a Lion's skin upon his head, to intimate that
he was not less carefull and vigilant than valiant; for if at any
time affairs requir'd that he should not spend much time in
sleep, he was us'd to lie with his arm out of bed, holding a
Silver ball in his hand, that if he should fall asleep, that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into a brass Bason set underneath for that purpose, might
waken him. He had never conquer'd the world, had he
been sleepy and lazy, he ought not to snore away his time,
who has the Government of People committed to him<note n="†" place="bottom">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56556:170"/>
Thus the Lion knowing himself to be King of Beasts, sleeps
but little, or if he does, 'tis with his Eyes open: he does
not confide so much in his Empire, nor relie so much on
his Majesty, as not to think it necessary to seem to be awake
even while he sleeps. The Senses do indeed require rest
sometimes, but even then 'tis necessary Princes should be
thought to be awake. A sleeping King differs not from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man: This Passion he ought to conceal from Friends
as well as Enemies; he may sleep, provided others think
him waking. Let him not depend so much upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power, as to shut his Eyes to Care and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection.
'Tis a cunning Dissimulation in the Lion to
sleep with his Eyes open, not with a design to deceive, but
only to hide his sleepiness. And if any one designing against
him be deceiv'd, finding him awake whom he thought he
had seen sleeping, 'tis his own fault not the Lion's. Nor is
this pretence below the greatness of his Mind, no more than
that other piece of cunning, of smoothing over the Tract
of his feet with his Tail to deceive the Huntsmen. There is
no Fortress secure unless guarded by Vigilance. The greater the
Prince is, the greater care he ought to be crown'd with, not
with the Sincerity of innocent Doves, but the prudence
of subtle Serpents. For as when the Lion enters the Field,
the other Beasts lay aside their natural Enmity, and give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fighting, and with joint force combine against him, so
among men all arm and unite against the strongest. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more pernicious to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> than
the greatness of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for they take from them the
Dominion of the Seas; nothing more prejudicial to <hi>France,</hi>
than the Grandure of those same Rebels, who once breaking
down the Dikes oppos'd by <hi>Spain,</hi> would, like an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soon o'erwhelm the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> as King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth wisely observ'd: and yet what weigh'd more
with both these two Crowns than their danger, their hatred,
I mean, and fear of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, rais'd that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to that Grandure and Power, which upon alteration
of affairs they may fear against themselves. We are more
sollicitous and carefull to avert present dangers than future
ones, though these are often greater. Fear obstructs the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56556:171"/>
Senses, nor permits the Mind to survey things at a distance.
A groundless Fear is often of more force than the greatest
reason of State. The power of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> is a preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
against the distempers of the <hi>Genoese</hi> liberty; the same
also preserves the Dukedom of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> augments the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Empire of the Church, maintains the Authority of
the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and secures the <hi>Venetians</hi> from the
Tyranny of the <hi>Turks;</hi> yet I know not whether the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of these Princes will acknowledge this, or act confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to this their Interest. Such Jealousies as are not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by reason, work their own ruin. They who thought
they should be safe in disarming the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Second, sound afterwards that they had need of those
arms which they had caus'd him to disband. Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
which for Reasons of State sought the ruin of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire lost their own liberty with its ruin.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Prince put much confidence in exterior respect
and ceremony, for 'tis all feign'd, and far from what it appears
to be; Complaisance is Flattery; Adoration, Fear; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
Force; and Friendship, Necessity. The good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which a Prince conceives of others, they make use of
to circumvent and betray him. All watch his motions, to
make a prey of him; all strive to overcome him by Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
whom they can't by force; few or none act sincerely
with him; for he who is fear'd, seldom hears truth; and
therefore he ought not to sleep in confidence of his own
power. Let him oppose Stratagem with Stratagem, and
Power with Power. A generous mind closely and cautiously
prevents, or couragiously resists dangers.</p>
                     <p>But though in the present Emblem we allow of the arts of
Dissimulation, nay and think them necessary with the aforesaid
restrictions, yet does it more become the Ministers than the
Princes themselves, for in them there is a certain occult
Divinity which is offended at that care: Dissimulation is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
the Daughter of Fear and Ambition, neither of which
ought to be discover'd in a Prince. The conveniences of
Dissimulation he ought to supply by silence and reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
A Prince is more belov'd for being prudent and wary,
provided he act with a Royal Sincerity. All hate Artifice,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56556:171"/>
and on the contrary, a natural and open freedom is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     <p>AN Oar under Water appears crooked and broken,
which is caus'd by the refraction of Species: so in
many things our opinion deceives us. For this
reason the Sceptick Philosophers doubted of all things, and
durst affirm nothing for certain. A wary piece of Modesty
and prudent Distruct of humane Judgment, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground: for to a certain knowledge of things, there are
required two dispositions, that which is to know, and that
which is to be known; the first is the Understanding, which
uses the external and internal Senses to form Imaginations;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56556:172"/>
the external are variously chang'd according to the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
or defect of humours. The internal are also subject
to changes, either from the same cause, or from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Affections of the Organs. Whence proceed such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions and Judgments, one judging differently of
the same things from another, and both with equal uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
for things change their shape and colour with their
places, by being near or at a distance, or because none are
purely simple, or because of natural Mixtures and Species
which interpose between them and the Senses; so that we
can't affirm things are so and so, but that they seem such,
forming an Opinion not certain Knowledge. <hi>Plato</hi> found a
yet greater incertainty in them, when he consider'd that
there was nothing of so pure and perfect nature as God;
and that in this life we could have no perfect knowledge of
any thing, but saw only things present, and those too, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
and Shadows of others, so that 'twas impossible to
reduce them to a Science. Not that I would have a Prince
a Sceptick, for he who doubts all determines nothing; nor
is there any thing more pernicious to Government, than He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
in resolving and executing. I only advise that he
would not be too positive in his opinions, but believe that he
may easily be deceiv'd in his Judgment, either through
Affection, or Passion, or false Information, or Flattery and
Insinuation, or because he don't care to hear truth which
prescribes bounds to his Authority and Will, or because of
the uncertainty of our own apprehension; or lastly, because
few things are really what they appear, especially in Policy,
which is now a-days nothing but the art of cheating, or not
being cheated; wherefore they ought to be viewed in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
lights, and a Prince ought carefully to consider and
weigh them not slightly to pass them over, least he should
give credit to appearances and groundless Stories.</p>
                     <p>These Cheats and politick Tricks can't be well known,
unless the nature of man be also known; for the knowledge
of him is absolutely necessary for a Prince, that he may know
how to govern and beware of him. For tho' Government
be an invention of men, 'tis in no danger but from them;
for Man has no greater Enemy than Man. The Eagle hurts
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56556:172"/>
not the Eagle, nor the Serpent the Serpent; but man is
continually plotting against his own kind. The Dens of
Beasts are open and unguarded, but three of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not sufficient for the guard of Cities, <hi>viz.</hi> Earth
cast up into Walls and Entrenchments, Water confin'd to
Ditches, and Fire enclos'd in Artillery. That some may
sleep, the rest must watch. What instruments are there
not invented against Life, as if it were not of it self short
enough, and subject to the infirmities of Nature; and tho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Seeds of all Vertues and Vices are in man as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Subject; 'tis with this difference, that those can't grow
and increase without the Dew of celestial and supernatural
Grace; but these do spontaneously bud out and flourish, which
is the effect and punishment of man's first Sin; and as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
suffer our selves to be led by our Inclinations and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which hurry us to ill, and as there is not the same danger
in Vertue as in Vices, we therefore will lay before a Prince
a short description of deprav'd human Nature.</p>
                     <p>Man is then the most inconstant Animal in the Creation;
pernicious both to himself and others; Changes with his
Age, Fortune, Interest and Passion; nor does the Sea vary
so oft as his condition. He is deluded by empty appearances,
and through self-conceit persists in his Errour. Revenge
and Cruelty he esteems praise-worthy and honourable. Is

he inscribes on Wax; Injuries receiv'd on Marble;
and those he offers on Brass. He is subject to Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not out

Anger. In Adversity prostrate and cringing. In Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Under shew of Friendship, he is the greatest Enemy.
Loves the Rigour of Justice in others, but hates it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>This is a description of humane nature in general, nor
are all these Vices in one person, but dispers'd in several.
And though a Prince think that some one is wholly free
from them, let him not therefore be less cautious of him,
for there is no certainty in the Judgment which is made of
the condition and nature of men. Vice often puts on the
Mask of Vertue, the better to deceive, and the best of men
may be deficient sometimes, either through human frailty,
or the inconstancy of the times, or necessity, or interest, or
appearance of publick or private good, or over-sight, or
want of knowledge; whence it happens that the good are not
less dangerous than the bad; and in case of doubt, 'tis more
prudent for a Prince to avoid the danger, remembring
(not to offend, but to defend) that, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> said, <hi>Briars

have waves of Envy and Jealousie been interpos'd between

those appear crooked and disloyal which are drawn by the

                     <p>There are others, who make advantage of the injuries

                     <p>These are the usual practices of Courts, and though they
are oft discover'd, yet they never want Patrons, nay, there
are those who will suffer themselves to be cheated twice;
whence we often see bare-fac'd Impostors remain at Court so
long; an effect of the weakness of our deprav'd Nature,
which is more taken with Lyes than Truth. We are more
apt to admire the Picture of a Horse than a real one, that
being but a Lye of th'other. What is Rhetorick with all
its Tropes and Figures, but a kind of Falshood and Cheat?
From all which we may see, how much danger there is of
a Prince's being deceiv'd in his opinion, unless he with great
application and diligence examine things, suspending his
belief, untill he not only sees the things themselves, but also
as it were, feels them, those especially which he has only
by hear-say. For the Breath of Flattery, and the Winds
of Hatred and Envy enter at the Ears, and raise the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Affections of the Mind, before there can be any
Certainty of the truth of the thing. 'Twould therefore be
very convenient for a Prince to have his Ears near his
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56556:175"/>
Thoughts and Reason. As are the Owl's (for that reason
perhaps sacred to <hi>Minerva</hi>) upon the top of its head, the
Chamber of the Senses, all of which we have need of in
hearing, least our ears should deceive us. Let a Prince
therefore take great care thereof, for when the ears are once
free from affections, and reason sits there as judge, every thing
is well examin'd; all things relating to Government depend
upon the relation of others: therefore what <hi>Aristotle</hi> said of
Bees seems improbable; that is, that they are deaf; for that
would be a great inconveniency for that prudent and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
little Animal, since those two Senses, Hearing and See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are the Instruments through which we draw Wisdom
and Experience; both these we have need of to prevent our
being deceiv'd by Passion, Nature or Inclination. The

Sun shone, were Blood<note n="17" place="bottom">And they rose up early in the Morning, and the Sun shone upon the Waters, and the <hi>Moabites</hi> saw the water on the other side as red as Blood, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 22.</note>. The same noise of the people,

When therefore a Prince shall have seen, heard, and felt
things, he can't be deceiv'd, or if he be, 'twill not be his
fault. From all which we may see how ill contriv'd was
that image of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> by which they express'd the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
of their Princes, for it had ears, but no Eyes,
these being full as necessary as those: the Ears to know things,
and the Eyes to believe them, in which the Eyes are most
trusty, for truth is no farther distant from a Lye than the
Eyes from the Ears.</p>

to Peace and War, for their usual aim is their own
particular interest, and effects don't always correspond to
our expectations. Ingenuity often approves Counsels which

He puts all their Names in a Pot, draws out one, and asks
the people what they would have done with him; they all
cry out, let him die; then he advises them to elect another;
this confounds them, and they don't know who to propose;
and so a second and third time they could not agree upon
their choice. At last their confusion taught them, that
'twas better to bear with an ill already experienc'd, than to
attempt a remedy, and so they immediately commanded the
Senators to be releas'd. The people is very furious in its
opinions, and 'tis often, especially upon any imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
a piece of great management in a Prince to govern it
with his own hand, keeping pace with it in its igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
The people are often reduc'd to their duty, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them the incoveniences which have hapned in
the like cases; for they are more mov'd by Example than

                     <p>EVEN Vertues have their Dangers; they should be
always in a Prince's Mind, but not always in exercise.
Publick interest ought to dictate when and where
to use them. Us'd without Prudence, they either become
Vices, or are not less hurtfull than them. In a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they respect only him; in a Prince both him and the
State too. They ought to suit with the common interest of
all, not with that of particular persons. Civil Science pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
certain limits to the Vertue of him who commands
and him who obeys. Justice is not in the power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
but ought always to be directed by the Laws. In
the Prince, who is the Soul thereof, it has certain conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which respect the Government in common. In the
Subject Commiseration can never be excessive; in a Prince
'tis often dangerous. To demonstrate this in the present
Emblem, I have made use of that method, which according
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56556:177"/>
to <hi>Sanaz<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ro</hi> and <hi>Garcilazo,</hi> the Shepherds us'd to catch
Crows. Which shews Princes with how much circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they ought to interest themselves in the misfortunes
and dangers of others. They fastned a Crow by the Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of its Wings to the ground, this seeing others fly by,
would, by making a grievous noise, excite them to pity, and
come down to its assistance.
<q>
                           <l>Cercavanla, i alguna mas piadosa</l>
                           <l>Del mal ageno de la companera.</l>
                           <l>Quae del fnyo à visada, ô timerosa, &amp;c.</l>
                        </q>
For that which was fastned to the ground, catches hold of
another with its Claws, thereby to free it self, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of another, which the same Compassion brought to
their assistance; so that for the sake of one another, they
are all caught. In which something may be attributed to
the Novelty of the accident, for sometimes that appears
Compassion which is only a motion of natural Inquietude.
I allow the Eyes and Heart to be mov'd with Compassion,
at the Misfortunes and Complaints of foreign Princes. But
not to arm upon every slight occasion for their Defence. For
a private person to expose himself to dangers to serve his
Friend, is brave and commendable, but in a Prince blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
if he hazzards the publick safety for the service of a
Foreigner, without good grounds and reasons of State; nor
are those of Consanguinity or private Friendship sufficient.
For a Prince is born more for his Subjects than his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Friends; he may indeed assist them, but without
incurring any damage or danger. When assistance renders
the danger so common, that the ruin of one draws after it
that of the other, there is no tie of Obligation or Piety can
excuse it: but when interests are so interwoven and united,
that one must follow the fate of th'other, who-ever assists
in that case acts his own cause; and 'tis more prudence
(as we have said) to oppose dangers in a foreign State than
to expect them at home. Also when 'tis the publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to assist the oppressed; the Prince who is most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
is, without doubt, obliged to it. For between Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Justice can't have recourse to the common Tribunals;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56556:177"/>
'tis in the Authority and Power of the strongest, that it
finds Refuge. In such case 'twould be a kind of Tyranny
to be an idle Spectator only, and give way to that Policy
which aims to imbroil other Princes, that themselves may
be more secure through their dissensions, and raise their
own fortunes upon the ruin of others, for such as these the
supreme Judge of the intentions severely punishes.</p>
                     <p>These cases require great Prudence, to weigh the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the interest, least we should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> entangle our selves
in others Misfortunes, and make their danger ours, for we
must not afterwards expect the same return. <hi>Spain</hi> pitied
the Misfortunes of the Empire, and assisted it with its Blood
and Treasures, from whence proceeded the Invasions which
<hi>France</hi> made in <hi>Italy, Flanders, Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the
whole War lying at present upon this Monarchy, yet won't
some in <hi>Germany</hi> acknowledge this, or believe that it is for
their sakes.</p>
                     <p>Experience therefore in our own and others Misfortunes
ought to make us more cautious in our Commiseration and
Assistance. How often, by assisting the Misfortunes of our
Friends, have we lost both our selves and him, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ungratefull for the benefit! How often have these
incurr'd the hatred of a Prince by those very means by
which they have endeavour'd to serv'd him. <hi>Germanicus</hi>

Services, and what is worse, won't be convinc'd of them,
nor that their liberty is subject to desert, and therefore take
great care to disengage themselves from it. Him who has
perform'd signal Services they charge with some Crime or

They seem dis-satisfied with those very Services which they
inwardly approve; to avoid being oblig'd, or they attribute
them to their own orders, and sometimes that very thing
which they desir'd and commanded to be done, they repent
of afterwards, and are angry with him who facilitated it,

                        </gap>officiousness, we had need
distinguish between Vertues, that we may know how to use
them, by considering that though they are all in us as their
proper Subject, yet do they not all operate within us. Some
are practised externally, others internally. These are For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
Patience, Modesty, Humility, Religion, among
which, some are only so far for us, that those external
ones contribute no more thereto, than the security of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society, and an esteem for their own Excellence, as
are Humility, Modesty, and Humanity. So that the more
perfect these Vertues are, the more they work upon the
Minds and Approbation of others, provided we can keep a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56556:179"/>
Decorum. Other of those Vertues, though they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
yet their Operation depends upon external Actions,
as Valour and Magnanimity. In these there is no danger,
if they be govern'd by Prudence, which prescribes time and
manner to all Vertues. For excessive and imprudent reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness
usually obstructs our interest; we losing our selves
under a Notion of Reputation and Glory, while those who
suit themselves to the Times, Necessity and Fla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tery, obtain
the Rewards and Commendations. In the exercise of those
Vertues which respect the good of others, such as Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Compassion, there is always some danger, because
neither the Rewards of Princes, nor the acknowledgments
of Friends are answerable to them; we perswade our selves
that our Services will be acceptable, and that to assist our
Misfortunes, they will reciprocally expose their own Lives
and Fortunes. Into this error we are led by our own Sense
of Gratitude, which often makes us heedless of our own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to satisfie for Obligations receiv'd. But if we fall into any
Calamity they withdraw and desert us. There were but
three of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends who visited him in his Afflictions,

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56556:179"/>
Spirit has cautioned us of this: <hi>My Son,</hi> says he, <hi>if thou
be surety for thy Friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a

art taken with thine own words</hi>

our selves from the hand of a Friend, as a Roe from the
hand of the Hunter, and as a Bird from the hand of the
Fowler<note n="19" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Do good but look about ye, is a <hi>Spanish</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
drawn from Experience. Those are not subject to
these Misfortunes who live only to themselves, nor suffer
themselves to be mov'd by Compassion or Charity, to assist
the calamities of others, being deaf to their Tears and
Groans, avoiding all occasions of intermedling with them,
whence they live free from cares and troubles, and if they
gain not new Friends, they however keep those they have;
not being esteem'd for the good they do, but for the ill they
don't do, this being in them accounted Prudence. Besides
we naturally esteem them most, who have least need of us,
who without being beholden to us, live content with their
own. Whence considering the usual custom of Mankind,
it may perhaps seem adviseable to be an idle Spectator of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Calamities, and minding only our own interests, not
to engage our selves in their dangers and troubles. But this
policy would be against our duty as Christians, Charity,
and generous Vertues, which gives us a nearer access to
God. This would dissolve all civil Society, which wholly
consists in the mutual assistance of one another. Vertue
needs no outward acknowledgments; being to it self a fair
reward. Nay, 'tis then most perfect and glorious, when it
expects the least return; for 'tis a kind of Avarice to do good
in hopes of a Retaliation, which if not obtain'd creates a
lasting resentment. Let us therefore be guided by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of what we owe our selves, and also by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God Almighty, who bestows his Blessings even on the
Ungratefull. Yet 'tis Prudence to have respect to the time
when and where acknowledgments may be expected, for 'tis
too hard for a man, after great Expences, great Hazards
and Hardships undergone for another, to meet with nothing
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56556:180"/>
but Ingratitude in return. To him who understands the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and usual ways of Mankind, this will not seem at all
new; but foreknowing it, will ward the blow, and avoid
being hurt.</p>
                     <p>We should also well consider, whether it be really our
Friend's interest for us to undertake his assistance: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we do him an injury by our diligence, because 'tis
either unseasonable or imprudent, by which we ruin both
our selves and him too. This officiousness <hi>Thraseas</hi> check'd
in <hi>Rusticus Arulenus,</hi> though in his own behalf, knowing
that kindness would be prejudicial to the Intercessor, and
of no advantage to the criminal<note n="20" place="bottom">Ne vana, &amp; reo non profitura, intercessori exitiosa inciperet. <hi>Tac. 16 ann.</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it less imprudent and dangerous to be over zealous
for the publick good and welfare of the Prince, then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when without obligation of duty, or certain prospect
of remedy, we intermeddle with their concerns to our own
apparent ruin. I don't mean, that we should be insensible
at the sight of others sufferings, or that for our own ease
and quiet we should basely truckle to the Times and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But that we should not foolishly ruin our selves, and
that we should follow the example of <hi>Lucius Piso,</hi> who in
difficult and deplorable times, knew how to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with such Prudence, that he was never the Author of
any servile proposition, and upon absolute necessity, did it
with great Moderation<note n="21" place="bottom">Nullius servilis sententiae sponte author, &amp; quoties neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitas ingrueret, sapi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in giving our advice in things which don't concern us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that therein consists the remedy of the publick ills:
not considering how easily we are deceiv'd with a conceit of
our own opinions, without particular knowledge of the
motives upon which Princes act. Nothing is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than to advise; even he who is oblig'd in duty to it,
ought to avoid it if not ask'd; for Advice is judg'd by the
event, and that depends upon future accidents, which no
Prudence can foresee, and that which falls out ill is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Counsellor, but not that which succeeds well.</p>

                     <p>HOW are Princes arm'd against foreign Enemies!
and how unprovided against domestick ones! who
follow them even through the midst of their Guards,
yet do they take no notice of them. These are Flatterers
and Parasites; nor is there less danger from their Fawns
than from an Enemy's Sword. Flattery has ruin'd more
Princes than force. What Royal Purple has not this Moth
eaten? What Sceptre has not this Worm gnaw'd? It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
it self into the tallest Cedars, and preying upon the
root soon brings them to the ground. 'Tis a damage not
discern'd, but by entire ruin; the effect is sooner seen than
the cause. 'Tis a false Silk-worm which inhabits the gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Roofs of Palaces. The present Emblem compares it
to a Lizzard, with a gay sta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ry back and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
Breast. It appears to the Prince under the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Cloak of Zeal, the better to conceal its perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

                     <p>The Lizzard changes its skin every year, so also does Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
as oft, I mean, as the Prince changes his mind. The
Ministers of King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Tenth, advis'd him to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
Queen <hi>Violante,</hi> for Barrenness, arguing, that the
Marriage was void, which they afterwards declar'd valid,
and perswaded the King to retake her to his Bed<note n="†" place="bottom">Mar. hist. Hisp.</note>

                     <p>There is no Animal more cunning than the Lizzard,
whence the Lawyers call all false practice <hi>Crimen Stelliona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
Who uses more cheats than the Flatterer, imposing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56556:181"/>
upon the Will, the noblest faculty of man; so much above
the other Senses, that without it the rest would be inslav'd.</p>
                     <p>The Lizzard does not kill him whom it wounds, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
benumbs him, and puts him, as it were, beside himself,
by raising divers passions in him. The proper quality of a
Flatterer, who with specious pretences charms the Eyes
and Ears of Princes, and put them so beside themselves, that
they can't search the truth of things. The Lizzard is so
inveterate against man, that when it casts its skin, it eats
it up, least it should be usefull in the cure of the Falling-sickness.
A Flatterer desires a Prince may not recover from
his errors; for Disabuse is the Son of Truth, which is an
utter Enemy to Flattery. Flatterers envy the prosperity
of Princes, and hate them as those who by their power, and
a certain necessity oblige them to the Slavery of Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Flattery, and force them to speak one thing and
think another.</p>
                     <p>A Prince has need of great Prudence to distinguish Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
for it consists in Praise, which he will find from those
who are far from that Vice. This is the difference that a
Flatterer promiscuously commends all, honourable or base,
good or bad; but the other only that which is just and good.
When therefore a Prince sees things attributed to him
which are due to others, or which are mere accidents<note n="5" place="bottom">O my People, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the way of thy paths, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 12.</note>;
frivolous things commended and extoll'd which don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, such as tend more to pleasure than Reputation.
Such as avert his mind from the toil of affairs, such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
more his own advantage than the publick interest, and
that the person who so commends these things, does not
rightly govern himself, that he does not shew any concern
or readiness to admonish him, when he commits any thing
below his Person and Majesty; nay, that he excuses his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and regards more his own Interest than his Service,
that he never seems offended at any thing, that he may he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
near him, that he does not associate with those who
are zealous Patriots and lovers of their Country. That he
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56556:182"/>
praises those whom he thinks agreeable to him, and whom,
if he would, he cannot turn out of favour, that when he
finds himself fixt therein, makes it his business to gain the
esteem of others, by attributing all good success to himself,
and by accusing the Prince in that he did not follow his
Counsel; that to gain credit, he brags that he reprehended
his Errors, when in private he excus'd commended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.
Such a one as this a Prince may well mark for a
Flatterer, whom he ought to avoid as the most venomous
Poison, and directly opposite to that sincere Love with
which he ought to be serv'd<note n="6" place="bottom">Elanditiae pessimum veri affectus venenum; sua cuique utilitas. <hi>Tac. 1. hist.</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>But though these marks are plain enough, yet is self Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
generally so blind, as not to discern Flattery, but suffer
it self to be coax'd with its own Praises, which exercise
an agreeable Tyranny over the Senses, so that there is no
Flattery so gross, which it does not believe its due. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this happens from a remiss and negligent Goodness,
which not duly considering the inconveniences of Flattery,
bears it, and interprets it Submission and Zeal. This was
the fault of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Galicia,</hi> who was hated of
his Subjects for listening too much to Flatterers. And King
<hi>Alphonso</hi> the Ninth, for the same reason, did not a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
the Glory of his other Vertues and Exploits. Let
Princes therefore believe, that they may be so deceiv'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Self-conceit, or their natural Goodness, that
though there be sufficient tokens to distinguish Flattery,
which that they may know and avoid, I would advise them
to read History, and observe by what Tricks and Cheats
their Ancestors were cajol'd, and what Losses they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
thereby, and then consider, whether or no they are
not serv'd in the same manner. One time only, when King
<hi>Ahasuerus</hi> could not sleep, and commanded the Chronicles
to be read to him, he presently learn'd from thence what
never any one durst tell him, the Designs and Tyranny of
his Favourite <hi>Haman,</hi> and the faithfull Services of <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat:</hi>
those hid hitherto by Dissimulation and Flattery, these
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56556:182"/>
stifled through Malice, by which being disabus'd, he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
the one and rewarded the other. Yet even in this
they ought to beware of Flattery, wherefore let them read
themselves; for perhaps if another reads, he will either
pass over those cases which should instruct them, or change
some Sentences and Words. O unhappy State of Majesty,
which can't be sure of the truth even of Books, which are
esteem'd the faithfullest Friends of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>A Prince ought also to get a sight of all Libels which
are publish'd against him: for though Malice dictate them,
yet Truth writes them, and he will find therein what his
Courtiers conceal, and gather Prudence and Instruction
from his Infamy. <hi>Tiberius</hi> seeing how he had been cheated,
in not discovering the practices of <hi>Sejanus</hi> in time, caus'd to
be publish'd the Will of <hi>Fulcinius Trius,</hi> which was a Satyr
upon him, that he might see, though to his shame, the
Truths which Flattery had conceal'd from him<note n="7" place="bottom">Quae ab haeredibus occultata, recitari Tiberius jussit: patientiam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert at is alienae ostentans, &amp; contemptor suae infamiae, an scelerum Sejani dici nescius, mox quodam modo dicta vulgari malebat, veritatisqui cui officit adulatio, per probra saltem gnarus fieri. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let not a Prince always view his own actions in the
glass of those that are about him, but rather let him consult
Strangers, zealous Men, and such as are of strict Lives and
Conversation, and observe if they all agree in one opinion:
for the variable and inconstant glasses of Flattery never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
things as they really are, but as the Prince would
have them. And 'tis better to be corrected by the wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

necessary sometimes to consult one, sometimes another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them lay aside Modesty and Fear, by letting them know

people, in which the least spot immediately appears, for the
Mob can't dissemble. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> would,
disguis'd, mix himself with the Crowd, and hear what
they said of his Actions and Government. He that would
find Truth, must seek her in the Streets. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh
of <hi>France</hi> us'd to complain, that he wanted one piece of Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
in his Palace, which was Truth. Which is too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and plain to live in Courts, being confounded in the
presence of Kings. For this reason <hi>Saul</hi> disguised himself
when he went to consult the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> that she
might answer him with more freedom; and he did this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without trusting to another<note n="11" place="bottom">And <hi>Saul</hi> disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 8.</note>. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the same method, when he sent his Wife to <hi>Ahijah</hi> to
enquire about their sick Child. He commanded her to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
her self, that he might not know her, least if he should,
he might either give her no answer at all, or not tell her
truth<note n="12" place="bottom">1 King 14. 2.</note>. Since then Truth is not to be found in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Princes, she must be trac'd out else-where; 'tis <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a King to search out a matter</hi>

of the people in the absence of the Prince, be true, yet when
they come to his ears they are so softned, and gilded with
Flattery, that they rather encourage, and blindly make him
pursue his Vices, perswading him that his actions are highly

care to make use of them, it being so agreeable to their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and nature; and so we see Coiners punish'd, but not
Flatterers, though the last are most guilty; these gild and
counterfeit our Money, those our Vices, putting them off
even to our selves for Vertues. This is a great fault, which
is still decry'd, yet still maintain'd in the Courts of Princes;
where Truth appears not without danger, especially with
haughty and passionate Princes<note n="17" place="bottom">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacius loqui non est tutum apud aures superbas, &amp; offensioni proniores. <hi>Tac. 4. ann.</hi>

accuse his Actions and Judgment, which Princes won't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
for they think he don't sufficiently respect them, who
talks to them freely. <hi>Gutierrez Fernandez</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> with
an honest and well-meaning Sincerity, told King <hi>Peter</hi> the
Cruel, what he thought of his Government, and advis'd
him to moderate his Severity; which meritorious Advice
the King took for such a crime, that he caus'd him to be
beheaded for it<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. hist. Hisp.</note>. A Prince looks upon him as his Judge,
who observes his Actions, nor can he endure him who finds
fault with them. The danger is in admonishing a Prince
what he should do, not what he would do<note n="18" place="bottom">Nam suadere Principi quod opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teat, multi laboris, &amp; periculi. <hi>Tac. 1. hist.</hi>

the reason Truth is so timorous, and Flattery so audacious.
But if any Prince would be so generous, as to think it base

Let a Prince also publickly gratifie those who shall be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
as to tell him Truth. Thus <hi>Clisthenes</hi> the Tyrant
of <hi>Sicily</hi> did, who erected a Statue to one of his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
who contradicted his Triumph, by which he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
gain'd the hearts of his Subjects, and encouraged his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Counsellors to speak their Sentiments more freely. King
<hi>Alphonso</hi> the Twelfth, being once advising about an affair of
great moment, with his Sword in his right hand, and his
Sceptre in his left, spoke to this effect: <hi>Come,</hi> says he, <hi>speak
all your minds freely, and frankly advise me what you think for
the glory of this Sword, and the advantage of this Scepter</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">

Happy that Kingdom, in which Counsel is neither embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass'd
by Respect, nor aw'd by Fear! All men know the
baseness of Flattery, but they know too the inconveniencies
of Truth, and see more danger from this than that. Who
would not speak with more sincerity and zeal to Princes,
were they all of the same temper with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who when one petition'd for some vacant
Office, reply'd, That he had long since promis'd it to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Servant, who never spoke to please, but to serve him and
the State<note n="†" place="bottom">Mar. hist. Hisp.</note>. But this generous Sincerity is very rarely to be
found; Princes being usually of King <hi>Achab</hi>'s mind, who
calling a council of Prophets, would have <hi>Micah</hi> excluded,
because, says he, <hi>he doth not prophecy good concerning me, but
evil</hi>
                        <note n="22" place="bottom">1 Kings 22. 8.</note>. For this reason, Ministers often run great Risques,
who through zeal are too forward in telling their Thoughts
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56556:184"/>
of future dangers, that they may be seasonably prevented.
For Princes had rather not know them than fear them; their
ears are prepar'd for the soft Harmony of Musick, but can't
bear the jarring sounds of impending dangers. Whence
they chose for their Counsellors and Confidents, such as
will tell them nothing but what they approve of<note n="23" place="bottom">After their own Lusts they shall heap to themselves teachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</note>, and
not what God inspires as the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> did<note n="24" place="bottom">And <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

wonder then, if without the light of Truth they lose their
way and are lost?</p>
                     <p>Would these Tell-truths be guided by Prudence, doubtless
a Prince would more value Truth, than vain and empty
Flattery; but there are few who use it seasonably; or with
that Modesty and Address that is requisite. For all that
are free are morose, and offend Princes with the asperity
of their Looks, especially when arm'd with Truth; for
some Vertues are odious, such as obstinate Severity, and a
Spirit not to be gain'd by favours. For Princes think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
slighted, when they see those measures, which are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
taken to obtain their favour are contemn'd, thinking
he who does not study to acquire them, neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
himself their Subject, nor has occasion for them. The
Superiour uses the Lancet or incision Knife of Truth,
to cure the distempers of the inferiour, but this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a caustick, which without pain benumbs, and wears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the parts infected in the Superiour. To be troublesome
with unseasonable and improper Truths, is rather Malice
than Zeal, rather Sauciness that Admonition. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
uses singular Prudence and Caution in revealing them;
for though he might have told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
their future Calamities by <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> yet he chose
rather to do it by Dream, when the Senses were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Majesty buried in Sleep, and even then not clearly, but by
Figures and Hieroglyphicks, that there might be some
time allow'd for their Interpretation, to avoid sudden Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and Consternation, as also the danger of the Ministers,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56556:185"/>
should they unask'd declare such things<note n="25" place="bottom">Gen. 41. 22. &amp; Dan. 4 2.</note>. 'Tis suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
if the Minister can make the Prince understand them;
which if he can effect by signs, let him not use words. Yet
are there some so imprudent, that they glory in bold Truths,
and are fond to be the bearers, nay sometimes the inventers
of ill News. Let these learn of what befell King <hi>Balshazzar,</hi>
to whom the hand that pronounc'd his death upon the Wall,
was not wholly visible, but only the fingers appear'd, and
but the ends of them neither; so that it could not in the
least be discover'd, who guided them; nor this by day light
but by night, writing that decretory Sentence by Candle-light,
upon the Wall in such Characters, as required some
time to be understood. While therefore the intention is
good, and accompanied by Prudence, 'twill be easie to walk
a secure and middle path, between the Slavery of Flattery
and the Arrogance of Truth; for all Truths may be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

but is Reflection; it appears Zeal but is Malice. And
this I look upon as not less pernicious than Flattery it self.
For if one be an odious Slavery, the other is a false kind of
Liberty. Hence the wisest Princes dread freedom as much
as Flattery, neither being safe, and therefore the extremes of
both are to be avoided; which was observ'd in the time of

which a gentle and modest Flattery can't sooth into good

Truth being of it self something bitter, we must sweeten the

They won't hear it if it be dry, nay are often worse for it.

                     <p>MANY reasons make me doubt, whether the
chance of birth has any part of the favour or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Princes; or whether our Conduct and
Prudence, can, without ambition and peril, find a secure
path, between a froward Obstinacy, and a despicable Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
There seems to be a certain occult force, which, if
it does not compell, does at least move our Will, and incline
it to one more than another: and if in the Senses and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Appetites there is a Sympathy and Antipathy to things,
why not in the Affections and Passions? They may perhaps,
have more power and force over the Appetite than the Will,
because that is more a Rebell to Free-Will than this, but it
can't be deny'd, but that the inclination too is of great
force, being generally attended by reason, especially when
Art and Prudence know how to adapt themselves to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56556:187"/>
of the Prince. We see in all things as well animate
as inanimate, a secret Correspondence and Friendship, whose
chains are easier broken than parted. Neither the injuries
nor adversities which King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second suffer'd for
his affection to <hi>Alvarez de Luna,</hi> nor the apparent danger
of the latter, could dissolve that firm bond of Friendship
with which their Souls were united. And though this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
be not natural, yet gratitude for past Services,
or the extraordinary merits of the Subject usually produce it.
Vertue is of it self amiable, and gratefull to the Will. 'T would
be barbarous to oblige a Prince to balance his affections with
indifferency to all, for they proceed from the heart by the
Eyes and Hands: what stanch severity can always resist the
charms of favour? How reserv'd was <hi>Philip</hi> the Second? Yet
had he not one but many particular Favourites. God himself
had some whom he peculiarly favour'd, giving them power
to stop the course of the Sun and Moon<note n="1" place="bottom">And he said in the sight of <hi>Israel,</hi> Sun, stand thou still upon <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon;</hi> and thou Moon, in the valley of <hi>Ajalon, Jos.</hi> 10. 12.</note>; The Lord

to alleviate which, 'twill be necessary to have some one near

There are many difficulties in it, which are not to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted

then 'tis necessary that the weight of Government should be
divided; 'tis natural in the choice of such an assistant to be
guided in some measure by inclination, or some secret Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy

upon desert, can be no ways dangerous; nay, 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
that the humour of the party whom the Prince takes to
assist him, should be chosen to him The question is. Whether
one or many should be chosen to this Office; if many equally
favour'd and respected, Emulation will arise, and their
Counsels will thwart one another to the detriment of the
State. So that it seems more agreeable to natural order,
that affairs should be committed to one alone, who should
supervise the rest, and by whom affairs should come digested
and methodized to the Prince, who should only substitute
him to his cares and trouble, not his power and authority,
in his Counsels not his Rewards. The Sun alone imparts
Light to the whole world, and when he sets, he leaves not
many but only one Vicegerent, the Moon, with a Lustre
much greater than that of the other Stars, who seem but as
so many inferiour Ministers to assist her. Yet neither this
nor those shine with their own, but borrow'd Light, which
the Earth acknowledges receiv'd from the Sun. Nor does
this favour misbecome Majesty, when a Prince devolves part
of the burden of Affairs upon his Favourite, so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the sovereign power and authority to himself: for this
is not favour but imployment, not so much an obligation,
as a communication of trouble; nor is this so much to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
if Princes would be so prudent, as to give it another

                     </p>
                     <p>The felicity of Subjects consists not in the Prince's being
like a loadstone, attractive of Iron and not of Gold, but in
his knowledge in chusing such a Minister as will attribute
whatever is great and commendable to him; and take all
the Reflections and Odium of the people upon himself;
one whose mind is wholly bent upon the publick good; who
manages affairs without Ambition; hears without Disdain
and debates without Passion; whose Resolves and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
have no respect to self-interest. In a word, whose
whole aim is the service and advantage of his Country, not
himself, or the preservation of his Master's favour. By this
rule one may know whether this Familiarity proceed from
pure Zeal or Tyranny. Princes ought to take great care in
the choice of such a Minister, endeavouring not to be byass'd
by Affection or fansifull Inclination, but by rare and excellent
Qualifications and Merits, for sometimes such Friendship
is not the result of deliberation but accident; it is not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
but diligence: Courts usually erect and adore some I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
which they deify, and treat with Royal Splendor and
Magnificence; they worship it upon their Knees, burn Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and offer Incense to it, imploring its assistance with
Prayers and Vows<note n="11" place="bottom">And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a God, which a little before was but honoured as a man, <hi>Wisd</hi> 14. 20.</note>. As industry can change the course

The heart of a Prince is never safe in the power of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
whose Nobility and Authority make him too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected

when this favour falls upon some great man who is truly
zealous and intent upon his Prince's Service, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and Odium will not be so great, and the orders which
are dispatch'd through the hands of such a one will be the
more readily observ'd; yet 'tis always highly necessary, if a
Prince could balance his favour between his own Authority
and the Merits of his Favourite, to commit only that part
of the administration to him, which he cannot manage
himself; for should he commit it wholly to him, he would
experience the same misfortunes with King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> when

for the Kings being embrass'd with such a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of writings were oblig'd to communicate them to some
one, and this must of necessity be a Favourite. On such a
one let a Prince bestow more peculiar marks of favour and
benevolence. For he who merits his favour and shares his
trouble, ought to have Pre-eminence above others. The
shadow of St. <hi>Peter</hi> worked Miracles<note n="16" place="bottom">Acts 5. 15.</note>. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then, if a Prince's Favourite, who is but his shadow,
acts with more Authority than others? Nevertheless, some
favours should be reserv'd for others; nor should those other
be so great, as to exceed the condition of a Subject, and
make him equal to the Prince, so as to have Court made
to him as Co-partner in the Empire, and to draw the whole
body of affairs after him, which derogates much from the
Authority and Esteem of the Prince. A Favourite should
act as the shadow not the Substance. In this the Kings of
<hi>Castile,</hi> who, in times past, had Favourites, run<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Risques; for as the power of the Kings being then not so
large, how little soever they granted, it endanger'd the

Let not the Vallies envy it this Glory, for though it be
nearer the favours of Heaven, 'tis also more expos'd to the
strokes of its. Thunder too. About its head Clouds gather,
and Storms prepare their rage, and upon it they first exert
it. 'Tis the same in Offices and Imployments more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
under Princes. The Activity of their power is most
offensive to those who are nearest it. Their Conversation is
as venomous as that of a Viper<note n="1" place="bottom">Eccles. 9. 13.</note>. Whoever walks among

be ascrib'd to divers causes, either because the Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in the favours of the one, and the ambition of the other;
yet what constancy can there be in the minds of Princes,
which the more vehement they are, are the more subject to
variety and contradiction? who can fix the affections of
him whose Senses see double, and is like the first matter,
not resting in one form, but pleas'd with variety. Who
can preserve that favour which is liable to so many chances
and turns of Humour? Who can behave himself with so nice
integrity, as to maintain the Prince's good opinion of him
with the people? The Eyes of all are upon the Favourite.
The Prince's Friends think him an Usurper of their Rewards,
his Enemies that he incenses the Prince farther against them.
These, if they return to their duty, must make the disgrace
of the Favourite one of the conditions; those if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it, lay all the blame upon him. Ambition and Envy
are always in Arms, intent upon every occasion to ruin him.
The people are so imbitter'd against him, that they impute

of seeming a man in favour, reveals them, or they are
discover'd by another, or by discourse, which are equally
pernicious to the Favourite. But though this should not
happen, the Prince will be willing to free himself from the

                     <p>Nor is the danger less, if this favour proceeds from the
Favourites being conscious of the Prince's Cowardice and
Baseness; for such favour is rather fear than inclination,
nor will a Prince indure, that his honour should depend
upon another's silence, or that there should be one who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
should despise him.</p>
                     <p>If this favour be but small, it can't resist the fury of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
but is blown down by every blast, like a tree not firmly
rooted.</p>
                     <p>If it be great, it creates Envy and Fear in the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and so makes him carefull to free himself from it; as
when we have pil'd Stones upon Stones, we at last fear lest
the heap which we have rais'd, should fall upon our own
heads, and so push them over th'other way. The Prince
sees the Statue which he erected shades his own Grandure,
and so pulls it down again. I may venture to say, that
Princes seem to delight to shew their power, as well in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down those images as in erecting them; for their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
being limited, can't seem immense, unless it return to
the center from which it proceeded, or keep in a circle.</p>
                     <p>These are the rocks against which, if the ship of favour
strike, 'tis lost, so much the surer, by how much the
more sail it makes. But if any one scape, 'tis either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it recover'd port in time, or that it ran first upon the
shore of Eternity. Is there then any Pilot so skilfull as to
know how to manage the helm of favour, and to sail in so
very dangerous a Gulf? What prudence, what art can save
him? What Chymist can fix this Mercury of Princes Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
especially, when favour founded upon eminent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
can't resist Envy and the Machinations of so many as
conspire its ruin. Neither the Kings <hi>Darius</hi> nor <hi>Achis</hi>
could defend their favour to <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> against the
hatred of the Princes and Guards<note n="23" place="bottom">Dan. 6 4.</note>; but were forc'd for
their satisfaction, to banish one, and throw the other into

be sufficent to prevent those accidents which depend
not upon the Favourite, yet may he do much in things which
depend upon him, and at least will be unblameable if he fall
into disgrace. Which consideration oblig'd me here to mark
out to him the usual causes of his ruin, arising from his own
imprudence and the malice of others, that being forewarn'd
he may avoid them. If we would attentively consider

being once masters of this favour, they loose the Helm

                     <p>At first they are diligent to appear wholly disengag'd
from their own affairs, and only intent upon the Prince's
interest, preferring his service even to their own Lives and
Fortunes; whence the Prince, persuaded that he has got in

extolls him every-where; as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did <hi>Sejanus</hi> to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

                     <p>The Favourite considering, that nothing is more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to favour than the capacity of the Prince, makes it his
whole endeavour, to keep him from knowing, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seeing or hearing any thing, or having any one about
him to inform him. He procures his aversion to business
and fatigue, by filling his mind with the diversions of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Plays, and Banquets, that his Senses being diverted,
neither his Eyes may inspect Transactions, nor his Ears
hear the Murmurs and Complaints of his people. Thus in
the Sacrifices of the Idol <hi>Moloch,</hi> the Priests made a noise
with Drums and Trumpets, to drown the Cries and Groans
of the dying Infants. Sometimes by a farther fetch, he
embarasses and confounds him with Affairs and Papers, on
purpose to tire him quickly, so we ride Colts in a boggy
ground to break them, and make them sooner take the Bit.
To which end he perswades him to assist at Audiences, by
which being wholly wearied, he may commit the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56556:195"/>
of all to the Favourite, thinking it sufficient to have
an account of affairs from him. Whence (as <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
said of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Idols) the Prince is nothing but what
the Favourite pleases<note n="47" place="bottom">Baruch 6. 46.</note>.</p>
                     <p>He would not have Affairs go smoothly and with success,
for any one can sail in a Calm, but he wishes that the Sea
may run high, and that the State may be so toss'd by the
Waves, that the Prince may be afraid to put his hand to
the Helm, and so have more need of him. And then to
stop at all Avenues to Truth, and remain sole manager of
Affairs beyond the reach of Envy, he draws him from
Court to some Retreat among his own Creatures. So <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi>

is soon remedied in his Successor, which can't be,
when the Prince is by these arts render'd unserviceable to

he lives, to the utmost Detriment of the Commonwealth.
And as 'tis daily more and more felt, it creates Discontent

insolent and insult over him, it being now not in the power
of the Prince himself to assist him. His Relations and
Friends fore-seeing his fall, and the danger which threatens
them, fear lest they too should be involv'd in the ruin<note n="52" place="bottom">Quidam male alacres, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infanstae amicitie gravis exitus imminebat. <hi>Tac. 4. ann.</hi>

                     <p>From all that has been said we may evidently see, that
the greatest danger in Favour is in the methods which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
takes to preserve it; it being the same with Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
as with People who are too curious about their Health,
who thinking to preserve it by abundance of Physick, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destroy it and shorten their days. And as in Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Body there is no better remedy than Abstinence,
leaving the rest to Nature, so when Favour begins to sicken,
the best Advice is not to tamper too much with Medicines,
but to serve his Prince with sincerity and integrity, without
affection or interest, leaving the Operation to Merit and Truth,
more durable than Artifice; and using only some Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
such as respect the Favourite, the Prince or his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
or the Court, or the People, or Strangers.</p>
                     <p>As to the Favourite, he should preserve the same state
of Modesty, and Affability that his fortune found him in.
He should clear his Looks from the dazling Beams of Favour,

and if any would offer them, let him advertise both
himself and him, that he is only a Servant to the Prince, to

their Displeasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor conceal his Favour, nor covet So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power, nor arm against Envy, nor provide against
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56556:197"/>
Emulation, for in these Precautions are very dangerous
Let him fear God and Infamy.</p>
                     <p>The Favourite is also in danger from his Family and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
for though the Prince and People do approve of his
Actions, it don't thence follow, that they must also those
of his Domesticks and Relations, whose Disorders, Indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Pride, Avarice, and Ambition render him odious and
ruin him. Let him not deceive himself by thinking, that
his own Creatures are the support and strength of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
for he who depends on many, is in danger of many,
and therefore 'tis better to keep them within remembrance
of their former Condition, and far from the management
of Affairs, that others may see they hold no part in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor his Favour, or that they are preferr'd meerly
for being his Servants. But if they are persons of Worth
and Merit, I would not that their being the Favourites Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Relations should prejudice them. Christ has
taught us this Point, giving to his Relations the Dignity of
forerunner and Apostle, but not that of Teacher of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that of the Pontificate, which were due to the
Faith of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Learning of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the Prince let him observe these Maxims. Let him
always presuppose, that his Favour or Affection is very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to change, and if any such change should happen, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not into the Cause thereof, nor pretend to take notice
of it, that the Prince may not suspect him, nor his Rivals
hope his Fall, for he is in danger of it when he but thinks
of it. Let him not build his Favour upon the inclination
and fancy of the Prince, but upon his own Merit; for if
the Gold of Favour be not well tempered with that Allay,
it can never endure the Hammer of Emulation. Let him
love more the Dignity than the person of a Prince. Let
him moderate his Zeal by Prudence, and guide his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by that of the Prince, for none can suffer a
a Rival in Sense. Let him think himself his Subject not his
Companion, and being a Creature, let him not pretend to
equal his Creator<note n="59" place="bottom">

advise with a modest, agreeable and sincere Freedom<note n="60" place="bottom">Prov. 22. 11.</note>,
without fear of Danger or Ambition of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
zealous and stanch in his Opinion. Let him make no
Affair his own, nor think his Reputation concern'd in
its Success, nor be disgusted that his Sentiments are reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or that being admitted they were afterwards altered,
for such Attempts are very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>In Debates and Resolutions, let him be neither so hot as to
flame, nor so cold as to freeze, but keep a moderate pace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to time and opportunity. Let him be more intent
upon his Duty than his Favour, but without Affectation or
vain Glory, for he who serves only for Reputation, robs the
Prince of his<note n="61" place="bottom">Luk. 17. 10.</note>. Let his Silence be <hi>a propos,</hi> and his
words close and ready upon occasion, which quality King

him prefer his Princes Service to his own interest, nay let
them be both one. Let him pay due Veneration to the
Royal Family, esteeming their Friendship his greatest Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without fomenting Differences between them and the
Prince, for Blood is easily reconcil'd to the ruin of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.
Let him take care that the Prince has always
good Servants, and faithful Ministers about him, and let
him instruct him faithfully in the Art of Government. Let
him neither shut his Eyes, nor stop his Ears, but rather take
care that he see, touch and feel all things himself. Let
him discreetly inform him of his Errours and Failures,
without fear of offence, if necessity requires. For though
his Favour may sicken for a time, 'twill recover again when
he finds his Errour, as it happen'd to <hi>Daniel</hi> with the Kings
of <hi>Babylon</hi>
                        <note n="63" place="bottom">Prov. 28 23.</note>. When the Prince resolves or determines
any thing through Heat or Passion, he should endeavour to
bend not break those Resolutions, waiting while time and
the inconveniencies thereof convince him of his Errour.
Let him not prevent his hearing Peoples Complaints, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56556:198"/>
Satyrs, for when they fall upon Innocence, they are as Grains
of Salt that preserve Favour, and Admonitions not to err
or to amend. Let him ascribe successful Actions to the
Prince, but t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke miscarriages upon himself. Let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
think his ruin sure and certain, waiting for it with
Constancy, and a free and disinteress'd mind, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over sollicitous to establish his Favour, for he falls soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
from a Precipice who fears it most. The reflection of
the danger disturbs the Brain, and we grow giddy with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from an height. Whatever Favourites have been
thus giddy have certainly fell, when those who have not
been so sollicitous have pass'd secure<note n="64" place="bottom">Prov. 10. 9.</note>. Among the
Ministers of State, let him behave himself rather as a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
than a Master, rather as a Defender than Accuser<note n="65" place="bottom">Eccles. 32. 1.</note>.
Let him encourage the Good, and endeavour to reform
the Bad. Let him not interpose his Authority in their
Preferments or Removals; and leave to them their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
Let him not alter the Course of Counsels in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations,
nor deny any access to the Prince. If the Prince
would have him confer with him, let him declare his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
frankly, without any other Design than to consult
for the best.</p>
                     <p>The Court is the most dangerous Rock of Favour, and
yet all use it to establish and confirm it; there is not a stone
in it but would strive to fall, if in falling it might crush
the Statue of the Favourite, which is as brittle as that of
<hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> by reason of the diversity of Metals that
compos'd it. Not one Courtier is a true Friend to the
Favourite; if he chooses some he incurs the Hatred and
Envy of the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he introduces them, he is in danger
of being supplanted; if he does not he makes them his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
'Tis there<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore the safest way to walk with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to all, and not to intermeddle in the Affairs of any one,
but endeavour to satisfie all, and (if possible) rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
than hinder them in their Pretensions and Interest. If
any one shall have insinuated himself into the Prince's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
'twill be the best way to keep him there; for he who
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56556:198"/>
wrestles with another to throw him down usually falls
with him, and opposition confirms Favour. More Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
have been ruined by striving to displace others, than
by advancing them. Let him slight Accusations, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
to the Prince, and leave them to Fortune.</p>
                     <p>Favour is very subject to the People, for if they disapprove
the Favourite, the Prince can never support him against the
common Cry; or if he Attempts it, the People usually turn
his Judges and Executioners, we having seen a great many
fall by their hands. If the People love him to excess he is
in danger from thence, for that creates Jealousie and Envy
in others, nay in the Prince himself, whence the Peoples
Loves are generally short and unlucky<note n="66" place="bottom">Breves &amp; infaustos populi Romani amores. <hi>Tac. 2. ann.</hi>
                        </note>. And so that
the Favourite may walk safe between these two Extreams, he
must avoid all occasions of publick Applause and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Let him only endeavour to procure to himself a good
Esteem, by Piety, Liberality, Complaisance and Affability,
making it his Care to see Justice duely administred, that
there may be plenty of all things, that the publick Peace
be not disturb'd in his time; that Privileges be not violated,
nor Novelties introduced into the Government; but above
all that there be no Disputes in matters of Religion, nor
difference among the Clergy: For he will soon feel the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Rage, if he once incur the name of impious.</p>
                     <p>Foreigners who want this natural Love for the Prince,
depend more upon the Favourite than him, whence they pay
him most Respect, that they may by his means accomplish
their Designs, to the great dishonour of the Prince, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of his States. Nay, they often prove the ruin of the
Favourite, unless he abundantly satisfie them in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and Requests; wherefore he ought to beware of their
Respect, and refuse the incense and worth of Foreigners,
letting them who would pay him those Honours know,
that he is only the Curtain before the Image, and that 'tis
the Prince that works the Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Ambassadors usually affect the Friendship of the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56556:199"/>
as the most effectual means to accomplish their Affairs,
and judging that the disorders which result from Favour,
will be of Service to them, they endeavour to foment it,
being often introduc'd thereto by the Favourite himself,
and as they take occasion to commend them in Audiences,
and seem at first sight free from Interest and Emulation, it
has often very good Effect, yet for all this they are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Friends; for the Favourite can't preserve their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
without great Detriment to the Prince and State. And
if in consideration of his Duty, he does not abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them, they are utter Enemies and leave no stone unturn'd
to ruin him. 'Tis therefore safest not to be more engag'd to
them than the Princes Service will permit. Endeavouring
only to gain the Reputation abroad of a sincere and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Person, and one who would rather preserve the good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondences
and Alliances of his Prince, than break 'em.</p>
                     <p>A timely Application of these Preservatives may perhaps
prevent a Favourites fall, but when he has once incurr'd
the <hi>Odium</hi> and Envy of the people, these are look'd upon
as Tricks and Artifices, and more endanger him. As it
happened to <hi>Seneca</hi> who took no method to prevent his

                     <p>If notwithstanding the Observation of all these Cautions,
the Favourite shall fall into Disgrace, his fall will be Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he having liv'd without the little Fears, and the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Care of preserving his Favour by methods below a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Spirit, a torment much worse than the disgrace it
self. If there be any thing valuable in a Princes Favour,
'tis only the Glory of having merited his Esteem; the
Continuation of which is full of Cares and Dangers. And
he is happiest, who soonest and with most Reputation
quits it.</p>
                     <p>I have describ'd, Royal Sir, the Practices of Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
but not how a Prince ought to comport himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56556:199"/>
them, not supposing that he ought to have any, for
though he must be allow'd to have more inclination to one
than another, yet not so as to devolve all his Authority
upon one person, from whom the people must expect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Rewards and Punishments; for such Favour is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
an Alienation from the Crown, and dangerous to the
Government, even when Favour succeeds in the Election
of the Subject, for neither will the people so readily obey,
nor so awfully respect the Favourite as the Prince, nor is he
so much concern'd for the welfare of the State, nor is he
so immediately under the care of God as the Prince: So
that though many of your Royal Highness's Ancestors have
had Favourites, who with much care and zeal (as we see
at present) have endeavour'd to Act with the greatest Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
yet have their attempts met with answerable Success.
Let not your Royal Highness be deceiv'd by the example of
<hi>France,</hi> whose Territories we see indeed much enlarg'd by
the Counsels of a Favourite, but not without detriment
to the Kingdom, and prejudice to the Royal Prerogative.

Jealousie, the opposition at <hi>Nivers</hi> Wars, the Diversion,
Expence, the Army in <hi>Alsace</hi> Rivals, the War for <hi>Spain</hi>

Confidence is not less important to a Prince than Distrust:
The one is worthy a sincere and Royal Breast, the other is
very necessary in the Art of Government, as an Instrument
by which Policy works its Ends. The Difficulty consists in
knowing how rightly to use one and t' other, so that neither
a too credulous Confidence expose you to Infidelity and
Dangers, or a too suspicious Distrust provoke Hatred, or
make the Prince by reason of this Diffidence incapble o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

those who are not so. Let a Prince confide, but at the
same time suspect that he may be cheated; this Suspicion
ought not to retard the Course of his Actions, but only
to be a Caution to him: if he was without Suspicion he
would be too careless. Suspicion is a cautionary Security,
a due weighing of Matters; he who doubts nothing can
never know the Truth. Let him give Credit as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and distrust as if he believ'd not. Confidence and
Diffidence being thus governed by Prudence and Reason,
work Miracles. Let the Prince therefore be well advised
in the Affairs which he treats of, in the Alliances which he
ratifies, in the Peaces which he concludes, and in all other
Treaties in general which concern the Government; and
when he Signs them let his hand be full of Eyes, (as in
the prefent Emblem) that he may see what he does. The
Bawd in <hi>Plautus</hi> valued not the Promises of the Lover when
she said, <hi>Our hands are full of eyes, what they see they believe;</hi>
and elsewhere she calls the Day quick sighted, in which
she never traded but for the Ready. Blind are Resolves
made by Confidence: <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Motto was, Not to shake
hands with every Body. Credulity to all is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
let a Prince therefore consider well before he inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
himself, thinking always that his Friends as well as his
Enemies design to cheat him, one more, the other less; one
to rob him of his Territories and Riches, the other only
to reconcile himself to his Favour and Good-will. This
Pre-supposition should not be deriv'd from Fraud, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
giving him the Liberty to forfeit his Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
which would utterly confound the publick Faith, and
be a great Blot in his Reputation; this Caution should
be nothing but a prudent Circumspection and piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.
That Diffidence the Daughter of Suspicion is then
blameable in a Prince, when 'tis frivolous and vicious,
which immediately discovers its Effects and proceeds to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
not that Circumspect and general Distrust, which
equally regards all, without particularizing upon any one,
until the Circumstances well examined shall dictate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and perhaps you may not sufficiently confide in any
one, whom you may nevertheless have a good Opinion of, for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56556:204"/>
this is not a particular distrusting of him, but a general
Caution of Prudence; there are Forts in the very middle of
Kingdoms, in which there are Garrisons kept, as if on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Frontiers. This Caution is convenient, and reflects
not upon the Subjects Fidelity. A Prince may confide
in his Relations, Allies, Subjects and Ministers, yet this
Confidence should not be so remiss, as to lull him asleep,
and make him careless of all Accidents, by which Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Interest, or Hatred usually pervert Fidelity; breaking
the strongest Bars of the Law of Nature and Nations;
when a Prince had rather chuse to suffer, than live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Alarms of so many Cautions; and rather let things
run on, than remedy the Inconveniencies which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
He makes his Ministers wicked and sometimes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
for they imputing his Indulgence to Incapability
despise and slight him, and each Reigns absolutely in that
part of the Government which is allotted him. But when
the Prince is vigilant, and if he does confide in any does it
not without Caution; when he is always so prepar'd, that
Treachery shall never find him unprovided; when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
not without hearing; and reprehends not but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Fidelity, when 'tis in danger, he may wear his Crown
in safety. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick had no reason to
suspect the Fidelity of the great Captain<note n="†" place="bottom">

kept those people near him who should diligently pry
into his Actions, that he knowing how narrowly
he was watch'd, might Act with the more Caution. This
was not properly an Action of distrust but prudence.
For all this he must take care that this Suspicion be not
groundless and frivolous, as was that of the same King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
to the same great Captain; for though after the loss
of the Battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> he wanted him for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> he would not make use of him
when he saw with what eagerness all the people strove
to serve and fight under him; and so endeavoured by al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>

that suspecting an experimented Fidelity, he exposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56556:204"/>
to one suspected: So over jealous Spirits to avoid one
Danger fall into a greater; though sometimes the refusal of
the Services of such great Men, may be rather a Princes
Envy or Ingratitude, than Jealousie or Suspicion. It may be
also that this wise Prince, thought it not convenient to make
use of a Man whom he knew to be discontented; a Prince
must expect little Fidelity from a person of whom he has
once shewn a Distrust. The more ingenious and generous a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is, the more it resents the Suspicion of its Fidelity, and so
more easily quits it, which made <hi>Getulius</hi> make bold to write
to <hi>Tiberius, That he was Loyal, and unless suspected, would remain
so</hi>

not to have an Eye upon 'em, that in Offices and Places of

Master King <hi>Peter</hi> like true and faithful Subjects, and oblige
'em to make amends for past Offences by future Services;
but that he should not put any Confidence in the Neuters,
who had shewn themselves more addicted to self Interest
than the publick Good. Traytors are odious even to those
whom they serve by their Treason<note n="5" place="bottom">Quippe proditores, etiam iis, quos anteponunt, invisunt. <hi>Tac. 1. ann.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis not good to raise a Minister all at once to great
Places, for it makes other envy him and hate the Prince,
they taking this sudden Promotion as an Argument of his
Levity. There is no Minister so modest, as not to be affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor so zealous as to continue in his Devoir, when he sees
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56556:205"/>
another so unjustly preferred. For one that's satisfied many
are discontented; and when the Ministers are disgusted 'tis
impossible the Government should go well: Such Elections
are nothing else but abortive Births; and Fidelity takes
deeper root, when it sees that Offices and Imployments are
the reward of faithful Services: the Prince has in the mean
while time to make Tryal of his Minister, first in places of
small Trust least it should cost him too dear, afterwards in
places of greater Importance<note n="7" place="bottom">He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 10.</note>, let him examine before
he employs him in Affairs of Peace or War, what is the
most likely to shake his Fidelity, what his Birth is, what
his Reputation and Fortune; this Circumspection is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
necessary in places of Trust, which are as 'twere the

                        <hi>Augustus</hi> would not permit any Senator or Roman Knight
to enter <hi>Egypt</hi> without his special Order, because that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
was the Grainary of the Empire, and that he who
made himself Master of that had the other at Command:
for the same reason <hi>Tiberius</hi> sharply reprehended <hi>Germanicus</hi>
for going into <hi>Alexandria</hi> without his leave<note n="8" place="bottom">Acerrimè increpuit, quod contra institutum Augusti, non sponte Principis Alexandriam introisset. <hi>Tac. 2. ann.</hi>
                        </note>, but for
the greater Security, and the better to keep the Minister in
obedience, 'twould be convenient to allow a little more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to the Magistracy of the Province, for there are
no Curbs stronger than that, nor more ready to oppose the
Faults of the Governor.</p>
                     <p>Mean and abject Spirits, such as have no Ambition of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or thirst for Preferments, are fit for no Employ. The chief
Quality which God found in <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> to introduce him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the management of Affairs, was that he had a great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<note n="9" place="bottom">Numb. 27. 18.</note>. But yet the Courage should not be so great, as to
repine at his being born a Subject, and not be contented
with his Condition; for the Loyalty of such is in great
Danger, because they aspire always to the highest step,
which if they attain not, 'tis either for want of Power, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56556:205"/>
Wit, besides they soon flag in their Zeal for the Publick,

                     <p>Great Spirits are not less dangerous at least, if they are
not docile and modest for being very positive and conceited
of their own Opinions, they are apt to slight Commands,
and believe that all should be governed at their Pleasure.
A person is as troublesome for his good Qualifications, as
for his having none at all; for there is no satisfying him,
who presumes too much upon his Merit: <hi>Tiberius</hi> never
desired great Vertues in Offices of Trust, and hated Vices
too; for from one he feared Danger to himself, from t' other

Now if any Minister is to be removed, it should be done

                     <p>When Princes are concerned with one another, there is
no Obligation of Friendship or Affinity, a sufficient Reason
for their trusting each other; <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> the great King of

much admir'd at the Interview between the great Captain

Cases Confidence is more safe and necessary to gain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Affections than Distrust. <hi>Don Alonso</hi> VI. having lost

his Sates recalled him to his Throne, with the greatest
privacy imaginable, fearing lest if it should come to be known
by the <hi>Moors,</hi> they might retain him by force; he like a

this Confidence so oblig'd the <hi>Barbarian</hi> King, who before
understood the Intrigue and design'd to seize him, that he
not only let him go free, but also furnished him with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

without being dazl'd with the splendour of Riches and
Prosperity to resist it. If Promotion makes the good bad,
'twill make the bad worse. And if Vice notwithstanding
the Punishments and Infamy that attend it find so many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
what will it do when back'd with Favour and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.
And if Vice be the ready way to Preferment,
who will seek it through the rugged Road of Vertue? That
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56556:207"/>
is inherent to our Natures, but this must be acquir'd by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.
The first forces Rewards, the other expects 'em
with Patience, and we find the Appetite much better pleas'd
by its own Violence than Merit; and being impatient had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
depend upon its own Industry, than attend the Pleasure
and Will of another; to reward the bad, by promoting
them to places of Authority, is, to check the vertuous and
incourage the vicious. A private Knave while he is private
can do no great matter of mischief, 'tis but an inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of private Men, on whom he can exercise his
Villainy; but promoted to places of Trust, his Villainy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
all, being himself Minister of Justice, and having the
whole Body of Government at his disposal<note n="1" place="bottom">Nam qui maguam potestatem habent, etiam si ipsi nullius pretii sint, multum nocent. <hi>Arist. 1. Pol. cap.</hi> 9.</note>; Villains
ought not to be put into places where they have power to
exercise their Villainy, Nature foreseeing this inconvenience,
has given venomous Animals neither feet nor wings, that
they may do less mischief? He who furnished Villains with
either designs it should either run or fly. But Princes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
usually make use of the bad rather than the good,
the former seeming generally more cunning<note n="2" place="bottom">For the Children of this world are in their Generation, wiser than the Children of light, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 8.</note>; but they
are mistaken, for Vice is not Wisdom, and he can have no
true Judgment who has no Vertue; for which reason <hi>Don
Alonso</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> commended the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>Romaus,</hi> in building the Temple of Honour
within that of Vertue, that to go into that you must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
pass through this, esteeming him not worthy of
Honour, who was not a follower of Vertue; and that he
should not arrive to Offices and Preferment, who enter'd
not at the Porch of Vertue: Without this how can a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
be serviceable to the Government? Among a crowd of
Vices what room is there for Prudence, Justice, Clemency,
Valour, and other Vertues absolutely necessary for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander?
How will the Subject observe those proper to
him, if he wants the example of the Minister, whose Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56556:208"/>
he observes carefully, and imitates through Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
The people have a respect for a just Minister, and
imagine that he cannot err; on the contrary, they never
approve and commend the Actions of one who is not
so. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> spoke very well one day in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
but because the people look'd upon him as a vicious
person, they rejected his Counsel. Whereupon it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> that a person whom they had a better
Opinion of should propose the same thing, that it might
be received and executed: this good Opinion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is so necessary, that though the Minister be a person of
Integrity, the Government is not safe in his hands, if the
people mis-inform'd think him otherwise. <hi>Henry</hi> the Vth.
King of <hi>England,</hi> for this reason at his coming to the
Crown, removed from him all those who had been his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in his younger days, and turn'd out all Ministers,
putting in their places Men of worth, and such as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the people; one can impute the Success and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
of <hi>Theodorick,</hi> to nothing but his good Choice of
Ministers, having no other for his Councellors than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of the strictest Vertues. Ministers are as it were the
Picture of Majesty, which since it can't appear every where
is represented by them; who ought therefore to be as like
him as possible in Life and Conversation, since the Prince
cannot of himself exercise in all places, the Authority
which he has received by common Consent, he ought to
take great Care how he shares it amongst his Ministers.
For he who is not born a Prince, when he sees himself
deck'd with Majesty, will take Pride in shewing it, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising

necessity obliging a Prince to substitute his Power to several
Ministers, if they are bad they will do more Damage to a
Nation, than the Prince be he never so good can advantage
it; for they will abuse his Goodness, and under pretence
of publick Good, will turn it to their own private interest
and advantage. A bad Prince may be reformed by many
good Ministers, but not many bad Ministers by a good
Prince.</p>
                     <p>Some imagine a Princes hands are bound, and his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
infring'd, when he has good Ministers, and that the more
vicious the Subjects are, the safer he lives among 'em; a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and senseless Phancy, for Vertue is the only thing
that keeps Nations in obedience and quiet, and Nations are
never more quiet and firm than when at home, private people
live justly and innocently, and Justice and Clemency flourish
abroad; 'tis easie to govern the good. Without Vertue the
Laws lose their force; the love of Liberty reigns, and the
aversion to Government increases, whence proceed the
change of States, and fall of Princes. 'Tis necessary then
that they have vertuous Ministers, who should advise them
with Zeal and Affection, and introduce Vertue into the
Nation by their Example, and by the integrity of their
Lives. <hi>Tiberius</hi> held the extreams of both Vertue and Vice
equally dangerous to a Minister, and chose one between
both, as we said elsewhere, but this is properly the fear of a
Tyrant; if a vertuous Minister be good, one more vertuous
is better.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not sufficient for his Ministers to be endued with
excellent Vertues, if those necessary Endowments, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of experience, which the management of Affairs

Elections carry with 'em which are made at a jump, and not

In this we have seen great Errors, in changing the reins and
administration of Governments. These are different in
Kingdoms and Common-wealths. Some respect Justice,
others Plenty, some War, others Peace; yet though they
are so different in themselves, there is nevertheless a certain
Faculty or civil Vertue, which unites 'em, and makes them
all tend one way, to the Preservation of the State: each
aiming at this by means proportion'd to the Office he is in.
This civil Vertue is different according to the several
Forms of Government, which differ according to the means,
and methods of governing, for which reason a Man may
be a good Citizen, but not a good Minister, for 'tis not
sufficient that he be endu'd with several moral Vertues, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he has also civil ones, and this natural Disposition so
proper to Administration and Government.</p>

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56556:209"/>
'Tis therefore necessary for a Prince to know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Inclinations of his Subjects, that he may better
know how to employ 'em, for upon this good Choice all
the Actions of his Government depend. The Genius of
<hi>Herman Cortez,</hi> was particularly proper for the Conquest of
<hi>India;</hi> that of <hi>Gonzalez Fernandez</hi> of <hi>Cordova</hi> for the War
of <hi>Noples;</hi> and if they had been exchang'd, and the first
sent against the <hi>French,</hi> and the latter against the <hi>Indians,</hi>
doubtless they had not been so successful. Nature has not
given Man a like Qualifications for all things; but only one
excellence for one Office, whether it be Frugality, or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and 'tis certain, Instruments do most Service when
they are made use of by one, not by many. For this reason,

Offices and Preferments upon one person, to the Envy and
Dissatisfaction of all; but whether for want of Knowledge
of persons, or for that they won't take the pains to look
for fit Men, it usually happens that Princes imploy one, or
at most a very few of those who are about them: In all
Affairs, whence Promotions and Rewards are scarce, and so
Emulation grows cold, and all things move slowly.</p>
                     <p>For the same Reason 'tis not good for two persons to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56556:210"/>
employed about the same Affair, for that makes it confus'd
like a Picture drawn by two hands, the methods of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being always different, one is quick, the t' other slow,

this, 'tis impossible two should agree in the same Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Counsels and Methods, or that they should not disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the great Detriment of the Negotiation and Prince
too. These second Causes have each their distinct Office
and separate Operations. For my part I think it more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable
to commit an Office to one person less capable, than
to two though more sufficient; since therefore the good
Election is a thing so necessary, and its Success so difficult,
'tis not adviseable for Princes to relie too much upon their
own Judgments. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the III. and King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Catholick first consulted the people, suffering it as if

How will he indeavour to merit Rewards, who is his own

then by Envy against those who commit it, and so by
Hatred to the Prince that suffers it; if he knows it not, they

                     <p>Avarice in Princes is the ruin of States<note n="5" place="bottom">Prov. 29. 4.</note>, for the
people can't bear to see their Estates in danger, in the

In short, what can a Subject hope for from a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Prince? For this Vice even Children hate their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Where there is no Prospect of Interest, there is no
Love nor Obedience; that Government is Tyrannick which
respects Self-interest, more than the publick Good. King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi>
the Wise, for this Reason said: <q>That a King ought
not to covet abundance of Riches only to fill his Treasury,
and not do good with them; for 'tis impossible but he

is beneath the Dignity of a Prince</q>

which is ill got is soon spent How like Spiders are some

There are several Remedies against this Vice, the best
are those which prevent it; for if once Nature is tainted
with it, 'tis very Difficulty cured; 'tis our last shift. If
Princes are naturally Lovers of Money, they should be kept
from seeing or feeling it, as much as possible, for Avarice
like Love enters at the Eyes, and 'tis more easie to order a
Payment than to make it ones self. The Ministers of the
Treasury too should be generous, and not prompt the Prince
to enrich himself by sordid and unworthy Methods; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
also Avarice in the Ministers, Care should be taken
that Offices and Places be not bought and sold, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Commodus</hi> observ'd, for he who buys 'em sells 'em
too; this the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> knew, as also <hi>Lewis</hi> XII.
of <hi>France,</hi> who used this Remedy, but has been since
ill observ'd by his Successours. It seems to be the
Law of Nations, that a Province, the Command of which
is bought, should be plunder'd, and that Judgment should
be given to the highest bidder at the Court of Justice,
which is not to be approached but by Golden steps<note n="9" place="bottom">Provincias spoliari, &amp; nummarium tribunal, audita utrinque li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatione, alteri addici non mirum quando quae emerit vendere gentium jus est. <hi>Sen. lib. 1. c. 9. de ben.</hi>

careful of, and less chargeable to the Publick. Those who
are too much addicted to Self-interest, and a desire of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Fortunes, are very dangerous in publick Offices.
For though some do strive to raise themselves by Merit and
Renown, yet they generally think it the surest way to do it
by Riches, without waiting Rewards and Gratuities from
the Prince, who is usually most sparing to him, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves

he imagines his Liberty consists in changing the
form of Government: and this is the greatest misfortune
that can befall States, and is often the chief Cause of their
Ruine, wherefore 'tis highly necessary to use such methods,
as that this Lust after Liberty, and this humane Ambition
being removed far from the immediate Administration,
should be kept under by reason, and the force of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so that this supream Authority which is the Princes
Property should be granted to none else, for he exposes
Loyalty to evident Danger; who grants any one a Power too
absolute. The Royal Crown put upon a Subjects Head, tho'
but in jest, will make him proud and think himself above
what he is. The mind of a Subject should not experience this
Royal Grandeur and Glory of reigning, for afterwards abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it he usurps it, and that it mayn't return to him from
whom he had it, he Plots and contrives his Ruine; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Writ in one Chapter gives us Examples of Kings put
to Death by the hands of their Subjects, for having raised
them too high. <hi>Solomon</hi> for all his Wisdom fell into this
misfortune and ran the same Risque, for having made <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>

and we read that he had the Impudence to lift up his hand
against his King<note n="3" place="bottom">1 Kin. 11. 26.</note>. Let Princes then take it for a Maxim
of State, not to promote one too much above others, or
if they are oblig'd to it, let it not be one but several, that
they may Balance one another and mutually keep each other
in their Devoir, by a reciprocal Examination of one anothers
Actions and Designs<note n="4" place="bottom">Est autem omnis Monarchiae cautio communis, neminem facere nimis magnum, aut certè plusquam unum facere: ipsi enim inter se, quid quisque agat observant. <hi>Arist. 5. Pol. c.</hi> 11.</note>. The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II.

to the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> whence sprang so many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and amongst the rest the loss of that great Man,

Christ, and there are very few <hi>Ioseph's</hi> to be found now

the Body; which this present Emblem represents, by a
Branch encircled with a wicker Basket filled with Earth,
such as Gardiners use, where it by degrees takes root, and
so being cut off insensibly, becomes a Tree independant of
the Stock, without the least respect to its Greatness. This
Example shews the Danger in making Governments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
perpetual, for Ambition having once taken root,
claims 'em as its Property, he who is so accustom'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
will afterwards scarce be brought to obey. <hi>France</hi>
shews us many Examples of this written in its own Blood.
Even God's Ministers in the Kingdom of Heaven are liable

from the Crown; the Scepter will be useless and of no
force, and will stand in awe of that very Power it has been
so prodigal of: Liberality will want a Dowry, and Vertue
a Reward. The Minister becomes a Tyrant in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

sees preserves his Authority, he respects as his Master, but
him who does not he despises, and at last rebells against him.

and dangerous times, publick Offices and places of
Trust ought to be continu'd longer, least they should upon
removal be conferr'd upon raw, unexperienced Persons. So
<hi>Augustus</hi> did upon the defeat of <hi>Quintilius Varus.</hi> But this
Doctrine of Ministers being continued in Offices but for a
time, must not be understood of those supream Offices of
the Princes Counsel, or of Justice. But on the contrary,
they ought to be fixt and continued, because of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their Experience and Knowledge of Affairs depending.</p>
                     <p>These kinds of Offices are in Governments like the Poles
in the Heavens, about which the lesser Orbs move, so that if
they should be chang'd or removed, the whole Universe
would be endanger'd by the disorder of its natural Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Solon</hi> knew this Inconveniency in the four hundred
Senatours, which were yearly Elected by Lot at <hi>Athens,</hi>
and therefore he established a Senate of Sixty worthy Men
who were called <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and while this continu'd the
Republick flourished. 'Tis moreover very dangerous to
commit the Government of Kingdoms during the Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to persons who have any Pretentio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s thereto, though
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56556:216"/>
never so unjust; so it fell out in <hi>Arragon,</hi> by the Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of those who committed the Government to
<hi>Sancho</hi> Duke of <hi>Roussillon,</hi> until King <hi>Iames</hi> I. came to
age. Those Persons who have no manner of Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Crown, either by Birth, or any other Cause,
often thirst after it; how much more then those, who in
Pictures and Images see their Ancestours brows incircled
with it?</p>
                     <p>This Age as well as the pass'd gives us many deplorable
Examples of Relations, who have treacherously usurped
Kingdoms which they were entrusted with. Those of the
Royal Blood are more prone to Tyranny, in that they never
want means to accomplish their Designs. Few can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swad'd
of the Justice of that Law, which prefers Birth to
Vertue; and every one thinks he better deserves a Crown,
than another, and if this Reason should be of force in any
one, he is in danger from his Favourites, who hoping to
participate of his Grandeur, strive to procure it by violent
means, and to raise Jealousies amongst his Relations. If
King <hi>Philip</hi> had any Jealousie of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> they
flow'd from this Spring. A glorious Example of this Policy
we find in the Infant <hi>Ferdinand</hi> refusing the Crown, which
was the Right of his Nephew <hi>Don John</hi> II. by which generous
Recusance of that Crown on Earth he merited many more
in Heaven. The generous Loyalty which the Infants of
that Name have paid the Kings of their Race, is of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Date. Nor do we find less in this present Infant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the present King, whose Respect and Obedience is
more like that of a Subject than of a Brother. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spheres pay not a more ready Obedience to the first
mover, than his Highness does to his Majestys Will. O
truly Noble Prince, whose glorious Birth, though the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in the World, is yet the least of his Excellencies, the
Effect of Divine Providence, that in a time of such trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
and tedious Wars, which strain'd the very Axle-tree
and Poles of the Government, to raise us up an <hi>Atlas</hi> to
support it by his Valour, Conduct and Prudence.</p>

Emblem you see a Scepter full of Eyes, to give the Prince
to understand, that he ought to inspect all Affairs of the
Government by his Ministers; nor is it to be wonder'd at,
that we place the Ministers in the Scepter, for formerly
their Names were engrave on the Crowns of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor without Reason, for they
shine brighter than the Diadems themselves.</p>
                     <p>This Emblem of Eyes sufficiently shews the Qualifications
that a Minister ought to be endued with. For as the Sight
extends to all things far and near, so should the active Spirit
of the Counsellour inspect all things present, past and future,
that he may make a right Judgment of things, and give
a true Opinion of all Affairs, which can't be done without
much Reading, great Experience, and a continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with foreign Countries: For if the Counsellours
ben't perfectly versed in the Princes Nature, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Genius of the people, they'll ruine both themselves
and the Government<note n="7" place="bottom">Morum, animor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. And to know this requires use; for
the Eyes don't know things which they have never seen; he
who has had Experience and Knowledge of things, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
find Expedients and Remedies<note n="8" place="bottom">Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 3. 4.</note>.</p>

There is such a correspondence between the Eyes and
Heart, that the Affections of the one immediately strikes
the other, when this is sad they weep, when this glad they
smile; if the Counsellour has not a particular Esteem for
his Prince, he will take but little care of his Affairs, and is
therefore very little to be trusted, so said King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the
Wise: <q>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">L. 5. tit. 9. p. 2.</note> That Councellours ought to be the Princes true
Friends, otherwise he would be in great Danger, for
those who hate a Person will never advise him cordially.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Eye won't suffer the Finger to touch its inside, but
upon its approach immediately sculks within the Lids;
how wise and learn'd soever the Minister is in his Counsels,
if he is easie and free of his Secerts, if he suffers his Finger
to probe his Heart, he'll be more prejudicial to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
Affairs than one who understands nothing, Counsels
are worth nothing when revealed, and there is more danger
in good Resolves unseasonably discover'd, than in ill ones
executed with Secrecy; let a Minister therefore avoid Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with those who are not entrusted with the same Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
Let him shut his Heart against those who would dive
into it: for in discoursing of Affairs the Design is easily
discovered, with the Maxims by which the Prince governs.
The Lips are the windows of the Heart, the opening of
which discovers all within.</p>
                     <p>The Eyes are so pure and free from Avarice; that they
won't admit the least Atom, and if by chance any thing,
though never so little gets in, it obstructs their Sight, or at
least makes them see things double, and different from what
they are; the Minister who receives Presents will be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the dust of them, so as not to be able to discern
things rightly, but only as Self-interest shall represent 'em.</p>
                     <p>Though the Eyes are two, yet they see but one and the
same thing, they both agree in the truth of the Species
which they receive, and in transmitting them to the sence
by the Optick Nerves which are united, that they mayn't
enter severally and deceive it. If the Ministers don't unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
agree in advising for the best, without being divided
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56556:218"/>
in their Sentiments by love and hate, or any other reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Prince will be always in doubt or confusion, without
knowing which Counsel is best. And this inconvenience
falls out when one Minister thinks he sees and understands
more than another, or when he has not Judgment enough
to distinguish which is best<note n="9" place="bottom">Eccles. 8. 20</note>. or when he is byass'd by his
own Passions or desire of Revenge. But a Minister should
be free from all these, so as to have no other Purpose or
Design than the Service of his Prince: <q>Such a Minister
[says <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise] is called in Latine <hi>Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
being as it were a Father to the Prince, which
Title is taken from the resemblance it bears to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Father, for every Father is naturally inclined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
his Son in all things for his advantage and Honour;
so he who governs the Prince by his Counsels, ought to
love him and advise him with Sincerity, preferring his
Honour and Interest above all things, not respecting the
Love or Hatred, Interest or Prejudice, that may ensue,
and all this without Flattery, not minding whether he be
good or bad; like a Father in instructing his Child</q>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">L. 7. tit. 1. p. 4.</note>.
Nature has divided the Jurisdiction of the Eyes by a Line
interpos'd, not but that they both agree in Operation, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
one another with a Zeal so mutual, that if one turns
to one side, the t'other does so too, that they may have a
more certain Cognizance of things, neither regarding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be within their Sphere or not, the same Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is absolutely necessary amongst Ministers, whose Zeal
should be so universal, that they should not only regard
those things which their Office obliges 'em to, but also those
that belong to others; there is no Member, but for the
preservation of the whole Body, sends its Blood and Spirits
to the assistance of that which is out of order. For a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to be an idle Spectator of anothers Calamities shews
malice, envy and want of respect to the Prince. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
often from a love of Self-interest and Glory; or least
he should by assisting his Friend endanger his own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or else that he may flourish more upon his Friends
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56556:218"/>
misfortune. Such Ministers only serve themselves not the
Prince. Whence proceed Divisions in the State, Army and
Revenue, by which many good opportunities are lost, many
Towns, Castles and Provinces ruined; Ministers should
mutually communicate their Designs and Actions, as the
Cherubims did their wings in the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi>

                        </gap>eful as Eyes are to the Body, Nature has given it but
two, because more would breed confusion and obstruct the
Susception of things: 'Tis the same in Counsellours, for
when there are too many, Consultations are retarded, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
revealed, and Truth confounded, for their Votes are
only counted not duly weighed, and the greater number
carries it; and thence proceed generally all misfortunes in
Common-wealths. The multitude is always blind and
thoughtless; and the wisest Senate, if composed of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
will have a mixture of the Ignorance of the vulgar. A

in disorder and confusion; if the Ministers aim to be any

Negotiations of his Ambassadours, when he had a mind to
draw 'em to his own Resolutions, or thought it convenient
to conceal certain Circumstances from them. A Council
of State should be like a <hi>Colossus,</hi> that the Prince standing
upon its Shoulders may see farther than it. The <hi>Thebans</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> there are several Councils instituted, with a

and Provinces, and for all the most important Affairs of the

                        </gap>bly undermin'd by Malice
or Abuse. 'Tis not sufficient for each distinct part to be
well govern'd, if they don't sometimes all unite, to treat
as well of themselves in particular, as of the whole Body in
general. For this Reason we have in Convents or religious
Orders, Provincial and general Chapters, and in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, Councils. For the same Reason every
ten years there is held at <hi>Madrid</hi> a General Council consisting
of two Counsellours, of each particular Council, and of two
Deputies of each Province, to consult for the Preservation
not only of each part, but of the whole Kingdom. For if
these Kingdoms were not so renewed, they would grow old
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56556:221"/>
and at last die. This Assembly will unite the parts of the
Monarchy, and make 'em agree among themselves, to the
mutual assistance of each other. For this Reason the
Councils of <hi>Toledo</hi> were assembled, where not only Matters
of Religion, but also those of State were treated of.</p>
                     <p>All these Qualities of Eyes ought also to be found in
Confessors to Princes, who are their Counsellours, Judges,
and spiritual Physicians: these Offices require Men of Zeal
and intire Affection for the Service of God, and their Prince;
Persons who have Sence to judge well, prudence to advise,
Liberty to reprehend, and Courage to undeceive, by setting
before his Eyes, though at the hazard of his Favour, the
Disgusts of his Subjects, and the Danger of his Kingdom,
without smearing over the craz'd and falling Wall with
untempered Mortar<note n="29" place="bottom">Ezek. 13. 10.</note>. Some Princes use Confessors
only for Conscience sake, others make use of them as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
of State: I shall not pretend to examine into the
Reason of these two Methods; I only say, 'tis thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
in <hi>Spain,</hi> to admit the King's Confessor into his
Council, as well to give his assistance in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as also that being as it were a sharer in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs, he may correct the Prince, if in any thing
he is deficient in his Devoir. For some know the Faults
that they are guilty of as Men, but not those which they
commit as Princes, though those are greater which belong
to their Office than those which respect only their person.

                     <p>THE Office of a Secretary depends upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
not the Pen; if it all lay in neatly cutting a
Letter Printers would be the best Secretaries. His
Duty is to consult, propose and bring matters to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is the right hand of the Princes Will, his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Government, the Finger by which he points out
his Resolutions; and as King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> says, <q>The second
Officer of the Houshold, at least of those who are of
the Cabinet; for as the Confessor is Mediator between
God and the King, so is the Secretary between the King
his Subjects<note n="†" place="bottom">L. 4. tit. 9. p. 2.</note>
                        </q>. Discreet and prudent Consultations in
Councils will be of small Effect, if he who should metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56556:223"/>
them should fail in his part; the Ministers give their
Opinions, and the Prince declares his Sentiments by his
Secretary, and a word now and then aptly apply'd, changes
the Face of Affairs, as in a Picture, a small shade or a stroke
of the Pencil, either spoils it, or gives more Life to it; the
Council forms the Idea of the Building, the Secretary
draws the Plan thereof, which if it be irregular, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-structure
must of necessity be so too. The better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
this, you see in the present Emblem his Pen is a
pair of Compasses, because his Business is not only to write,
but also to measure the Resolves, and to set out fit times and
opportunities for the Execution of 'em, that they may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be too soon nor too late: this Office is so united to
that of the Prince, that if the trouble of Affairs would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
it should by no means be committed to another, for if it
is not a part of Majesty, 'tis at least a certain Reflection of
it; this I believe <hi>Cicero</hi> meant, when he advised the then
Pro-consul of <hi>Asia</hi> thus, <q>Let your Ring [which you must
construe Secretary] be not as any other piece of Goods,
but as your own self, not a Minister of another's Will,
but a Witness of your own; each other Minister is the
Kings Representative but in one Office, but the Secretary
in all<note n="1" place="bottom">Sit annullus tuus, non ut vas aliquod, sed tanquam ipse tu; no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

particular Places, but he must have a perfect Knowledge,
a general and particular Intelligence of Practices, and Arts,
as well of Peace as War. If they erre 'tis but in some one
particular; but this reaches all in general, yet so privately,
that the mis-carriage is imputed to the Council; as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Physician is to the Malignity of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
some Affairs may be negotiated with bad Ministers,
but not with an ignorant Secretary. He is the Stomach, in
which Affairs are digested, and if they come thence crude
and ill concocted, the Life of the Government will be sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and short; cast your Eyes back upon Pastimes, and you
will find that never any Government has been well manag'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56556:223"/>
without good Secretaries. What signifies the Princes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Resolves, if the Secretary knows not how to apply
them, by judiciously considering, and prudently observing
certain Circumstances on which Affairs always depend. If
he wants Discretion and Judgment, his written Rules and
Instructions are of small use, for there is scarce any Affair
for which you can find an exact Precedent. For time and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accidents alter the very Nature and Form of all things.
Apothecaries have different Medicines prescribed by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Physicians, for several Diseases; but they'd be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
mistaken, if they should ignorantly apply them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due Knowledge of the Causes whence they proceed,
as also of the Constitution of the sick Person, the time, and
other Circumstances; which Experience, Reason, and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
shall dictate. The same Affair should be differently
prescrib'd to a Phlegmatick and Cholerick Minister, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to a timorous and bold one. The Secretary ought
to instruct each how he should behave himself. What are
Secretaries Offices, but certain Schools for the Education
of able Statesmen? From what Practice and Experience
teaches them, they learn the true Art of Government.
There they observe what Counsels have succeeded, what
mis-carried. From all which appears the necessity of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such for Secretaries, as are endu'd with good natural
parts. Those great Ministers or Secretaries of God, which
we call Evangelists, were represented in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> by
four wing'd Animals, full of Eyes both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
signifying by their Wings, their Expedition and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
their Knowledge of all things by their external
Eyes, and their Contemplation by their internal ones<note n="2" place="bottom">Revel. 4. 8.</note>.
Being so busie that they never rested night or day<note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, so
intent upon their Duty, that their wings were always
stretch'd upwards<note n="4" place="bottom">Ezek. 1. 11.</note>, so conformed and united to the
Holy Spirit in all things, that they never parted from
it<note n="5" place="bottom">Ezek. 1. 12.</note>.</p>

To make a good Choice of a Secretary, 'twould be
convenient for Princes to train up such persons as by their
natural Qualifications and perfect Knowledge of the Latine
Tongue seem fit for it, under their Ambassadours, or chief
Ministers, making Tryal of them in several Posts beyond
Sea; and afterwards let them call 'em to the Secretaries
Office at Court, where they may serve, and capacitate
themselves for Secretaries of State, High Treasurer, and
the like, upon whose Knowledge and Experience, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and good management of Affairs very much depend.
By this means the ill Choice which Ministers of State usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
make of their Secretaries would be avoided, for they
employ only them, who have served 'em formerly, and who
are usually most unfit for that Office, being chosen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
more from the neatness of their Hand-writing than
their Understanding. Whence it falls out, that a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
who has a careless ignorant Secretary, is more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the Princes Affairs, than a bad Minister whose
Secretary is discreet and careful; besides the Secretary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen by the Prince himself, on whom he solely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
will make the Minister more vigilant and attentive
in the performance of his Office; King <hi>Alphonso</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what importance it was to have a good Secretary,
said, <q>That a King ought to make Choice of for that
Charge, a person well born and well bred, of good Sence,
good Temper, and good Manners; who can read and
write Latine, as well as his vulgar Tongue<note n="†" place="bottom">L. 4. ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

but that he must readily speak it too; for this is absolutely
necessary for him, who is to treat with all Nations. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

the frequent Correspondence in Latine.</p>
                     <p>The most essential thing in a Secretary is Secrecy, whence
his Name is derived, that he may upon hearing it be put
in mind of his Duty. The Tongue and the Pen are the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56556:224"/>
most dangerous Instruments of the heart, by these 'tis usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
expos'd, either through Levity, or Vanity, to be thought
the Repositories of very important Secrets, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
them, either by discourse or writing, to those from
whom they should conceal 'em: So that he is not fit for the
Charge of a Secretary, who can't modestly hear others, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than talk himself, without changing the Air of his
Face at any thing; for oft-times the Secrets of the heart
are discovered thereby.</p>

offence to their Majesty, they may be decided by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Wherefore <hi>Sanguinius</hi> advised the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, not
to trouble the Emperour with such Matters, as without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting
him were in their Power to remedy<note n="11" place="bottom">Sanguinius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus è Consularibus oravit Senatum ne curas Imperatoris conquisitis insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acerbitatibus augerent, sufficere ipsum statuendis remediis. <hi>Tac. 6. ann.</hi>
                        </note>. But if a
Prince relying upon the Prudence and Integrity of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
shall intrust him with the management of any Affair,
let him leave it wholly to him. After God had made <hi>Adam</hi>
Lord of the whole Earth, he brings all the Animals which
he had created, that he might give 'em names<note n="12" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 19.</note>, God
would not so much as reserve that to himself. For the like
Reason a Prince ought to leave ordinary Cares and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56556:226"/>
to others: for the Head intermeddles not with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the Hands and Feet, nor does the Pilot intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the common Sailers Duty, but sitting in the Stern
does more with the gentle Motion of his hand, in guiding
the Boat, than all the other with their Toil and Labour.</p>
                     <p>But if a Prince either by reason of his Minority or old
Age, or any other natural defect, be incapable of attending
the direction of Affairs, let him choose an Assistant. For 'tis
much better to govern well by another, than ill by himself.
The first years of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign were happy, because he took
Advice from good Councellours; but when he took the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of all into his own hands he ruin'd himself. King
<hi>Philip</hi> II. finding that Age and Infirmities had render'd
him unfit to govern, chose certain trusty and experienced
Ministers for his Assistants. Yet even when necessity urges,
a Prince ought not wholly to omit the Care of Affairs, be
his Ministers never so prudent and faithful, for the Body
politick resembles the natural, in which if the Heat be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
no Remedy, no Art, nor Industry can preserve its
Life. The Prince is the Soul of the Government where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to keep that alive, 'tis necessary that this should assist
the Members and Organs; if he can't absolutely do this, let
him seem to see and hear all things, with such Assiduity,
that they may be attributed to his Disposal and Judgment;
the Princes Presence though it has no other Effect, at least
influences the Ministers, and makes 'em more careful and
Assiduous. To know only that all Orders come through
his hands, gives them Authority, though he never alter nor
see 'em; what will it do then if he shall particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and being privately instructed, shall correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his Ministers faults? If he do this but once, they
will be ever after fearful and cautious, they will imagine
that he actually sees, or inspects all things. Let them treat
in Councils not only of Affairs of State, but also of what
worthy Persons, they should promote to Offices and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments;
but let his hand confirm their Resolutions, let
it be that which bestows all Rewards and Gratuities, not

The hand of a Clock has no effect upon the Wheels, but
permits them to do their Duty, and only denotes their
Motion, so the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. was of Opinion, a
Prince ought to behave himself towards his Council, to let
them alone in their Debates without intermeddling with
'em; this Precept he left to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the II. A Princes
Presence obstructs their Freedom, and gives opportunity for
Flattery, and though in Matters of greater moment, the
Prince's Presence seems very convenient, in that he can't
be so throughly inform'd by reading, as by hearing their
Debates, for by this he will learn much, and begin to love
Business, and be instructed in the Qualifications, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of his Councellours, a Prince ought to be extremely
cautious in declaring his Opinion, least either Flattery, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
or Fear should make it received. For this Reason

great Concern, what has been their Issue, in what they
succeeded, in what fail'd, and several other Observations,
which are instructive in the Art of Government. Hence
proceeds the Harmony in the Order of the Jesuits, which
all so much admire, for every three years the General has
a particular Account of all things that have pass'd, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a private List of those of the Order; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they may in time alter their Nature and Manners
these Catalogues are renewed every Year; besides, he has
particular Informations every Year of what ever in necessary
for him to know. By which they always succeed in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
by suiting the Capacity of the Person to the Office,
not the Office to the Person. And if Princes had such
Characters of things and persons, they would not be so
often deceived in their Resolves and Counsels; they would
be better instructed in the Art of Government, and need not
depend wholly upon their Ministers; and these would serve
the Prince with more Care and Circumspection, when they
knew that he understood and took notice of all things; and
so these gross Faults which we see at present, I mean, in
not timely providing Necessaries for Peace and War, would
never be committed; in a word, the fear of this Catalogue
would make Vertue flourish, and Vice perish; nor would
these short Memoirs breed any confusion, especially if some
were made by the Princes own hands, and others by his
chief Ministers, who are persons of Understanding, and
whom he can trust to do it sincerely and carefully; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>HONOUR is one of the chiefest Instruments in the
Art of Government; if it were not the Off-spring
of Glory, I should think it a politick Invention;
it is the Prop of Empires; without it none could stand
long; a Prince without it wants a Guard for his Vertues,
the Spur of Renown, and Bond, which makes him to be
loved and respected; a Thirst for Riches is Tyrannick, but
for Honour Royal<note n="1" place="bottom">Velle pecuniis excellere Tyrannicum, H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Subject than the Prince; for without that the Laws would
not be able to keep the people in their Devoir, it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that they are more restrain'd by the fear of Infamy
than punishment. The Economy of Government would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56556:231"/>
soon be ruined, were not Obedience, Loyalty, Integrity and
such like Vertues in esteem. Ambition for Honour preserves
the Authority of the Laws, to attain it we inure our selves
to Labour and Vertue. That Government is in as much
danger where all would be Slaves, as that in which a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l
would be Masters. A Nation too abject and base, is a prey
to every Invader, and soon forgets its Duty to its lawful
Prince; but that which is of a more lofty Spirit, and which
sets a value upon Honour, slights all Toils and Perils; nay,
even despises its own Ruine, to remain firm in its Obedience
and Loyalty; what Wars, Calamities and Devastations by
Fire and Sword, has not the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> felt for
preserving their Faith and Allegiance to his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
neither the Tyranny and Barbarity of their Enemies,
nor the infection of the Elements, though all seem'd to
conspire against them, could shake their Constancy. They
might indeed take from those Loyal Subjects, their Estates,
their Countrey, and their Lives, but not their sincere Faith,
and generous Loyalty to their lawful Prince.</p>
                     <p>The usual Remedies against intestine Disorders, is to
make the People strangers to Honour and Reputation, which
piece of Policy is us'd in <hi>China,</hi> which is in no danger but
from its own Subjects: but in other Kingdoms which are
exposed to Invasions, Glory and Renown is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Subjects, that they may have Courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
an Enemy; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or where there is no Honour, there is no
Valour. That Prince is not truly Great, who does not
command great Spirits, nor can he ever without such make
himself formidable, or enlarge his Territories. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's
Honour obliges them to procure the Prince's, for
upon his Grandeur depends their's. The very sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and empty appearance of Honour, makes 'em assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
in Labours, and valiant in Dangers. What Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
could make sufficient Compensation for the Estates,
and Blood which Subjects squander away for the Prince's
Will and Fancy; were it not for this publick Coin of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
wherewith every one pays himself in his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
'Tis the best Price of worthy and brave Exploits, the
cheapest Reward that Princes could have found, so that if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56556:231"/>
not for their own Grandeur, they ought at least for their
Conveniency and Interest, maintain it among their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
by either taking no notice of, or lightly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Faults which they commit to defend it, and on the
contrary, by encouraging with Rewards and publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
such Actions as are generous and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But they should beware of giving the least Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that vain fantastical Honour so much in Vogue,
which depends upon peoples Fancies, not true Vertue,
thence proceed Disputes among the Ministers about Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to the prejudice of the Publick, and the Prince's
Service: Hence Duels, Affronts, and Murthers; and from
these come Tumults and Seditions. This makes Obedience
stagger, and defiles it with the Prince's blood; for if once
the Subject shall be perswaded in his own Opinion, or by
the common Cry, that he is a Tyrant and not fit to live, he
soon contrives his Death, to obtain the Honour of Assertor
of his Countrey's Liberty<note n="2" place="bottom">Itaque Monarchas, non ut sibi vendicent Monarchiam, invadunt, s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Sentences the present Emblem is taken; a lighted Candle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56556:232"/>
in a Candlestick, the Emblem of Divinity, and supream
Authority, at which two others are lighted, to signifie that
a Prince may bestow Honour upon those who deserve it
without Detriment to his own. His Honour, is borrowed,
not his own, who is afraid of wanting it, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it on others. Springs continually flow, and are never
empty. The Fund of Honour in Princes is inexhaustible,
be they never so profuse: All respect them as the only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
of Honours, from whence every one expects his
share; so the Earth with its Vapours refreshes the Air,
which returns them in Dew upon the Earth again.
And this mutual Correspondence between the Prince and his
Subjects, King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise knew, when he said, that
<q>these in Honouring him, honour'd themselves, because
from him they expect Honour and Preferment; where
this mutual Honour is, there Affairs flourish in Peace and
War, and the Government is established.</q> Nor does a
Prince shew his Majesty more in any thing, than in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
he confers. All natural Bodies the more noble they
are, are the more generous and free of their Vertues and
Gifts. To give Riches is humane, but the distribution of
Honour belongs to God or his Vicegerents. In these Maxims
I would perfectly instruct your Highness, especially in that
of honouring the Nobility, who are the main support of
Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Let your Highness hearken to your glorious Predecessor,
King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Wise, who in laying down Maxims for
his Successors, speaks to this Effect: <q>Furthermore he
ought to respect and honour the Nobility for their Riches,
and for that they are an Honour to his State; and he
should respect and honour the Gentry, as being his Guard
and the Bulwark of his Kingdom.</q>

glorious Example transmitted to Posterity. Those three

and fetch'd water from the Cistern, scarce did

them. A Prince by once rewarding the Merits of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
binds them to his Service for ever. The Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is as much urg'd to Glory, by the noble Exploits of their

as by those which they themselves expect; 'twas upon

Conduct of one Minister is often the Foundation and Rise
of a Kingdom That which is founded in <hi>America</hi> is owing
to <hi>Herman Cortez,</hi> and the <hi>Pizarrs.</hi> The single Valour and
Industry of the Marquess of <hi>Aytona,</hi> kept the <hi>Netherlands</hi>

some of our present Ministers have been the chief Instruments
in preserving the Empire in the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of the

and secures their Estates; the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
because it encourages and prefers Valour in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is conspicuous. The Fabrick of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
arrived at this Perfection, because King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Catholick, and after him <hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Philip</hi> II.
knew how to hew out, and proportion the Stones to its
bigness. Princes complain of this Age of being barren, and
not productive of such great Spirits, not considering that
the Reason is that they don't look for them, or if they do
find them, that they don't give them sufficient Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only promote those who are about them, which
depends more upon Chance than Choice. Nature always
produces some great Genius's, but Princes don't always
make use of them. How many excellent Genius's and great
Spirits are born and die in Obscurity, who if they had
been imployed and exercis'd in Business, had been the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of Mankind: <hi>Ossat</hi> had died Chaplain of St. <hi>Lewis</hi>

Services to <hi>France,</hi> had not <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> observing
his great Abilities procur'd him a Cardinals Hat. If a
Prince suffers a great Soul to herd with the common Rout,
he will live and die like one of them, without performing
any thing remarkable or glorious. Christ went up to the

Nor should a Prince honour and prefer only his Nobility
and Ministers, but also all others of his Subjects, whose Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall be meritorious. As King <hi>Alphonso</hi> prudently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
in his Laws, where he says, that a Prince ought to
honour Vertue wheresoever he finds it, though it be in the
very meanest of his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>A Prince ought to be very cautious in the Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Honours, considering the time and weighing the
Qualifications of the persons, that they may be exactly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted
to their Merit. For that distinguishes Dignities, as
the intrinsick worth of a Diamond makes it more valuable;
if Honours were all equal, they would be less valued; 'tis
a kind of Tyranny not to reward Desert, and nothing more
incenses the People than it; a whole Government is disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the unequal Distribution of Preferments, Rewards
above Desert are a Scandal to the receiver, and an Affront to
those who deserve better. One is gratified; many offended.
To gratifie all alike is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o reward none. Vertue thrives not
by equality, nor will Valour ever attempt any considerable
Action, without the hopes of some particular Reward. A Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
erected for one, affects many with a glorious Desire of
obtaining the same Honour. In a word, Honour suited to a
persons Merit, is a Spur to him, an Encouragement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and a means to preserve Obedience in the people.</p>
                     <p>But though nothing more firmly settles, or more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
adorns a Prince's Throne than Distribution of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
yet ought he diligently to take Care, not to Grant
away those which are proper to his own Dignity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him from others: For they are not like Flames
which passing to another Subject, still remains entire in its
own; but all such which he shall confer on others, will no
more shine in him, so that Majesty will be obscur'd, nor will
any make their Applications to him, but to them to whom
he has granted such Honours; <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not permit
even his Mother <hi>Livia</hi> to receive those particular Honours
which the Senate design'd because he thought 'twould

protected Widows and Orphans, reliev'd the Poor, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
and reward'd the Nobility according to their Desert,
prefer'd Vertue, and made the Kingdom plentiful and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
which acquir'd him the Affections of all. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was <hi>Alphonso</hi> V. King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who made himself
extreamly beloved by the People, by his care and prudence
in Affairs, by a due Disposal of Rewards and Punishments,
by Liberality, Complaisance and Easiness of Access, by his
Love for the publick Well-fare, and by so exact a Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Manners and Customs of the Kingdom, that
he seem'd a natural, not a foreign Prince. Those Kings
who have their Residence among their Subjects, may gain
their hearts more easily, than those who reside in distant
Provinces, for if their Loyalty does not grow quite cold,
'tis at most but Luke-warm, and nothing but the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Constitution can preserve its heat; that is by
providing able Ministers, and by severely punishing their
Faults, especially those which they commit against Justice,
and the Reputation and Estates of others, all the Comfort
absent Subjects have is that if the Prince be good, they shall
feel the Effect of it as well as if present, but if otherwise,
they should be least under the Lash of his Tyranny<note n="25" place="bottom">Laudatorum Principum usu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But because such Kingdoms love Novelty and Change and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Presence of the Prince himself to govern them;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56556:239"/>
the Confidence which he puts in them, should be arm'd
and senced from all Accidents, using the same means which
we prescrib'd for the preservation of a Conquer'd Kingdom?
Elective Kingdoms which are obtain'd by Favour are also
maintain'd by the same, though this very rarely continues
long. And though all new Empires begin with Applause,
yet in this 'tis but short and soon over; amidst the very
Acclamations, when <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed King, the People
began to distrust and slight him, though he was chosen by
God himself<note n="26" place="bottom">1 Sam. 10. 27.</note>. But there are Ways by which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Elected, may preserve the Peoples good Opinion of
him, that is to say, by maintaining those Vertues and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
which made him at first thought worthy of the
Crown; for Men usually change their Manners with their
Fortunes. <hi>Tiberius</hi> had a very good Character and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

him; civil to those who gave their Votes against
him; let him be a zealous Lover of his Countrey. And
a vigorous Assertor of its Laws and Privileges; let his
Council be compos'd of the Natives of the Countrey,
imploying them alone in Offices and places of Trust, not
admitting Foreigners and Relations; let him maintain his
Family with modesty; let him temper Majesty with Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and Justice with Clemency; let him so govern as if
his Kingdom came by Descent, which he should transmit
to his Posterity, not as if it were Elective, fleecing it of
what he can during his Reign; according to the Poet.
<q>A short Reign never spares the People<note n="29" place="bottom">Non parcit populis Regnum breve. <hi>Statius.</hi>

The Prince ought moreover to be peaceable, not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader
of others: for Elective Kingdoms fear such a Master,
whose mind is bent upon Conquering others; but they love
him who is only careful in preserving his own, as we see in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for 'tis evident that all Kingdoms were at first Elective,
and that 'twas only Ambition of enlarging them by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Neighbours, by which so many have lost that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which they would have taken from others. Nor is
it possible, that among so many Casualties and Dangers of
Election, this Enlargement of States should be lasting, for
those very Arms which make those additional Conquests,
will reduce them to Hereditary Kingdoms; which was<note n="31" place="bottom">Si immensum Imperii corpus starè, ac librari sine rectore posset,

                        <hi>Galba</hi>'s excuse for not converting the Empire into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Elective Monarchies love Liberty, and so
ought not to be governed without it, and since Election is
the Scale in which they weight it, the Prince should always
stand on that side, for if he gives the least Suspicion that he
intends to make the Crown Hereditary, he will certainly
lose it.</p>
                     <p>In States acquir'd by Conquest, there is more difficulty
in attaining than preserving them, for they are like wild

King <hi>Sancho</hi> did this way establish his doubtful Title to the

ruin'd by striving to preserve that by Force which they got
so. This pernicious piece of Policy has been the ruin of

he chang'd his Tyranny into Benevolence, and his
Cruelty into Clemency: Vice cannot subsist long unless
Vertue be its substitute; Ambition unjust in acquiring at
first, must change into Zeal for the publick Good to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it self. Subjects love their Prince for the publick, and
their private Interests, and when they succeed in both, their
Fear soon changes into Reverence, and their Hatred into
Respect: but Care must be taken that this Reformation of
Vices, which are now publickly known, be not so sudden
nor affected, as to proceed from Design not Nature, whose
Operations are slow and methodical, so <hi>Otho</hi> thought; that
a sudden Modesty, or affected Gravity could not preserve the
Empire which he had attain'd by Villany<note n="35" place="bottom">Simul reputans non posse Principatum scelere quaesitum, subita modestia &amp; prisca gravitate retineri. <hi>Tac. 1. Hist.</hi>

By these and such like means, foreign Government becomes

In changing one form of Government into another, such
Skill should be us'd that the People mayn't perceive the
change, and regret the loss of the former. It was at the
Expulsion of Kings at <hi>Rome,</hi> where all things, as well Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and Profane were manag'd with that Prudence, that the
People did not perceive the want of those Kings, who had
before the Care and management of both, and afterwards
when the Commonwealth was turn'd into an Empire, the
Magistrates retain'd the same Titles<note n="61" place="bottom">Eadem Magistratuum vocabula. <hi>Tac. 1. ann.</hi>

The Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> was a great Master of this Policy:

ruin, endeavouring to stop they fall, and ceasing to labour

Government, and thus Aristocracy is introduc'd; but even
this soon falls into the Inconveniences of Monarchy; for
as their Children succeed, the Magistracy and Government

                     <p>AN Harp Forms a compleat Aristocracy, compos'd
of Monarchy and Democracy; understanding Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
several Fingers govern, and many Strings o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
not with a particular, but general and common Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
so that the Disproportion between the great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones don't spoil the Tune. One may justly compare to a
a Harp every Republick, in which long Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
have appointed who shall command, and who obey;
in which they have establish'd Laws, elected Magistrates,
distinguished Offices, prescribed set Rules and Methods of
Government, and instituted in each part of the Republick,
such Customs and Laws as are most conformable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous
to its Nature. This makes the first Institutions
durable, and not easie to be chang'd. This Harp of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Commonwealths being thus fitted up, and all the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56556:249"/>
Strings tun'd and dispos'd in Order, though any one should

                        </gap>ansie he could better tune any one of them, he ought to
have a better opinion of the Prudence and Judgment of his
Ancestors, whom long Practice, and dear bought Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had instructed: for some Ways and Methods of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
though they have some Inconveniences are yet
better born with than alter'd. A prudent Prince tunes the
strings in the same Order they stand in, not changing
them without time or other accidents have so discompos'd
them, that they can't perform the Office they were first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for, wherefore a Prince should perfectly understand
this Harp of his Empire, and the Grace and Majesty that
attends it, and be throughly vers'd in the Nature, Qualities,
and Genius's of the Nobility and Commons, which are its
main Strings. For as King <hi>Alphonso</hi> says in one of his Laws:
<q>A King's greatest Care should be to know Men, for since
tis them he has to do with, an exact Knowledge of them is
absolutely necessary<note n="*" place="bottom">L. 13. tit. 5. p. 2.</note>.</q> In this consists the principal Art of
Government.</p>
                     <q>To know his Subjects is a King's best Art<note n="†" place="bottom">Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>.</note>.</q>
                     <p>Those who have most apply'd themselves to this Study
have govern'd with most Success. Many take this Harp in
their hand, but few can finger it with Judgment, few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
its Nature, and can touch it agreeably. Let therefore a
Prince know, that a Kingdom is nothing but an Union of
many Cities and People; and a joynt Consent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of some one, and the Obedience of the rest, which
Consent, Ambition and Force introduc'd. Concord at first
rais'd, and Concord preserves it. Justice and Clemency
keep it alive; 'tis the Care of others Safety; its Sp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rit
consists in Unity of Religion; its Increase, Preservation or
Ruin depends upon the Parts of which it is compos'd. It
admits of no Companion; is expos'd to all Dangers. In
it more than any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fortune shews her Inconstancy. 'Tis
liable to Envy and Emulation; 'tis in more danger in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56556:250"/>
than Adversity; for then it lives in Security, which
creates Pride, from whence proceeds its Ruin; when young
'tis weak, and when old decrepid; 'tis as much in danger
in continual Peace as in War. It falls of its self, when not
exercis'd by foreign Arms, and when it once begins to fall
it cannot stop it self; there is no Interval between its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Elevation, and its Ruin. Emulation sometimes raises
it, and sometimes oppresses it. If it be small it can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it self, if great it can't govern it self, it is better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Art than Force; 'tis fond of Novelties though
they are its bane, Vertue is its Health, and Vice its Sickness.
Labour raises it, and Idleness is its Ruin; 'tis fortified by
Forts and Alliances, and establish'd by Laws, the Magistracy
is its Heart, Counsel its Eyes, Arms its Hands, and Riches
its Feet.</p>
                     <p>This Harp is attended with a certain Majesty, which is
a Harmony springing from the strings of the People, and
approv'd by Heaven<note n="1" place="bottom">1 Kings 2. 24.</note>. An Emblem of Power, and
Splendour of supream Jurisdiction; a certain Force which
draws Authority and Obedience to it; the Safeguard and
Preservation of the Government. Opinion and Fame give
it Life; Love, Security; Fear, Authority; Ostentation,
Greatness; Ceremony, Reverence; Severity, Respect; Pomp,
Esteem; in Retirement the more venerable; 'tis in danger
of Contempt and Hate. It neither bears Equality nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
for it consists in Admiration and Unity; 'tis constant
in either Fortune; Respect strengthens it; Arms and the
Laws maintain it; it lasts not in Pride, nor falls in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It lives by Prudence and Beneficence, and dies by
Force and Vice.</p>
                     <p>The strings of a Harp are the People, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
monstrous, different from themselves, inconstant and
various; govern'd by outward appearances, without search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the bottom of things; they take Counsel of Report,
so void of means and reason, that they cannot distinguish
Truth from Falshood, always prone to mischief. The same
minute of two contrary Affections, by which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56556:250"/>
guided not by Reason; by Violence not Prudence, by
the shadow not the reality. Only to be tam'd by Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Their Flatteries are an aukward medly of Truth
and Falsity; they know no <hi>Medium;</hi> they love or hate to
Excess; are extreamly Complaisant, or extreamly Insolent;
either fear or frighten; and when they fear, are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
Small Dangers at hand terrifie them strangely,
but great ones at a distance, they are unconcern'd at. If a
Servant slavish, if a Master haughty; know not what Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is themselves, and will not suffer it in others. Bold and
courageous in Words, but cowardly and base in Action. They
rise upon the least occasion, and are soon compos'd. Do not
lead, but follow; bear themselves the same to all; are sooner
forc'd than perswaded. In Success arrogant and impious,
in Adversity timorous and superstitious; as prone to Cruelty
as Mercy. Equally blind in their Favours as their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions;
they abuse Clemency by Licenciousness, and rebel
against strict Discipline; if they once shall attack the Rich,
neither Reason nor Shame will reclaim them. They raise
and are fond of Stories, and by their own Credulity enlarge
them; they follow the Advice of the many, not the wise few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they attribute ill Success to the Malice of the Magistracy,
and common Calamities to the Prince's f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ult. Nothing
makes them more supple and obedient than Plenty of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
for upon that their Care and Thoughts are fixt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Dishonour soon put them in Commotion. Loaden
they fall, lighten'd they kick back; they love hot and rash
Spirits, and an ambitious and turbulent way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they are never content with the present State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
but are always greedy of Change. A servile Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Vertues and Vices of those in Authority. They
Envy the Rich and Wealthy, and plot against them; are
mighty fond of Plays and Shews, nor is there any other
way, than that to gain their Favour. Superstitious in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
paying more respect to the Priests than their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
These are the chief Qualities and Affections of the
Mob. But a Prince may be satisfied that there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
or Councel, though never so great and grave, and
of Select Persons, in which there is not something of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56556:251"/>
and which does not in many things resemble the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity?
The Court makes another part of the strings of this
Harp; which if a Prince can't touch with great Prudence
and Dexterity, the whole Harmony of Government is
spoil'd; wherefore that he many know to tune them well,
'tis necessary he should know their Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Court is presumptuous and inconstant, changing its
Colour, <hi>Camelion</hi> like, each moment according as the Wind
of Prosperity or Adversity blows; though it all speaks one
Language, yet all don't alike understand it; it Worships
and Adores <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he rising Prince, but slights him when declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards his West; it censures and carps at his Actions,
and yet imitates them; it hawks after his Favour, with
the Nets of Flattery; ever bent upon Ambition and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest;
it lives by Lyes and hates Truth. Easily swallow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Vice, but Vertue not without Difficulty; loves Change and
Novelty; fears every thing, and distrusts all. Haughty and
arrogant in Authority, servile and cringing in Obedience.
Envys even it self as well as others; wonderful cunning
and dissembling, in concealing its Designs; it veils its Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with Smile and Ceremony. Praises, and commends in
publick, and defames privately. Is its own Enemy, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
in its Appearance, and unperforming in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
                     <p>This Instrument of Government being known, and the
Qualities and Sound of each string, the Prince ought to
touch 'em with that Dexterity, that they may all sound
Harmoniously without jarring; in which he ought to keep
time and measure, and not favour one String more than
another, in those which are to make the Consort, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget others; for in this Instrument of the Government
all have their proper Functions, tho' they are unequal and
easily jarr, which Discord is very dangerous, when he shall
grant too great Authority to the Magistracy; or too much
Favour the Commons, and slight the Nobility; or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to some, and not to others; or confound Offices Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
with Civil, or does not well know to sustain his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
by Authority; his Kingdom by Love; the Court by
Gravity; the Nobility by Honour, the People by Plenty
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56556:251"/>
Justice by Equality; the Laws by Fear; Arms by Rewards;
Power by Frugality; War by Riches, and Peace by Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
every one of these Instruments are different, both in
their Nature, and the Disposition of the Strings, which
are the Subjects; and so should be manag'd and play'd upon
by different ways, and a different hand; one Kingdom is
like a Harp, which not only requires the softness of the
Fingers ends, but also the hardness of the Nails too. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is more like an Organ, which requires both Hands to
express the Harmony of the Pipes. The third is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate,
like a Guitarre, that it won't bear the Fingers, but
must be touch'd with a fine Quill, to make it exert its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
A Prince ought therefore to be well vers'd in the
Knowledge of these Instruments, and their Strings, to keep
'em always in Tune, and to take Care not to strain too
hard upon the Notes of Severity or Avarice (as St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>

nothing scapes. They are publick Spies, and
Plummets that always search the bottom; prudent are those
Governments, which allow them not continual Residence.
They are more prejudicial, than beneficial to the publick
Peace, and they oft'ner breed Disturbances than promote
Tranquility. They are ever making Glass Hives, that they

may treacherously inspect the Deliberations of Councils.
Let a Prince therefore attentively indeavour to stop all those
Crevises, through which inquisitive Curiosity may pry into
his Concerns. For if any Enemy penetrates them, he easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevents and frustrates them. As <hi>Germanicus</hi> did, who

create a Veneration for the Prince; and though at first
they are not well grounded, yet may a prudent Judgment
afterwards find means to make them Successful. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Esteem which we have for Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
would all be lost, if their private Consultations
were made publick. They are carv'd Gyants, which seem
tall and vast to the Eye, and which frighten more than
hurt, but if that Fear shall approach nearer, 'twill find
them govern'd and fram'd by Men of no higher Statu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

How smooth and pleasant does a deep River glide along;

Counsels are Ignorance? When their Resolutions are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd

profound Judgment; they shew the Majesty and Prudence
of the Prince, and we believe there are Reasons and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
which we can't comprehend; nay we many times
imagine some, that the Ministers never so much as thought
of. But if we were to hear the Debates, Grounds, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their Resolves, we should perhaps deservedly ridicule
them. As upon the Stage the Actors appear, Gay and

'tis to keep a Secret, and if it is safe within our own Breasts,
it is much less so, when committed to others; wherefore it
should without absolute necessity be entrusted to none; 'tis
like a Mine, which if it has too many Vents the force of the
Powder is lost, and it proves ineffectual, but if there is a
necessity of a Prince's communicating his Secrets to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and he seeing 'em divulg'd would know by whom,
let him feign several important Secrets, and commit one to
each, and by that which he hears of first, he will find who
was Tardy before. Let not these Cautions seem frivolous

                     <p>IN all Affairs the Beginnings and Ends ought mutually
to correspond; the Form should be perfect, and not
easily to be chang'd. The Potter does not give his Wheel
so much Liberty, nor use his hand so carelesly, as to form
a different Pot from what he began. Let any undertaking

There is nothing more pernicious than this, inequality of
Actions and Government, when the Beginnings don't an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Ends. He makes himself ridiculous to all,
who begins his Reign with Care and Diligence, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
grows negligent and careless. It had been better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to have kept the same Pace though dull and slow, the
Commendation which the beginning of his Reign merited
accuses the end. <hi>Galba</hi> lost his Reputation, for that, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                        </note>. Many
Princes seem very good, and are very bad. Many Talk and
Discourse prudently, and Act without Discretion. Others
promise much, and perform little; some are very valiant
in Peace, and mere Cowards in War; others undertake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing and do nothing. This Disagreement is much
below the Majesty of a Prince, in whom a firm Constancy
should appear in all his Words and Actions. The People
can never be firm in their Obedience to a Prince, who stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
thus himself. Wherefore he should attentively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
before he concludes any thing, whether in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions

the Beginning and End; as <hi>Godfrey</hi> advises.</p>

the Figure of this present Emblem, representing prudent
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56556:256"/>
Counsel, careful of its Beginning and End; by a Ship
moored between two Anchors, one a Head, and the other
a Stern, to preserve it from the violence of Tempests; only
one at the Bow would be of small effect, if the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>There are three things requisite in Resolutions, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to deliberate, Diligence to dispose, and Constancy to
proceed. All the heat and toil about the beginning of
Affairs would be insignificant, if (as it usually is) we are
careless about the end<note n="3" place="bottom">Acribus ut ferme tali<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>; 'tis at each end that Prudence
ought to cast Anchor. But since Prudence only regards
things present and past, not future, upon which all Affairs
depend; 'tis necessary by Discourse and Reason, to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and foresee what such and such means should produce;
to make use of Deliberation and Counsel; which are as the
Wise <hi>Alphonso</hi> says, <q>The best Foresight a Man can have
in dubious Matters.</q> And in those there's three things to
be consider'd, the Probability, Justice, and Profit of the
thing propos'd; and also the Capacity and Experience of
the Minister, who gives the Counsels; whether he be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Interest or private Ends; whether he offers himself to
the Danger, what are the Difficulties of the Enterprize,
and upon whom the Blame and Honour of the event will

such means ought to be applys'd, as are conformable to the
above mentioned Qualities; for nothing will be just and
beneficial, which shall be attain'd by indirect or extravagant
means: In this also should be consider'd, four Distinctions
of time, which occur in all Affairs, but especially in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of States, as well as those of humane Bodies, and these
are the Beginning, the Growth, or Progress, the Consistence,
and Declension; by which, and a timely Application of
proper means, the desir'd End is easily obtain'd; as on the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56556:257"/>

                        </gap>
the Course of a Ship would be, if the Rudder were chang'd
to the Head; the Art consists in selecting means proper to
the Ends design'd, using sometimes these, and sometimes tho<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

those being not less useful and assistant which are omitted
than those which are apply'd; as in a Consort of Voices,
where some cease while others Sing, and yet all equally
make the Harmony. Affairs will not move of themselves,
tho their good Disposition, and Justice, or common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
seem to drive 'em, and if not guided by Judgment, they
certainly miscarry<note n="5" place="bottom">Nam saepe honest<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

with Assiduity and Circumspection; but either they
tire, or else despise these Arts, and will obstinately accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their Designs by their own methods. This is the
way of stubborn Ignorance, but Prudence uses other means.
What Force can't subdue, is easily obtained by Dexterity,
adapted to time and circumstance. So <hi>Caecinus,</hi> when he
could neither by Prayers, nor by Threats stop the Flight of
the <hi>German</hi> Legions possess'd by a vain Fear, he at last threw
himself in the Gate way, and by the Horror, they conceiv'd
of trampling over their Generals Body, stopt them<note n="6" place="bottom">Projectus in limine portae, misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione demum, quia per corpus Legati eundum erat, clausit viam. <hi>Tac. 2. an.</hi>
                        </note>.
The same thing <hi>Pompey</hi> did in another Case; one single
word spoken to Purpose has gained the Victory. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando
Gonsalez</hi> Count of <hi>Castile,</hi> having drawn up his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against the <hi>Moors,</hi> a certain Person putting Spurs to
his Horse, rode out of his Rank towards the Enemy, and
immediately the Earth open'd and swallow'd him, the whole
Army was in a Consternation at it, but the Count turning
to 'em: <q>Courage Gentlemen, says he, If the Earth can't
bear us,</q> much less will our Enemies, and instantly joyning
Battle he gain'd the Victory. That which happen'd at the
Battle of <hi>Cirniola</hi> is not less remarkable; an <hi>Italian</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were routed, set Fire to two Waggons of
Powder, the great Captain <hi>Gonsalvo</hi> readily and cheerfully
animated them with these words: <q>Courage my Friends,

these are the Bone-Fires for our Victory;</q> which the Event
prov'd<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp.</note>; so much it imports a Minister to have a quick
ready Wit, and address to make use of Opportunities, and
by proper means to turn Misfortunes to his Advantage.</p>
                     <p>If after the Election of good Ministers, and the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of proper means, Events don't answer the Prince's
Desire, let him not be discouraged, but rather shew his
Constancy; for Resolutions should not be measur'd by
Chance, but Prudence. Casualties which can't be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
or prevented, accuse not the Action; and to blame
a Man for doing his endeavour is Impudence. This usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befalls Princes, who either want Judgment or Courage;
who being oppress'd by ill Success, and as it were beside them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
give themselves up to Melancholy, and lose that time
in vain Reflections upon what has happen'd, which should
be imploy'd in remedying it, quarrelling with themselves,
that they did not take another method<note n="7" place="bottom">Eccles. 22. 24.</note>; and laying all the
Fault upon him who was the Author of this, not considering
whether 'twas grounded upon Reason or no. Whence 'tis
that Ministers are afraid of declaring their Opinions, and
let slip many Opportunities, without advertising the Prince
thereof, for fear of exposing their Favour and Reputation
to the uncertainty of Casualties. These Inconveniences
a Prince ought most industriously to avoid, by persisting
constant in Adversity, and excusing their Ministers, when
they are not notoriously to blame, that they may more readily
and couragiously assist him in overcoming them. And tho'
there are palpable Errours in some Resolves and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet he ought to bear it calmly; for what is once done,
as we say, can't be undone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought to reflect upon past
Actions, for Instruction not Affliction; it requires as much
Courage, to pass by Faults, as to encounter Dangers; there
is no Empire free from 'em. He who is too timorous can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
resolve, and oftentimes Irresolution is worse than Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
it self. Business requires a quick and ready Genius; if
each particular should take up his whole time, many must
of necessity be neglected, to the utmost Detriment of the
Parties concern'd, and of the Government in general.</p>

should be executed with haste, but deliberated with leisure.
<hi>Iames</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> advised his Son to be prudent

'em long, though that Vigour and heat of Glory,

therefore Empires are in this Vigour, I don't so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
of these tedious Deliberations. For so they gain
more time to enjoy quietly what they have gotten: too
speedy Resolutions being often attended with Danger. In
this Sence that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is to be understood, that Power
is better preserv'd by cautious than rash Counsels<note n="8" place="bottom">Potenti<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But when this Age decays, and the Esteem and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Empire begins to Flag, other methods ought to
be us'd, Counsels should be speedy, and other means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to recover its former Vigour, before decrepid old Age
comes on, and renders it irrecoverable; this difference of
Ages is not considerable in small States, but they should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be ready to spread their Sails to every favourable Wind,
which sits sometimes this way, sometimes that. As in the
Circumference of the Horizon, the Winds rule alternative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Earth; the <hi>Goths</hi> and other Nothern Nations,
had formerly very favourable Winds, of which they made
so good use, loosing all their Sails, that they penetrated even
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56556:259"/>
to <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, the then utmost limits of the World;
but this Wind ceasing another succeeded more favourable to
other Empires.</p>
                     <p>Constancy in executing Resolutions, whether they are
the Prince's own, or given him by others, is always of great
Importance. For want of this <hi>Paetus</hi> could not triumph

                     <p>A Stone cast in a Pond creates such a continual Series
of Waves, that they at last become innumerable,
and wholly disturb that transparent Element, and
calm Looking-Glass; from which the Species of things
which were before distinctly represented, appear now in
Disorder and Confusion. 'Tis the same with the Mind,
in which from one Errour proceeds many, so that the
Judgment being confounded and blinded, and the Waves
of Passion raised, the Understanding can't perceive the
truth of things represented, but striving to remedy the
first Errour falls into another, and thence into a third,
which at length become infinite, and the further they are
from the first the greater they are, like Waves that are
most distant from the Stone that caus'd 'em. The Reason
of this is, <q>That the Beginning is said to be half of the

these and the like Cases, 'tis not levity of Mind, but Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to alter Counsels and Resolutions, nor can it be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Inconstancy, but a firm Zeal to be guided by Reason in
all things, as the Weather-Cock is by the Wind; and the
Needle by the North Pole. The Physician varies his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
according to the Accidents, having Respect to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the recovery of his Patient. The different Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
which States labour under, require different methods
of Cure. Let a Prince then think it a Credit to review,
and correct his Decrees, and his Errours too, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asham'd of 'em to commit 'em might be Inadvertency;
but to amend is Prudence; Obstinacy is ever a certain Sign
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56556:262"/>
of Folly. Yet 'twill be Prudence to make this Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with such Address and Dexterity, that the People may
not perceive it: for they ignorant and foolish as they are,
call Mistake want of Prudence, and Amendment, Levity.</p>
                     <p>But tho' I advise a Prince to correct his Errours, yet I would
not be understood of all in general; for some are so small
and insignificant, that the Danger of being censur'd for
Levity in the amendment of them is more than the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
they can do by continuing. So that where they will
by Degrees cease of themselves, without drawing on greater,
'twill be better to let 'em remain. There are some of that
Nature, that 'tis better to follow 'em, nay, and vigorously
to persist in them, there being perhaps more danger in retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting;
and these frequently happen in War; there are some
Affairs, in which that you may succeed, 'tis requisite to use
indirect means, tho' you incur some small Inconveniencies,
as the way to straiten a crooked Stick is to bend it the
contrary way; in these Cases small Errours are not to be
valu'd, nor their Causes, nor Means, provided they be not
wholly opposite to Honour and Justice, and when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to be reap'd from 'em is considerable: For so they
are allowable, and ought rather to be call'd Disposition to
Success than Errours. Others are so interwoven in great
Attempts, that like Roses there is no approaching them
without pricking ones hand. And this in those Counsels
which concern the general Good of a Nation, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
prejudicial to some private Persons. The Bodies of
States are compos'd of different and opposite Parts, as to their
Qualities and Humours, and a Remedy which is apply'd to
the whole Body, is usually disagreeable to some Part: A
Prince therefore has need of great Prudence, to weigh and
compare Advantages with Damages, and of a great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to execute without hazarding the loss of those for fear
of these.</p>

                     <p>RENOVATION perpetuates the most fading
things in Nature; each individual Eternizes it
self in another, and by that means preserves its
Species. 'Tis for this the Husbandman carefully preserves
young Plants to substitute in the room of those Trees
which die. He does not leave this to Chance, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they will either not spring at all, or not such as he
desires, or else not in proper places, nor will they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
grow strait and handsome, without his Care in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them while they are young; for when once grown up
no Force can straiten them. The same Care ought to be
taken in the Education of Youth', especially in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
where the Constitution of the Climate is apt to
produce great and noble Spirits, which are like fertile
Fields soon over-run with Wood and Brambles, unless
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56556:263"/>
their Fertility be corrected by the Art and Industry of the
Husbandman. The greater the Spirit is, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it is to the State, unless timely moderated by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
A high aspiring Spirit cannot contain it self; it
shakes off the Curb of the Laws, and is eager for Liberty,
and should therefore be restrain'd by Art and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and afterwards by being busied in some honourable
Exercise, but when a little more advanc'd in years, the
Cure for its Levity is, to employ it in Affairs of State; I
take this to be the Reason, why some States admitted young
Persons into their Senates. But the best way is, that
which Gardiners use, to transplant their young Trees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Ground, that the superfluous Roots may be
prun'd, and the Tree grow strait and tall. Youth seldom
thrives well in its own Countrey. For their Friends and
Relations by too much Indulgence make them Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.
In other Countries 'tis otherwise, for their Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
obliges them to regulate their Actions, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to gain People's Esteem. At home we generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a little more Liberty, and are apt to promise our
selves Pardon; but abroad when we are not known, we
are afraid of the Rigour of the Laws, besides Travel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
our Behaviour, and corrects the Roughness of our
Nature, and that foolish Vanity, which attends our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Gentlemen. There Languages, and Men are learn't,
and their Manners and Customs observed, the Knowledge
of which qualifies a Man for Affairs, as well of Peace as
War. 'Twas Travel made <hi>Plato, Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
such prudent Lawgivers and Philosophers. At
home Men are born and die with the same Fortune, but
abroad they raise it. No Planet is exalted in its own
House, but in anothers, though not without Detriment
and Inconveniency to it self.</p>
                     <p>Travel is the great Mistress of Prudence, if made for
Information, as well as Direction. In this the Northern
People are very much to be commended, who with great
Curiosity and Attention travel the World over to learn
Languages, Arts and Sciences. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have
greater Conveniency for travelling than any other Nation,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56556:263"/>
because of the great Extent of their Kingdom, have the
least inclination to it, lazily spending all their time at home,
unless sometimes they are call'd out by War; when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
'tis absolutely necessary for Princes, who have
often occasion to bring their Armies into several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
to have a perfect Knowledge of them. The two
chief Reasons which detain our <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobility at home,
are first, because <hi>Spain</hi> being almost wholly surrounded by
the Sea, 'tis more inconvenient Sailing, than Travelling
by Land; the other is a vain Conceit, that they can't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
abroad without great Pomp, and expensive Equipage,
in which Strangers, though Persons of the best Quality are
more modest.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it sufficient only to transplant Youth, but Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
should be also rais'd, of which vacant Offices may
be supply'd, to avoid the necessity of employing fresh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who must buy their Experience at the hazard of the
State. This is represented in the present Device by a
bundle of Rods, the Emblem of Magistracy; for these
being planted produce more of the same; and because in
each of the three Forms, that's to say Monarchy, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
and Democracy, the methods of Government are
different, so should also the methods of Education of Youth,
according to the different Institutions and Customs of each
State; and according to those things, in which they have
most occasion for able Men. The <hi>Persians, Aegyptians,
Chaldaeans,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were particularly careful about
this; but principally about the Education of Youth for
the Magistracy, the Welfare or Ruine of States, depending
upon the Capacity, or insufficiency of the Magistrates,
who are as it were their Soul, and according to the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of it the whole Body is govern'd. There were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Colleges erected in <hi>Spain</hi> for this Purpose, which
were so many Seminaries of able Men for the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Government; these though their Institutions
might seem vain and frivolous, yet were they of great
Use upon this account, that they first taught those to obey,
who were afterwards to command.</p>

I have elsewhere said, that the Knowledge of Sciences
was a necessary Qualification for a Prince, and will now
examine whether it be proper for Subjects, or whether
the young Commonalty should be instructed therein.
Nature has plac'd in the Head, as having the Command
over the whole Body, the Understanding to apprehend
Sciences, and the Memory to retain them. But to the
Hands and other parts she has given only a Disposition to
Obedience. Men at first enter'd into Society, for the
mutual Assistance of each other, not for Contemplation;
more for the conveniency of Action, than the Subtilty of
nice Speculation: The Happiness of Governments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from the Vivacity of the Wit, but the Activity
of the Hands. The leisure of Studies is imploy'd in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Eternizes all those upon Paper, which the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Times shall invent; plotting against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and raising Seditions among the People. The
<hi>Spartans</hi> thought it sufficient to learn Obedience, Patience,
and Conquest<note n="1" place="bottom">Literas ad usum saltem discebant, reliqua omnis disciplina erat, ut pulchrè parerent, ut labores perferrent, ut in pugna vincerent. <hi>Plutar.</hi>
                        </note>. Too subtil and learn'd Subjects are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fond of Novelty, continually reflecting upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and disputing the Princes Orders, and raising
Commotions among the People; Obedience should be
prompt not ingenious, sincere not cunning<note n="2" place="bottom">Patres valere decet consilio, populo supervacanea calliditas est. <hi>Sallust.</hi>

is the principal Foundation of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire. And
the readiest way to Ruin it is to sow Literature among the

from the same Cause, for frivolous Sophistry is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

Policy and Prudence, as any Nation whatever. Study

                        </gap>es the Mind, giving it too
quick an apprehension of Danger. Most Men are charm'd
by the Pleasure, Honour, or Profit of Learning, so that
few would apply themselves to Arms, or Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
for the defence of the State, whose Interest is in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
its People Valiant, rather rather than Learned. The
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56556:264"/>
Genteel Politeness of Learning, makes the Mind wholly
averse to all laborious Exercises. Study makes Men me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and Lovers of a retired and single Life; which
is wholly opposite to the Design of Government, which
is to multiply, and raise Men fit and capable of publick
Imployments, and such as are able to Act offensively, or
defensively with an Enemy. The <hi>Neatherlands</hi> shew us,
that it is not Learning and Ingenuity, but Arts, Industry
and Trade, that makes a Nation flourish. The <hi>Germans</hi>
and other Nations consider'd these Inconveniencies, and
therefore founded their Nobility upon Arms, not regarding
the Honour and Reputation of Learning; whence almost all
the Nobility apply'd themselves to War, and Arts Military.
Though Literature conduces much to the Knowledge of
the true Religion, yet 'tis evident, that from thence
arise different Opinions, which create as many Sects,
whence proceed the Confusion and Ruin of Empires, so
that the true Religion being now found, a sincere and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Ignorance would be much safer, than a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
and conceited Knowledge, which is expos'd to so
many Errours. These and some other Reasons which
might be alledg'd, seem to advise an utter Extirpation of
Learning, according to the Rules of Policy, which regard
more the Authority of the Prince, than the advantage of
the Subject; but these are Maxims of a Tyrant, not a
good and just Prince, who should have no other Object
than the Honour and Welfare of his People; to whom
Learning is absolutely necessary to confute the Errours of
Sectaries, which always flourish where Ignorance Reigns, and
also to administer Justice, and to preserve and improve Arts
Military, as well as Civil. For Scholars are as useful
in defending Cities as Souldiers; as <hi>Syracuse</hi> formerly
found in the Person of <hi>Archimedes:</hi> And <hi>Dole</hi> in its learn'd
Senate, by whose prudent Counsel, ingenious Machines,
and vigorous and resolute Defence, it resisted the whole
Power of <hi>France;</hi> changing their Libraries into Magazines,
their Gowns into Coats of Mail, and their Pens into
Swords, which dip'd in <hi>French</hi> Blood, recorded their
Names and Actions to Eternity. 'Tis only too great a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56556:265"/>
number of Universities and Students, which is prejudicial
to the Publick, as <hi>Spain</hi> found, whence 'tis highly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that the greatest number should apply themselves to
Arts of Navigation and War, not to Law or Speculative
Sciences: For which Reason there should be greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
given to those than the other, that Men may
be the more inclined to follow them; for want of such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
in <hi>Spain,</hi> there are so many apply themselves
to Learning, that there wants Souldiers to defend the
Kingdom. This ought to be remedied by the Care and
Prudence of the Prince, who should so judiciously dispose
the Education of Youth, that the number of Scholars,
Souldiers and Tradesmen might be proportioned to his
State.</p>
                     <p>The same Proportion should be observ'd in those who
would lead a religious Monastick Life, of whom too great
a number is very prejudicial, both to the Prince and
State. Though Religion and Piety ought not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
by the Rule of Policy, and in the Church Militant,
Spiritual Arms are of more use than Temporal, he who was
the first Founder of that State, will maintain and preserve it
without Detriment to the Publick; nevertheless since human
Prudence ought to believe, not expect Miracles, I leave
it to him whose Duty 'tis, to consider, whether if the
number of Ecclesiasticks, and religious Orders should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Laity which should support 'em, it would not be
of great Detriment even to the Church it self The
Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> in the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Remedy for this Inconveniency, by prohibiting the

But this Proportion in those who are design'd for Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Speculation, will be of small use, unless the Prince
also take Care of the Nurseries of the Commonalty, which
should produce a sufficient number of well qualified Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens

                     <p>THE Policy of our Times presupposes Malice and
Fraud in all things, and therefore arms it self with
greater, without any regard to Religion, Justice
or Honour. It thinks nothing disallowable that is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous;
but as these Practices are now common, they
must need justle and confound one another, to the Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the publick Tranquility, and without obtaining
their propos'd Ends. But let a Prince cautiously avoid such
Doctrine, and learn rather of Nature the Mistress of true
Policy, without Malice, Fraud, or any ill Practice, there
being none so certain, firm and solid, as that which she
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56556:268"/>
observes in the Government, of Vegetables and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
more especially that which she dictates to every
Man by his Reason. Particularly to Shepherds and
Husbandmen, for the Preservation of their Flocks,
and improvement of their Ground: Hence may be 'tis,
that those Kings who have been chosen from the Crook
or the Plow, have made the best Governours. Though
the Shepherd (whose Office is almost the same of a
Prince's)<note n="1" place="bottom">Jerem. 23.</note> enjoys the Benefit of the Wool and the
Milk of his Flock, yet 'tis with such moderation, that he
neither draws Blood from their Duggs, nor shears their
Skin so close as to leave 'em wholly expos'd to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of cold and heat. So a Prince, says King
<hi>Alphonso</hi>) <q>ought more to value the common Good of his
People, than his own particular Interest, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good and Riches of his Subjects, are as it were

of his time, stocking up all by the Roots, fleaing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

he gluts himself,<note n="3" place="bottom">Ezek. 34. 2.</note> and instead of defending them,

just and lawful Prince in imposing Taxes, considers the
Justice of the Cause, the Quantity, Quality, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and also Proportions them to his Subjects Estates
and Persons, treating his Kingdom not as a Body which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56556:269"/>

knowing that though Princes are Mortal, States are

                        </note> and since he expects a new Crop from

Taxes are the Prince of Peace: but if they are too heavy,
and the People not well satisfied of their necessity, they
soon rebel against their Prince. 'Twas for no other
Reason that King <hi>Alphonso</hi> Sirnamed the Great, grew
so odious to the People, that after many Troubles
and Vexations he was oblig'd to quit his Crown; for
the same also <hi>Garcios</hi> King of <hi>Galicia</hi> lost both his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

when they are satisfied of that, and of the Justice of the

as <hi>Charles</hi> VIIth. of <hi>France</hi> did formerly, when

from their Opinion of his Zeal for their Good, they
may think whatever Taxes he imposes upon them are

For afterwards Subjects dread them, and grudge to

                     <p>In raising Taxes, Care ought always to be taken
not to oppress the Nobility: for Exemption from Taxes
being the chief Distinction between them and the

and their Privileges violated, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by the Valour and Vertue of their Ancestors.
This was the Reason why the Nobility of <hi>Castile</hi> took

Marvedees of Gold apiece, towards the Charge of the
War.</p>
                     <p>Neither should Taxes be laid upon such things as
are absolutely necessary for Life; but rather upon
Toys, Curiosities, Pride and Vanity: for so besides
correcting Luxury, they would fall in the greatest
measure upon the Rich, and would be Encouragement
to Husbandmen and Tradesmen, which part of the
Government ought most to be cherished and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
so the <hi>Romans</hi> laid great Taxes upon the Spices,
Pearls and Jewels, which were imported from <hi>Arabia;</hi>
as <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> did upon those Offices which
tended more to Debauchery, than Use and Necessity,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56556:271"/>
'tis the readiest way to Reformation, to inhance the
Price of Vanity. There are no Taxes paid more
easily than those which are laid upon Commodities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
for the greatest part of them is paid by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners;
wherefore in <hi>England</hi> the Royal Revenue is
very prudently raised from these kind of Taxes, the
Kingdom it self being Exempt.</p>
                     <p>The greatest Inconveniency in raising Taxes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
is, in the Collectors and Receivers, who are often
more burthensome than the Taxes themselves; for
there is nothing that the Subjects take more grievously,
than the violence and importunity of these sort of
Men in collecting their Money. 'Tis an Observation
that only <hi>Sicily</hi> endur'd them with Patience: God

<hi>Castile</hi> offer'd to raise 150000 Ducats, it was upon
Condition, that they themselves should keep Books of
the Receipts and Disbursements of it, that they might
know what was imployed to the publick Interest, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56556:272"/>
how it was expended, without trusting it to the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those who had the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
during the Kings Minority. For the same Reason,
the People of <hi>France</hi> propos'd to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. that
if he would discharge his Collectors, they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
pay in their Assessments, where-ever he should
Order; which the King had agreed to, had not some
of his Ministers disswaded him. The Kingdoms of
<hi>Castile</hi> have often offer'd the same thing, nay, and also
to pay off the Crown Debts; but 'twas judg'd that it
would be a Diminution to the Royal Authority, to be
instructed and tutor'd by the Kingdom, and besides,
that such a Power could not be without Danger. But
I believe the true Reason was, that the Court was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to lose so many beneficial Offices, and such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
means of getting Money. A Prince's Credit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not in the Administration, but in the Possession of
Riches. The <hi>Roman</hi> State was not less careful of their
Authority than any other, yet by Reason of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to Collect and pay in their own Taxes; taking Care to
keep the Officers in their Duty, that they might not

                     <p>THE Ingenious <hi>Greeks</hi> included in certain pretty
Fables, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in Hieroglyphicks, not
only all Natural Philosophy, but also Moral and
Politick; either to hide them from the Vulgar, or else that
they might be the better imprinted in their Minds, by
these pleasant and delightful Fictions. So, to represent the
Power of Navigation, and the Riches thereby acquir'd,
they feign'd, that the Ship <hi>Argo</hi> (which was the first
that durst venture upon the main Ocean) obtained the
famous Fleece, which instead of Wool, yielded Gold;
for which glorious Exploit it was consecrated to <hi>Pallas,</hi>
the Goddess of War, and placed amongst the Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as a Reward of such dangerous Voyages: shewing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56556:273"/>
the World, that by the Help of Oars and Sails, they
might make Way through Mountains of Waves; and
by the Assistance of the Wind, carry Arms and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
all the World over. This Morality, and the
Preferment of that Ship to the Skies, occasion'd me to
draw two in this present <hi>Emblem;</hi> as the Poles of the
Globe Terrestrial, to shew that Navigation is the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the World, by Commerce and Arms: These
Poles are Movable, but in their Motion consists the
Stability of Empires: There's scarce any Monarchy
which has not receiv'd its Rise and Preservation from
thence. If the Grandeur of <hi>Spain</hi> were not supported
by both those Poles, the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Ocean,</hi> it
would soon fall: For 'tis evident, that Provinces so
distant from one another, would be in imminent Danger,
were it not, as 'twere, united by Oars and Sails, and
timely supplied with Recruits for its Support and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
So that Ships and Gallies seem to be nothing but
a kind of Sea-Bridge. For this Reason, the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> advis'd King
<hi>Philip</hi> II. to maintain a great Fleet at Sea. King <hi>Sisebutus</hi>
well knew the Advantage of it, being the first that kept
a Fleet upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Seas. <hi>Themistocles</hi> gave the same
Adice to his State; and the <hi>Romans</hi> made use of it
afterwards to conquer the World. This Element begirts
and conquers the Earth: In it Strength and Speed are
united; and whoever can make use of them with Valour,
has the World at command. Arms at Land attack and
terrifie only one Nation, but at Sea they Alarm the
whole World. There is no Circumspection, or Power
sufficient by Land, to defend the Sea Coasts. 'Tis the
Sea which has civiliz'd all Nations, which had been
rude and barbarous, without the Use of Navigation and
Commerce, which has taught 'em to know one another's
Languages and Customs: This Antiquity meant, when
they feign'd that the Rudder of the Ship <hi>Argo</hi> spoke;
intimating, that by the Help of that, foreign Languages
were learn'd. 'Tis Navigation that supplies each Nation
with the Goods and Riches of others, all Nations mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56556:273"/>
furnishing each other with what they want; which
Advantage promotes that mutual Love and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between Men, which is necessary for their reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
Assistance.</p>
                     <p>This Marine Power is more necessary for some King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
than others, according to their several Situation
and Disposition. The <hi>Asiatick</hi> Monarchies have more
Occasion for a Land than Sea Force. <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi>
of which one lies upon the Sea, the other near it, being
utterly unapt for Husbandry and Agriculture, apply
themselves wholly to Navigation: And as long as they
maintain'd their Power at Sea, they were the Terrour
and Glory of the World. So <hi>Spain,</hi> which is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
surrounded with the Ocean, must establish its Power
at Sea, if it would aspire to Universal Monarchy. The
Situation of its Ports is very commodious, not only for
the Support of such Force, but also for hindring the
Navigation of other Nations, who, by our Trade, get
Riches and Strength to make War upon us afterwards.
For which Reason, 'twill be convenient to provide suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Security for Commerce and Traffick, they being
the principal Causes; 'tis they turn all the Ports into
Magazines and Stores, furnishing the Kingdom with all
things necessary, making it flourish, and grow Populous.

and Promoting Trade and Navigation, both in the
Citizens and Nobility; for the Products of the Earth
are not more Natural than those of Traffick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
The Kings of <hi>Tyre</hi> did not disdain to Trade;
and the Fleets which <hi>Solomon</hi> sent to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> carry'd
not only Necessaries, but also Merchandize and Effects
to Trade with, that he might exceed all the Kings of
the Earth for Wisdom and Riches<note n="8" place="bottom">1 King. 10. 22.</note>. We read,
that <hi>Pompey</hi> put out his Money to Use. The Nobility
also of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> thought it not beneath 'em
to Traffick. <hi>Rome</hi> Instituted a College of Merchants;
whence, I believe, the <hi>Dutch</hi> took the Institution of their
Companies. How much more commodiously might
<hi>Spain</hi> Establish them, by securing them with Men of
War; which would make it not only Rich, but For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.
These Conveniencies the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi>

erect Military Orders in several Places in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi>

clear them of Pyrates, and secure our Trade with other

sufficient Rewards for Vertue and Valour; and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency

of the War, which soon after broke out in <hi>Italy,</hi> this
Design was not accomplish'd, or perhaps because God
reserv'd the Glory of this Institution for some other
King. Nor is the State-Objection, against Intrusting such
Potent Offices to the Nobility, of force. Military
Orders were, 'tis true, the Occasion of so many Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions

                     <p>DIvine Providence would not suffer this Monarchy
of the World to be one moment without Gold and
Iron; one to preserve, and the other to defend it:
For if it did not create them at the same time with the
World; yet did the Sun, the Second Governor of all things,
immediately after its Creation, operate in Purifying and
Refining the Mineral Matter, and locking it up in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as in publick Treasuries; where also <hi>Mars,</hi> after
the Matter was harden'd and re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

erected his Armory. Arms are the Hands of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and Riches their Blood and Spirit: And if
these don't supply the Hands with Strength, and they
again preserve and defend them, the whole Body will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56556:276"/>
soon fall, and be expos'd to Ruine and Violence. <hi>Pliny</hi>
tells of a sort of Ants, in <hi>India,</hi> which instead of
Grains of Corn, heap up Grains of Gold. Nature has
not granted those laborious Animals the Use of this
Metal; yet it would have them, like Masters, inform
every Government of the Importance of laying up
Treasure. And though it be the Opinion of some
Statesmen, That hoarding up Riches, serves for nothing
but to invite Enemies, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> found, when he had
shewn his Treasure to the Embassadors of <hi>Assyria</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">2 King. 20. 13.</note>; and
as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> knew, who, for this Reason, employ'd
all their Royal Revenues in Building; yet are their
Reasons invalid, and these two Examples of no force:
For 'twas not <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s shewing his Riches, that brought
the War upon him; but his Vanity and Pride, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Trust in them, more than in God: 'Twas this
that made <hi>Isaiah</hi> prophesie, That he should lose all that
he had<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. ver. 17.</note>. Nor did the <hi>Egyptians</hi> employ their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in Building, through fear of losing it, but through
Vain-glory, and a design to amuse the Peoples Minds, as
we shall observe in its proper place. If a Prince
amasses Treasure, through Avarice, not making use of
it, when Occasion requires, to defend his Country, and
offend his Enemy, and, to save Charges, leaves his State
unprovided of Arms and Men, he will soon invite his
Enemies to forge Keys to open his Chests, and plunder
him of his Riches. But if he applies those Treasures to
the Use and Service of his State, he will at once strike an
Awe and Respect into his Enemies. For Riches are the
Nerves of War<note n="3" place="bottom">Sed nihil aqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Allies. In a word, A Full Exchequer does more Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than Artillery, Fleets, or Armies. When thus
apply'd, hoarding Riches, and Moderation of Expences,
are not Avarice, but Prudence; as was that of King
<hi>Ferdinand the Catholick,</hi> who, while living, was call'd
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56556:276"/>
Miserable and Covetous; but after his Death, was clear'd
of that Aspersion, he leaving behind him but a very
inconsiderable Summ; whatever he hoarded, he used
to expend upon the Fabrick of the Kingdom, placing his
Glory not in spending, but in having what to spend.
It must be observ'd, That Treasures are sometimes col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
with a true and Heroick Design, to execute some
Great and Glorious Action: yet does this, by degrees,
dwindle into Avarice, and the Ruine of States happens
before the Treasury is open'd for their Relief. Man's
Mind is easily taken with the Love of Riches, and is
wholly possess'd with a desire of obtaining them.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it sufficient, that these Treasures be divided
among the whole Body of the State, as <hi>Chlorus</hi> in <hi>Eutropius</hi>
desired<note n="4" place="bottom">Melius publicas opes à privatis haberi, quam intra unum claustrum asservari. <hi>Eutrop.</hi>
                        </note>: For Riches secure the Prince, but endanger
the People. <hi>Cerealis</hi> told the People of <hi>Treves,</hi> That

When the Publick is Poor, and private Persons Rich,
Misfortunes arrive, before they can be prevented.
Counsels are prejudiced; for the People avoid those

(as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> explains it<note n="*" place="bottom">St. August. lib. 5. <hi>de Civ. Dei,</hi> cap. 12.</note>) stray'd from their first
Institution, in which private Persons were Poor, but the
Publick Rich. Of which <hi>Horace</hi> complains<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 2. Ode 15.</note>:

                           <l>Non it a Romuli</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Great Princes, relying too much upon their own
Power, lay aside all Care of laying up Treasure, or of
preserving what they already have; not considering, that
if the Necessity of their Affairs should require Money,
they must be oblig'd to oppress their Subjects with Taxes,
to the great hazard of their Fidelity; and the greater
the Kingdom is, there will be need of greater Expence
and Charge. Princes are <hi>Briareus's,</hi> who, what they
receive with fifty Hands, spend with a hundred; nor is
any Kingdom rich enough to supply the Extravagance
of one. Clouds, in one Hour, spend all the Vapours
which they have been many Days in collecting. Those
Riches which Nature had for many Ages hoarded up in
the close Treasury of the Earth, were not sufficient for the
extravagant Prodigality of some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.
And this Extravagance is usual to Successors who find
the Treasury filled to their Hands: For they spend that
carelesly and lavishly, which they never knew the
trouble of acquiring; they soon pull down the Banks of
the Treasury, and drown their State in Pleasure and
Luxury. In less than three Years time, <hi>Caligula</hi> squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
away Sixty Six Millions of Gold, though then One
Crown was as much as Two now. Power is self-will'd
and foolish, and should therefore be corrected by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
for without that, Empires would soon fall to
Ruine: that of <hi>Rome</hi> seem'd to decline, from the Time
that the Emperors began to squander away its Treasures.
The World is wholly ruled by Arms and Riches. Which
is represented in the present Emblem, by a <hi>Sword</hi> and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56556:277"/>
                        <hi>Golden Bough,</hi> which a <hi>Hand</hi> holds over a <hi>Globe;</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that by both these the World is govern'd: alluding
to <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Story of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who, by the help of both
these, conquer'd even Hell it self, and subdued its Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Furies. The Sword wounds most, whose edge
is Gold; and Valour without Conduct, and Magazines
without Treasuries, are insignificant. A Prince ought
therefore to consider, before he declares War, whether
he is sufficiently furnish'd with these Means to prosecute
it: For which Reason, 'twill be convenient, that the
President of the Treasury should be one of the Council,
that he may give an Account of the State of the Revenue,
and what Grounds they have to proceed upon. Power
ought to be cautious and circumspect, and diligently
consider of what it undertakes. Prudence does the
same in the Mind, as the Eyes do in the Head; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that, Kingdoms and States would be blind: And
<hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who having once lost his Eye by the Cunning
of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> in vain threw Stones about, and storm'd for
Revenge: so will they vainly squander and throw away
their Treasure and Riches. What prodigious Summs
have we seen spent in our Times, upon some vain Fear, in
countermining Enemies Designs, in raising Armies, and
making War, which might have been avoided by a
Friendly Composition, or by Dissimulation? How much
in Subsidies and Taxes ill apply'd, and in other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Expences, by which Princes, thinking to make
themselves Powerful, have found the contrary: The
Ostentations and Menaces of Gold extravagantly and
unseasonably squander'd away, render themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
and the second are less than the first, for one
weakens the other. Strength lost, is soon recruited;
but Riches once spent, are hard to be recover'd. They
ought not to be us'd but upon absolute Necessity. <hi>Aeneas</hi>
did not first shew the <hi>Golden Bough,</hi> but offer'd to force
his Passage with his Sword.
<q>
                           <l>The Chief unsheath'd his shinning Steel, prepar'd,</l>
                           <l>Though seiz'd with sudden Fear, to force the Guard.</l>

                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56556:278"/>
But when he found that neither Force nor Fair Means
could oblige <hi>Charon</hi> to waft him over, the <hi>Golden Bough</hi>
was produc'd, which had been hitherto conceal'd<note n="8" place="bottom">Prov. 21. 14.</note>:
At the sight of which, the angry God was pacified.</p>
                     <q>

                        <l>Can gain his Passage to the <hi>Stygian</hi> Strand,</l>
                        <l>This fatal Present shall prevail, at least,</l>
                        <l>(Then shew'd the <hi>Golden Bough,</hi> conceal'd within her Vest.)</l>
                        <l>No more was needful; for the Gloomy God</l>
                        <l>Stood mute with Awe, to see the Golden Rod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </q>
                     <p>Let Princes therefore take Care to keep those Eyes of
Prudence upon their Scepters, clear, and quick-sighted,
not disdaining Oeconomy, which is the Safety and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
thereof; Princes being, as 'twere, the Fathers
of their People. The Great <hi>Augustus</hi> condescended, as
we have said before, for the Good of the Publick, to
take the Accompts of the Empire with his own Hand.
<hi>Spain</hi> had had long since the Universal Empire of the
World, if it had been less Extravagant in War, and
more Regular and Methodical in Peace; but through a
certain Negligence, the usual Effect of Grandeur, it has
suffer'd those Riches which should have render'd it Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
to be made use of by other Nations. We pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
them of the simple <hi>Indians,</hi> for Toys and Baubles;
and afterwards, we our selves, as silly as they, permit
other Nations to Export them, leaving us Brass, Lead,
or some such worthless Commodities, in their stead.
'Twas the Kingdom of <hi>Castile,</hi> which, by its Valour and
Prowess, erected our Monarchy; yet others triumph,
and that suffers, not knowing how to make good Use of
the vast Treasures which are brought to them. So Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, in a manner, levels and equals States;
giving to the Great Ones Strength, without Industry;
and to the Little, Industry to acquire Strength. But lest
I should seem only to discover Wounds, and not heal
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56556:278"/>
them, I will prescribe some Remedies; not drawn from
the Quintessence and Nicety of Speculation, which are
approv'd at first, when new, but afterwards rejected by
Experience; but such as Natural Reason shall suggest,
and such as Ignorance slights as vulgar.</p>
                     <p>The chief Wealth and Riches of Nations, are the
Fruits of the Earth; no Mines in the World being richer
than Agriculture. This the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> knew, who made
the lower End of their Scepters like a Plow-share; to
intimate, that its Power and Grandeur was founded upon
that: The fertile Sides of <hi>Vesuvi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s,</hi> are richer than
<hi>Potosus</hi> with all its Gold. 'Tis not by Chance, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has so liberally imparted the Fruits of the Earth to
All, and hid Gold and Silver in the very Bowels of the
Earth: It made those common, and expos'd them upon
the Superficies of the Earth, on purpose for Man's Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment<note n="9" place="bottom">Maxima pars hominum è terra vivit &amp; fructibus. <hi>Aristor. Polit. lib. 1. c.</hi> 5.</note>;
and hid these in the Bowels thereof, that
they might not easily be dug out, and refined, knowing
they would prove the Bane and Ruine of Mankind.
<hi>Spain</hi> was, in former times, so rich, almost only from
the Fruits of the Earth, that <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
was surpriz'd at the Splendour and Magnificence
of that Court, affirming, That he had not seen the like
in all that Part of <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> which he had travell'd
through, in his Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> Such was then
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Grandeur of one King of <hi>Castile,</hi> though distracted
with Civil Wars, and the greatest part of his Kingdom
possess'd by the <hi>Moors.</hi> There are some Authors affirm,
That there was in this Kingdom, in the time of the
<hi>Holy War</hi> against the Heathens, a Rendezvouz of a
Hundred Thousand Foot, Ten Thousand Horse, and
Sixty Thousand Waggons; and that King <hi>Alphonso</hi> III.
daily paid both the Soldiers, Captains, and Generals,
according to their Office and Quality. These vast Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56556:279"/>
and Provisions, which at present seem incredible,
the single Kingdom of <hi>Castile</hi> could afford; nay, and at
the same time maintain'd a greater Number of Enemies,
without the Assistance of Foreign Riches; until a certain
<hi>Biscayner,</hi> roving upon the Sea, by fortune, got a sight
of this New World, either unknown to, or forgotten
by the Ancients, and preserv'd for the Honour of
<hi>Columbus,</hi> who, after the Death of this <hi>Spaniard,</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
considering the Observations that he, the first
Discoverer had made, undertook to demonstrate the
Discovery of the Provinces which Nature seem'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
to separate from us by Mountainous Waves.
He communicated this his Project to several Princes,
hoping, by their Assistance, to facilitate his great and
difficult Enterprize: But all slighted it, as vain and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary.
Which if they had done through Prudence
and Caution, and not Distrust and Misbelief, they had
merited the same Praise which <hi>Carthage</hi> gain'd of old;
which, when some Sailors were boasting in the Senate,
of the Discovery of a wonderful Rich and Delicious
Island, (supposed to be <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) caus'd 'em imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to be put to Death, thinking the Discovery of such
an Island would be of more Detriment than Advantage
to the Commonwealth. <hi>Columbus,</hi> at last, applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Their Catholick Majesties, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella;</hi>
whose Generous Spirits, capable of many Worlds, could
not be content with one alone. So that having received
necessary Assistance, he put to Sea; and after a tedious and
hazardous Voyage, in which he encounter'd as great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the Diffidence of his Companions, as from the
Sea it self, he at last return'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> laden with Gold and
Silver. The People flock'd to the Shore of <hi>Guadalquivir,</hi>
to admire these precious Products of the Earth, brought
to light by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and thither by the Valour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of their Countrymen. But this great Plenty of
them soon perverted all Things; the Husbandman soon
leaves Plough, gets into his Embroider'd Silks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be more curious of his Tawny, Sun-burnt Hands;
the Merchant steps from his Counter into his Sedan,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56556:279"/>
and lolls it lazily about the Streets; Workmen disdain
their Tools, and all, forsooth, must now turn Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
No Money is current now but Silver and Gold; and
our Coin being wholly unmix'd and pure, is coveted and
desired by all Nations. Gold and Silver now growing
common, all Things raise their Price. In fine, It befel
our Kings, as it did the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> whom a certain
<hi>African</hi> put a Trick upon, telling him, in his Grounds
he had found a vast Treasure, which he believ'd Queen
<hi>Dido</hi> had buried there, either lest too much Riches
should enervate the Minds of her Subjects, or lest they
should invite others to Invade her Kingdom. Which
the Emperor giving credit to, and thinking himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sure of the Treasure, squander'd away the Old
Stock, upon the Hope of these New-found Riches: The
Expectation of Riches being the cause of the Publick
Want<note n="10" place="bottom">Et divitiarum expectatio inter causas paupertatis publicae erat. <hi>Tac. 16. Annal.</hi>
                        </note>. Cheated by the same Hopes, we were
persuaded that we had no more need of fix'd and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treasuries, but think our Ships sufficient, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that all our Power depends upon the Uncertainty
of the Winds and Seas; as <hi>Tiberius</hi> said the Lives of the
<hi>Romans</hi> did, because their Provisions were all brought
them from Foreign Provinces<note n="11" place="bottom">At hercule nemo refert, quod Italia extern<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56556:280"/>
Riches; which being afterwards ill and negligently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
were not sufficient to defray such Expences: and
this made way for Debts, and those for Usury and Interest.
Necessity daily encreas'd, and occasion'd new Expences:
But nothing was so prejudicial to the Publick, as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Coin; which, though not consider'd,
should be preserv'd in as much Purity as Religion it self;
the Kings, <hi>Alphonso the Wise, Alphonso</hi> XI. and <hi>Henry</hi> II.
who did offer to alter it, endanger'd both themselves
and Kingdoms; and their Misfortunes ought to have been
a Warning to us. But when Ills are fatal, neither Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
nor Example, can move us. King <hi>Philip</hi> II.
deaf to all these Cautions, doubled the Value of Copper
Coin, which was before convenient for common Use,
and answerable to bigger Money. Foreigners coming to
understand the Value that the Royal Stamp gave to this
paultry Metal, began to Traffick with nothing else,
bringing us in vast quantities of Copper ready Coin'd,
in Exchange for our Gold, Silver, and other Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
Which did us more Damage, than if all the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and venomous Serpents of <hi>Africa</hi> had been brought
among us: And the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who us'd to ridicule the
<hi>Rhodians</hi> for their Copper Money, became themselves
the Jest and Laughing-stock of the whole World. Trade
was ruin'd by this troublesome, scoundrel Metal, all
things grew dearer, and, by degrees, scarcer, as in the
time of <hi>Alphonso the Wise.</hi> Buying and Selling ceas'd,
and at the same time the Revenues of the Crown were
diminish'd, so that new Impositions and Taxes were
unavoidable; whence, for want of Commerce, the
Wealth of <hi>Castile</hi> was spent, and the same Inconveniencies
renew'd, proceeding one from another in a pernicious
Circle; which will at last prove our Ruine, unless a
Remedy be timely apply'd, by reducing that king of
Money to its former and intrinsick Value. Who would
not think that this World must be subdu'd by the Riches
and Wealth of the other? And yet we see there were
greater Exploits perform'd formerly by pure Valour,
than since, by all these Riches; as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observ'd, in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56556:280"/>
the time of <hi>Vitellius</hi>
                        <note n="13" place="bottom">Vires luxu corrumpebantur, contra veterem disciplinam, &amp; insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta majorum, apud quos virtute, quam pecunia res Rom. melius stetit. <hi>Tac. 2. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>. Foreign Nations did soon
after find the same Damage, from the Discovery of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> from their too great Dependance upon their
Riches; all things grew dearer with them; as with us,
their Expences surmounted their Revenues: In a word,
they suffer'd all the same Inconveniencies with us; which
were so much greater to them, as being farther Distance
from those Provinces; and the Remedy of Gold and
Silver which is brought us from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and which
they must receive from us, being more uncertain.</p>
                     <p>These are the Inconveniencies which the Discovery of
the <hi>Indies</hi> caused: In knowing the Causes of which, we
know also their Remedies. The First, is, Not to neglect
Agriculture, upon Hopes of those Riches: Those which
we receive from the Earth, being more natural, sure,
and common to all: Wherefore Husbandmen should be
encourag'd and exempted from the Oppressions of War,
and all other Incumbrances.</p>
                     <p>The Second, is, That since all things are restored
by the contrary Means to which they were ruin'd, and
the Expences are greater than the Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Metals; the Prince should, like a prudent
Governor, provide, as the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> advis'd
<hi>Nero</hi>
                        <note n="14" place="bottom">Vt ratio quaestuum, &amp; necessitas erogationum inter se congruerent. <hi>Tac. 13. Annal.</hi>
                        </note>, That the Publick Revenues should rather
Exceed, than fall short of the Expences; That he should
moderate those that were superfluous and unnecessary:
imitating the Emperors <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
the last of which us'd to say, <hi>That 'twas the Part
of a Tyrant, to support them with the Intrails of his State.</hi>
Such a Reform would only Disgust some few, not the
whole Nation. And if Abuse or Imprudence has rais'd
the Salaries of Offices, and Charges in Peace and War;
and if they are only introduc'd by Vanity, under the
title of <hi>Grandeur;</hi> Why should they not be corrected and
reform'd by Prudence? And as the greater the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56556:281"/>
are, those Abuses will be greater; so also will be
the Effects of this Remedy. Frugality is the best Revenue.
Gold once spent, returns not. By damming up the
Streams, the Fountain-Head rises. And the way to keep
Silver, is to fix the Mercury of it; <hi>that</hi> being the True
and Approv'd Philosopher's Stone. Wherefore, I am
satisfy'd, that if a Prince be inform'd by his Ministers,
of all superfluous Expences by Sea and Land, and would
resolve to moderate them; he would soon find himself
enabled to pay his Debts, lessen his Taxes, and fill his
Treasury. As King <hi>Henry</hi> III. who finding the Crown
much in Debt, consulted with his Parliament, how to
remedy it: And they could not find a better Expedient,
than what we have here propos'd; that is, To Reduce
Salaries and Pensions, and Regulate Superfluous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.
The Treasurers also, and other Officers in the
Treasury and Exchequer, should be reduc'd to a less
number, as also the Collectors of Taxes, who all, like
the thirsty Sands of <hi>Africk,</hi> soak and drink up all the
Streams of the Revenue, which pass by them. The
Great Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> though he has immense
Revenues, has but two Treasurers, one in <hi>Asia,</hi> and
'tother in <hi>Europe. Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> (not less a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
than a Soldier) was satisfy'd of the Inconveniency
of this, and therefore reduc'd the Ministers of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to a less, yet sufficient number.</p>
                     <p>The Third Remedy, is, That since Princes are, by
Importunity, often forced to grant those Things which
are not in their Power; all such Grants, Privileges,
Immunities and Rewards, as are prejudicial to the Crown,
should be revok'd; especially when the same Causes
concurr, as mov'd Their Catholick Majesties to repeal
those of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. For, said they, in another Law,
<hi>A Princes Liberality should not be so great as to ruine him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Immunities granted to Subjects, should be such as may
not prejudice the Crown.</hi> But if a Prince, through Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or Necessity, has not consider'd this; it must be
remedy'd afterwards. As was after the Abdication of
<hi>Ramirez</hi> King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> at which time, all Grants that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56556:281"/>
had weakned the Crown, were made void. King <hi>Henry
the Liberal,</hi> and Queen <hi>Isabella,</hi> did the same thing: And
King <hi>Iohn</hi> II. repeal'd the Privileges and Immunities
which himself and his Predecessors had granted. 'Tis
with Princes, as 'twas with the Idols of <hi>Babylon;</hi> from
whose Crowns, according to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> the People took
the Gold and Silver, and apply'd it to their own Use<note n="15" place="bottom">Baruch 6. 9.</note>.
King <hi>Henry</hi> III. perceiving the same Abuse, Imprison'd
several of his Nobility, and made 'em refund what they
had purloin'd from the Crown; by which, and a just
Administration of his Revenues, he amass'd a prodigious
Treasure in the Castle of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Last Remedy, (which should have been the First)
is, That a Prince should first regulate the Expences of
his own Family, if he would reform those of his People:
For their Reformation, as King <hi>Theodatus</hi> said<note n="16" place="bottom">A domesticis volumus inchoare disciplinam, ut reliquos pudea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

'Tis a Misfortune, that Princes think it becomes their
Grandeur to be Careless, and keep no Accompts; and
take Extravagance to be Liberality, not considering how
contemptible they are when poor; and that true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
does not consist in Shews, and gaudy Ostentation,
but in Castles, strong Garrisons, and Armies. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Charles</hi> V. in the Parliament of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Expences of his Houshold. The true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Princes, consists in being liberal to others, and
moderate and sparing to themselves. For which Reason,
<hi>Sisenand,</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (so stiled by the
Fourth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi>) us'd to say, That Kings should
be <hi>Mais Escasos que Gastadores;</hi> that is, Rather Rich
than Lavish. I well know the Difficulty of these Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
but, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> said, in the like case, <hi>I do my Duty:</hi>
And though all that is requisite, cannot be executed; it

                     <p>I dare hardly say any thing about the Remedies of
Money, it being the Apple of the Eye of the State, which
you cannot touch, without hurting; so that 'tis better to
let it alone, than to alter the ancient Method: The
acutest Judgment cannot foresee all the Inconveniencies
which attend every Alteration thereof, until they are
discover'd by Experience: For it being, as it were, the
Rule and Measure of Contracts, every one feels the least
Variation of it; Commerce is disturb'd, and the whole
State disorder'd. Wherefore, after King <hi>Peter</hi> II. had
Abdicated the Throne, it was prudently Enacted by the
Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> That all their Kings thenceforward,
should take an Oath, not to alter any thing about the
Coin. This is the Duty of a Prince, as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III.
wrote to the same King <hi>Peter,</hi> when his Subjects began
to rebell against him. Of which this seems to be the
Reason; That the Prince is subject to the Law of Nations,
and as Publick Trustee, ought to take care that there be
no Alteration in the Nature of the Coin, which consists
in Matter, Form, and Quantity; nor can any Kingdom
be constituted, where that is not pure. But not to be
wholly silent in a Matter so Important to Government,
I'll mention Two things. First, That Money is then
Just and Convenient, when the Coin or Stamp adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Intrinsick Value of it, and when the Gold
and Silver have the common Alloy of other Nations;
for this will prevent its being Exported. The other, is,
That it should be of the same Weight and Value with
that of other Nations, permitting also the Currency of
Foreign Coin: Nor will it at all derogate from the Prince's
Authority, since the Coin serves only to shew the Weight
and Value of it. And this seems most commodious, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

those Kingdoms which hold Correspondence and Trade
with many Nations.</p>

                     <p>EMPIRE admits of no Companion, nor can
Majesty be divided: For it is impossible that each
should Command and Obey at the same time;
especially since Power and Accidents cannot be so nicely
shar'd between them both, nor Ambition so equally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced,
but that one will desire to be above the other, or
that Envy and Emulation will disturb their Agreement.

It seems next to an Impossibility, that the Orders and

when God made them Part'ners, he thought it necessary
to be in the Mouth of one, and in the Mouth of the
other, and to teach them what to do, lest any Dissention
should arise between them<note n="1" place="bottom">Exod. 4. 15.</note>. A Republick has but

                     <p>But if there be occasion for more Princes than One,
'tis better to have Three; for the Authority of One,
will check the Ambition of the other Two. There can
be no Faction, where there is no Equality; which was
the Reason why the Triumvirates of <hi>Caesar, Crassus,</hi> and
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and of <hi>Anthony, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> continued
for sometime. The Kingdom was well govern'd, during
the Minority of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. by his Three Guardians<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mar. Hist. Hisp. l. 15. c.</hi> 12.</note>.
Upon which Consideration, King <hi>Alphonso the Wise</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
That during the Nonage of Kings, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Affairs should be committed to One, Three,
Five, or Seven. Which not being observ'd in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of <hi>Alphonso</hi> XI. the Kingdom of <hi>Castile</hi> felt great
Commotions, from the Government of the two Infants,
<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> which at last oblig'd the Royal Council
to take upon 'em the Administration. Though Empires
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56556:283"/>
are always violent, and of short continuance, which are
divided, and depend not upon one; as it happen'd to
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s, which, vast as it was, ended with his Life;
for that after him, 'twas divided among many. That
which the <hi>Moors</hi> had founded in <hi>Spain,</hi> had lasted longer,
had it not been divided into many Kingdoms. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in this present <hi>Emblem,</hi> by a <hi>Crown'd Tree,</hi> which
signifies a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> To intimate, that if two Hands, tho'
of the same Body, should pull this Tree two different
ways, they would rend, burst, and ruine the Crown.
For Humane Ambition sometimes forgets the Bonds of
Nature. When States are divided among Brothers, the
Crown can never remain entire, and in Union; for
every one is for himself, and grasps at the whole Sceptre
as his Father held it. So it befell King <hi>Sancho</hi> the Elder.
Divine Providence united all the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> to
his Empire, that by their Joint-Force they might expell
the <hi>Moors,</hi> and free themselves from their Tyrannick
Slavery: But he, through Fatherly Affection, rather
than prudent Policy, divided his Kingdoms among his
Children, thinking that so they would be stronger, and
more ready to unite against the Common Enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mat. Hist. Hisp. l. 9. c.</hi> 1.</note>.
But instead of that, each of the Brothers set up for King
himself. So that the Crown being thus rent in pieces,
lost its Strength and Splendour. And as Domestick
Feuds and Grudges are more inveterate than other, they
soon grew to Civil Wars, each endeavouring to depose
his Brother, to the utmost Detriment of the Publick.
This Example might, one would have thought, have been
a Warning to all Princes, for the future; yet we find
King <hi>Ferdinand the Great,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Alphonso,</hi> and
<hi>Iames</hi> I. King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> guilty of the same fault, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Command of their Kingdoms among their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mar. Hist. Hisp. l. 9. c.</hi> 8.</note>. I know not whether this be the Effect of Self-Conceit,
or Humane Nature, ever greedy of Novelty,
and fond of old rejected Opinions, thinking that best,
which was done by their Ancestors; if 'tis not that we
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56556:284"/>
seek for Examples to excuse our own Resolutions. <hi>Iames</hi> II.
King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> was more prudent upon this score,
when he firmly Enacted, That the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi>
and <hi>Valence,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> should never
be separated<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp. l. 15. c. 19.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Nor can these Errors be excused, either by the Law
of the Twelve Tables, or the Common Law, which
shares the Father's Estate equally among the Children;
or by Natural Reason, which seems to urge, that as the
Children receiv'd their being in common from their
Father, they should also be Sharers of his Estate. For
a King is a Publick Person, and ought to act as King,
and not as a Father; and ought rather to attend the
Good of his Subjects, than his Children. Besides, a
Kingdom is a kind of Publick Chattel, and so belongs to
no one in particular; it not being in the King's Power
to dispose of that, as of his own private Goods: For
the Subjects, in submitting themselves to One, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
a Right to be preserv'd, defended and maintain'd
by him; which is inconsistent with the Division of the
Empire: And since this Right is Common and Universal,
it ought surely to be preferr'd to private Love, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Affection, or to Desire of making Peace among
his Children, by the Ruine of the Publick. Besides,
instead of making them agree, it arms 'em with Power
to quarrel with one another about the Dividends, which
cannot be made so equal as to satisfie all. Brothers would
live much more quietly, if their Maintenance should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him who Commands in Chief; for so each
would receive a Revenue sufficient to support the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his Birth. Thus <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> did<note n="4" place="bottom">2 Chron. 21. 3.</note>. There
being no Occasion for that barbarous Custom of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> or that Impious Policy of some, who think no
Government firm and secure, unless its Foundation be
mix'd with the Blood of all such who have but the least
Pretensions to it; as if <hi>that,</hi> like Cement or Mortar,
fasten'd the Stones of the Building.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56556:284"/>
For the said Reason, almost all Nations preferr Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to Election; well knowing that an <hi>Interregnum</hi>
is liable to Dissentions and Civil Wars, and that 'tis safer
to accept a Prince, than to seek one<note n="5" place="bottom">Minori discrimine sumi principem quàm quaeri. <hi>Tac. 1. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, since Succession is best, 'tis most agreeable
to follow the Course of Nature, preferring him whom
she first sent into the World; so that neither Minority,
nor any other Natural Defect, is a sufficient Objection
to this Right, especially when there are greater Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
attend the admittance of another, of which the
Scriptures afford us very many Examples.</p>
                     <p>There is the same Reason and Right for the Succession
of Women to the Crown, in default of Heirs Male; for
otherwise the Crown would be subject to Divisions, by
Collateral Pretensions. And though the <hi>Salique Law,</hi>
under the Pretence of the Frailty and Imbecility of that
Sex, (if it mayn't rather be call'd the Envy and Ambition
of Men) does, contrary to the many glorious Examples
of the Valour and Conduct of the Female Sex, urge many
Inconveniencies, which may seem to exclude them from
the Administration; yet is there none so weighty as to
balance the Advantage of preventing an <hi>Interregnum.</hi>
Nay, there are strong Reasons why they ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
it preventing Pretensions and Civil Wars about
the Succession: And besides, matching the Heiress to
some Great Prince, there acceeds a considerable Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Crown; as it happen'd to the Kingdom of
<hi>Castile</hi> and the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> If the above-mention'd
Inconveniencies are ever of weight, 'tis in small Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities;
where the Heiress marrying with other Princes,
the Family may become extinct, and one State be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the other.</p>

                     <p>WHAT does not <hi>Labour</hi> overcome? It subdues
Iron, softens Brass, draws out Gold into the
finest Wire, and cuts the hardest Diamonds.
A soft Rope does, by continual Motion, wear the Marble
Edge of the Well. By this Consideration, St. <hi>Isidore,</hi>
when he apply'd himself to Study, overcame the Dulness
of his Genius. What Fort was ever so strong, as that
Assiduity could not conquer it? The continued Force
of that Engine, which the Ancients call'd a <hi>Ram,</hi> would
make a Breach in the thickest and strongest Walls. And
we see now a-days, that Castles, though defended by
Artillery Walls, Ramparts and Ditches, are at last
forced to yield to the Spade and Mattock. No Difficulty
retards or checks a Constant Spirit. The Temple of
Glory is not situated in a delightful Valley, nor in a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56556:285"/>
delicious Plain, but upon a rugged Mountain's Top, not
to be arriv'd at, but by rough, uncouth Paths, over-run
with Thorns and Brambles. The Temples of <hi>Minerva,
Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> (Deities glorious for their Vertue)
were not built of <hi>Corinthian</hi> or Carv'd Work, finely
imbellish'd with curious Engravings, as were those of
<hi>Flora</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> but after the <hi>Dorick</hi> Fashion, rough
and unpolish'd: Nor did the Cornices and Chapiters of
the Pillars shew any thing, but that they were built by
Labour and Industry, not by Luxury and Ease. 'Twas
not the Ship <hi>Argos</hi>'s lying at Anchor in Port, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
it to the Skies; but its daring the Wind and Sea,
and resolutely exposing it self to all Dangers and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
Never did any Prince Enlarge his Territories
by Effeminacy, Luxury and Ease. Labour, Traffick
and Industry are necessary to all, but to none more than
to a Prince; for others are born only for themselves,
but a Prince for All. A Kingdom is not an Office of
Repose and Rest. Certain Courtiers once were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
before <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi>
against the necessity of a Prince taking Pains; <hi>Do you
think then,</hi> says he, <hi>that Nature gave Princes Hands to do
nothing.</hi> That wise Prince had, doubtless, considered the
admirable Composure of them, their Joins, their Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to open, and their Strength to hold, and also their
mutual Aptness to do whatever the Mind proposes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it were, the Instruments of all Arts: Whence
he concluded, that this exquisite Structure was not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
or merely for no Use, but for Pains and Toil,
Labour and Industry. The Prince whose Hands are
careless and unclinched, will soon drop his Sceptre,
and give his Courtiers opportunity of catching at it.
As it befell King <hi>Iohn</hi> II. who so wholly gave himself
up to the Diversions of Poetry and Musick, that he
could not endure the Weight of Affairs, and either
carelesly transacted them himself, or left 'em totally to
the Management of his Ministers; rather chusing this
sottish Ease, than the glorious Labour of Government;
not at all regarding the Examples of his Heroick Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56556:286"/>
So we often find, that the Vertue and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Courage of Ancestors is wholly extinguish'd in
their Posterity, by the Luxury and Voluptuousness of
Empire, and so the Race of great Princes becomes dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate;
as we see in Horses, when they are remov'd from
a dry and lean Pasture, into one too fat and fertile.
This Consideration mov'd <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> upon
his Death-bed, to write to his Son the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi>
to inure his Body to Military Exercise, and not suffer
himself to be debauch'd by Pleasures, nor vanquish'd by
Difficulties and Dangers<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp. l. 28. 11.</note>. Labour and Employment
is, as it were, the Anchor of the Mind: without which,
it would be toss'd about with the Waves of Passion, and
dash'd to pieces upon the Rocks of Vice. God enjoyn'd
Labour to Man, as a Punishment; yet so, as it might be
at the same time the Means of his Quiet and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<note n="1" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 19.</note>. Those Foundations and noble Superstructures
of the Monarchies of the <hi>Medes, Assyrians, Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> were not founded by Sloth and Laziness, but
by Toil and Labour. It was that which so long supported
their Grandeur; 'tis this which still preserves Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies
in Kingdoms: For since it partly depends upon
the mutual Assistance of Peoples Labours, when they
flag, all those Conveniencies at the same time cease;
which oblig'd Men to Society and Order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Divine Wisdom proposes the Example of the
Ant, to instruct Men in their Duty; for that, with great
Care and Prudence, lays up a Store in the Summer, to
supply its Necessity in Winter<note n="2" place="bottom">Prov. 6. 6.</note>. Let Princes learn
from this little, prudent Animal, timely to provide
their Cities, Forts and Garrisons with Necessaries; and
to make Preparations in the Winter, to meet the Enemy
in the Spring. Nor is the Commonwealth of Bees less
assiduous than these; you shall never find them idle, but
continually employ'd both within and without their little
Cells; the Diligence of each, causes the Prosperity of
all. And if the Labour of these little Animals can
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56556:286"/>
enrich the whole World with Honey and Wax; What
would a Kingdom do, in which all the People should
be equally Industrious? For this Reason, in <hi>China,</hi> tho'
it be so Populous, that it reckons Seventy Millions of
Inhabitants; they all live in the greatest Affluence and
Plenty, there being none among them but exercises some
Trade. The Scarcity of things in <hi>Spain,</hi> proceeds from
the want of this, not from the Infertility of the Soil;
for in the Countries of <hi>Muroia</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> Wheat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
a hundred Corns for one, and might thereby sustain
a War for many Ages: But this Misfortune arrives from
the neglect of Husbandry, Trades, Business, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
the People, even the meanest of them, being so
excessive proud, that they can't be content with what
Lot Nature has given them, but aspire to something
greater, loathing those Employments which are not
agreeable to their affected Grandeur. The Reason of
which, seems to be, that the Bounds between the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and the Commonalty are not so well distinguish'd
with us, as in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as Noble and Well-employ'd Labour is Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
that which is Nice and Superfluous is Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.
For Mens Minds are not less effeminated by soft
and easie Employments, than by Idleness.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Prince ought to take particular care
to employ his Subjects in such Arts as tend to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and Preservation of the State, not to Luxury and
Debauchery. How many Hands are vainly wearied in
adorning one Finger, and how few in the Necessities of
the Body? How many are employed in making Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
for Pleasure and Recreation, and how few in
making necessary Works for the Defence of Cities?
How many in Gardening, and forming curious Figures
in Box or Myrtle; and how few in Agriculture?
Whence we see Kingdoms abound so much in superfluous
Trifles, and want those things which are most necessary.
Since therefore Labour is so conducive to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a State, the Prince ought to take care that it be
continual, and not be hindred by too great a number of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56556:287"/>
Holy-Days, such as the People, through a kind of Pious
Levity, dedicate to Divine Worship: For Experience
shews us, that such are more employ'd in profane Games
and Sports, than Religious Exercise. But if Labourers
would spend those Days, as we read St. <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Madrid</hi>
did, 'twere to be hop'd that the Time would not be
lost, and that Angels would descend and hold the Plough:
But Experience has taught us the contrary. One Holy-day
in which all Arts and Trade ceases, is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
than any Tax; and, as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says, <hi>Saints
take no delight in being worshipp'd, at the Expence of the
Poor</hi>
                        <note n="3" place="bottom">Non gaudent Martyres, quando exillis pecuniis honorantur, in quibus pauperes plorant. <hi>St. Chrysoft sup. Matth.</hi>

                     <p>Though generally the End of all Actions is Rest, yet
'tis otherwise in those which belong to Government:
For 'tis not sufficient for Princes and States to labour, but
their Labour must also be continual. One Hour's Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in a Garrison, frustrates the Care and Vigilance
of many Months. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which had been
supported by the Labour and Valour of Six Ages, was
ruin'd by the Negligence of a few Months. <hi>Spain</hi> would
scarce repair the Loss in Eight Year, which it sustain'd
in Eight Months. There should be no Interposition of
Idleness between the Acquisition and Preservation of
Empires. The Husbandman has no sooner got his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
into the Barn, but he immediately goes to Plough
again; his Labours never end, but continually renew.
If he should rely upon his Grainery, and leave his Lands
untill'd; he would soon find one empty, and the other
over-run with Weeds and Bryers. But there is this
difference between the Husbandman and the Prince;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56556:287"/>
That he has his Set-times of Sowing and Reaping, but
the Prince has not: For in Government, all Months are
<hi>Septembers</hi> to Sow, and <hi>Augusts</hi> to Reap in.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Prince believe that the Pains and Labours of
his Ancestors excuse him, for this Motion must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual:
And as declining things surely fall, unless suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some new Force; so do Empires, unless sustain'd
by the Strength of the Successor. This is the Cause (as we
have observ'd) of the Ruines of all Kingdoms. When
any Monarchy shall be once instituted and founded, it
should ne'er be idle, but should imitate Heaven, whose
Orbs continue their Motion from their first Creation;
and if they should once stop, the Generation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of all Things would cease. The Exercise of
States should be always continual and vigorous, and not
be corrupted by Idleness or Intermission; as we see the
Sea, if not agitated by the Winds, is kept in Motion by
its Tides. Citizens who carelesly give themselves up to
Pleasure and Luxury, without ever moving their Hands
to Work or Labour, are their own greatest Enemies.
Such Idleness plots against the Laws and Government,
and is nourish'd by Vice, from whence proceeds all the
Internal and External Misfortunes of States. That Repose
only is commendable and beneficial which is the Gift of
Peace, and which is employ'd in Trade, and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Exercises Military and Civil, by which all
enjoy a serene, peaceable and secure Tranquility.</p>

would discourse very pertinently upon any Subject. But
this commendable Custom is out of date; and instead of
it, Princes keep Buffoons, Jesters, and Ridiculous Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
for their Entertainment at Table. The Errors

They love to hear themselves prais'd, though unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly:

those Praises, as coming from some Fool; yet Self-conceit
easily receives them; and the Ears being by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

generally obscene, sometimes vicious. And if such
Buffoonry can divert the Mind, how much more will the
neat and witty Discourses of the Learned, who not being
too grave and rigid (as they are sometimes) can be

For which Reason, the Emperors <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander
Severus,</hi> would never entertain them. If they are good
for any thing, 'tis for the Truth they tell the Great
Ones by way of Jest.</p>
                     <p>Some Princes, through the Glory and Ambition of
Affairs, think themselves sufficiently eas'd, in resting
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56556:289"/>
from Matters of Importance, and employing themselves
in those of less moment; as the Hair of a Mad Dog
cures his Bite. But because then all Minds are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by this means, and that there is no Affair, though
never so little, but requires Attention enough to tire the
Mind; 'tis necessary to be sometimes wholly unemploy'd,
and to quit, for a time, the Trouble and Toil of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<note n="7" place="bottom">Satis Onerum Principibus, satis etiam potentiae. <hi>Tac. 3. Annal.</hi>
                        </note>. Business ought to be so mix'd with Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Pastime, as that the Mind may neither be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
by the first, nor enervated by the latter: It being
like a Mill, which having nothing to grind, wears out
it self. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII. sometimes laid by the Helm
of the Church, and diverted himself in his Garden, in
planting Trees. In these Truces of Repose, Age, Time,
and the Quality of the Diversion, ought also to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd:
So that Gaiety mayn't be offensive to Reserv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Ingenuity to Gravity, nor Recreation to Majesty.
For some Pastimes not only debase the Mind, but also
diminish the Prince's Authority. So <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was
infamous for Spinning; <hi>Viantes,</hi> a King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for
fishing for Frogs; <hi>Augustus,</hi> for playing at Even or Odd
with the Boys; <hi>Domitian,</hi> for killing Flyes with a
Bodkin; <hi>Solyman,</hi> for making Pins; and <hi>Selim,</hi> for
Embroidering with the Women. While the Prince is
young, there are no Diversions more proper than such
as confirm the Mind and Body; such as Fencing, Horse-races,
Tennis, and Hunting; and also those Noble Arts
of Musick and Painting, which we elsewhere commended
in a Prince's Education; which are very requisite to
refresh the Spirits, when exhausted by Assiduity of
Affairs, provided they be us'd with Moderation: So as
not to waste that Time therein, which should be employ'd
in Matters of State.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick</hi> diverted himself so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably,
that even amidst his Recreations he forgot not
his Affairs; but while a Hawking, he gave ear to the
Journals and Dispatches which his Secretary read to him,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56556:290"/>
and at the same time observ'd the Game. <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> never deny'd Audience amidst his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
A Prince should divert himself upon Affairs, as
the Dolphin does upon the Waves, though never so
deep, not seeking the quiet Retreat of some River. His
Repose should not be Idleness, but Refreshment.</p>
                     <p>'Twill be convenient sometimes to entertain the People
with Publick Diversions, that they may breath a little,
and return more vigorously to their Work, upon which
their Thoughts are employ'd: For if they are always
sad and melancholy, they turn them against the Prince
and Magistracy; whereas if they are allow'd some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment

any Burthen; and losing their Heat and Restiness,

To live conformable to Government, is not Slavery,
but Liberty. But since in all things the Publick Good
ought to be the only aim, 'tis conducive to convert all
these Diversions into such Pastimes as exercise the
Strength, prohibiting all such as depend upon Luck, as
pernicious both to the Government and Subject: To
these, because they give themselves so much to them,
that they neglect their Business; to that, because by such
Games the People squander away their Livelyhood,

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56556:292"/>
an empty Shadow stops 'em. All the Art lies in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to humour their Rage; while that works, they
are uncontrollable; they always either fear, or are
fear'd<note n="6" place="bottom">Nihil in vulgo modicum: terrere ni paveant, ubi pertimuerint impunè contemni. <hi>Tac. 1. Annal.</hi>
                        </note>. If any one should endeavour, by a set, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated

lose his Time and Pains. A sharp Sentence, or severe
Check, has more Force than all the Rhetorick in the

among the Soldiers;
<q>

                              <note n="*" place="bottom">Lucan.</note>—Begone, ye <hi>Roman</hi> Drones,</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the most effectual Means to pacifie a Sedition, is
Division; by drawing the Heads thereof into divers
Factions and Parties. This Way we use with Bees,
whene'er that Wing'd People begin to Mutiny, (for
even that Republick has its Intestine Broils) and leaving
their waxen Houses, begin to gather in the Air, by
throwing a little Dust among them, they are soon sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:
<q>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Virg. in Georg.</note> Throw but a little Sand, they settle straight.</q>
Whence the Figure and Motto of this present <hi>Emblem</hi>
is taken. But though this Division be always good,
'tis more Prudence thereby to prevent Ills e're they
happen, than to remedy them afterwards. King
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> IV. understanding the Commotions of some
of the Nobility of <hi>Galicia,</hi> sent for them; and giving
them Commissions, sent them to the Wars. The <hi>Romans</hi>
us'd to send all turbulent and seditious Men to their

chief Authors of Seditions to <hi>Italy;</hi> as also <hi>Charles</hi> V.
did the Nobles of <hi>Saxony. Rutilius</hi> and <hi>Germanicus,</hi>
instead of Punishing some Mutineers, made 'em Freemen.

                        </note>, weakning their
Force by Division. And doubtless this is the meaning of
that Law of <hi>Solon,</hi> which Condemn'd a Citizen, who, in
a Sedition, did not adhere to some one Party. But this
is rather to enflame, than quench and divide it; since,
at this rate, there would remain none who might be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators

                     <p>There is also another effectual Remedy, which is the

                        </note>. Sedition is soon quash'd by Authority
and Presence. As the Blood hasts to the Assistance of
the Part wounded, so ought the Prince to assist with his
Presence at the Disorders of his State. Majesty easily
reduces Subjects to their Obedience; for in that Nature
has plac'd a certain Occult Force, which often produces
wonderful Effects. Certain Conspirators had enter'd
the very Palace of <hi>Peter</hi> IV. King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> with a
Design upon his Life; and he readily going to meet
them, quite dash'd their Resolutions. The Rebellion
in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces had never gone so far, had
<hi>Philip</hi> II. been himself upon the Spot. But this Remedy
ought well to be weigh'd and consider'd of, whether or
no absolute Necessity requires it: for 'tis the last; and
if that fails, there is no other. For this Reason, <hi>Tiberius</hi>
sent <hi>Drusus</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> to compose the Mutinous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions

                        </note>. The Prince's Presence is also
dangerous, if he be hated, or a Tyrant; for then the
Subjects are willing and eager to shake off the Yoke of
Obedience.</p>
                     <p>But if any Kingdom be divided into Factions, by the
private Grudges of Families one to another, 'tis Prudence
to prohibit their Names from being mention'd. Thus
did King <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Navarr,</hi> forbidding any one, upon
severe Penalties, to be call'd <hi>Agramont</hi> or <hi>Biamont,</hi> which
were two Families in that Kingdom at continual Enmity.</p>
                     <p>But if the Peoples Dissatisfaction and Sedition proceed
from the Male-Administration of some Minister, there
is no Dust more effectual to appease them, than the
Punishment of that Person. If they impute to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
that which is really the Prince's fault, and so rise
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56556:293"/>
against him, their Errour must have its free course; since
neither Force nor Reason can stop it, without greater
Detriment to the Publick. Innocence, 'tis true, will
thereby suffer, but not through the Prince's fault. In
all such great Accidents there is no Remedy without
Injustice, which is compensated by the Publick Good<note n="15" place="bottom">Habet aliquid ex iniquo omne magnum exemplum, quod contra <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Sedition is a Poison which strikes at the Heart; and 'tis
therefore necessary sometimes to lop off a Limb, to save
the Body; and to give way to the Torrent of Fury,
though disagreeable to Reason and Justice. Thus did
Queen <hi>Isabella,</hi> in a Rising of the People of <hi>Sevill:</hi> For
when they insisted upon her turning <hi>Andrew Cabrera,</hi>
Governor of the Palace, out of his Office, and were
running on to further Demands, she cut 'em off short;
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> says she, <hi>what you demand, I had before resolv'd
on; Go, remove not only the Governor, but also all my other
Domesticks.</hi> By which Answer, she seem'd to command
that which she was forc'd to, and the Mutineers took it
as her Favour and Kindness; and having satisfy'd their
Rage, by tumbling down those headlong, whom they
found upon the Towers, they were quiet; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she, upon Examining the Accusations which they
laid to the Governor's Charge, finding them unjust and
groundless, restor'd him to his Office. When the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers
think that the Punishment of the Heads of the
Sedition will be sufficient, they spare none, hoping by
that means to expiate their Crime; as the <hi>German</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions

more proper: which nevertheless created no
Disturbance; though there were not wanting those who
urg'd it as an Aggravation, to make that People
revolt.</p>
                     <p>There is another sort of Disobedience, which proceeds
from a too zealous and inconsiderate Fidelity; in which
case the Subjects are to be brought to their Duty, by
benign and mild Means. Such as <hi>Iohn</hi> II. King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> us'd, in an Insurrection at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> upon the
Death of his Son, Prince <hi>Charles:</hi> For he wrote to that
City, That unless compell'd by Necessity, he would
never use violent Methods; but that if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their Obedience, he would use them as his own
Children. This Mildness, and his Promise of a General
Pardon, reduced them all to their Devoir. A Prince
ought always to discover an Inclination to Clemency;
for without Hopes of that, Criminals grow desperate.
For which Reason, <hi>Valentinus,</hi> after he had mov'd the
People of <hi>Treves</hi> to a Rebellion, order'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to be kill'd, that he might, by the Peoples
Despair, strengthen his Crime<note n="29" place="bottom">Quo minor spes veniae, cresceret vinculum sceleris, <hi>Tac. 4. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>. Sedition turns
to Obstinacy, where there is no Hopes of Pardon; and
the Seditious had rather die Rebels, than Malefactors.
Upon this account, those who follow'd the Faction of
<hi>Vitellius,</hi> were Pardon'd<note n="30" place="bottom">Tac. 4. Hist.</note>. This Generosity is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
necessary in Insurrections of the <hi>Mobb.</hi> This
King <hi>Ferdinand the Holy</hi> us'd in the Commotions of
<hi>Castile;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> I. in the Convention of the States of
<hi>Guadalajara,</hi> pardoning all those who sided with the
<hi>Portuguese.</hi> But if a Prince has lost his Reputation, and
is in contempt with his Subjects; then, I confess, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
will be of small use: nay, those very Remedies
which should cure these Wounds, do more exulcerate,
and render them incurable. For his Authority once
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56556:295"/>
lost, he can neither maintain the Severity of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor terrifie the Offenders by Example: so that he
must give way to his Misfortunes, and as prudently as
he can, circumvent them by Policy and Stratagem. Thus
<hi>Vocula</hi> did, when he saw he was unable to punish the
Mutinous Legions<note n="31" place="bottom">Sed vires ad coercendum deerant, in frequentibus infidisque Legio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, <hi>&amp;c. Tac. 4. Hist.</hi>
                        </note>. For the same Reasons, King
<hi>Iohn</hi> II. releas'd those Noblemen whom he had in
Prison.</p>
                     <p>Nor are those Favours and Benefits more effectual in
appeasing Seditions, which proceed from a Prince who
has lost his Reputation: For the Receiver either imputes
them to Cowardice, or persists in Rebellion to preserve
them<note n="32" place="bottom">Nihil spei, nisi per discordias habeant. <hi>Tac. 11. Annal.</hi>
                        </note>; and sometimes sets up another King, by
whose Protection he may enjoy them: As did those who
Conspired against King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. for they would never
be obliged by his Favours, though never so great and
numerous. When a Prince resolves to quench the Fire
of Sedition, 'twill be conducive, that those Resolutions
should be thought to proceed from his own Vertue, not
from the Persuasions of others; for the People are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more Incens'd, when they find the Prince does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by the Instigation of his Ministers. But when
a General Pardon is once granted, the Prince ought
punctually to observe it, wholly forgetting all former
Offences and Injuries; for otherwise he would give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for fresh Commotions: As <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of
<hi>Naples</hi> did, when he offer'd to punish some Noblemen
whom he had already pardon'd, and who had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the Protection of King <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick.</hi>
But if they are afterwards found Delinquent, they should
be punish'd with the utmost Rigour of the Law, to curb
them, and prevent others from abusing the Prince's
Authority.</p>
                     <p>In these, and all other Remedies, there is nothing
more useful than Expedition<note n="33" place="bottom">Nihil in discordiis civilibus festinatione tuti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As Seditions are suddenly raised, they ought suddenly
to be remedied. There is more need of Action than
of Consultation, before the Venom takes Root and
spreads. When the People are once us'd to Murther,
Rapine, and all other Ills that Sedition brings with it,
'tis very difficult to recall and pacifie them. This
King <hi>Henry</hi> well knew, when, upon the Death of his
Brother, King <hi>Peter,</hi> he immediately seized upon the
chief Cities and Garrisons of the Kingdom; and by this
Diligence, soon establish'd its Tranquility.</p>

                     <p>ANIMALS naturally endeavour nothing but the
Preservation of their Individuals; and if at any

that Reason, and a certain Natural Fierceness, which is

all those Things, even beyond the Bounds which Reason
has prescribed him; and his Imagination being cheated
by the false Appearance of Good, seeks this Enjoyment

and so War was introduced into the World<note n="2" place="bottom">Iam. 4. 1.</note>. This was
the Original of this Monster, unless it came from Hell,
after the Fall of the Rebellious Angels. War is so
hateful to God, that he would not permit <hi>David,</hi> as

War disturbs the Order and Harmony of States; changes
Religion, violates Justice, silences the Laws, destroys
Friendship and Relation, makes Arts forgot, Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cease, ruines Trade, depopulates Cities, and alters
Governments. King <hi>Alphonso</hi> calls Wars, <hi>the Alienation
from Peace, the Disturber of Quiet, and the Destruction
of Order.</hi> A Civil War is like a Burning Fever, which
soon scorches up the State: A Foreign War cuts its
Veins, and dreins it of its Riches, Strength and Vigour.
War is a Vice contrary to Reason, Nature, and the End
of Man; for God created him after his own Image,
and gave him the Command of all Things here below,
not to destroy them by War, but to preserve 'em by
Peace: He did not create him for War, but Peace; not
for Rage, but Quiet; not to Ruine, but to Preserve:
For which Reason he sent him into the World Naked,
without Arms to offend others, or a thick Hide to defend
himself; so indigent of the Assistance and Government
of others, that even in his most flourishing Estate he
can't subsist without foreign Aid. This Necessity oblig'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56556:297"/>
him to Society, and Civil Correspondence; from which,
by the Joint-Labour of all, he might be supply'd with
necessary Conveniencies for Life, and that this Politick
Felicity might unite all in the firmest Bonds of mutual
Friendship; and that one Country, haughty with its own
Riches, might not disdain Communication with the rest,
he has shar'd his Blessings among all; Wheat he has
given to <hi>Sicily,</hi> Wine to <hi>Crete,</hi> Purple to <hi>Tyre,</hi> Silk to
<hi>Calabria,</hi> Aromaticks to <hi>Arabia,</hi> Gold and Silver to
<hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> Diamonds, Pearls and
Spices, to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> The Desire and Want of the
Riches and Rarities creating Commerce, by which the
whole World became as one common House, and that
they might understand one another in this Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and mutually express their Affections of Love
and Benevolence, he endued them with a Voice Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,
smooth and pleasant, to explain their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
Laughter, to shew their Satisfaction; Tears, to
shew their Sorrow; Hands, to exert their Faith and
Liberality; Knees, their Submission and Obedience:
Which are all Tokens of a Civil, Benign, and Pacifick
Animal. But those Animals which Nature designed for
War, she created with Arms Offensive and Defensive,
for that purpose; to the Lion she has given Claws, to
the Eagle Talons, to the Elephant a Trunk, to the Bull
Horns, to the Bear Fangs, to the Porcupine sharp
Quills; she has made Adders and Vipers formidable by
their Poison, for their Defence consists in our Danger,
and their Security in our Fear. For which Reason, she
has cloathed almost all Beasts with a thick Skin, for their
Defence; the Crocadile with a Breast-Plate, Serpents
with a Coat of Mail, Scorpions with Scales: She has
given all an Aspect terrible, and a Voice horrible and
dreadful. Let therefore Savage War be for them, not
for Man, in whom Reason is predominate over Rage.
Nature has hid Iron, Steel, Gold and Silver, in the
Bowels of the Earth, lest Men should make ill Use of
them; but Revenge or Injustice has found them even
there, some for the Instruments, and some for the Price

the Right of Victory to him to whom it belongs. King
<hi>Philip</hi> II. was so desirous to clear his Right to the Crown
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon the Death of King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> that after
having had the Opinions of many Divines and Lawyers,
and his Army being then upon the Frontiers, he stopp'd,
to conferr with them further about it. A Prince who
desires gradually to raise his Fortune, may do it by War,
provided he has just Occasion. But he who is already
in quiet Possession of a competent Greatness, ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to consider how he engages himself in War; and
to endeavour, as much as possible, to avoid it by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Means, without loss of Authority and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for if he loses them, the Refusal will rather kindle
it. The Emperor <hi>Rodolphus</hi> I. us'd to say, <hi>That 'twas
more commendable to Govern a State well, than to Enlarge it.</hi>
'Tis not less Glorious for a Prince to preserve Peace
with his Sword, than to Conquer in War. Happy
is that Kingdom, in which the Reputation of Arms
maintains Plenty, and where Lances support the Vines
and Olive-Trees; where <hi>Ceres</hi> is protected by <hi>Bellona</hi>'s
Head-piece. The greater the Courage is, the more
averse 'tis to War, as knowing to what it must be
obliged. Many times, Cowards advise and promote it,

not from the Perverseness of the Mind. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> King
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who carried it into <hi>Africk,</hi> more by the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56556:299"/>
impulse of his Courage than Counsel, with his Blood
imprinted on those Sands the Truth of this Precept.
The Bees don't chuse an armed King, that he mayn't be
given to War, and neglect the Government of his own
State, for foreign Conquests. If <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Gustavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had duly consider'd this,
the first had not been taken at <hi>Pavia,</hi> nor the last kill'd
at <hi>Lutzen.</hi> Ambition of Rule, is that which begins the
Ruine of many States. This <hi>Hanibal</hi> knew at last, when
he told <hi>Scipio,</hi> That '<hi>twould have been better, had the Gods
given Men more modest Thoughts, that the</hi> Romans <hi>might
be content with</hi> Italy, <hi>and the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>with</hi> Africk.</p>
                     <p>Great Princes ought to carry on War with their
utmost Power and Vigour, that they may the sooner
end it, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did; for the Protraction of it is
both chargeable and dangerous. The Enemy is also
thereby disciplin'd, and forewarn'd, and encouraged.
Power, without Vigour, loses its Esteem. For these
Reasons, two Wars ought not to be commenc'd at the
same time; for the Forces being divided, they can't be
ended so soon, nor is any Power sufficient to maintain
'em long, nor Subjects capable to Command them. The
<hi>Romans</hi> ever endeavoured, as do the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day,
not to be engaged in two Wars at a time. Upon this
were grounded the Threats of <hi>Corbulo</hi> to the <hi>Parthians;</hi>
telling them, <hi>That all the Empire enjoy'd a firm Peace, and
that they had only that War</hi>

'Tis the same in War; there is none so distant, but it
changes the Center of Rest of other Kingdoms. War
is a raging Fire, which kindled in one Place, runs on to
others, and very often to its own Home, according as
the Wind drives it. The prudent Farmer dreads the
Storm he sees gathering upon the Mountain's top, though
at never so great a distance: Much greater need has he
to fear, who raises it, by supplying it with Vapours.
Those who foment the <hi>Dutch</hi> Power and Grandeur, may
in time repent it, when subject to the Yoke of their Slavery;
as it befell those who favour'd the Rise of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Grandeur. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> jealous of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> for
that by their Voyages they depriv'd 'em of the Traffick
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Sea, and the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> sent an Embassador

<hi>Dutch</hi> to oppose their Passage by the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi>
But they having comply'd with their Desires, and
establish'd their own Factories and Commerce, quite
disappointed the Republick, who had better have left
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Trade free, since so they might have made
use of their Ships to Import the Eastern Commodities;
which when they had brought to their Ports, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
might with more Industry and Profit disperse
over <hi>Europe.</hi> Thus we see the Means which humane
Prudence makes use of for its own Safety, turn to the
Ruine of the Author. The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi>
thought to maintain the War in the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> and
the one utterly ruin'd his own, and the other made
his the Seat of War. Ill Advice impos'd upon the
Goodness of the <hi>French</hi> King, made him fearful of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
diffident of his Mother and Brother, and of the
whole Kingdom, being persuaded, that without War he
could not subsist, and that his Preservation depended
upon the Ruine of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> and for that
end, he rais'd (with the Blood of the Nobility of
that Kingdom, engag'd in Civil Broils) Clouds which
created a general Tempest against all <hi>Christendom;</hi> the

that he might pass the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea by those Northern

The Neighbourhood of greater Power is not always
Dangerous; it is sometimes like the Sea, which Ebbing,

States gain more by their good Correspondence with
Princes, than by Force. They are cunning Ladies,
who easily captivate their Heart and Will, and guide
their Actions to their particular Ends. Let 'em not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be disturbed, if Princes are sometimes angry with
them; for such Anger is like the Petty Quarrels of Lovers,
which are the Renewing of Love: Let them blame ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jealousies, and credulous Suspicions, which make
them doubt the Fidelity of their best Friends; which is

Reason, but by their vain Suspicions.</p>

                     <p>In those who assist at Treaties of Peace, the Danger is
yet greater, each acting according to his Inclination and
Passion, and not according to the good Intention of the
Prince. <hi>Don Lopez de Haro</hi> being disgusted by King

Peace between that King, and <hi>Peter</hi> III. King of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
differently reporting the Answers of both; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
them more than before. The greatest Misfortune
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56556:303"/>
of Princes, is, that they can't Personally assist at all
Affairs, but are oblig'd to be guided by others Reports,
which are like Streams which are always tinctur'd with
the Quality of the Minerals through which they pass, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
always infected with the Malice, Passion or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Ministers, and answer their Conveniencies
and Designs; by these they strive to flatter the Prince,
preparing them so, that they may be grateful to his
Taste and Inclination. Ministers, and principally Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
eager to shew their Abilities, and that they
penetrate all things, report to the Prince for Certainty,
not that which is, but that which they fansie may be;
they are too prone to Suspicions, which they form from
the least Shadow, and then give credit to them, whence
proceed great Equivocations and Errors, and is the
chief cause of Quarrels and Wars among Princes; for
no Minister but has Power to promote Broils and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord<note n="2" place="bottom">In turb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>. Let Princes therefore be cautious of giving
Credit to the first Relations of their Ministers, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them first with those they receive from others:
And to form a more certain Judgment of what is written
to them, let them be perfectly acquainted with their
Humour and Genius, and with their Method of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Things, whether they act by private Interest and
Passion; for it happens sometimes, that the Minister is
taken with a Love for the Country or Prince with whom
he Treats. and thinks all things Right and Just;
and sometimes suffers himself to be oblig'd by their
Favours and Civilities, and being naturally Grateful,
is of their Side, and acts their Cause. Sometimes is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by plain Appearances, and by contrary Reports,
cunningly spread, and so easily deceives his Prince;
for there is none more apt to deceive others, than one
who has been impos'd upon before. Many Ministers are
mov'd by slight Reasons, or by some Passion or private
Aversion which disturbs their Judgments, and turn
every thing to ill. There are some also naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56556:304"/>
to Misconstrue all Actions and Designs; whereas
others are so Frank and Generous, that they think nothing
ill design'd. Both the one and the other are dangerous,
and these last not less so than the others.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Minister, thinking it part of his Duty
to discover to the Prince his Enemies, and that by that
means he shall gain the Character of a Zealous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Person, becomes so nicely suspicious, that
no one is safe from his Tongue and Pen; and to make
his Surmises and Apprehensions sure, gives occasion, by
his Distrust, to Friends to become Enemies, to the great
Detriment of the Prince, to whom it were much better
to have a good Confidence in all, or for the Minister to
apply Remedies to cure, not to infect the Minds and
Wills of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>Ministers also, weary of Embassies, that they may
retire to enjoy the Conveniencies and Ease of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Life, stick not to promote a Rupture between
the Princes they assist, or at least to suggest Counsels not
less pernicious.</p>
                     <p>Princes are much deceived, who think their Ministers
act always as Ministers, and not as Men. If it were so,
they would be much better served, and find less Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.
But they are Men, and their Office does
not strip 'em of their Inclination to Ease, and to the
Pleasures of Love, Anger, Revenge, and other Affections
and Passions, which Zeal nor Duty are not always ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to correct.</p>
                     <p>But let Princes be apprized, that those who can't
seduce Good and Loyal Ministers, (for that they fathom
their Artifices and Counsels, and know what is their
Prince's Interest, what not) they traduce them as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful,
Passionate, Perverse and Obstinate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour to remove them from the Management of
Affairs, and to introduce others less Knowing, or to
treat immediately with the Prince himself, tendring
him specious Propositions, which oblige him to Resolves
more prejudicial. He must not give the least grounds
to any one, to think that he can't change the course of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56556:304"/>
Affairs, or displace Ministers; for if such Thoughts take
place, the Prince will be ill served: For such Confidence
causes Disdain and Disobedience in the Accuser, and the
Fear of it discourages the Minister. The Errors of these
are less dangerous than those to admit the Accusations
against them, especially if they are Foreigners: And
were they true, yet 'tis more Prudence to deferr the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
till he from whom they came can't ascribe it to
himself.</p>

their Influence and Light is Below: But when
they are in Conjunction, their being Brethren; does not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56556:305"/>
prevent the one from obscuring the other's Rays; and
such Eclipse creates Shadows and Inconveniencies to the
Earth. Princes, by the benefit of their Ministers and
Letters, maintain and uphold mutual Correspondence
with each other: But if they should Conferr Personally
with one another, their Interview would create shadows
of Suspicion and Jealousie, which would put all their
States in Confusion, for that they never find in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what they promis'd to themselves, and that neither
measures himself by his own Rule, but pretends always
to much more than his Due. An Interview of two
Princes, is almost like a Duel, in which they fight with
Ceremonies, each endeavouring to conquer t'other. The
Families of each assist at the Engagement, like two
Hostile Troops, each being zealous for his Prince's
Triumph over the other, in Personal Accomplishments
or Grandeur; and as in such a number all can't be Men
of Prudence, some light Expression, or slight Affront,
causes Dissatisfaction in the rest. So it happen'd in the
Interview between King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. of <hi>France;</hi>

is, to despise the Difficulties and Inconveniencies which

King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> gave a Meeting at <hi>Segovia,</hi> to King

they declare. The Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> delivers up that City

surprize this City from the <hi>French,</hi> and accidentally detain

<hi>Valcamonica</hi> from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they might desist from
their Pretensions, and that the Valley might be clear'd
of the Protestants. The Duke, moved by these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and by the common Danger of this Sect, which
threatned the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and all <hi>Italy,</hi> and also by
the Complaints and Tears of the Catholicks, enter'd the

change their Minds, and oppose this Intent,
entring into League in <hi>Avignon</hi> with <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi>
under Pretence of the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> though that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
more in the stopping that Passage from the Protestants
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56556:308"/>
on t'other side the Mountains, than in any Acquisitions
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could make in this Country; and the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline</hi>
being only the Pretence of the League, the Arms of
the Allies serv'd only as a Diversion, and all the Force
and Design were turn'd to the Oppression of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of <hi>Genoa.</hi> So that Pretences vary according to the
Alteration of Interests.</p>
                     <p>Times by their Effects discover the Falsity of these
Pretences; for either they don't perform what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or don't act where they propos'd. The Republick
of <hi>Venice</hi> had a mind to seize <hi>Gradisca,</hi> and took for a
Pretext the Incursions of the <hi>Vscoques</hi> in <hi>Croatia:</hi> They
made a Feint to defend the Liberty of the Sea, and made
War upon the Land.</p>
                     <p>Many times they make War, upon pretence of Zeal
for the Glory of God, and rather hinder it; sometimes
for Religion, and confound it; sometimes for Publick
Peace, and disturb it; sometimes for the Peoples Liberty,
and oppress 'em; sometimes for Protection, and enslave
them; sometimes to preserve their own State, and they
invade others. O Men, O People, O States, O King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms!

                     <p>When the Ends of Actions are Just, but are in danger
of not being so interpreted, or of miscarrying if they
are understood, we may so dispose them, that our
Actions may appear different to the Eyes of the World,
and be thought to be guided by other honest Causes. He
who acts so, cheats none, but acts justifiably, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muses
Malice by false Appearances, by which it deceives
it self, and prevents its opposition to the just Designs of
the Prince; for no Reason obliges him to point at the
Mark at which he levels; for it would be impossible for
him to strike one, if at the same time he did not seem to
aim at another.</p>
                     <p>There is not less Danger to States, in the feign'd Zeal
with which some would seem to respect the Publick,
and regard only their own particular Interest. They
pretend to reform the Government, to weaken its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56556:308"/>
They propose Means, and suggest Counsels

Liberty, and don't know it till they have lost it, and

suffer themselves to be moved by the Fears of these false
Crocodiles, and rashly intrust them with their Lives and
Fortunes. How peaceable would the World be, if Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
knew, that whether the Government be of All, of
Many, or of One, it would have its Inconveniencies,
with some kind of Tyranny: For though Speculation
may invent a perfect Form of Government, as it must be
of Men, not of Angels, it may be commended, but not
practised<note n="14" place="bottom">Dilecta ex his, &amp; constituta Reipub. forma laudari facilius quam evenire, vel si evenit, haud diuturna esse potest. <hi>Tac. 4. Annal.</hi>

is very Candid and Ingenuous, the Quality of Great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
yet is not its Candour exposed to Deceit, but she
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56556:310"/>
knows how to prevent it; and as sly and crafty as the
Serpent is, it evades his Artifices, and to secure its Nest
from him, it hangs it at the end of the highest and slenderest
Twig of a Tree, in the manner here represented, that
when he would pass by them to devour its young ones,
he falls by his own weight. So Artifice must be frustrated
by Artifice, and Counsel by Counsel. In which Case,
King <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick</hi> was an Exellent Master for
Princes, as he sufficiently shewed in all his Designs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in his Marriage with <hi>Germana de Foix,</hi> Niece
to <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. of <hi>France,</hi> to break the Peace clapt up at
<hi>Hagenaw,</hi> between the Emperor, and his Son-in-Law,
King <hi>Philip</hi> I. without his knowledge, and to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
Nor did he use with less Address the Opportunity
offer'd by the same King of <hi>France</hi> 's desiring a League
with him, to get liberty to Invade the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> contriving the Matter so that he might recover
the Governments of <hi>Rousillon</hi> and <hi>Sardinia:</hi> And when
he saw the <hi>French</hi> King had already made an Inroad into
<hi>Italy</hi> with that Intent, and withal how dangerous a
Neighbour he would prove to the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
which his Eye was upon, he put a stop to his Progress,
broke the Treaty, and denounc'd War against him,
entring into an Alliance with the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi>
and other Princes. And these Weapons are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in War than Peace; for their Wit does more
than Strength. And certainly that Commander deserves
no small Praise, who despising the Vain-glory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
his Enemy with the Sword, steals the Victory,
and triumphs by Policy and Stratagem, whereby the
Law of Nations is not the least violated<note n="2" place="bottom">Cum justè Bellum suscipitur, ut aperte pugnet quis, aut ex Insidiis, nihil ad Iustitiam interest. <hi>D. Aug.</hi>

<q>'Twixt Force and Fraud, what Difference in War?</q>
And indeed, what Reason can be given, why you may
not deceive him, whom it is lawful even to kill? It is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56556:310"/>
a piece of Magnanimity to preferr the Publick Safety
before a Triumph, and make sure of Victory without
exposing it to the manifest Fortune of War, when there's
none, in Humane Judgment, can appear so certain, but
it is subject to a thousand Chances. In countermining
the cunning Designs and Intrigues of an Enemy, we
must not always regard what a Prudent Man would do
in the like case, (though to have also some Fore-thought
of <hi>that</hi> were adviseable) but a Judgment must be formed
from the Condition and Capacity of the Person to be
dealt with; for all Men take not always the most proper
and prudent Methods. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> 's entring
<hi>Portugal</hi> with an Army, upon King <hi>Sebastian</hi> 's Death, was
Amazing; by several blamed as a very Dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
in a Person so eminently versed in the Art of
War. To whom he reply'd, <hi>That he was not ignorant of
the Danger; but he trusted in having to do with a Nation,
which by a continued Enjoyment of Peace, had probably forgot
the Affairs of War.</hi> Even when we have to do with Men
eminent for Prudence, the Judgment and Conjecture we
pass upon their Actions, even by the Rule of Reason and
Prudence, is not infallibly certain; for sometimes they
suffer themselves to be carry'd away by Passion, and the
wisest Men are now and then guilty of the greatest Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Self-conceit rendring them negligent, or too much
Confidence in their Discretion, making them presume,
that though they have a little lost their Way, they can
easily find it again. Sometimes in Things they presuppose,
Time and other Events deceive them. Wherefore it is
the safest way, ever to suspend one's Judgment in Things
that depend upon another's Pleasure, and not to go
about to regulate them by our own Private Discretion;
for every one has his particular Reasons unknown to
others, and consonant to his Nature, which are the
Spring of his Actions. What to one seems impossible,
another thinks easie: And there be some Genius's that
fear not the most hazardous Enterprises; some that
are guided by Reason, others that are utterly averse
to it.</p>

The most secret Artifices of Enemies, or those who
under colour of Friendship, aim wholly at their own
Interest, are such particularly whereby they make their
Proposals with so much Subtilty, that they seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Prince's Advantage, when they really tend
to his Ruine; a Thing his Integrity is easily deluded in,
if he want Experience, or smell not their Drift. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
therefore no small Prudence and Attention to
turn such Counsels to the Destruction of the Authors
thereof. Into what Precipes will that Government fall,
which is directed by Foreign Councils, contrary to the
Advice of the Holy Ghost<note n="4" place="bottom">Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 34.</note>. But although an Enemy's
Designs are usually discoverable by bare Reasoning,
yet is it convenient to trace them also by Spies, the
principal Instruments of Government, without which
a Crown can never be secure, or admit of Encrease, nor
a War be carry'd on with Success<note n="5" place="bottom">Ignarus militiae, improvidus con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in a readiness to expect them. When Time favours, it
is assisted by Delay; otherwise Expedition surmounts it,
and then Counsellors of lively, active Spirits, are chiefly
necessary. Other Affairs, which allow Time, should be
transacted with Maturity; for nothing is more opposite
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56556:312"/>
to Prudence, than Haste and Passion. Impetuousness
ever miscarries, and Examination and Attention are
confounded by it. Hence it is that hot, rash Counsels
almost always please at first Sight; are difficult in the
Execution; in the Event grievous; and the Persons who
suggest them, though they may appear at first daring,
yet when they come to execute, are at a stand, being
embroiled by their own Counsels: For Haste is blind,
and without Forecast<note n="3" place="bottom">Omnia non properanti clara certaque sunt, festinatio improvida est &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And although the Common People love to see Effects
before they do Causes, and so always condemn slow
Counsels; yet the Prince ought to be Proof against these

Though both in the one and the other Prudence should

Prickles and Difficulties, by being too slow.</p>
                     <p>When therefore Orders come first out of the Prince's
Hand, let them be Absolute, to prevent Confusion or
Doubt in their Execution. For the most prudent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
can never perform as they ought, such as come to
them rough and deformed: It is for him that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to prescribe the Form, for the Subject to Execute
it. And if each do not keep to their distinct Duties, the
Work will remain defective. The Prince should do the
part of a Master-Workman, the Minister that of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Labourer. That Prince who leaves all to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of his Ministers, either is ignorant or weary of his
Office. 'Tis an ill-constituted Government, where
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ower is lodg'd in many; nay, it is indeed no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is not under one Head. If Ministers Rule,
all Authority and the Order of Government will perish.
Then only they may and ought to suspend the Execution
of Orders, when the same appear evidently unjust,
inasmuch as they are born for God, before their Prince.
As also when the Prince's Commands are prejudicial to
his Patrimony or Reputation, or inconsistent with good
Government, and depend upon the knowledge of some
particular Matters of Fact, or lastly, when Distance or
other Accidents shall seem to have made such an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56556:313"/>
in the state of Affairs, that it may be probably ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
that had the Prince known these before, he
would not have given those Orders; in this Case, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
however there be no other considerable Danger
in Delaying, they may be deferred and excepted against,
modestly however, and with all the Respect due to his
Authority and Judgment, with this Hope at least, that
upon better Information, he may Command what is more
proper to be done. Thus the <hi>Great Captain</hi> did, when,
contrary to the Orders of <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick,</hi> he
stay'd at <hi>Naples</hi> with his Army, considering with what
Impatience the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes expected the Result of the
Interview between the two Kings, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his
Son-in-Law, <hi>Philip</hi> I. and what a desperate Condition
the Affairs of <hi>Naples</hi> would be in, if he abandon'd them
at that Juncture. For all this, if the Minister know his
Prince to be so great a Lover of his own Counsels, as
rather to do amiss, than admit of Instruction, he may
hold his Tongue, and Dissemble; for it were down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Folly for him to expose himself to Danger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hopes of a Remedy. <hi>Corbulo</hi> was already engaged
in some considerable Enterprize; but the Emperor
having Commanded him to desist, he retir'd: For tho'

                     <p>No Orders require so punctual Observance in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
as those which relate to Matters of State. In
this Case (unless the above-mention'd Circumstances
occurr, or there be otherwise any considerable evident
Danger in the Execution) he is implicitly to Obey,
without giving any heed to his private Opinion and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ments.
For the Designs of Princes are often too
deeply rooted, to be penetrated by the Minister, or
rather they would not have him dive into them; and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56556:314"/>
therefore he should side with the Prince's Commands,
and presume upon his Prudence that so it ought to be.
Hence <hi>Dolabella,</hi> when Commanded by <hi>Tiberius</hi> to bring
the Ninth Legion out of <hi>Germany,</hi> readily Obeyed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he wanted not Reasons to the contrary<note n="11" place="bottom">Iussa Principis magis, quam incerta belli metuens. <hi>Tac. l.</hi> 4. Annal.</note>.
If every one had liberty to canvas and examine what is
enjoined, all things would be confounded, and infinite
Opportunities lost. A Kingdom (as has been said else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
is like a Musical Instrument, whose Strings the
Prince tunes, who runs them all over with his Fingers;
whereas the Minister touches only one, and not hearing
the rest sound, cannot know whether it be too high or
too low, and would very easily be mistaken, if he went
to set it according to his own Fancy. The Count
<hi>de Fuentes,</hi> by the liberty of his Years, Zeal, Services and
Experiences, crowned with so many signal Trophies and
Victories gave him, sometimes (while he governed the
State of <hi>Milan</hi>) suspended his Obedience to King <hi>Philip</hi>
the Third's Orders, because he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>udged them improper,
and to proceed rather from the Self-Interest or Ignorance
of his Ministers, than his own Mind: Which Example
many afterwards have followed, to the great prejudice
of the Publick Repose, and Regal Authority. It would
be of very ill Consequence, for Ministers to be always
allow'd to question, whether what is Commanded, be
the Prince's Will or not; an Abuse which usually has
its first Rise from their knowing it not to be his own
Hand that proportions and polishes the Stones designed
for the Edifice of Government. But suppose it be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
yet due Honour and submission ought to be paid to
the Commands, no less than if they came from his own
Will and Judgment, or else there would be nothing but
Confusion and Disorder. Zealous and Prudent Obedience
reverences the bare Hand and Seal of its Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>But if Princes are too remote, and there is Danger of
their Orders coming too late, even after the Event, or
that variety of Accidents (particularly in Affairs of War)
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56556:314"/>
may not allow Time for Deliberation, and there be
certain Intelligence that the Opportunity will be in the
mean time lost, it will be Prudence to give full Power
of Acting as Occasion shall require, lest that happen
which befell <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in the Civil War with <hi>Vitellius,</hi>
when Distance of Place made the Counsels come after the
Events. To avoid which Inconveniency, <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
upon sending <hi>Drusus</hi> to Command the <hi>German</hi> Legions,
joined with him some Prudent and Experienc'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
whom he might Consult as Occasion required,
but a full Power to Act as he saw Opportunity. When
<hi>Helvidius Priscus</hi> was sent into <hi>Armenia,</hi> he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Act as he saw Occasion. In<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fine, this was the
usual Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, to leave all to the
Discretion and Conduct of their Commanders, and to
recommend nothing in particular to them, but only all
possible Care that the Commonwealth suffer'd no
Damage. An Example the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and
<hi>Florence</hi> are far from imitating; who, unwilling to let
their Liberty lie at the Mercy of one Man, restrain
the Power of their Generals; being forewarned by the
Example of <hi>Augustus,</hi> who turned the Arms upon the
Commonwealth, which he had taken up in its Defence
against <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Freedom of Power the Ministers who are near
the King's Person are wont to limit, to encrease their
own, and render it necessary for all to pass through
their Hands. Whence it is that so much Time is spent
in Deliberating, and that Resolutions are taken too late
to be executed, or at least to have the Success that might
be expected from them; and consequently the Charges
and Pains in Preventing is utterly thrown away. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
also sometimes, that while there passes so great a
Space of Time between the Accidents themselves, and
their being known and examined, fresh Advice is brought
of the State of Affairs, with new Circumstances, which
make it necessary to alter the former Orders; and after
this manner Days and Years slide away, without any
Effect either of Resolution or Action.</p>

                     <p>THE Forces of all Powers are limited, those of
Ambition alone (the common Vice of Humane
Nature) infinite. This, the more it has, the
more it desires to have, or rather is a kind of fiery Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
by the Heart exhaled, which draws Strength and
Encrease from the very Matter it is apply'd to. This
Failing is greater in Princes than in other Men; for to
the Desire of Getting is joined that Glory of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
both which neither submit to Reason nor
Danger, and hate to measure themselves by their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Wherefore the Prince ought to weigh well what
his Sword is able to strike, what his Shield to defend,
always remembring this, that his Crown is a finite and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56556:315"/>
limited Circle. King <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick,</hi> in all his
Undertakings, never failed to consider every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of them, their Cause, Disposition, Time, Means,
and End. He who attempts nothing but what he can
effect, will pass for Invincible; whereas one that aspires
to a Thing impossible, or too difficult, discovers the
Bounds of his Power, and the frustrated Designs are, as
'twere, publick Records of his Weakness. There is no
Monarchy so Potent, but it is upheld more by Opinion
than Reality, by Reputation than Strength. Desire of
Glory and Sovereignty hurry us on, so that all things
seem easie, but in the end we meet with Difficulties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observed
before. Almost all Wars might be avoided,
were their Means and End throughly examined at first:
It is therefore incumbent on the Prince, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in them, perfectly to know his Forces, as well
Offensive as Defensive, the State of his Malitia, and
what Officers he has to Command them, the Substance
of his Coffers, what Contributions he may expect from
his Subjects, and whether they be like to continue Loyal
in Adversity, also by Study, Reading and Conversation,
to instruct himself in the Disposition and Situation of
Countries, in the Customs of Nations, the Natures of
his Enemies, their Wealth, Auxiliaries and Allies.
Let him measure every one's Sword, and examine
wherein his Strength consists. <hi>Henry,</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi>
notwithstanding his Sickness, never neglected this, but
sent several Embassadors as far as <hi>Asia,</hi> to inform him of
the Manners and Customs of those Parts. The same
did <hi>Moses,</hi> before the <hi>Israelites</hi> entred the Promised
Land<note n="1" place="bottom">See the land what it is, and the People that dwell therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 18.</note>. And lest the Prince we frame by these
<hi>Emblems</hi> should want this Matter also, I shall here, in
general, touch upon some Points of it, with what brevity
the present Design requires.</p>
                     <p>Nature, willing to shew her Beauty and Power, by
the variety of her Productions, has stampt a Difference
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56556:316"/>
not only upon the Faces, but also on the Minds of Men;
there being a vast Disagreement between the Tempers
and Morals of Nations. To this end, she has variously
disposed the Causes themselves; which either jointly all
operate in some Places, or separately; in these some, in
those others. Geographers have divided the Globe of
the Earth into divers Climates, each of which is subject
to a particular Planet, as to the principal Cause and
Fountain of that Diversity: And because the First Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
which is drawn through <hi>Meroe,</hi> an Island of the
River <hi>Nile,</hi> is subject to <hi>Saturn,</hi> they say its Inhabitants
are Black, Barbarous, Rough, Suspicious, Treacherous,
and Cannibals.</p>
                     <p>That those of the Second, which is attributed to
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> and passes through <hi>Siene,</hi> a City of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are
Religious, Grave, Honest and Prudent.</p>
                     <p>Those of the Third, which is subject to <hi>Mars,</hi> and
reaches through <hi>Alexandria,</hi> are Restless and Warlike.</p>
                     <p>Those of the Fourth, which is under the Sun, and is
stretch'd through the Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and the Midst of
<hi>Greece,</hi> are Men of Learning, Orators, Poets, and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Artists.</p>
                     <p>Those of the Fifth, which passes through <hi>Rome,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>Savoy,</hi> and is ascribed to <hi>Venus,</hi> are
Effeminate, Lovers of Musick and Luxury.</p>
                     <p>Those of the Sixth, govern'd by <hi>Mercury,</hi> and passing
through <hi>France,</hi> are Fickle, Inconstant, and addicted to
Sciences.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Those of the Seventh, where the <hi>Moon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
and which is extended through <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> are Flegmatick, Lovers of Good-Fellowship,
Fishing, and Trading.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, this one Cause seems not to be always
uniform, nor sufficient: For under the same Parallel or
Climate, with the same Elevation of the Pole, and an
equal Rising and Setting of the Stars, we see opposite
Effects, particularly in the Climates of the Lower Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere.
In <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> for Instance, the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Beams
scorch and blacken Mens Bodies; but in <hi>Brasil,</hi> which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56556:316"/>
has the same Latitude, their Skins are White, and the
Air Temperate and Agreeable. The Ancients held
the Torrid Zone, for its excessive Heat, to be uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable,
yet in <hi>Armenia</hi> it is very Temperate, and well
Peopled. And though those Eternal Luminaries of
Heaven have some energy, yet the Disposition of the
Earth contributes more; for we find the Effects of their
Rays to be greater or varied, according to the various
Situation of Hills and Valleys, and temper'd even by
Rivers and Lakes. This is undeniable, That Nature is
wonderful in her Works, and that she sometimes seems
to swerve from the ordinary Laws of Causes, and from
Reason, as it were on purpose to baffle Humane Curiosity.
Who can account for what we see happen in the Country
of <hi>Malabar,</hi> where <hi>Calecut</hi> is? Vast high Mountains,
which touch the very Clouds, and end in a Promontory
call'd anciently <hi>Corus,</hi> now Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> divide this
Country into two Parts, and altho' both have the same
Elevation of the Pole, yet when on this side the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
Winter begins, and <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Billows rage and
swell, on the other side the Fields and Towns are burnt
up with the scorching Heats of Summer, and the Waters

their very Natures. For the Manners of the Mind follow

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56556:317"/>
did heretofore, as its Spiritual one does at this day,
Rule almost the whole World. They are no less able
and fit to Command, than Obey; of Prodigious Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Ingenuity in Arts, as well of Peace as War.
Their excess of Judgment makes them enclinable to
Suspicion, to the prejudice of themselves, and other
Nations. They are in continual fear and jealousie of
greater Powers, and make it their endeavour to balance
them. There's not a Sword drawn, nor Pike trail'd in
any part of the Earth, but what has been first made and
sharpened in the Forge of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Germany,</hi> variety of Religions, Civil Wars, and
the Soldiers of other Nations serving there, have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
their ancient Candour and Ingenuity of Mind.
And as things of a Delicate Make receive most Damage
by being corrupted; so where Foreign Malice has
infected these People, it has render'd them more Mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Depraved in their Morals. Some of them have
wholly thrown off Allegiance to their Prince. The
Horror of so many Cruelties has render'd their Minds so
Savage, that they are neither touch'd with Love nor
Compassion towards their Neighbours or one another.
One cannot, without Tears, compare what this Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious

Nations. Their Obedience and Patience in War is great,
their Hearts strenuous and valiant. The Power of the
Empire perished, by being too prodigal of it Grandeur
and Majesty among the Princes, and suffering the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of so many Provinces, and the too great Liberty
of the Free Towns, the chief Rise of its Troubles, by
the Disunion of the Parts of so Puissant a Body.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> are Civil, Affable, and Warlike: Their
first Onsets, with the same Speed they are heated, cool
again. They neither know how to keep within the
Bounds of their own, nor preserve themselves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Land; are Impatient and Fickle; in Look lovely,
in Manners intolerable; their Vivacity, and Freedom
of Action, being very disagreeable to the Gravity of
other Nations. All Arts and Sciences flourish among
them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>English</hi> are Grave and Resolute, have a good
Opinion of themselves; and, when Occasion requires,
undauntedly expose their Lives to the greatest Dangers,
though sometimes carry'd on by too bold and impetuous
Passion, rather than premeditated Choice. They are
excellent and Powerful by Sea, and good Soldiers also
at Land, when by long Use inured to Arms.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> are Hardy; despise Arts, and proudly boast
of their Extraction.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are Constant and Faithful to their Kings,
having continued the Crown in one Line for Twenty
Ages down to these Times. They know no other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal

                     <p>The <hi>Netherlands</hi> are Industrious, Men of Candour
and Sincerity, fit for Arts both of Peace and War, in

They love Religion and Liberty; know not how to cheat
others, nor will they suffer themselves to be cheated.
Their kind Natures are like melted Metals, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                     <p>The <hi>Asiaticks</hi> are Slaves to their Sovereigns, to
their Vices also, and Superstitions. That vast Empire
was at first raised and is still supported more by our

                     <p>The <hi>Moscovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> are naturally Servile;

                     <p>But these General Observations comprehend not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exception every Individual: For there are found
some Grateful and Loyal Persons in the most Ungrateful
and Perfidious Nation, inasmuch as Alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
passing from one Nation to another, Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Inter-Marriages, War, Peace, and those very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spheres which from the Poles and from the
Zodiack of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> derive on Things here
below Celestial Influences, change Customs and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
nay, even Nature it self. For if we consult Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
we shall find the <hi>Germans</hi> were noted for their
Bravery; the <hi>Italians,</hi> on the contrary, branded with
Cowardice: a Difference not visible now. Nations have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56556:319"/>
been uppermost by turns; and while Monarchy lasted
in them, Vertues, Arts and Arms flourished, which have
been afterwards, with the Empires Ruine, buried in its
Ashes, and with it revived again in another Place.
Nevertheless, all Nations have some peculiar Inclinations
and Passions, which insensibly stick to Foreigners, if they
make any considerable Stay amongst them.</p>
                     <p>The Customs then of Nations being known, the Prince
will be able far better to manage Affairs whether of Peace
or War, and know how to rule Foreign Countries, every
one of which enclines to a particular Manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

not all an Uniform Reason of State, no more than one
Medicine is a Cure for all their Diseases. And herein
Unexperienc'd Counsellors are generally out, who think
others can be govern'd by the Maxims and Principles of
their own States. The Bit which is easie to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
is not so to the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Netherlander:</hi> And as the
ways of Dressing, Managing and Breaking the Horses of
<hi>Spain, Naples</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> are different, though they
are all of one Species; so Nations also should be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
govern'd according to their Natures, Customs
and Habits.</p>
                     <p>From this variety of Peoples Conditions, we may
gather, how careful the Prince ought to be in sending
Embassadors, to see that they be not only endued with
all the Qualifications necessary for the Representation of
his Person, and Exercise of his Power; but withal,
that their Natures, Wit and Manners, agree with those
of the Nation they are to treat with: For if this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
be wanting, they will be fitter to kindle War,
than to make Peace; to excite Hatred, than procure
Love. Hence God himself was, as it were, in Suspence,
and Dubious in the Choice of a Minister to send to his
People, and therefore deliberates thus with himself;
<hi>Whom shall I send, and who will go for us</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56556:319"/>
Court requires a Minister suitable to its Nature. In
that of <hi>Rome,</hi> Men of Thought are approved, who are
perfectly versed in the Art of Dissimulation, so as not to
betray any Passion, either in their Speech or Looks:
such as appear Sincere, and are Subtile and Prudent;
who know how to Oblige all Men, and be Obliged to
none; are Civil in Negotiations, Easie in Treaties, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in Counsels, Constant in Resolutions, Friends to
all, Intimate with none.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor's Court requires a Man who maintains
his Authority without Pride, who Speaks with Sincerity,
Proposes with Modesty, Answers with Truth, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
with Patience; who anticipates not Accidents,
but makes use of them when they happen; who, in a
word, is Cautious in Promising, Exact in performing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> Court likes Men of Facetious, Pleasant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
that can mix Seriousness with Gaiety; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
despise, nor very much regard Promises; who
change with the Times, though more according to the
present than future.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the Grave and Reserved are commended,
such as are slow both in Negotiations and Dispatches.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> are valued Men of Eloquence, of a Ready
lavention, Ingenuous in Reasoning and Proposing, and
Quick-sighted into others Designs.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Genoa,</hi> Persons of Frugality, loving rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
than breed Dissention; who keep up their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
without State, are Patient, and Time-Servers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Suissers</hi> require such as can, upon occasion, lay
aside Publick Grandeur, and be Familiar in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as have learn'd to ingratiate themselves by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and Hopes, to have Patience, and watch their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities;
for they have to do with a Subtile and
Jealous People, differing from each other in Religion,
Factions, and Methods of Government, but are unanimous
in their Resolutions and Decrees, and in their Counsels
avoid Extremes, which each Canton afterwards executes
according to its own Method.</p>

Now, as these Qualities are proper for every Court
before-mention'd; so are Complaisance, Civility, and
Splendour, of universal use in all, if accompany'd with
a good Mien and Carriage, with some Learning and
Knowledge of Languages, particularly the Latine; for
these affect every body, procure the Applause and Esteem
of Foreigners, and Credit to one's own Country.</p>
                     <p>As Nations differ in Manners, so do they also in
Strength. That of the <hi>Church,</hi> consists in the Respect
and Obedience of Christian Believers; that of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
in Reputation of Grandeur; of <hi>Spain,</hi> in its Infantry;
<hi>France,</hi> in the Nobility; of <hi>England,</hi> in the Sea; of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> in their Number; that of <hi>Poland,</hi> in its Cavalry;
that of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in their Prudence; of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi>
in their Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Almost all Nations differ from each other in Arms
both Offensive and Defensive, which are adapted to the
Genius and Disposition of each Country; wherein it is
principally to be considered which are the most common
and general, and whether those of our own Country
are inferior to others, that the most advantageous may
be made use of; for Excellency in one kind of Weapons,
or the Novelty of the late-invented ones, often give or
take away Empires. The <hi>Parthians</hi> enlarged theirs by
the use of Darts: The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Northerns</hi> opened a
way to theirs by that of the armed Lance, forc'd on by
the Swiftness of their Cavalry: The Art of Fencing,
which the <hi>Romans</hi> practis'd in their Publick Sword-Plays,
(wherein Judgment has great effect) made them Masters
of the Universe: And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have conquer'd a
New World, and establish'd a Monarchy in <hi>Europe,</hi>
by the Invention of several sorts of Fire-Arms; for
these, above all, require Courage and Resolution, which
are the particular Vertues of that Nation. To this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Fire the very Earth has opposed it self, (so that
now all the Four Elements conspire the Destruction of
Mankind;) and by introducing the Pick-ax and Shovel,
the Industry of the <hi>Dutch</hi> has made such advances, as to
be able to resist the Valour of <hi>Spain.</hi>

The greatest Politicians often mistake the Balance of
Governments; particularly some of the <hi>Italians,</hi> who
vainly strive to keep them always in <hi>Aequilibrio;</hi> for that
Government is not the most Dangerous or Potent, whose
Dominions are of the Largest Extent, or Subjects most
Numerous, but which knows best how to use its Strength.
If you put the Forces in a pair of Scales, and one fall
down, the other hang in the Air; yet, upon adding to
this but one drachm of Prudence and Valour, or else if
the quantity of Ambition and Tyranny exceed in that,
the former shall poise, if not out-weigh the latter. They
who have raised their Fortune in this World, and ruled
it, have all had but slender Beginnings. The Grandeur
of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> inflamed the Envy of many, and
all conspired to bring it down, while not one so much
as thought of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which had undoubtedly enslaved
<hi>Germany,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Italy</hi> too, had not the King's
Death prevented it. Powers that begin to grow, are
more to be feared than those that are already grown;
for in these their Declension is Natural, as in those their
Encrease. The one strive to preserve themselves by the
Publick Quiet, the other to advance themselves by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
Foreign Dominions. Suppose one Power be in
it self stronger than another, this has not therefore less
Valour than that, to defend and protect it self. One
Planet has more Force and Vigour in its own House, than
another in its Elevation. Nor are these Fears of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Power always well grounded; on the other side,
they often turn to its Advantage. <hi>Italy</hi> was under Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Slavery from the West, when it saw the
Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> united to the Crown of <hi>Castile;</hi> which
were not a little augmented when <hi>Naples</hi> was added,
and both at once paid Obedience to <hi>Castile:</hi> But when
the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. annexed the State of <hi>Milan</hi> to
the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> it seemed absolutely to Despair;
yet for all this, the Princes lost not their Liberty; on
the contrary, have been effectually preserv'd against the
<hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Transalpine</hi> Arms, and enjoy'd a whole Age
of Peace. The Fort <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> built by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:56556:321"/>
was a great Eye-sore to many, who look'd on it as a
Bridle to <hi>Italy,</hi> yet Experience has shew'd its only Design
was their Defence. But all these Examples are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to cure the Pannick Fears of that <hi>Hypochondria</hi>
of State-Interest, as they call it, especially complicated
with the ill Humours of Envy and Emulation, so as to
make it shake off those Melancholy Whimsies. His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Majesty lays Siege to <hi>Casal,</hi> to dispossess the
<hi>French</hi> of it, and put it into the Hands of the right
Owner, to promote the Peace of <hi>Italy:</hi> And what do
the Envious, but immediately enter into a new League
to oppose him? As if one City, more or less, were
of any moment to so vast a Dominion. From this false
Apprehension of future Evils and Dangers, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would never have really come to pass, proceed
other present ones, much greater, by the Anticipation
of their Remedies. Let such Persons then as are thus
solicitous to poise the Balance of Governments, lay aside
their Emulations; for it cannot be effected without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the Publick Repose. Who can so keep the
Globe of the World in this Equinox of Power, that some
shall not come nearer the Solstices of Grandeur than
others; Nations would be in perpetual War; nothing
giving more Disturbance to them, than to be once pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with such empty Chimera's which never have an
end, especially since the Union of inferiour Powers against
a Greater cannot be of long continuance: And should they
pull this down, who will they find to share the Grandeur
among them, so that each shall be satisfy'd, and not every
one desire the Whole? Who shall keep them so even, that
one shall not encrease faster than another? Since Man's
Body is preserved by the inequality of its Members, why
should not States, as well by the Greatness of one and
Mediocrity of another Commonwealth? It is the securer
Policy to follow the most Powerful, and conform to
their Fortune, than to oppose them. Opposition awaken<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

To remedy which Abuses, and once more introduce the

in the Assembly of the States of <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the Year 1534:
<hi>The Natives of these Kingdoms</hi>(said he)<hi>have ever been
esteemed and honoured both at Home and Abroad, for their
Skill in Chivalry; and it is by this alone they have obtained
so many glorious Victories over their Enemies, as well Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as Infidels, conquered so many Kingdoms and Dominions
as at this day depend on our Crown.</hi> The Scripture says,

by the Emperor <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> came with great Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to swear Homage to him, and, as he was exhorted
by his Attendance, to deck himself as became his Majesty:
he replied; <hi>Arm, and March in Rank and File, and shew
these men, that you place your Bravery and Gallantry, not
in Fine Cloaths, but in your Arms, for they best become both
me and you.</hi> That Majesty begets Princes most Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which proceeds from Power. The People chuse
them for their Defence; which was intimated by the
<hi>Navarrois,</hi> when, in their Coronations, they seated the
Kings on a Shield: This was their Throne, and Heaven
their Canopy. The Prince should be a Buckler to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
armed against all Assaults, and exposed to Dangers
and Injuries. He will never appear more beautiful either
to them or Foreigners, than when in Armour. The first
Ornaments and Marks of Honour the ancient <hi>Germans</hi>
gave their Youth, was a Sword and Buckler: Till then
they were part of their Family, but afterwards became
Members of their Government<note n="8" place="bottom">Scuto Frameaque juvenes <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

looks like himself, but when in Arms. There's no
Equipage more splendid than a Troop of Curiassiers;
no Train more pleasing to the Eye than that of Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
whose Sight is then most agreeable, when they
are Martially equipt with all things necessary for an
Attack, and want Nothing either for their Defence or

what is necessary for them. Splendid Furniture is but

Shoulders Thirty Days Provision, and Seven Stakes for
Intrenchments. Such was then the Equipage of that
Warlike Nation, so inured to Hardships, that they took
the City to be built for the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and People,
the Temples for the Gods, but thought their Glory was
in the Fields, under Tents and Pavilions<note n="10" place="bottom">Vrbem Senatui, &amp; Populo Romano, Templa Diis reddita, propri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

more solicitous to preserve what he has, than even
to get the Victory. He that goes to fight, with a Spirit
of Covetousness, is desirous to conquer his Enemy, only
that he may afterwards rifle him. Interest and Glory
are powerful Incentives to Man's Breast. How would
<hi>Hannibal</hi> have laugh'd to have seen the Soldiers of these

that there are scarce Horses and Carriages enough

I dare affirm, no Soldiers can be good, unless their
Commanders be something enclin'd to Prodigality and
Severity. And 'tis probably on this account the <hi>Germans</hi>
call a Regiment, and all that belongs to it, <hi>the Colonel's
Staff, (den Regiment oder Colonelstah,</hi>) for with that Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
are to be ruled. <hi>Moses</hi> kept his in such strict
Discipline, that suing once for Passage through the King
of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Country, he withal engaged, that none of them
should drink of the Water of his Wells, or pass through
any one's Fields or Vineyards<note n="21" place="bottom">We will not pass through the fields nor through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 19.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Antiquity has left us an illustrious Example of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of decayed Military Discipline in the Person
of <hi>Metellus,</hi> when he was in <hi>Africa,</hi> where he found the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army so corrupted, that the Soldiers would not
stir out of their Quarters, deserted their Colours, and
dispersing themselves over the Province, Ravag'd and
Plunder'd where-ever they came, being guilty of all the
Extravagancies that Avarice and Luxury are capable of
inspiring. Yet all these he insensibly remedied, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
them in Military Arts. He first order'd, that
no Bread, or any other Meat dress'd, should be sold in
the Camp; forbad the Sutlers to follow the Army;
suffer'd not any Common Soldier, upon a March, to

Abuses, he restor'd them to their former Courage and
Strength. The effect of which Care was so great, as of
it self to terrifie <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> and oblig'd him, by Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
to beg his Life, and the Lives of his Children of
him, and to promise the Delivery of all besides to the
<hi>Romans.</hi> Arms are Vital Spirits, which cherish and
give motion to the Body of a Government; the Surety
of Publick Tranquility, wherein the Preservation and
Encrease of the same consists, provided they be well
ordered, and admit of Discipline. This the Emperor
<hi>Alexander Severus</hi> well knew, when he said, <hi>Ancient Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
was the Support of the Commonwealth, the Fall of which
would be the Ruine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Name and Empire</hi>

                     <p>Since then it is of so great Importance to have good
Soldiers, it is the Duty of Princes to conferr Favours
and Honours upon them. <hi>Saul</hi> loved a brave Soldier
so well, that he would not suffer him out of his sight.
Reward and Honour find, and Exercise makes them:
For Nature produces few Valiant Men; but Industry,

                        </note>. This ought
to be the care of the Captains, Colonels, and Generals,
as it was of <hi>Sopher</hi> the Chief of the Host, who exercised
his Fresh-water Soldiers<note n="24" place="bottom">And the principal scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land, <hi>&amp;c. 2 King.</hi> 25. 9.</note>. And thus the Holy

                     <p>But because this, through the excessive Indulgence and
Carelesness of Officers, and upon account of other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
in War, is not easily reduc'd to Practice, the
Evil of it ought rather to be timely prevented; a Thing
which Princes and Commonwealths are strangely negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in. Upon the Study of Literature are founded Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56556:326"/>
for Religion, Convents and Monasteries. The
Church Militant has its Nurseries for the Edification of
Spiritual Soldiers to defend it; for Temporal ones there
is none. The <hi>Turk</hi> alone regards this, who, to that end,
gathers Children of all Nations into certain Seraglio's,
and sees them brought up in the Exercise of Arms;
whence afterwards is formed the Body of his Janizaries,
who knowing no other Father or Lord but the Grand
Signior, are the chiefest Strength and Defence of his
Empire. Christian Princes ought to do the same in all
great Cities, by taking Orphans, Foundlings, and all
other of that nature, into Seminaries for that purpose,
there to be instructed in Military Exercises, taught to
forge Arms, twist Ropes, make Gun-powder, and all
other Ammunition, to prepare them for War-Service.
There might also be some educated in Sea-Port Towns,
where they might have an early insight into Navigation,
and see the manner of Building Ships, of making Sails
and Cables, which would be a means to cleanse the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
from those Dregs of Vagabonds, and furnish
it with Persons that would be useful in Military Arts,
which might be kept out of what they daily earn; or, if
that would not suffice, a Law might be made to assign
such Seminaries the Third of all Pious Gifts or Legacies:
For assuredly they deserve no less who defend the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
than those that offer Incense at them.</p>
                     <p>It would be also a very good way, for the Subsistence
of an Army, to endow the Treasury of War with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
stated Revenues, to be employed to no other uses:
As <hi>Augustus</hi> did, who setled the Tenth of all Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

sold upon it. Which Tax <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not

The Wars of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> put an end to the Intestine
Commotions in <hi>Spain.</hi> That Theater of War, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that School of <hi>Mars,</hi> where so many Military Arts
have been taught and exercised, has been very much to
the Advantage of this Monarchy: Though, 'tis true,
this Military Exercise and Discipline has been common
to its Enemies and Rivals, almost all the Princes of
<hi>Europe</hi> having learn'd the Use of Arms there, although
it is a prodigious Charge to make War in Countries so
disturb'd and remote, with so much Bloodshed and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,
so much Advantage on the Enemies side, and
so little on ours, that it may reasonably be question'd
whether it were better to conquer or be conquered; or
if it would not be more expedient to apply some Remedy,
whereby to quench, or at least damp, for a time, that
ardent Thirst after Blood and Riches; to the end, that
what is thrown away there, might be laid out upon a
a Fleet, for the Establishment of the Empire of the Ocean
and Mediterranean, and the carrying on a War in <hi>Africa,</hi>
the successful Progress of which, by reason of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56556:329"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> would the more unite this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
However, Love of those so Ancient and Loyal
Subjects, join'd with a Desire to see them redeemed from
that vile Slavery, they are, under the Notion of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
miserably oppress'd with, and to reduce them to
the true Worship of God, have more Influence on us,
than State-Interest.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Encouragement of Valour and Military
Glory in a Monarchy, is the Security thereof; so is it
not without Danger, when the Supreme Power is lodg'd
in many, as in Commonwealths; their greatest Hazard
being in their own Arms, while they intrust the Power
of the Army to one; that very Hand which they first
arm'd usually laying the Yoke on them; those Forces
themselves gave, oppressing their Liberty. Thus it was
with the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick, and from thence Tyranny
pass'd to almost all other Nations. However requisite
therefore it be to keep Armies always ready, and in
Exercise; yet the Arts of Peace are still more secure,
especially if the People be corrupted, and separated in
distant Places: For the Fierceness of War does but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them more Insolent; and it is better to keep them
in view of Danger, than secure from it, if you expect
they should unite for their Conservation. The Liberty
of the Republick of <hi>Genoua</hi> was not less safe, when its
Mountains were not regularly fortified, than now that
through singular Industry and Labour they are made as
Impregnable Walls to the State. For too much Security
breeds ill Humours, divides the People into Factions,
begets Presumptuous Spirits, and despises External
Means. In a word, In Commonwealths harrass'd with
Intestine Broils, Wars are more dangerous than useful;
and consequently then only will be of advantage to
<hi>Genoua,</hi> when that prudent Senate shall act as if they had
never built them.</p>

                     <p>IT has been the Opinion of some, That Nature was
rather a Step-Mother to Man, than his own; and
that she had shewed her self more liberal to other
Creatures, in giving them a clearer Instinct and Notice
of the Means necessary for their Defence and Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But these Persons did not sufficiently consider
their own Excellency, their Power and Dominion over
Sublunary Things; Nature having bestowed on them a
swift Understanding, in a Moment penetrating both the
Earth and Heavens: a Memory, wherein, without the
least confusion or disorder, are reposited the Idea's of
Things so various: a Reason, which Distinguisheth,
Collects, and Concludes: a Judgment, that Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,

Weighs, and Determines; Gifts whereby Man
is intitled to the Sovereignty of all Created Beings, and
a Liberty to dispose of them according to his Pleasure,
having Hands framed with such Skill and Wisdom, that
they are Tools fit for all Arts; so that although he
comes into the World naked and without Arms, yet he
forges them according to his Fancy, either to defend
himself, or assault others. The Earth, to that end,
furnishes him with Iron and Steel; the Water (as you
see in this Device) turns the Mill that strikes them:
Thus all the Elements obey his Will. With any slight
Plank (Boat) he tames the Sea's Pride, and gathers
the Winds into a small piece of Canvas, to make them
serve him for Wings to fly from one Place to another;
confines all the Fire's Violence within Brazen Pipes,

Influence. Nor does Princes being remote one

with, and are united to each other by the
means of Roots, their Activity being a very large
Extent; so they, by their Embassadors, and secret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,

Obedience: He made himself more Formidable by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

If he had a Place to stand on, he could, with his Machines,

might easily attain to an Universal Empire, if to its

dangerous as Rashness without Power. Abundance of
Wars between Christian Princes might be avoided by
Industry; but either Judgment is insensible of their
Inconveniencies, and cannot find a way to decline them
Honourably, or it does not regard them, Ambition
blinding Prudence; or else Vanity and Haughtiness look
on it as a piece of Bravery, voluntarily to face them;
and thus are tickled with a Counterfeit-Glory of War,
which, as it is a Publick Action, whereon the Common
Preservation of all depends, ought not to be measured
by thin Shadows of Honour, but by the Publick Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and Utility; yet so, that the Prince must in the
mean time leave no Stone unturn'd to shun War, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off all Occasions, before they happen, or if they be
already, getting the Hearts of such as by their Counsel
can promote Peace. Let him find out all endearing ways
imaginable to preserve Friendship: Let him embrace his
Enemy both within and without his Realms; and by cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Designs, and entring into Leagues and Alliances
Defensive, terrifie him. And to these Humane Means
let him join the Divine Assistances of Prayer and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and apply himself to the Pope, as the Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Christendom, ingenuously telling him his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Desire of the Publick Quiet, of the Injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or the Reasons that induce him to take up Arms,

if Satisfaction be not made him. Whence the Matter being

of the Apostolick See interposed, either the War will
be avoided, or the Prince justifie the Cause of it at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where is the Tribunal at which all Princes Actions ought
to be judged, and their Controversies decided. Nor is
this a Mean-spiritedness, but rather a Christian Generosity,

why he thus went from one Extreme to the other, when

Thus <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of <hi>France,</hi> laid not aside his Enmity
to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. notwithstanding he set him
at liberty, because his Captivity was not so generous as
that of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who being taken in a
Battel by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Leon,</hi> was treated by him
with all the Humanity imaginable, his Wounds dress'd
carefully, and himself set at liberty after his Recovery;
Favours which wrought upon him to lay his whole
Kingdom at the Conqueror's Feet: But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the Offer, satisfied with the Restitution of such
Places as had been lately taken in <hi>Galicia.</hi> The same
Consideration had <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> when having

                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:56556:333"/>
(the first of which was <hi>Alphonsus</hi> V.) he call'd a Council,
to deliberate what should be done with them; and while
some were for having them pay a Ransom, others for
binding them to certain Conditions, and lasty, others
for freely Dismissing them without either, he took this
last Advice, thereby to lay the greater Obligation upon
them, and so engage their Friendship.</p>
                     <p>When Kingdoms are embroil'd in Civil Wars, there's
nothing more dangerous than standing Neuter, as
<hi>Henry the Infant</hi> endeavoured to do, during the Troubles

by which means he lost his Friends, without obliging

it seems most adviseable, either wholly to connive

In Affairs of War, Fear would sometimes appear
prudent; and to that end, suggests Moderate Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
which serve but to encourage the Enemy, and
give him Time to look about him. As King <hi>Iohn</hi> I.
found, who pretending the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> was

resolved to enter that Kingdom alone, and to
have his Army follow: whence the <hi>Portuguese</hi> gained
Time to take up Arms in the <hi>interim;</hi> which had never
been done, had he immediately fell upon them; but he,
to avoid War, left his Right to the Decision of Justice.
Threats signifie little, if the Hand lifted up, have no
Weapon in it, and do not sometimes punish Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in earnest.</p>
                     <p>The Hastiness of the <hi>French,</hi> makes them regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the past nor present Time, and through the Heat
of their Minds they are too adventurous, and too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitous
in their Resolutions: However, this very thing
oftentimes gives Success to them; for by this means
they avoid Luke-warmness, and dispatch every thing in
a trice. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on the other side, are Dilatory,
that they may, by long and much Consideration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with more Caution; and out of an Affectation of

who are slow in Resolving, lazy in Executing, and
consult only the present Time, without any regard to
the past or future. Their Minds change with Events,
which is the reason they have so little advanced their
Fortune; it being otherwise a Nation, which, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its innate Courage, might extend its Dominions far
and near. To the same Cause may be ascribed the long
Continuance of the Civil Wars the Empire is harrass'd
with at this day; which undoubtedly, by resolute Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

Prudent, we have seen vast Armies, upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi>

more prejudice, than if they had lost several Battels:
For there can be no greater Overthrow, than for an
Army insensibly to waste and perish within it self. It is

Extremes, and because it is of great Importance ever

Power, is to wear out the Chain of Servitude: 'Tis a
kind of Tyranny, to go about to reduce Subjects to the
model of an absolute Perfect State, in that the Condition
of Humane Nature admits not of it. It is not necessary
for a Government to be such as it ought to be, but as
it is capable of being; for all things that are expedient,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56556:334"/>
are not possible to Humane Infirmity. It is an Absurdity,
to wish there may be no Defect at all in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
There will be Vices, as long as there be Men.
Excess of Zeal is the Spring of many Mistakes in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
in not knowing how to conform to Prudence.
The same is Ambition, when Princes affect to pass for
Severe, and imagining their Reputation consists in Ruling
their Subjects so, that they shall never in the least degree
swerve from Reason and the Laws. 'Tis a dangerous
Strictness, which consults not the ordinary Passions of
the Vulgar. Open Address prevails more than Power;
Example and Complacency, than Inhuman Severity. Let
the Prince therefore rather make believe he finds his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
good, than value himself upon making them so: which

                     <p>MAN's Mind has not been satisfy'd with the
Speculation of Terrestrial Things; but impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
that the Knowledge of the Heavens should
be deferred so long as till after Death, has broke the
Prison of the Body, and soar'd above the very Elements,
to find out, by Reasoning, what it could not by Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Sight, and Hearing: and to this end, hath form'd
in Imagination an Idea of that most Beautiful Fabrick,
contriving a Sphere with such various Circles, Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Epicycles, as aptly represent the several Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Planets and Constellations; and though he
be not positively assured whether the thing be really so,
he hath, however, acquired this Glory, that he can now

conceive how this World is, or at least how it might
have been created. Neither does the Mind stay here;
but restless and venturesom in its Researches, has ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
another quite different Hypothesis, and would
persuade others, that the Sun is the Center of those Orbs
which move round it, and have their Light from it.

not the Sun to bring them him, when yet this (as all

It is certain then, that this Prince of Light, who has in
Charge the Empire of all Things here below, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
and by his Presence informs them, by going,
without intermission, from one Tropick to the other,
with a Contrivance so wonderful, that all Parts of the
Earth receive from him, if not an equal Heat, at least,
an equal Light, whereby the Divine Wisdom has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Evil that would unavoidably ensue, if the
Sun should never leave the <hi>Aequator;</hi> for then its Rays
would utterly burn up some Countries, while others
would freeze, and be involved in perpetual Darkness.
This Natural Example teaches Princes how much it
advances the Publick Utility, for Them, like that
Swiftest of the Planets, continually to move about their
States, to warm the Affection of their Subjects, and give

the Condition of the War, whether the Prince, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting

either from within or abroad; if he shall not
hazard his Succession; whether he have Courage enough,
and be capable of Arms, and have an Inclination to
them: For if he want but any one of these Qualities, he
will do more by putting his Power and Forces into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hand; as we see in the Loadstone, which by
touching the Iron, and communicating its Virtue to it,
lifts up a greater Weight than it could do by it self.
But if the Necessity be great, it will suffice, if the Prince
be hard by, to Influence his Army, staying in some
Place, whence he may readily Consult, Resolve, and

though this Undertaking was look'd on by all Men as
rash, nay, impossible, yet the Town surrender'd. Bold
Counsels are commonly judged by the Event; if they
succeed, they are commended for Prudent<note n="2" place="bottom">Fortuna in sapient<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Persons blamed who gave safer Advice. No Judgment
can either in Precipitation, or when it acts calmly, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
provide for it self, in that Affairs depend upon
Contingencies, which are uncertain even to the most
wary Foresight. Sometimes Rashness comes before Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and Moderation follows it; sometimes this slides
swiftly between them, nor has it any Hair behind to be
held by.</p>
                     <p>All things depend on that Eternal Providence, which
efficaciously moves us to act, when the Disposition of it,
and the Accomplishing of its Divine Decrees so require;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56556:339"/>
and then Fool-hardy Counsels are Prudence, and Errors
the highest Reason. When Providence would pull down
the Pride of a Monarchy, lest, like the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi>
it should attempt to reach Heaven, it confounds the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and Languages of its Ministers, that they may
disagree; so that if one asks for Lime, another either
does not understand what he means, or else offers him
Sand. In the Untimely Death of those who are invested
with Supreme Government, its end is not to cut their
Thread of Life, but to throw down that Grandeur.
The Holy Spirit, mentioning <hi>David</hi>'s Victory over
<hi>Goliah,</hi> says not that his Body, but that his <hi>Boasting</hi> was
beat down with the Stone<note n="3" place="bottom">When he lift up his hand with the stone in his sling, and beat down the boasting Goliah <hi>Eccles.</hi> 47. 4.</note>. So if, on the other side,
it has decreed to Exalt a Monarchy, it creates in that
Age brave Commanders, and wise Councellors, or causes
them to be made choice of, and gives them occasion of
exerting their Valour, and giving Proof of their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by which two more is done than by the Arm and
Sword<note n="4" place="bottom">Pleraque in summa <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Weapons grow, as that Hunting Spear of <hi>Romulus</hi> did,
upon Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> and erected at a Wild Boar. The
very missing of the Blow of this Founder of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Monarchy was fortunate, being a kind of Prognostick of
it. Which shews, that it is not always Courage or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that raises and supports Monarchies, (though they
are generally the Instruments) but that Superior Impulse
which moves all Causes together, for their Encrease or
Preservation; and then even Chance, directed by that
Eternal Mind, effects what Prudence could not so much
as have imagined before. When <hi>Germany</hi> Revolted, and
the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs were extremely desperate, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

there be a finer Soldier than <hi>D'Aubigny?</hi> Yet he was

who was Destined to Establish the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy in

                        <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) its Beginnings and Causes, by the
means chiefly of <hi>Ferdinand the Catholick,</hi> who, by his
Prudence and Skill in Government, laid the Foundations
of that Monarchy, and by his Valour erected and enlarg'd
it; being so careful and vigilant to encrease it, that he
neglected no Occasion which offer'd it self; nay, of
himself, found all that Humane Judgment is capable of:
Lastly, so strenuous in the prosecution of them, that he
was always the first in Danger and Fatigue; and as Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is abundantly more easie to Mankind than Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
he made it his business to Command more by
his Actions than Orders. But because so great a Fabrick
required Workmen, that Age (fertile in Great Persons)
produced <hi>Columbus, Herman Cortez,</hi> the two Brothers
<hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand Pizarro, Antony de Liba, Fabritius,</hi>
and <hi>Prosper Colonna, Raimond de Cardona,</hi> the Marquesses
of <hi>Pescara</hi> and <hi>Basto,</hi> and many other Hero's so illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that a whole Age now scarce brings forth one such.
To that end, God then prolonged their Lives; whereas
now, not <hi>Mars</hi>'s Fury, but some lingring Fever, carries
them off before their time. Within how few Years has
untimely Death depriv'd us of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Toledo, Lewis Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jardo,

Persons no less considerable for the glorious Actions

of the Universe that disposes these interchangeable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations

One Age raises up great Men in a Country, improves
Arts, and makes Arms flourish; and the succeeding
immediately overturns and confounds all, without leaving
so much as the Traces of the Vertue and Valour which
were an Ornament to those of the past. What great,
what secret Force on Things, nay, even on Minds, is
conceal'd in those Second Causes of the Heavenly Spheres?
It is not by meer Accident that those Superior Lights
are so different one from another, some having a Fix'd
Place, others Wandring; and since this Disorder and
Irregularity gives no additional Beauty, it is a sign at
least they contribute to Operations and Effects. O vast
Volume! in the Leaves of which, God, the Contriver
and Maker of all Things (yet without laying any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

                        </note> Man's Will) has
wrote their Changes and Vicissitudes in Characters of
Light, for the Glory of his Eternal Wisdom, which
past Ages have, the present do, and those to come will
for ever read! <hi>Greece</hi> was heretofore flourishing both
in Arms and Arts; it left <hi>Rome</hi> enough to learn, but
little to invent; but now it lies buried in the Depth of
Ignorance and Degeneracy. The Wits in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s
time exceeded even Expectation, but under <hi>Nero</hi> they
began to flag, so that all the Pains and Industry in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56556:341"/>
World was not sufficient to save the Arts and Sciences
from Destruction. Unhappy are those great Genius's
who come into the World when Monarchies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
in that they either are not employed, or if they
be, cannot withstand the weight of their Ruine, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
miserably fall with them, without Honour or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown;
nay, sometimes their Fate seems deserved, and
they are blamed for what was the effect of Chance<note n="9" place="bottom">Cuj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

God lays no Constraint upon Free-Will; but yet either
the course of Causes draws it on, or, for want of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light, it stumbles of it self, and its Designs are
overthrown or executed too late. Princes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
are the Eyes of Kingdoms; and when God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
determines the overthrow of these, he blinds
them, that they may neither see Dangers, nor know
their Remedies<note n="10" place="bottom">For the Lord hath poured forth upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets, and the rulers, and the seers hath he covered. <hi>Isai</hi> 29. 10.</note>. That which they think to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
most by, leads them most into Miscarriages: They
see Accidents, but do not prevent, but rather, as much
as in them lies, forward them. A Dangerous Instance
of this Truth we have in the <hi>Swiss-Cantons,</hi> ever so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and stout in defending their Country and Liberty,
but now so negligent and supine, that themselves are
the Cause of the Ruine that threatens them. The First
Author of Monarchies had situated their Republick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Outworks of the <hi>Alpes</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
environ'd it with the Countries of <hi>Alsace, Lorrain,</hi> and
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> against the Power of <hi>France,</hi> and other Princes;
and when they were farthest from the Fire of War, in
the Fruition of a happy and desired Peace, they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
called and encouraged One upon their own Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
standing by and seeing the Ruine of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
redounding afterwards to their own Prejudice,
they not considering the Danger of a neighbouring Power,
superiour in Strength, and whose Fortune must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
be raised out of their Ashes. May I be deceived,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56556:341"/>
but I fear this Body of the <hi>Switzers</hi> is already at its full
growth, and that it will begin to decay, when those

Enemy, and open an happy Way to his Military Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
it will be great Prudence to allow them Time
to disperse sensibly of themselves, not that they lay
any necessity upon the Freedom of the Will, but because
this Freedom has power only over the Motions of the
Mind and Body, not over those External Things: It
may indeed give way to Accidents, but cannot avoid
being overwhelmed by them. Constancy in Expecting,
is infinitely more valuable than Valour in Fighting.

All those Efforts of several Causes concurring, are very
brittle, in that they hinder each other; and are subject
not only to various Accidents, but to Time also, which
by degrees brings their Effects to Nothing. Many Wars,

He who can but a little while bear up against the Forces
of Confederate Enemies, certainly gets the better of
them at last: For as they are many, they have different
Causes, different Interests and Designs; and if they
happen to disagree in any one thing, part and leave one
another. There was never a greater League than that
of <hi>Cambray</hi> against the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> yet the
Resolution and Prudence of this Valiant Senate soon
broke it. All things in the World arrive to a certain
Period; after which, they decline again. Were that
Critical Minute known, it would be easie to overcome
them<note n="5" place="bottom">Opportunos magnis conatibus transitus rerum. <hi>Tacit. Hist. l.</hi> 1.</note>. 'Tis for want of this Knowledge, which
sometimes consists in the least Delay imaginable, that
we sink under Accidents. Our Impatience or Ignorance
aggravates them, in that often, not sensible of their
Force, we voluntarily submit to them, or else perhaps
promote them by the violence of those very Means we
take to shun them. God had undertaken the Grandeur
of <hi>Cosmo de Medicis;</hi> and they who strove to put a stop
to it, by Banishing him from the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi>
were the Instruments of making him Master of it.
<hi>Nicholas Vzanus</hi> observ'd, with much greater Prudence,
the Torrent of that Fortune; and lest it should encrease
by Opposition, thought it most advisable (as long as he
lived) to give him no Occasion of Displeasure; but
with his Death the Consideration of such discreet Counsel
fell. Nor is it possible for the greater Force of such
like Cases to be concealed; forasmuch as all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
to their Success, though they appear, at first sight,
directly contrary to that end. And therefore it is then
best to Endure what you cannot Mend; and quietly to
conform to God, by whose Appointment all Things

comes to less Harm who lets himself be carried down
by the Stream, than he that struggles against it. It is
a foolish Presumption, to think to overthrow the Decrees
of the Almighty. The Predictions of the Statue with
Feet of Clay, in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream, was never
the less certain, for his making another of Gold, and
commanding it to be worshipped<note n="7" place="bottom">Dan. 3. 1.</note>. However, this
Resignation of our Will to the Divine must not be so
Brutish, as that we should believe all Things were so
Ordain'd from Eternity, that nothing can be Improv'd
by our Diligence and Conduct; for this would be the
very Weakness of Mind which had given occasion to
that Divine Decree: We are to Act as if all depended
on our Will, for God makes use of our Selves to bring
us to Happiness or Misery<note n="8" place="bottom">Eccles. 10. 5.</note>. We make a part of the
Creation, and that no small one; and though Things
were set in order without us, yet they were not made
without us. 'Tis true, we cannot break that Web of
Events wrought on the Loom of Eternity, but we might
very well concurr to the weaving of it. The same that
ranged the Causes foresaw their Effects, and permitted
their Course, yet so that it should be still at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
He has saved from Danger whom he thought
fit; and left others in it, by abandoning them to their
liberty: If the first was an Effect of his Mercy, or our
Merit, this is of his Justice. Our Will involved in
the Ruine of Accidents, falls with them; and as this
most Wise Contriver of the Universe is the Supreme
and Absolute Arbitrator, he might break his Vessels as
he pleased, and make one to Honour, another to
Dishonour<note n="9" place="bottom">Rom. 9. 21.</note>. In the Eternal Disposal of Empires,
their Progresses, Revolutions, or Ruines; that Sovereign
Governor of the Orbs had always present in his Mind
our Valour and Vertue, our Negligence, Impudence,
and Tyranny: And upon this Prescience it was, that he
disposed the Eternal Order of Things, in conformity to
the Motion and Execution of our Choice, without the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56556:344"/>
least Violence done to the same. For as he lays no
Constraint upon our Free Will, who discovers its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
by Reasoning; so neither does the Supreme
Being, who by his Immense Wisdom foresaw them long
ago. He forced not our Will in the Alterations of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires;
but rather altered Empires, because our Wills
freely and deliberately deviated from Justice. The
Cruelty exercised by King <hi>Peter</hi> was the cause of his
Brother <hi>Henry</hi>'s succeeding him; not, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
this the Occasion of that. For the Mind has more
Power than any Fortune, turns its Affairs which way
it pleases, and is the sole Cause of a Happy or Miserable
Life<note n="10" place="bottom">Valentior enim omni fortuna animus est, in utramque partem res suas ducit. <hi>Sen. Epist.</hi> 98.</note>. To expect Fortune from Chance, is Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness;
to think it prescribed and already determined,
Desperation. At this rate, Vertue would be useless,
and Vice excusable by Compulsion. Let your Highness
but look upon your Glorious Ancestors, who have
raised the Greatness of this Monarchy, and I am assured
you will see, it was not Chance that Crowned them,
but Vertue, Courage, and Fatigues, and that it has been
supported by the same Means, by their Descendants, to
whom an equal Glory is due; he no less contributing to
the Fabrick of his Fortune who maintains it, than he that
at first raised it. 'Tis a thing equally difficult to get,
and easie to lose. One Hour's Imprudence ruines what
cost many Years to acquire. By Labour and Vigilance

                     <p>THE smallest things encrease by Concord; by
Discord the greatest fall to the ground. Those
which being divided, were weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;

What Arm can pull off a Horse's Main when the Hairs
are not parted, or break a Bundle of Arrows? And yet
either of these, of it self, is unable to withstand the least
Violence. By these Emblems, <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and <hi>Scilurus</hi>
the <hi>Scythian,</hi> express'd the Force of Concord, which of
many distinct Parts makes one united and consequently
strong Body. Care of the Publick Repose has raised the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56556:345"/>
Walls of Cities so much above the reach of Men, that
they might not scale them; but however, many Soldiers
at once closing their Shields, and mutually joining and
agreeing to lift one another up, have got above their
Battlements, and stormed them. All the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are preserved by Amity and Concord; and when this
fails, they decay and die: The cause of Death being no
other than a Discord of the Part, whereon Life depends.
The very same happens in Commonwealths; as common
Consent made them a Society, so a Dissention between
the greatest or most powerful part dissolves again and
dissociates, or else new models them. That City, which
by Concord was but one, without it becomes two, nay,
sometimes three or four, for want of that Body of Love
whereby its Inhabitants made one Body. This Division
engenders Hatred, whence Revenge arises, and from
that a disrespect of Laws; without the Authority of
which, Justice loses its force; and where that fails,
Arms are taken up; and a Civil War breaking out, the
Order of the State, which wholly consists in Unity, is
confounded<note n="2" place="bottom">Wisdom 18. 9.</note>. The Bees no sooner fall out, but their

notwithstanding these and other Reasons, some Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
assert, That it is necessary, for the Preservation
of a State, to sow Discords among the People; and to
this end, alledges, for an Example, the Bees, in whose
Hives is always heard a kind of Murmurring and Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But, alas, this is so far from strengthning, that it
rather overthrows their Opinion; for that <hi>Humming</hi> is
not a Dissonance, as I may say, of Wills, but a Harmony
of Voices, whereby these Creatures, as it were, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and stir up each other to the Labours of making
Honey, as Mariners do when they Hoise Sail. Nor is
the Argument drawn from the contrariety of the four
Humours in living Bodies, of any force; for 'tis rather
from this Conflict of theirs that proceed Diseases, and
Shortness of Life, that which is Prdominant at last
getting the Victory. Hence Vegetables, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that contrariety, endure longer. What differs from,
and is at variance with it self, must of necessity suffer;
and what suffers, can never be lasting. Who, when a
Republick is divided, can keep the Flame of Dissentions
within certain Bounds? Who will afterwards quench it,
when All are involved in them? The more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Faction will now oppress the Weaker; and that to
Defend, this to Revenge it self, make use of Foreign
Forces, and so enslave the Commonwealth, or else intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new Form of Government, which will almost
always be Tyrannical, as several Instances witness. It
is not the Prince's Duty to distract the Minds of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but rather to keep them loving and amicable; and
besides, 'tis impossible they should conspire to love and
obey him, who are divided amongst themselves, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not whence their Evil comes. As often therefore
as the Prince himself is the cause of Discord, Divine
Providence (as it abominably<note n="6" place="bottom">And a seventh doth my heart abhorr, he that soweth discord among brethren. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 14.</note> detests it) permits
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56556:346"/>
those very Means he thought to preserve himself by, to
be the Instruments of his Ruine: For when the Parties
come to know it, they despise and abhorr him, as the
first Author and Promoter of their Differences. King
<hi>Italus</hi> gained the Affection and Applause of the <hi>Germans,</hi>
by never fomenting Dissentions, and carrying himself
alike to all.</p>
                     <p>For these then, and such like Reasons, the Prince
should beware of letting Discords take root; and rather
strive to encourage the Union of his State, which will
easily be maintained, if he look carefully to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of the Laws, the Unity of Religion, Plenty of
Corn and Provision, to the equal Distribution of Favours
and Gratuities, to the Maintaining of Privileges; if he
take care that the Common People be employed in
Mechanick Arts, the Nobility in Publick Government,
Arms, and Literature, to prohibit Cabals, and Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
Meetings, to keep the Great Ones Frugal and
Modest, and the Inferiours Peaceable, to restrain Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged
Persons, and those who pretend to be exempt
from Duties; in a word, if he see that Riches be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a Mediocrity, and Poverty remedied. For
from the Reformation and Regulating these, results
good Government; and where that is, there Peace and
Concord ever flourish. There is but one Case wherein
it seems convenient and warrantable to kindle Discords
in Kingdoms, and that is, when they are already troubled
with Seditions, and Intestine Broils; for then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
them into Factions, will be a means to weaken the
Power of the Bad, the only end in that being to render
Peace to the Good. And it is a piece of Self-Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to let Disturbers be at quiet; inasmuch as the
Concord of Ill Men is to the Prejudice of the Good;
as 'tis to be wish'd that these may live Peaceably, so it is
that those may be in Discord: For Good Men always
come by the worst, when Bad Men are united<note n="7" place="bottom">Concordi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Discord we condemn as pernicious to Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
is that which arises from Hatred and Enmity;
not that Contention which has place between several
Conditions and Members of the same Commonwealth,
as between the Lords and Commons, the Soldiers and
Tradesmen: For that Contrariety, or rather Emulation,
by the very diversity of Natures and Ends, keeps up a
Distinction in the Degrees and Spheres of the State, and
supports it; nor are there Seditions, but when the States
combine together, and make every private Person's the
Common Interest: just as from the commixtion of the
Elements, and the meeting of Rivers and Streams, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Storms and Inundations. It concerns the Prince
therefore to employ all his Care upon this Division; so
moderating it, that it shall neither come on the one hand
to absolute Rupture, nor on the other to unlawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations.</p>
                     <p>The same thing should be done between Ministers,
that some kind of Emulation and Diffidence one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may make them more attentive of their Duty;
for if once, through a neglect of this, they Dissemble,
and conceal one another's Faults, or with one consent
join the pursuit of their own Interests, there will be an
end of the Prince and the State, without the possibility
of a Remedy, in that none can be apply'd but by their
Hands. But if this Honest and Generous Emulation
should degenerate into Aversion and Enmity, it will
create the same Inconveniencies; for they will then be
more intent on contradicting and thwarting one another,
more solicitous to overthrow each others Counsels and
Actions, than to promote the Publick Good, and their
Prince's Service. Every one has his Friends and
Creatures, and the Common sort of People are apt to be

Dissentions among the Kings of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and ordained,
that when Embassadors were to be sent afar off, such

Age of Publick Losses, occasion'd by the clashing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters

with many Bloody Instances of this Truth; that in
former Ages, this in all. The best Remedies are, by
the means of Emulation, to keep them divided from the
Commons and themselves, yet with the Moderation
above-mention'd. To multiply and level the Titles and
Dignities of the Nobles; to spend their Estates upon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ostentations, and their Great Souls in the Toils and
Dangers of War; to divert their Thoughts by Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Peace, and humble their Exalted Spirits by the
servile Offices of the Court.</p>

                     <p>KINGS, in Holy Scripture, are compared to
<hi>Rivers;</hi> for so the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> is to be
understood, when he says, God would cleave
the Rivers of the Earth<note n="1" place="bottom">Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. <hi>Haba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

divide the Forces of those who took up Arms against his
People: As <hi>David</hi> actually found he did, in his Defeat
of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> and therefore openly confessed, that
the Lord had divided his Enemies before him, as Waters
are divided<note n="2" place="bottom">The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 20.</note>. Division is the most effectual means
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56556:348"/>
to pull down any Power; the very greatest, if divided,
being uncapable of making any further Resistance. How
impetuously does a River stream down the midst of its
Channel, breaking through its very Banks to open it self
new Passages; yet if parted into several Rivulets, it
loses its strength, and becomes passable to all. Thus
it happened to the River <hi>Gyndes,</hi> where a beloved Horse
of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s having been drowned, it so enraged him, that
he immediately commanded it to be cut into an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty Canals; by which means it lost both its
Name and Greatness; and that which before would
scarce bear Bridges, might afterwards be easily forded.
This the Counsel had regard to, which some gave the
<hi>Roman</hi> Senate, to weaken the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> by turning the
Course of the Lakes and Brooks that discharged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into it<note n="3" place="bottom">Siamnis Nar (id enim parabatur) in Rivos diductus supernavigasset. <hi>Tac. Annal. l.</hi> 1.</note>, to rid the City of continual Fear and

shews of what consequence it is to distract the Forces of
Puissant Princes: For the greater the Power is, the
more Forces and Expence its Defence requires; nor is
it hardly possible to find Officers and Soldiers enough
for it, or to prevent all Mischances. Courage and
Prudence are confounded, when Dangers threaten thus
on all sides. Besides, this is the most secure and the
cheapest Method that can be taken; inasmuch as a
Trumpet on a sudden sounding an Alarm in several
Parts of a Kingdom, has abundantly greater Effects,
than a War solemnly denounced.</p>
                     <p>It is always the best and securest way, to divide Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Forces, and sow seeds of Dissention within their
States<note n="5" place="bottom">Prudentis est Ducis inter bostes discordi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> established their Dominion in <hi>Spain,</hi>
dividing it into various Factions. The same did the

having taken <hi>Boabdili,</hi> King of <hi>Grenada,</hi> he moved
<hi>Ferdinand the Catholick</hi> to set him at liberty, that his
Presence might foment the Factions a foot between him
and his Father, about the Crown, which had distracted
the Kingdom into a great many Parties. When the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, says <hi>Tacitus,</hi> began to decline, and
hasten to decay, nothing greater could be desired of
Fortune, than the Discord of its Enemies<note n="7" place="bottom">Vrgentibus Imperii Romani fatis, nihil jam praes<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Money is laid out to more Advantage, none with less
Bloodshed or Danger, than that which is employed in
encouraging the Dissentions of an Enemy's Kingdom, or
in getting another Prince to make War upon it; for the
Charges and Damage become hereby much more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
But this matter demandeth extraordinary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency;
for sometimes, upon a mis-grounded Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
Money is expended to no purpose, and the
Discovery of the ill Intention begets open Hostility:
A thing we have many Instances of, in those who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Provocation, or the least Prospect of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
have countenanced the Adversaries of the House
of <hi>Austria,</hi> to keep its Hands full, by continual Wars,
in the mean time unprofitably exhausting their Treasuries,
without considering, that if they should once be attack'd
by those of this House, it would be much better to have
still by them, for their own Defence, what they had
laid out upon the Diversion of their Forces.</p>
                     <p>And this whole Doctrine has place, without any
scruple in Policy, in an open War, where the Reason
of Self-Preservation is more cogent, than other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
less solid; and the same Cause that makes the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56556:349"/>
War lawful, justifies also this Discord. But when the
case is nothing but an invidious Emulation of Grandeur,
these Artifices are not warrantable; for he who stirs up
the Subjects of another Prince to Rebellion, at the same
time teaches his own to be Traitors. The Emulation
should be between the Persons, not the Offices: Dignity
is of the same kind in all its parts; that which wounds
one, wounds all. Passions and Hatreds are transient,
but Bad Examples remain for ever. It is the Interest
and Concern of every Prince, not to suffer the Dignity
of another to be injured by Contempt or Disobedience,
or his Person by Treason. 'Tis an Action unworthy of
a Prince to conquer by Poison, not by the Sword. It
was ever accounted base, among the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <note n="8" place="bottom">Non fraude neque occultis, sed palam, &amp; armatum populum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum bostes suos ulcisci. <hi>Tac. Hist. l.</hi> 2.</note>; and is
to this day with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have been so far from
making use of such secret Practices against their Enemies,
that they have often been assisting to them. A remarkable
Example of which, our Catholick King left your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when he sent an Army to aid the <hi>French</hi> King
against the <hi>English,</hi> who had possess'd themselves of the
Isle of <hi>Rhea,</hi> not regarding the Duke of <hi>Roan</hi>'s Advice,
which was, to divide the Kingdom into several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And another time, when His Majesty offered, by
Monsieur <hi>de Maximi,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, to assist the
same King in Person to subdue the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi>
and drive them out of his Country. Which
Signal and Heroick Kindness had no other Return but
Ingratitude; leaving a Lesson to Reason, not to let it
self be too easily touch'd with Compassion towards a
Foreign State.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been said, it is obvious to deduce
how much the Agreement of Subjects Minds, and the
Union of States, contribute to their Common Defence:
If, I say, every particular Person did look on the
Danger of his Neighbour as his own, be it at never so
remote a distance, and accordingly endeavour all ways,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56556:349"/>
both with Men and Money, to relieve him, that the
whole Body may be preserved. But not a few are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in this Point; they who are far off, flattering
themselves with the Thoughts that the Danger will
never reach them, or that they are no way obliged to
anticipate such Expences, and that it is greater Prudence
to keep their Forces entire till the Enemy come nigher.
But alas! then all the Difficulties being surmounted, and
those States taken, which served them for Out-works
the rest will never be able to hold out. This was the
Fate of the <hi>Britains:</hi> of whom, thus <hi>Tacitus; Heretofore
they were under Kings, now are by petty Princes distracted
into Factions; nor does any thing further our Designs against
the strongest Nations, than their not consulting the Common
Good. Seldom above two or three Cities associate to repell
the Common Danger: Thus while every one fights single, all
are overcome</hi>

                        <hi>FRiendship</hi> seems to restrain a Government more,
and to have been more considered by Law-Givers,
than <hi>Iustice.</hi> For if all Men were Friends,
there would be no need of Justice; but though all were
Just, yet would they want the Protection of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

a sure Sword always by one's side, both in Peace
and War; a faithful Companion in both Fortunes.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56556:350"/>
With this, Prosperity is crown'd, and Adversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more easie. For it neither is diminished by one,
or encreased by the other: In one it is guided by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
in the other by Constancy; in the one and the
other always at hand, as if by both it were like to gain.
Consanguinity may be without Kindness and Affection,
Friendship cannot. This comes from our own Choice,
that from Chance. That may be without the Bond of
Communication and Mutual Assistance, this cannot;
forasmuch as there are three things, which, as consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
parts of its Being unite it; Nature by the means of
Resemblance; the Will, by that of Good Humour;
and Reason, by that of Honour. Hereunto, certainly,
King <hi>Alphonsus the Wise</hi> alludes, when he accuseth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Person of Cruelty and Injustice, for carrying away
Prisoner one of two Persons who were endeared to each
other by Consanguinity and Friendship<note n="2" place="bottom">L. 19. Tit. 2. p. 2.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The more tried therefore and sincere the Friendship
has been, so much the less valuable will it be, when
once violated. A Crystal crackt, is good for nothing.
The Diamond loses all its Worth, when divided into
Pieces. A Sword once broken, can never be solder'd
again. Whoever trusts to reconciled Friendship, will
find himself deceived; for upon the first Blow of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
or Prospect of Advantage, it will presently
relapse again. Neither <hi>David</hi>'s Mercy, in sparing <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Life, nor the Acknowledgments and fair Protestations
of <hi>Saul,</hi> confirmed by Oath, were sufficient to make the
first think himself e'er the safer for this Reconcilement,
or the last to cease Plotting against him<note n="3" place="bottom">And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 22.</note>. <hi>Esau,</hi> with
Embraces, and Tears in his Eyes, tried to regain the
Favour of his Brother <hi>Iacob;</hi> and though there passed
great Signs and Expressions of Friendship on both sides,
yet could they never take away <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Distrust, who,
notwithstanding, endeavoured all he could to be severed
from him, and secure himself<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 33. 12.</note>. Renewed Friendship
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56556:351"/>
is like a vessel of Metal, which to day shines, and
to morrow is covered with Rust<note n="4" place="bottom">Never trust thine enemy; for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness: though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed, and beware of him, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 10.</note>. Nor are all the
good offices in the World capable of making it firm,
because the remembrance of Injuries is never quite erased
out of the Mind. <hi>Ervigius,</hi> after the Usurpation of
<hi>Wamba</hi>'s Crown, marry'd his Daughter <hi>Cixilon</hi> to <hi>Egica,</hi>
a very near Relation of that King's, and afterwards
nominated him for his Successor; but even this could
not keep <hi>Egica</hi> from giving some marks of his Hatred
to his Father-in-Law, as soon as ever he came to the
Crown<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp.</note>. The Scars of Wounds made by Injuries on
the Mind, always remain in the Person wrong'd, and
upon the first motion bleed afresh. Injuries are like
Marshes, which, though dried up, are easily filled with
Water again. There is a certain Shadow always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Offender and the Offended, which no Light of
Excuse or Satisfaction can dispell. Nor is Friendship
secure on the former's side, in that he never is persuaded
the other has really and from his heart forgiven the
Injury, and always looks on him as an Enemy. Besides
that, it is natural to hate one you have injured<note n="5" place="bottom">Proprium humani ingenii est, odisse quem laeser is. <hi>Tac. Vit. Agric.</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>This is what happens in the Friendship of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but 'tis not so in those of Princes, (if indeed there
be any true Friendship to be met with between them) for
Self-Interest makes them Friends or Enemies; and though
the Friendship be broke a thousand times, yet it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
renewed again by hopes of Advantage; and as
long as this may be executed, continues firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
Wherefore in such Friendships as these, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
is to be had to the Ties of Blood, or Obligations
of Favours received, for these are things disowned by
Ambition. Their Duration is to be esteem'd by Utility,
in that all Friendships now-a-days are like those of <hi>Philip,</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who made Interest, not Faith, the
Measure of them. In these, Friendships, which are more
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56556:351"/>
                        <hi>Reason of State,</hi> than any Mutual Harmony of Wills,
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> would never have so sharply repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Bias,</hi> for saying, <hi>We ought to love no otherwise,
than if we were to hate again:</hi> For a Prince would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his Confidence, should he ground it upon such
Friendship. It is best then for Princes to be Friends so
to day, as to think they may possibly fall out to morrow.
But although this Precaution is not to be found fault
with, yet Interest and Self-ends are not to be preferred
to Friendship, ever the more, for that 'tis common for
others to do so. Let Friendship fail in others, but not
the Prince we propose to form by these <hi>Emblems,</hi> whom
we exhort to Constancy in his Actions and Obligations.</p>
                     <p>All that has been said hitherto, has respect to such
Friendships as are betwixt neighbouring Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom there is some Emulation of Grandeur; for
among others, sincere Amity, and a reciprocal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
may have place. Power should not be so
over-careful, as to trust no one. Like a Tyrant, he
will be ever in Fear, who puts no Confidence in his
Friends. Without these, the Crown is Slavery, not
Majesty. 'Tis an unjust Empire, that deprives Princes
of Friendships. Not Armies nor Treasures are the
Defence of a Kingdom, but Friends<note n="6" place="bottom">Non exercitus neque thesauri, praesidia Regni sunt, verum amici, <hi>Sallust.</hi>

                     <p>Friendship between great Princes, should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
rather by a good Correspondence, than by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents;
for Interest is always ungrateful and insatiable:
For the sake of <hi>that,</hi> Friendships are pretended, never
really contracted; as <hi>Vitellius</hi> found, who thinking to
preserve his Friends, by the Richness of his Presents,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56556:352"/>
not by his Merit, deserved rather than had them<note n="9" place="bottom">Dum amicitias magnitudine munerum, non constantia morum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere putavit, meruit, magis quam habuit, <hi>Tac. Hist. l.</hi> 2.</note>.
Friends are to be kept by Iron, not Gold; for Fear of
Arms creates more of them, than Desire of Money.
Pecuniary Subsidies enervate the Giver; and the greater
they are, the lesser time can they be continued; and as
fast as the Prince's Coffers empty, his Reputation dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes.
Princes are esteem'd and lov'd for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
they still have, not those they have already squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
away; more, I say, for what they can give, than
for what they have given: For Hope prevails much
more with Men than Gratitude. He who buys Peace,
is unable to uphold it with Arms. This is a Fault which
almost all Monarchies fall into, when arrived to some
height of Grandeur, they strive to maintain it by Money,
not Arms; and thus consuming their Treasures, and
oppressing their Subjects, to raise Contributions for
neighbouring Princes, to keep the Circumference quiet,
they weaken the Center. And though that Greatness be
supported for a time, yet 'tis at the Price of a greater
Downfall; for that Weakness being known, and the
Frontiers once lost, the Enemy, without Opposition,
makes way to their Heart. Thus it befell the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, when, after having been at so many useless
Expences, and wasted their Strength, the Emperors
went about to gain the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
which was the first beginning of their Ruine.
Hence <hi>Alcibiades</hi> advised <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> not to be so liberal
of his Succors to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> but to remember,
that it was not his own, but another's Victory he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted;
and that he was to support the War, so as not

Counsel we may make our Advantage of, by taking
care, what is expended on Favour of Foreign Princes,
to the great prejudice and weakening of <hi>Castile;</hi> which
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56556:352"/>
yet, as being the Heart of the whole Monarchy, should
be furnish'd with the greatest quantity of Blood, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
Vital Spirits to all the other Parts of the Body;
as Nature her self, the best Mistress of Politicks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs,
who fortifies with the strongest Fences the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Parts, whereon Life depends. If what Timorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Solicitude spends Abroad to keep the Monarchy
in Security, Prudence would lay out at Home in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Forces both by Sea and Land, in Fortifying and
Garrisoning Strong Holds, Forts and Cities, the remote
Provinces would be abundantly more safe; and if any
one should be lost, it might easily be recovered by the
Forces within. <hi>Rome</hi> was able to defend it self, and
even to retake all that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had gotten from them,
nay, even to overthrow <hi>Carthage</hi> it self, by keeping all
its Wealth and Strength within the Bowels of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                     <p>Not that I say this, with a desire to persuade Princes
always to refuse their Money to their Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but only that they might be very careful how
they lay it out, and rather assist them with Men than
Money; for this stays with them that receiv'd it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those return to him who sent them. And this is to
be understood, when there is no danger of engaging
themselves in the War, by drawing it into their own
States, or of getting their Friend greater Enemies; as
also when it is more Expensive, and liable to more
Inconveniences to aid with Money, than Arms: For one
of the two ways State-Interest absolutely requires us to
defend a neighbouring Prince, as often as our Fortune
is inseparably joined with his; it being prudenter to
carry on a War in another's State, than to feed it in
the very Heart of our own. Thus, of old, it was the
peculiar way of the <hi>Romans</hi> to make War far from
Home, and by the Fortresses of the Empire to defend
the Fortunes of their Allies<note n="11" place="bottom">Fuit proprium populi Romani longè à domo bellare, &amp; pro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And this we ought to have learn'd from that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we might not be forced to lament at this day
so many Calamities. 'Tis this Policy, rather than Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
that has moved the <hi>Swiss-Cantons</hi> to undertake the
Protection of some People; for though they were sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this could not be done without great Charges, and the
running the Risque of their own Defence, yet they thought
it more their Interest to keep the War out of their own
Territories: The Confines of a neighbouring State are
the Walls of our own, and as such, to be guarded with
all the Care imaginable.</p>

Thus Protection changes into Tyranny. A Superiour
Power observes no Laws, Ambition no Respect. What
was committed to its Trust, it afterwards detains as its
own, under colour of Self-Preservation. Petty Princes
think to secure their States by Foreign Aids and utterly
ruine them: They fall a Prey both to Friend and Enemy;
the former being no less dangerous from Confidence,
than the latter from Hatred. With a Friend we live
secure, without the least Fear or Precaution; so that he
may easily strike us, without any Danger on his side.
Upon this Reason, I conceive, was founded that Law,
which commanded, the Oxe that had gored any one,
to be stoned<note n="2" place="bottom">If an oxe gore a man or a woman, and they die, the oxe shall be s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

we trust the Oxe more, as being a Domestick Animal
we every day make use of. Ambition creeps in, under
the pretext of Friendship and Protection; and that, by
their means, is easily obtained, which never could
have been by Force. With what specious Names did
the <hi>Romans</hi> mask their Tyranny, when they received
the People of other Nations for Citizens, Friends, and
Allies? They admitted the <hi>Albani</hi> into their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
peopling it with those who before were Enemies:
The <hi>Sabines</hi> they made Free of their City; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Countries called them to their Aid, against
their Enemies, as the Protectors of their Liberties and
Privileges, and the Universal Arbitrators of Justice.
Thus they, who of themselves could not have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

one Foot of Ground, by the Ignorance of others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
their Dominions far and near. At first they
exacted but moderate Tributes of those Nations; thus
disguising their Treachery, under the Appearance of
Morality. But when that Imperial Eagle had spread its
Wings wider, over the three Parts of the World, <hi>Europe,
Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> she whet her Beak upon Ambition,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56556:354"/>
and discovered the Claws of her Tyranny. The People
then found their Confidence was miserably deluded,
and the Feathers of their Power destroyed, under those
of the Oppression of Taxes, and the loss of their Liberty
and Privileges; and now the Tyranny was grown
powerful, could neither recover themselves again, nor
re-establish their Forces: And to the end the Venom
might turn into Nature, the <hi>Romans</hi> invented Colonies,
and introduced the Latin Tongue, thus to efface the
Distinction of Nations, and leave the <hi>Romans</hi> alone to
enjoy the Empire of all. This was that <hi>Eagle</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s
Vision, with <hi>great Wings, and many Feathers</hi>
                        <note n="3" place="bottom">And there was also another Eagle, with great wings, and many feathers, <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 17. 7.</note>; or, as
the Septuagint has it, <hi>many Talons,</hi> because such were its
Feathers. How often do Men think they stand under
the one, when they are really under the other? How
often do they think themselves covered with the Lily,
when stuck so fast amidst Thorns and Briars, that they
can't escape without tearing their Cloaths. The City
of <hi>Pisa</hi> put their Rights and Pretensions against the

the Catholick,</hi> and the King of <hi>France;</hi> and both agreed
to deliver it to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> under the pretence of the

Ornament, are sullied and unset, the Orders of
its States overthrown and confounded, the Harmony

Nobility stript and impoverished; <hi>that,</hi> of all its
Provinces which knew best how to assert its Liberty,
now without the least appearance of it, is trampled
under foot and laid waste by the Fire and Sword of
Foreign Nations, and exposed to the Will of a thousand
Tyrants, all living Pictures of the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> in

stupified by its Misfortunes, that 'tis render'd incapable

Fate of all People at variance with themselves, of all
Princes who make use of Foreign Forces; especially if
he who sends, does not also pay them. Thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

                        </note>. Glory, at first, prompts to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
but in the end, Ambition seizes all. Whoever
employs his Forces for another, expects some Amends
for it. The Country always loves the Power that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
it; the Subjects imagining they shall live more
secure and happy under his Government, freed from
the Fear and Danger of Wars, and the severe Taxes
inferiour Princes are wont to impose, and from those
Grievances they generally suffer at their Hands. The
Nobles too, think it more Honourable to serve a greater
Master, who has larger Rewards to give, and greater
Preferments to confer upon them. All these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
make way for Tyranny and Usurpation. Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
Troops always obey him who sends them, or in
whose Pay they are, and treat those Countries they serve
in, as Foreign; so that when the War is ended with the
Enemy, they must begin with the Friend. Therefore
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56556:355"/>
I think it better, and less hazardous and expensive, for
the weaker Prince to come to a Composition, upon any
Terms, with the more powerful, than even to conquer
him with Foreign Arms: What cannot be obtained but
by them, can much less be preserved without them,
after they shall be withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>This Danger of Auxiliary Forces is yet more to be
feared, when the Prince who sends them is of a different
Religion, or has, or at least pretends to some Right to
that State; or else, if it be of any considerable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for him to be possessed of it, for the opening a
Passage to his own, or obstructing that of an Enemy.
These Apprehensions should be measured by Necessity,
the Condition and Manners of the Prince being well
examined; for if he be open and generous, Publick
Faith and Reputation will have more Influence on him,
than Interest, and Reasons of State; as has been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in all the Princes of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by that powerful protecting Cherub to which
<hi>Ezekiel</hi>
                        <note n="5" place="bottom">Thou art the anointed Cherub that governeth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 14.</note> compares the King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> before he failed
in his Duty) of whose Friendship no one can justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
<hi>Piedmont, Savoy, Cologne, Constance,</hi> and <hi>Brisac,</hi> all
Places defended by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Arms, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
without so much as a Garrison left in them, are
everlasting Witnesses of this Truth. Nor can <hi>Genoua</hi>
deny it; for when oppressed by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> it put
its Liberty into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> these People
most faithfully preserved it, as esteeming more their
Friendship, and the Glory of Publick Faith, than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                     <p>But if Necessity, at any time, oblige the Prince to have
recourse to a Foreigner, he may avoid the Dangers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
by these two or three Cautions: If he take care
that the Foreign Forces be not greater than his own;
That his own Officers Command them; That they be
not put in Garrisons; That they be mixed or divided,
and immediately drawn out against the Enemy.</p>

                     <p>OFten has the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea felt the Danger of the
Neighbourhood of Mount <hi>Vesuvius:</hi> But we learn
not always to profit by our Misfortunes, being,
out of a vain confidence, apt to persuade our selves,
they will never happen a second time. The World had
long since been at the height of Wisdom, had it known
how to improve by its Experiences: But Time, we see,
effaces them, as it did in the Ruines the late Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had left upon the skirts of that Mountain, covering
it with a prodigious quantity of Ashes, which, but a
few Years afterwards, the Plough cultivated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

sustained, was lost, or rather, no one would retain it,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56556:356"/>
when yet they ought to have ever kept Humane Caution
upon its Guard. The treacherous Mountain conceal'd
under its green Garment the Heat and Drought of its
Entrails; and the Sea, suspecting no harm, made an
Alliance with it, and embraced it with its Waters, not
regarding the contrariety of those two Natures. But
the treacherous Mountain kept its Intention so close, that
not the least Smoke gave any sign of what was plotting
within. Their Communication encreased by secret
ways: Nor co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

was raising Fortifications against it, and preparing Mines
with divers sulphurous Metals; which being afterwards
filled, and that in our Age, was set fire to. There
open'd, on the top of it, a wide and deep Mouth,
breathing out Flames, which at first seem'd to be no
more than P<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

but in a few hours proved tragical Prodigies. This
heavy Body several times shook; and amidst its dreadful
Thunder, vomited up the liquid Flames of those indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
Matters of melted Metals which boiled in its
Stomach: like Torrents of Fire they streamed down it,
into the Plains adjacent, burning the Trees, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Houses along with them, till at length they
run into the Sea; which, astonish'd at so sudden an
Hostility, retired with its Waters to the very Center,
whether out of Fear, or Policy, to raise a greater Body
of Waves to defend it self withal; for now the old
League was violated, it was obliged to prepare for its
Defence. The two Elements engaged not without the
trembling of Nature her <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Fabrick of the Universe on Fire: The very Waves,
conquered by a superiour Enemy, burned; and the Fish,
swimming in the Flames, were drowned: For the Fire,
(as <hi>Solomon</hi>

Such will be the Effects of all the like Alliances of
contrary Natures. Let not the Catholick Prince, who
enters into a Confederacy with Infidels, expect less
Evils. For there being no more inveterate Animosities
than those which arise from the Difference of Religions,
the present Necessity may indeed dissemble them, but it
is impossible that Time should not discover them: And
how is it to be imagined that Amity can ever be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
between them, when the one cannot trust the
other? when the Ruine of this, is the Interest of that?
They who differ in Opinions, differ also in Minds; and
as Creatures of that Eternal Artificer, we cannot suffer
any other Adoration to be paid him, than what we judge
to be true and Orthodox. And altho' the Friendship of
Infidels were never so good, yet Divine Justice permits
us not to obtain our Ends by the means of his Enemies,
nay, usually chastises us by the very Infidel's Hand that
Sign'd the Treaty. The Emperor which <hi>Constantine the
Great</hi> translated into the <hi>East,</hi> was ruin'd by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
of the <hi>Palaeologi</hi> with the Turk; God permitting
it to remain to Posterity, for an Example of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but not any living Memorial of that Family. But
if, by reason of the Distance of Places, or Disposition
of Things, the Chastisement cannot be inflicted by those
very Infidels, God uses his own Hand. What Calamities
has not <hi>France</hi> suffered, since <hi>Francis</hi> I. more through
Emulation of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Glory, than forced by
any Necessity, made a League with the Turk, and called
him into <hi>Europe?</hi> This Fault he acknowledged in the
last moments of his Life, expressed his utmost Detestation
of it in Words; which piously we ought to impute to
a Christian Compunction, though otherwise they seemed
to proceed from extreme Despair. God pursued his
Chastisement in some of his Successors, by taking them
off with violent and unhappy Deaths. Now if this
Just Judge be thus severe on Princes who do but ask the
Aid of Infidels and Hereticks, what will he do to those
who assist them against the Catholicks, and are the
reason of their making such great Progresses? The
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56556:357"/>
Example of <hi>Peter</hi> II. of <hi>Arragon,</hi> will tell us<note n="2" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. l. 12. c. 2.</note>: This
King stuck with all his Forces to the Faction of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses</hi>
in <hi>France;</hi> and though he fought at the Head of
One hundred thousand Men, against the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who
were but Eight hundred Horse, and a Thousand Foot, lost
at once both his Life and the Battel. <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi>
no sooner joined with the <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' only to defend
himself against the <hi>Grecian</hi> Power, but the two Angels,
that stood by his side, left him, and he was slain. The
same Punishment, and for the same Cause, suffered
<hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Simon,</hi> his Brothers and Successors.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Excuse of Self-Defence always sufficient;
for all the Conditions and Circumstances that make such
Confederacies allowable, very rarely concurr, and are
of greater weight than that universal Scandal and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of defiling the true Religion with Errors; the
Communication of Hereticks being a Poison apt to infect,
a Gangrene that soon spreads, where Minds are enclined
to Novelty and Licentiousness<note n="3" place="bottom">And their word will eat as doth a canker, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17.</note>. Policy distrusting
the Divine Assistance, and wholly relying upon Humane
Artifices, may indeed deceive it self, but not God, at

received. <hi>Baasha,</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> built a Fortress in

This occasion'd
a War between those two Kings; and <hi>Asa</hi> fearing the

contrived first to break that, and then enter'd himself

interfere not with Religion or Good Manners, and be
confirmed by Oath, the Publick Faith is by all means to
be kept with them; for in the Oath, God is called to be
a Witness to the Agreement, and, as it were, a Surety
for the Performance of it, both Parties consenting to
make him Judge of it, to punish the Perjurer. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it were a hainous Sin, to call him to witness to a
Lye. Nations have no other Security of the Treaties they
make, than the Religion of Oaths; which if they should
make use of to deceive, there would be an end of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce

Truces or Peace to be ever concluded. But though
there pass no Oath, yet the Treaties should nevertheless
be observed: For from the Truth, Fidelity and Justice
whereby they are maintained, there arises in them a
mutual Obligation, and a Duty common to all Nations;
and as it is not allowable to kill or hate a Man of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

suffers the Intemperatures of Heat under the Torrid

the same Zone. Now what the <hi>Sun</hi> does in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial-Line,
a Part of Heaven so considerable, that if the
immense Being of God could be confined to any limited
Place, it could be no other than that; the same Effect,
I say, is produced here below, by that Pontifical Triple-Crown,
which from <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Fixed Equinox, with its
Divine Rays illuminates all the Parts of the World:
This is the Sun of these inferior Orbs, in which was
substituted the Power of the Light of that Eternal Sun
of Righteousness, that all Things Sacred might receive
from it their true Form, so as never to be called in
question by the shadows of impious Opinions. There is
no Country so near the Poles, but the Brightness of its
Rays, in spite of the Frosts and Mists of Ignorance,
has reached it. This <hi>Tiara,</hi> or Triple-Crown, is the
Touch-stone on which other Crowns are tried, and the
Caracts of their Gold and Silver proved, in that, as in
a Crucible, they are separated from other base Metals;
and it is by the <hi>Tau</hi> they are stampt with, that they are
assured of their real Value. Hence <hi>Ramius,</hi> King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> and many others, voluntarily offered to become
Feudataries to the Church, looking on it as an Honour
and Happiness for their Crowns to pay it Tribute.
Those that refuse the Touch of this Apostolical Stone,

was encreased; who afterwards armed the Spiritual
Sword, so as to render it capable of being the Balance
of the Kingdoms of Christendom. And by the same
means the Popes still endeavour to support their Power,
procuring the Favour of Potentates by their Paternal
Affection. Their Empire over Minds is a Voluntary
one, imposed by Reason, not Force: and if at any time
this latter has been too immoderate, it has had quite
contrary Effects; for Passion is blind, and easily runs
headlong. The Papacy even unarmed, is stronger than
the best appointed Armies. The Presence of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
in his Pontifical Robes, struck such a Terrour into <hi>Attila,</hi>
that it made him retreat, and lay aside his Thoughts of
Sacking of <hi>Rome;</hi> which had he attempted by Arms, he

The bare Whistle of the Shepherd, or a kind Menace

It is a Rebellious Sheep, that must be led by Rigour:

Grandeur, than done with a design to let them use it,

The Splendour of his Vertues strike the Mind
more than the Sword does the Body, which is much less
prevalent in composing the Differences of Princes than
Love and Respect; for when Princes once see that his
good Offices proceed from a true Paternal Love, free
from Passions, Affections, and Politick Artifices, they
willingly lay their Rights, and Arms, at his Feet.
This several Popes have had Experience of, who avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Neutrality, have shewn themselves the Common
Fathers of the whole World. He who adheres to one
alone, denies himself to all besides; and he that is
neither on this Side nor that Side, takes the Part of none.
Whereas the High-Priests should be for All, as their
Garments, in the Old Law, gave us to understand,
whose exquisite Make represented the Globe of the
Earth<note n="3" place="bottom">For in the long garment was the whole world, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 18. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

a-cross at the sight of other Mens Calamities. Should
a Father stand still while his Children quarrel, he would
be deservedly blamed for whatever mischief they should
do one to another; he ought, sometimes by Rigour,
sometimes by good Words, to part them, putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
betwixt them, or, if need be, espousing one's Cause,
the better to reduce the other to Agreement. Thus if
Princes refuse to hearken to the Fatherly Admonition of
His Holiness, if they pay not the Respect due to his
Authority, and there be no hopes of ever recovering
them, it seems best to declare in favour of the most
just Side, always having regard to the Publick Quiet,
and the Advancement of Religion and the Church, to
assist that, till the other be brought to its Duty: For he
that approves the Cause of the one and the other,
will be thought to co-operate with both.

Affection of the Popes, not to give Occasion to
them, behaving themselves so Courteous always, so as
thereby to maintain a good Correspondence with Princes:
For although they have in their Hand, as was said, the
two Swords of Spiritual and Temporal Authority, yet
this ought to execute nothing but by the Arms of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Kings, as Protectors and Defenders of the
Church: Which makes it (as <hi>Alphonsus the Wise</hi> says<note n="*" place="bottom">In Proem. p. 2.</note>)
of so much concernment for those two Powers always to
agree, so that each may help the other, when Occasion
requires. I doubt not but all those whom God hath
placed in this High Station, have this Care deeply rooted
in their Hearts; but yet it is often-times perplexed by
the Courtiers of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose only business is to sow
Discords; as also by the Ambition of some Ministers,
who think to wind themselves into the Favour of the
Popes, and to procure the best Preferments by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency
on Princes, and by the Aversion they bear
them, always inventing Pretences to reject their Petitions,
and taking all occasions of Affronting their Embassadors;
and who, to appear Stout, suggest violent Counsels,
under colour of Religion and Zeal: all which ruine

                        <note n="1" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp. l. 11. c. 16.</note>; for each of these Kings took care
not to let it be oppress'd by the other, and those Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
kept the Freedom of that little State untouch'd.
By this the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> may see how much it is their

                        </gap> this Neutrality, and side with one of the
two Crowns and that is, when the other attempts the
Conquest of their Dominions, particularly that of <hi>France:</hi>
For if once the <hi>French</hi> should drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> they would become so powerful (considering they
have already e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they must of necessity either unite them to
the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> or but then them with an intolerable
Slavery, which the whole Body of <hi>Italy</hi> would soon feel
the Effects of, without hopes of redeeming their Liberty
again; and for <hi>Spain</hi> ever to retrieve their Losses, or
balance their Forces, would be extremely difficult,
considering the vast distance between them too. This
Danger the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> with a great deal of
Prudence, weighed, when seeing <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth's
Power encrease in <hi>Italy,</hi> they struck up that which was
called <hi>the Holy League.</hi> From that time, one may say,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56556:363"/>
Divine Providence began to contrive the Security and
Preservation of the Apostolick Chair, and of Religion,
and to prevent its falling under the Tyranny of the
Turk, or being infected with the Heresies, then taking
root in <hi>Germany;</hi> advanced the Greatness of the House
of <hi>Austria,</hi> and establish'd the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy in the
States of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> that <hi>Italy</hi> might have
a Catholick Prince to defend it on all sides: And to
restrain the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and make it content with
the Rights of Succession, Fiefs, and Arms, it raised it
a Rival in the Person of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to lay its
Kings under a necessity for their Preservation of gaining
the Love and Good-will of their Subjects, and the Esteem
of other Princes, by maintaining Justice among them,
with these Peace, without giving the least Occasion to
War, which always hazards the Rights and Designs of
the most Powerful.</p>
                     <p>This Advantage which <hi>Italy</hi> reaps from the Power
of <hi>Spain,</hi> is, by some, unjustly traduced as a Yoke of
Slavery; when, on the contrary, it is the only Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its Repose, of its Liberty and Religion: The
Mistake proceeds from their not well knowing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of this Counterpoise. A Person, ignorant in
Navigation, seeing the Bottom of a Ship filled with Sand
and Stones, thinks it carries the Cause of its Wreck in this
Weight: whereas they who are acquainted with Sea-Affairs,
know, that without this Ballast, the Lightness of
the Ship could never subsist long against the Agitation of
the Waves. <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> speaking of this <hi>Aequilibrium</hi>
between two Crowns, looks on it as a Common Advantage
to the Subjects of both Kingdoms, when he says, <q>That
he could not enough admire the inscrutable Wisdom
of God, who makes two directly opposite Means tend
to the same End; as when he would keep two Powers
at variance, without however subjecting the one to
the other, he either gives to both Commanders,
whose Capacity and Courage discover the Artifices,
and oppose the Attempts of the adverse Party, which
makes for the Liberty of the Subjects of both Sides;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56556:364"/>
or else sets over them Men so senseless and cowardly,
that they undertake nothing considerable one against

Propinquity of Territories, or Easiness of Passage, should

them open, according as the Publick Good requires.
This Divine Disposition Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. was sensible

good of</hi> Italy, <hi>that the</hi> French <hi>strive to get footing there, but
to bring it under their Subjection, as was attempted in the</hi>
Genoese <hi>Expedition.</hi> That <hi>Italian</hi> Prince penetrated not
the force of this Counsel, who advised the prefent <hi>French</hi>
King, by making himself Master of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> to get
firm footing on the <hi>Alps;</hi> deceived probably (unless it
were Malice) by the appearing Conveniency of having
the <hi>French</hi> ready against any Attacks of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
not considering, that by the fear of a future War, which
might perhaps never have really happen'd, a present
and most certain one is kindled, upon the admission of

the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> it being impossible for Peace to be
preserved in any one Province betwixt two Nations so
opposite and disagreeing: Nor were <hi>Italy</hi> like to reap
any other Benefit from it than this, That it would
nourish a Serpent in its Bosom, whose poisonous Sting
would certainly afterwards envenom it. Besides that
the <hi>French,</hi> even when within their own Limits, on the
other side of the <hi>Alps,</hi> are always near enough to march
into <hi>Italy,</hi> when called, nor is it necessary that they be
so near as to have the Passage at their Command. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
were the <hi>French</hi> so modest, so void of Ambition,
as to confine themselves there, and not move but when
called upon; yet who doubts but upon such an Occasion
they would widely transgress the Bounds of Protection;
as <hi>Lewis Sforza, Castruchio Castrocani,</hi> and several others,
have actually experienc'd, who sought their Aid with
no other Advantage, than that the same befell them
(as it does some at this day) which <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates to

some Reason in the Policy, some colour of Zeal for the
Publick Good, in this Counsel: But now, in a time the
most improper in the World, to place it within the

of Ambition or Levity, and that Fear of it might keep
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continually upon their Guard, and Occasion
be given to other Princes to take up Arms, and a Storm
of Wars be raised never to be calmed, was so far from
being good Counsel, that it was the rankest Treason,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56556:365"/>
being, in plain terms, no other than exposing it to the
Power of <hi>France,</hi> and wresting that out of the <hi>Italian</hi>

                     <p>In the other Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are not situate

                     <p>Victories are to be esteemed more for the Progresses
may be expected from them, than for themselves,
and therefore should be cultivated, that they may bear
the more. To give the Enemy Time, is to Arm him;

to leave Arms barren. It is as easie for a Fortune raised

was by getting, and preserving. The same Reasons

are not feared for having the Weapons in their Hands,
but for knowing how to use them. No one assaults him
who dares turn again. Almost all Wars are grounded
either upon the Oscitancy or Cowardice of the Person
against whom they are waged. What Risque is there in
making War against a Prince wholly devoted to Peace,
since whatever the Success be, that will certainly be
obtained? For this Reason, it seems convenient, that
the Maxims of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be changed in <hi>Italy,</hi> which
endeavour to inculcate, That the King wishes nothing
so much as Peace, and would purchase it at any Rate.
It is fit, indeed, Princes should know that His Majesty
is always Sincere, and willing to keep a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
with them, ready to employ all his Forces for
their Conservation and Defence, and that he will spare
no Care which may contribute to the Quiet of those
Provinces: but withal, they should know, That if any
one unjustly opposes his Grandeur, and conspires to
overthrow it, putting him to the Damages and Expences
of War, he will get Satisfaction, by detaining what he
shall take from them. What Court of Justice will not
allow Costs to the Party that sues another without Reason?

the Seat of the War may be changed. Thus the <hi>French</hi>
Sign'd the Peace of <hi>Mouzon,</hi> with no other intent than
to remove the War into <hi>Germany,</hi> and fall upon the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> that way. So the only end of the Peace of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> was to disarm the Emperor; for at the same
Time the <hi>French</hi> agreed to it, they were brewing a League
with the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> against him, and there was not
above two Months between the one and the other.
Now in the like Cases, War is much better than a
suspected Peace<note n="5" place="bottom">In pace suspecta tutius bellum, <hi>Tac. Hist. l.</hi> 4.</note>; this being indeed a Peace without
Peace<note n="6" place="bottom">Saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 14.</note>.</p>

A short Peace is good for nothing but to gather Fuel to
light War withal. The same Inconveniencies attend
Trucer made for a few Years; they do but suspend
Anger for a time, and give place for the sharpening of
Swords, and pointing of Lances; by their means Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
pass into Prescription, and Peace is afterwards
rendred more difficult, inasmuch as no one resigns wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

the Casualties of War are various and fortunate, often
beget unhappy Successes. How frequent is it to see him
begging for Peace, who was but just before asked it.
A Certain Peace is better than a Victory in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the one depends on our own Pleasure, the other

                     <p>Nothing in the World is more an Enemy to Possession

that Matter for War may be furnished, whenever it

                     <p>When a Peace is once Concluded, the Laws of God
and Man oblige to a faithful Observance of it, even
although transacted with one's Predecessors, without
any Distinction between the Government of One and
Many; both the Kingdom and Commonwealth, for the
Benefit, and upon the Faith of which the Contract was
made, being always the same, and never dying. Time,
and Common Consent, have Passed what was once
Agreed upon into a Law. Nor is Force or Necessity
a sufficient Excuse for making War: For if the Publick
Faith might be violated for these things, there would be
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56556:380"/>
no Capitulation, no Treaty of Peace, but might be
broken, under the same colour. <hi>Francis</hi> I. was blamed
for declaring War against <hi>Charles</hi> V. contrary to the
Agreement made during his Imprisonment, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Constraint. By such Artifices, and Equivocal
Negotiations, it comes to pass, that none at all are firm;
so that to establish them, it is necessary to demand
Hostages, or detain some considerable Place; things
which embarrass a Peace, and fatigue the World with
perpetual Wars.</p>
                     <p>The Prince then being free from the Toils and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of War, should apply himself wholly to the Arts
of Peace, (according to <hi>Tasso,</hi>)

                           <l>With equal Iustice punish and reward;</l>
                           <l>And out of Danger, stand upon your Guard.</l>
                        </q>
Yet not without reflecting how soon War may possibly
disturb his Rest. Let not his Eye quit the Arms his Hand
has laid down; nor those old Medals influence him, upon
the Reverse of which <hi>Peace</hi> was described burning
Shields with a Torch: This was far from being a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Emblem; for there is nothing so necessary after
War, as the preserving of Arms, to keep Violence from
making any attempt against Peace. None but God alone
could, when he gave it to his People, <hi>break the Bow,</hi> (as
the Psalmist expresseth it) <hi>cut the Spear in sunder,</hi> and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>the Chariots in the fire</hi>
                        <note n="14" place="bottom">Psal. 46. 9.</note>; forasmuch as he being
the Arbiter of War, needs not Arms to maintain Peace
withal: But among Men there can be no Peace, where
Ambition is not restrained by Fear or Force. This gave
Occasion to the Invention of Arms, which Defence found
out before Offence. The Plough marked out the Walls
before the Streets were disposed, and almost at the
same time Tents were pitched, and Houses built. The
Publick Repose would never be secure, did not Care armed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56556:380"/>
guard its Sleep. A State unprovided with Arms,
awakens the Enemy, and invites War. Never had the
<hi>Alps</hi> heard the Echo's of so many Trumpets, had the
Cities of the <hi>Milanese</hi> been better fortify'd: This State
is, as it were, an Outwork to all the Kingdoms of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, and each ought, for its own Security,
to contribute to its Strength; which, joined with the
Power of the Sea, would render the Monarchy firm and
unshaken. Mens Hearts, were they of Adamant, could
not supply the Defect of Walls. King <hi>Witiza,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing
these, made the <hi>Moors</hi> so bold as to invade
<hi>Spain,</hi> when those Banks were gone, which, till then,
had stopt their Inundations<note n="15" place="bottom">Mar. Hist. Hisp.</note>. <hi>Augustus</hi> was not guilty
of this Negligence, in that long Peace he enjoyed; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Publick Treasury, as a Provision against a War.
Except Forces be Exercised in Time of Peace, and the
Mind disciplin'd in the Arts of War, it will not easily
be done, when Danger of Invasion shall have put all Men
in a Consternation, and they be more intent on flying
and saving what they have, than on their Defence.
There is no greater Stratagem, than to leave a Kingdom
to its own Idleness. When Military Exercise fails,
Valour does the same. Nature produces in all Parts
great Souls, which either Occasion discovers, or want
of Business burieth. Past Ages have not furnish'd braver
Men in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> than are at this day born; but
they then appeared so Heroical, because Desire of Rule
made them use themselves to Arms. Let not a Prince
be discouraged at the Sluggishness of his Subjects; Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
will fit them either to preserve Peace, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
War. Let him keep them always employed in the
Exercise of Arms; for he that desires Peace, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
War.</p>

Some Princes are sensible enough of how great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it is to Crown their Life with Vertues; but they
are mistaken, in thinking to supply that, by leaving
them described in Epitaphs, and represented in Statues;
not considering that they blush to accompany him in
Death, whom they had not accompanied while alive,
and that the Marbles are, as it were, in Indignation to
see the Counterfeit-Glory of a Tyrant inscribed on them,
but seem to soften to facilitate the engraving of that of
a Just Prince, hardening again afterwards to preserve it
to Eternity; which even the Stones themselves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

From what has been said, may be easily gathered
how much it concerns the Prince, in the Declension of
his Life, to endeavour that his former Glories may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
new Life and Vigour from those of his last Days,
and that both, after his Death, may remain for ever in the
memory of Mankind. To which end, we shall offer
some Rules to direct him how he ought to govern
himself, with relation to his Person, his Successor, and
his Dominions. As to his Person, he is to know, that
as he advanceth in Years, his Empire grows more savage,
and less subject to Reason; for the variety of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
he has met with, instruct him in Malice; and by
indulging Jealousies and Distrusts, he becomes Cruel
and Tyrannical. A long Reign is apt to beget Pride
and Presumption<note n="9" place="bottom">Ve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Avarice: whence proceed many things inconsistent

of the Royal Person. Princes will still retain
their ancient Customs and Gravity, forgetting what
they did when young, and thus they render themselves
odious. In the Beginnings of Government, Passion for
Glory, and Fear of Ruine, make them take care to Act
with Prudence and Caution: But afterwards Ambition
is tired, and the Prince has neither any Satisfaction in
good, nor any Concern for ill Success<note n="10" place="bottom">Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

imagining Vice to be the Recompence of his Glory,

as he desires to reserve this small remainder of his
days to himself, free from the Hurry and Fatigue of
Government, he surrenders all to his Ministers, or some
Favourite, on whom the Weight of Affairs lies, and the
Odium of the People is transferred. In which Case, they
who are not in the Prince's Favour, and have no share
in the Administration and Preferments, wish for, and do
their utmost to procure a new Master.</p>
                     <p>These are the most dangerous Rocks of a declining
Age, among which the Prince cannot use too much
Precaution against a Shipwreck. Yet though the
Course be hazardous, he ought not therefore to despair
of passing securely, since many Princes have maintained
their Esteem and Respect to their last Gasp. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

the Storms are, with the more Resolution the

and the closer he ought to keep to the Helm of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
lest by entrusting it in the Hands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
both himself and the Commonwealth should
fall a Prey to the Sea. While the Prince's Vigour
lasts, he should live and die in Action. Government
is like the Spheres, which never stand still; it admits
no Poles but those of the Prince. In the Arms of the
State, not those of Sloth, the Prince must find Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Infirmities of his Age he wants Strength to bear
them, and has need of other Shoulders, yet let him
not wholly refuse the Assistance of his own, were it
only for Shew, since that is the same thing in the Eyes
of the ignorant Mobb as Reality, and (as we observed
elsewhere) is a Restraint to Ministers, and Support
to Reputation. In this Case it is safer to form a Privy-Council
of Three, as <hi>Philip</hi> II. did, than to leave all
to the Management of One single Person; because the
People look not on them as Favourites, but as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.</p>
                     <p>Let the Prince beware of Covetousness, a Vice uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally

never forsakes, though it has bid adieu to all others.

                     <p>The Choice of a Tutor for the Son who is to succeed in
his Non-age is another thing, which demands all the Skill
and Prudence the Father is Master of, there being nothing
more exposed to Casualties than that; as we see present,
and read of past Examples of many Princes, who, during
their Minority, have lost their Lives and Kingdoms, at
least been reduced to great Distress<note n="51" place="bottom">Wo to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, <hi>Eceles.</hi> 10. 16.</note>. For if the
Guardianship be left to the Mother, though that may be
looked upon as most secure, yet the Prudence and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
requisite for such a Task are rarely to be met with
in a Woman, and most of that Sex want Courage to awe
Subjects, and gain Respect. But should it fall to the
Uncle, Ambition of Rule is wont to break the strongest
and most close Ties of Blood. If it light upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
every one of them is wholly devoted to his private
Interest, which occasions Divisions among them. Besides,
Subjects despise the Government of their Equals, which is
the Rise of Troubles, and Civil Commotions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of all these Dangers and Inconveniencies the
Prince must chuse the least, considering the Nature of the
State, and of the Persons most capable of the Education of
his Son, and picking out a Class of Subjects, whereby
the Security of the Pupil may be so provided for, that
they cannot possibly unite and conspire to ruine him. In
this Case it is highly requisite that they be immediately
brought into Business, who are to have, after the Father's
Death, the Tuition and Guidance of the Heir, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Government.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it the Prince's only Duty to get the Successor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and instructed, but he is also to prevent the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of his new Government, and their ill Consequence;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56556:387"/>
for when the Sails are changed the Ship is endanger'd;
and by the Introduction of New Forms, Nature suffers;
because Things end faintly, but begin with vigour: 'Tis
from this Vicissitude of Things that those Dangers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
which threaten upon the meeting of the Waves of
both Reigns, as it happens when one rapid River runs
violently into another of an equal Current. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Successor is easily lost, and Conspiracies and
Innovations contriv'd against him<note n="52" place="bottom">Quando ausuros exposcere remedia, nisi novum, &amp; nutantem a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Prince should endeavour to make the latter part of his
Reign so calm, that the new one may be entred on without

quit their Oars, and furl their Sails; so ought he to close
his Government, by laying aside all thoughts of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
and Wars, by confirming ancient Alliances, and
making new ones, particularly with his Neighbours, that
Peace may be setled in his Realms.

Death as it is for Birth, for the Dissolution as for the
Formation of the Body, Man would become Insolent
to Reason; and therefore she has not only given him one
sure Minute to breath in, but, on the contrary, hath in all
things imaginable laid before him Evidences of the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

it kindles, and extinguishes again in a moment; and the
Heavens, in the Prince of Light which the same Day

a happy Prince, had he ended his Days before the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of his last Years. Sovereignty is a kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Sea, not to be kept calm by a long Course of Life;
he who lives longest, suffers most Storms and Dangers.
But if we consider the End and Perfection of Nature, a
long Life is happy, when, according to the Testimony
of <hi>Iob,</hi> it comes into the Grave in its Maturity, as Corn
into the Barn<note n="7" place="bottom">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in, in his season, <hi>Iob 5. 26. secund. Septuagint.</hi>
                        </note>, before Decrepidness makes it wither;
for with the Shadow of Death the Vital Spirits congeal,
and the Body remains useless. The Trembling Hand can
no longer steer the Helm of the State, the Eye perceive
the Clouds of Heaven, the Course of the Winds, and the
Rocks of the Sea, nor the Ear hear the Barkings of <hi>Scylla</hi>
and <hi>Carybdis.</hi> Amidst so many Miseries of Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
fails the Prince; and being reduced, by the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Senses, to a second Infancy, he believes every
thing, and suffers himself to be govern'd by Malice,
which is then most awake in those about him, who at such

When therefore the Age is come to this pass, the Prince
has more need of Instructions to make him sensible of his
inability, and resign the weight of the Government to his
Successor, than of Precepts to continue it to himself. Let
not Ambition delude him, by the Representation of his
post Character and Applause; for Men consider not the
Prince as he was, but as he now is: Nor is it enough to
have once made himself feared, if he cannot do it now;
nor to have governed well heretofore, if he neither is
able nor knows how to govern well still. Dominion is
like the Sea, which immediately casts on Shore all unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Carkasses. The Prince is esteemed for the Form
of the Soul with which he Ordains, Commands, Rewards
and Punishes; so that when Age comes to discompose that
Form, the Esteem vanishes; a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to acknowledge the Injuries and Contempts of Age
in time, and so slip from them before they arrive. If
the Prince and Business must part, it is better that he
bid the first adieu. 'Tis a glorious Action to submit to
own one's Frailty, and voluntarily divest one's self of
Grandeur, before Death takes it away by Force; lest it
should be said, that he died unknown by himself, who
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56556:390"/>
lived known by all Men. He should consider, that his
Royal Scepter is like the Herb of the same Name, which

whole Globe of the Earth be no more than a Point, in

These last Expressions of Grief must not be denied the
Tenderness and Resentments of Nature: They are the
Scales wherein the Merit of the deceas'd Prince is weighed,
and whereby may be known what Value his Subjects had
for him; in a word, the Touch-stone on which their
Love and Obedience is tried, which strengthens the Links
of Subjection, and gives Heart to the Successor. Yet for
all this, the People must not be obliged to an expensive
Mourning, for fear their Prince's Death should turn to
a burthensom Tax.</p>
                     <p>Not, however, that Funeral Pomp, and magnificent
Tombs, adorned with Statues, and costly Imbossed Works,
are to be look'd on as a meer Vanity of Princes; they are
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56556:391"/>
rather a generous piece of Piety, which marks out the last
Bounds of Humane Greatness, and shews, in the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
wherewith their Ashes are honoured, what Respect
is owing to Majesty; Sepulchres being no other than a

                     <p>In the Funerals of private Persons great Care is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
because Superstitions prejudicial to Religion are
easily introduced, the Imagination being deluded in what
is hoped or feared from the Deceased; and for that
Funeral Charges are things which happen every day, and
concern many, it is absolutely necessary they should be
moderated, Sorrow and Vain-glory being apt to raise
them too high. <hi>Plato</hi> set a certain Rate upon the Building
of Sepulchres, as did <hi>Solon</hi> also, and after them the <hi>Romans.</hi>
King <hi>Philip</hi> II. made a Law to regulate the Abuses and
Excesses of Funerals and Monuments; saying, That what
was laid out superfluously upon them, were better given to
pious Uses, and to pray for the Souls of the Deceased.</p>
                     <p>Thus far Your Highness has seen the Birth, Death, and
Burial of the Prince whom these <hi>Emblems</hi> form; being,
as it were, present at the Building of this Politick Edifice,
from the very Foundation, to the last Stone.</p>
                     <p>And now, that your Highness may with more ease
take a Review of the whole Fabrick, I have thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to subjoin here a kind of Platform thereof, or
Looking-Glass, wherein it may be represented, as a
greater City is in a lesser. This shall be King <hi>Ferdinand the
Catholick,</hi> one of Your Royal Highnesses's Ancestors; in
whose glorious Reign, all the Arts both of Peace and War
flourished, and Accidents both of prosperous and adverse
Fortune occurred. The Infancy of this Great King was
ripe and vigorous, his Youth employed in Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
and what art and Industry could not perfect in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56556:392"/>
him, Experience supplied. His very Leisure was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and his Diversions, Attention of Mind. He
was absolute Master of his Passions, following more the
Dictates of Policy, than his own Natural inclinations.
He own'd his Grandeur to be from God only; and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in his own Actions, not those of his Ancestors. He
look'd on Sovereignty rather as a Charge than a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
He qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Presence, rais'd his Monarchy by Valour and Prudence,

Love and Respect, embellish'd it with Arts and Sciences,
enrich'd it by Trade and Husbandry, and eterniz'd it by
Maxims and Institutions truly Politick. He was a King
as well of his Court as Kingdoms, and Master as well as
Home as Abroad. He temper'd his Liberality with Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
Affab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lity with Authority, Modesty with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and Clemency with Justice. By punishing some
few, he terrified many; and by rewarding others, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the Hopes of all. Personal Affronts he easily
pardon'd, but those which struck at the Royal Dignity
he never forgave. The Injuries done to his Subjects he
reveng'd as his own, behaving himself always as a Father
to them. He valu'd his Glory more than his Dominion;
but was neither puft up by Prosperity, nor dejected by
Adversity: In the one he fortify'd himself against the
other; and when Fortune frown'd, he us'd all his Industry
to retrieve her Favour. He made use of Time, not Time
of him; and though he submitted to Necessity, he made
it subservient to his own Advantage. His Conduct
render'd him both belov'd and fear'd of all. He gave
Audience with readiness; Hearing, that he might
know; and asking Questions, for his more certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
He trusted not his Enemies, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
even with his Friends. His Friendship was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>niency;
his Kindred, Reason of State; his Confidence
vigilant; his Diffidence considerate; his Providence,
Assurance; his Jealousy, Circumspection; his Malice,
a Defence; and his Dissimulation, a Refuge. He
deceived none, yet others were deceived by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56556:392"/>
of his Words and Treaties, which he knew how
to manage with so much Artifice (when it was necessary
to baffle Malice with Prudence) as to be able to extricate
himself without violating the Publick Faith. Neither
Falshood dared attack his Majesty, nor Flattery his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
He made his Ministers serviceable to him, without
making them Favourites; and suffer'd himself to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel'd,
not govern'd by them. What he could do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he committed not to others. He took Time for
Consultation, but was very Expeditious in Execution.
In his Resolutions the Effects were seen sooner than the
Causes. He conceal'd his Designs from his Embassadors,
when he desir'd, that being deceiv'd themselves, they
should more effectually persuade others the contrary. He
knew how to rule with his Queen, and obey his Son-in-Law.
He imposed Taxes through Necessity, not out of
Avarice and Luxury; and what he then took from the
Church, he afterwards restor'd, respecting the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Jurisdiction, and maintaining the Regal. He kept no
fixed Court, but, like the Sun, mov'd continually about the
Orbs of his Realms. He manag'd Peace with Moderation
and Integrity, and prosecuted War with Force and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
neither desiring the one, nor refusing the other.
Whatsoever his Foot was fixed on, his Arm and Conduct
join'd in the Defecne thereof, encreasing his Strength by
the Spoils of his Enemies. He did as much by his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations,
as by his Arms, never committing to the Sword,
what he could conquer by Address. he plac'd the Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Grandeur and Pomp in the Bravery of his
Battalions. He was always present, in time of War,
within his Kingdoms. The same Orders which he gave,
he observ'd himself; and made Leagues so as to remain
Arbiter, not subject. He was neither exalted when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;
nor when beaten, dispirited. He Sign'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Peace under the Shield. In a word, He liv'd to
all the World, and dy'd to himself; yet always remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the memory of. Men, as an absolute Pattern for
Princes, and Immortalizing himself in the Desire of his
Subjects.</p>
