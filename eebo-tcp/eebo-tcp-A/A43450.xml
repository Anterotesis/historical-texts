            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have now at laſt been able to comply with your requeſt of making this Diſcourſe publick: I heartily thank you for the good will you entertained it with at firſt, for the ſatisfaction you are pleaſed to ſay you received from it, and for the reſpect and kindneſs to me
<pb facs="tcp:94519:3"/>
(for that I know you intend) in your repeated wiſhes it might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>I am pretty well aſſured of your reſpect to what your own deſires have formed, but I have no great reaſon to be ſo of others; whom therefore I muſt beg to conſider that it was delivered in a plain, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Pulpit-way at firſt; and that as I have not concerned my ſelf to alter it, ſo I could not have done it, without more time, and labour than I was willing to allow to it.</p>
            <p>You muſt be pleaſed to ſtand accountable for it, and for my ſelf I ſhall be no further concerned, than to wiſh it may have that effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, that it hath had upon moſt of you; and I ſhould not wholly deſpair of it, if Men were willing to receive ſatisfaction, as certainly they ought, in a matter of this moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94519:3"/>I pray God Almighty preſerve our excellent Church: open mens Eyes to ſee the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and incline all our Hearts to comply carefully with this, and all other inſtitutions of our great Lord.

            <head>THE CONTENTS.</head>
            <list>
               <label>CHAP. I.</label>
               <item>The firſt thing propoſed in this Diſcourſe, is to give a plain Expoſition of the Words; to which purpoſe it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſider the import of three Expreſſions in them. <hi>pag. 6.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. II.</label>
               <item>Having in the former Chapter cleared the true ſenſe of the words: I proceed in this to the ſecond general that I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to draw ſome general Concluſions from them, which may be proper to be conſidered in the preſent caſe, and to
<pb facs="tcp:94519:5"/>
which I ſhall reduce (as to ſo many heads) what I intend further to ſay in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The Collections that I purpoſe, are three that follow. <hi>pag. 18.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. III.</label>
               <item>I advance to the ſecond Collection that I made in order to the taking off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that men make againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, upon the reaſon of theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the poſſibility and danger of eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to abſtain from the Holy Sacrament upon. <hi>pag. 66.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. IV.</label>
               <item>I begin with the firſt of theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is indeed the foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:94519:5"/>
all the reſt, and which when I have cleared, the reaſonableneſs of the other will eaſily follow: the Argument is this, the Communicating in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a plain, expreſs, neceſſary duty. <hi>pag. 74.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. V.</label>
               <item>The ſecond Conſideration that I named as an Argument for the Truth of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is this, The poſſibility and guilt of doing this ſervice of our Religion is no greater, than of doing others amiſs, which yet we count neceſſary to be done, and our ſelves do keep up the exerciſe of. <hi>pag. 81.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. VI.</label>
               <item>The third Conſideration that I propoſed as an argument for this ſecond Collection is
<pb facs="tcp:94519:6"/>
this, The Puniſhment threatned to eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> is no greater, than what may be feared upon our doing other ſervices of our Religion amiſs, and is threatned thereunto. <hi>pag. 102</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. VII.</label>
               <item>I advance to the fourth Conſideration, which I propoſed for the truth of our preſent Collection, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatever ſin or guilt there is in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily,</hi> there is the ſame, yea there is greater in not eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all. <hi>pag. 124.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. VIII.</label>
               <item>I add a fifth Conſideration to confirm the reaſonableneſs of our ſecond Collection,
<pb facs="tcp:94519:6"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That this danger of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> is cauſed by our own only default, and is what with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent care we may redreſs. <hi>pag. 136.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. IX.</label>
               <item>The third thing propoſed to Conſideration on this head, is this, An ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent endeavour and care (with Gods common Grace) may ſuffice to remove this unworthineſs, and put men out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it. <hi>pag. 155.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. X.</label>
               <item>I go on then to the fourth thing that was propoſed on this head, <hi>viz.</hi> that though men may have been careleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed themſelves for the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one time, yet they ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:94519:7"/>
more careful to prepare themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next, for continual indiſpoſition can excuſe no man; ſo that if ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition be upon a man now, yet care ought to be taken for its removal, that he may be fitted and prepared to Communicate the next time that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls him to it. <hi>pag. 185.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>CHAP. XI.</label>
               <item>We are come to the third and laſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection which was made from this Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That the true and only deſign of the Apoſtle in theſe words, and in this form of ſpeaking, was to engage the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to that reverence and devotion in the Holy Sacrament, that became ſo ſolemn a ſervice of Religion, as that is. I ſhall not need to ſtay long on this Argument, for I deſign but two things only upon it, and a little will ſuffice to diſpatch them both. <hi>pag. 198.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94519:7"/>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi>
               </label>
               <item>And then there is only the ſecond and laſt thing remaining upon our hands. For hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewed that to bring them to devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was his deſign; it will be proper now to ſhew how reaſonably he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that task, and how becoming it is for them, and us, and all that engage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſervice. <hi>pag. 212.</hi>

               <p>THere are few things more commonly inſtanced in the practice of Men, and none of more pernicious and miſchievous conſequence, than the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
as the <hi>Greeks</hi> call it, <hi>i. e.</hi> an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant humor of running out of one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into another.</p>
               <p>I need not ſtay remarking the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that, which is inſtanced in every days experience: nor ſeek for proofs of its bad effects, when we ſee nothing more to debauch the opinions and practices of Men.</p>
               <p>For there being in almoſt all caſes, two extream vices for one real vertue; it is very rare that Men running from the one, ſtop in the intermedial ſtage, or take up, till they come to the utmoſt extremity on the other hand. It's a hard matter to make a ſober Convert, and ſo to bring a Man either to reform one Vice, or quit ſuch a falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and evil Principle; but that he ſhall leap too far, and never think himſelf remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved enough from it, till he ſits down quite in the other extream.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94519:9"/>The Nature of Man is ſullen, or impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and like a reſtive beaſt, either unwilling to ſtir at all, or to run away without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or moderation, and our ſpightful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is watchful and cunning, and knows too well how to impoſe upon us.</p>
               <p>It is indifferent to him, in which extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we fix, ſince he knows both to be equally deſtructive to us; and therefore he not only willingly permits, but ſometimes purpoſely puſheth on a tranſition from one to the other, that he may the more effectually ſecure our deſtruction. Since he not only gratifieth our humor and affectation of novelty and change thereby, but cheats us into an opinion of being Converts, and having quitted our ſins; when alas we have only ſhifted the Scene, but the ſame act is continued ſtill; the ſame evil ſticks cloſe to us, only it appears in another Garb, and is acted in a differing inſtance.</p>
               <p>There are not many inſtances in which all this is more unhappily viſible at this day, than in Mens deportment and carriage towards the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper: from deſpiſing it on one hand, Men come to dread it on the other, and from thinking any preparation almoſt too much, they come to believe that none is enough for it.</p>
               <p>Time was when Chriſtians crowded to this Holy repaſt, as the Doves do to their own windows; and the good Fathers of the Church were imployed in directing them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94519:9"/>
how to come, and not in perſwading them to it: heretofore want of due preparation was the crime, but now neglect and contempt is the great guilt: Men cannot have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their coming unduly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly to the Lords Table; but they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoſe arguments too far, and make them to conclude againſt their coming at all.</p>
               <p>That which S. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed as an argument to reform one Error among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> we have improved into an excuſe of a worſer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves; and what he intended to ſhew the danger of coming amiſs, we make uſe of to fright our ſelves from coming at all.</p>
               <p>Our duty lies in the middle, and both theſe extremities are equally diſtant from it; it is the latter of theſe which is the great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this time, and which this diſcourſe is deſigned to endeavour the cure of; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto to conſider thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. which ſound ſo terribly to ſome men, and which they have improved into ſo great an exception againſt coming to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, <hi>for whoſoever eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which words a great many Men have taken up a ſuperſtitious fear and dread to approach the Table of the Lord, and from thence have fallen into an unchriſtian neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and diſregard of this ſervice, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94519:10"/>
ſome extraordinary guilt would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and ſome mighty danger incurr'd by any little failure in it, above what may be feared or contracted in any of the other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Religion, though they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them ſo well as they ought to do.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe you may hear them argue at this rate. You ſee what a mighty great deal of preparation is neceſſary to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and that upon no leſs a hazard than eternal <hi>damnation:</hi> you hear the Apoſtle ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly, that <hi>whoſoever eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what now would you have us to do? We are very ſenſible of our own infirmity, and know too well how far we ſhall fall ſhort (after all our care) of being <hi>worthy</hi> to ingage in ſuch a ſacred ſervice of Religion, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſo <hi>worthily</hi> as we ought to do; and therefore ſince we know this beforehand, is it not much ſafer to ſit ſtill, than to run ſo great a hazard? chooſe rather not to eat and drink at all, than to damn our ſelves by doing ſo <hi>unworthily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is really the caſe, and theſe are the reaſonings of too many men; the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> frights them from this ſervice; and they chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly to neglect their duty, than to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94519:10"/>
venture ſo great a ſtake upon the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p>This is that error and fault of Men, that I would vindicate theſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from having any influence upon; and I am very confident, whether I can ſucceſsfully do this or not; the Apoſtle was far enough from any ſuch intention or thought in them: his meaning was only to direct to carefulneſs and reverence in doing this duty, and by no means, to diſcourage or fright Men from it.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this deſign, I have propoſed to do theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To give a plain (though ſhort) account of the ſenſe of theſe words.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Draw ſome general deductions from them, which I judge proper to ſatisfie theſe fears of Men, and take off thoſe objections which they make againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, upon the reaſon of them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To make ſome plain practical reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the whole Argument.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt thing propoſed in this Diſcourſe, is to give a plain Expoſition of theſe Words; to which purpoſe it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſider the import of three Expreſſions in them.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHat is the true ſenſe of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What <hi>diſcerning,</hi> or <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body</hi> means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What we are to underſtand by <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and by <hi>eating and drinking damnation,</hi> in this Text.</p>
               <p>By conſidering theſe we may perhaps gain ſomething, towards the underſtanding the true intent and meaning of the Apoſtle in this place, and freeing our minds from thoſe affrightments, which men are fallen into, from their miſtaking of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order to the underſtanding the true meaning of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> it may not be unexpedient, to conſider what the ſignification of the word is in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ſecondly we may better know what there is to determine the ſenſe of it in this place.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94519:11"/>1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we render <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> may perhaps beſt be underſtood, by conſidering what the ſignification and uſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, which it is the oppoſite unto. Now though that do indeed ſignifie <hi>worthy</hi> in the ſtricteſt and moſt rigorous ſenſe of worthy, yet in the New Teſtament it is oftner uſed to ſignifie that which is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>becoming,</hi> or at leaſt as often uſed in this ſenſe as the other.</p>
               <p>Thus (to inſtance in a few places) in <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. bring forth fruits <hi>worthy</hi> of repentance, that is, ſuch as are becoming repentance, or as 'tis rendered <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. <hi>meet</hi> for repentance, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. for I reckon that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent world are not <hi>worthy</hi> to be compared with the glory that ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> they are vaſtly different, there is no correſpondence upon which a compariſon may be made between them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. that you walk <hi>worthy</hi> of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith you are called; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſutably to it, and as becomes thoſe that make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. And ſo in all the places where Chriſtians are exhorted to walk <hi>worthy</hi> of the Lord, <hi>worthy</hi> of God, and <hi>worthy</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; the true ſenſe of all which the ſame Apoſtle expreſſeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. by letting their converſation be as it becometh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus in all the places in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in which Men are either exhorted to endeavor, or declared to be <hi>worthy</hi> of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94519:12"/>
Kingdom of God, and <hi>worthy</hi> of the future glory: you are not to underſtand <hi>worthy</hi> in the utmoſt ſenſe of the word, as it means <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in the ſenſe in which that is now become matter of Controverſie, (for that is againſt the conſtant ſenſe and language of the New Teſtament,) but only as it ſignifies <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> and duly qualified for ſuch glory.</p>
               <p>Juſt as moſt of the Schoolmen, when they come to talk cloſely of <hi>merit,</hi> diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>meritum ex condigno,</hi> and <hi>meritum ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo,</hi> and when they would aſſert mans <hi>merit</hi> before God, make it at laſt to dwindle into <hi>meritum ex congruo, i. e.</hi> no <hi>merit</hi> at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, but only fitneſs and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to receive bleſſing from him: and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I do not know one place where the word is uſed of Man, with reſpect either to God, or future glory, or doing his duty, but it is uſed only in this ſenſe, for <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>fitting,</hi> and ſo as <hi>becomes</hi> him in all theſe reſpects.</p>
               <p>Now according to this ſenſe <hi>unworthy</hi> muſt needs ſignifie <hi>unfit, unmeet,</hi> and <hi>unbecoming;</hi> and accordingly you ſhall find it is uſed in two places in the New Teſtament, which are all the places (I think) beſides <hi>this Cup:</hi> where it is meet with <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. Seeing you judge your ſelves <hi>unworthy</hi> of everlaſting life, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Are ye <hi>unworthy</hi> to judge the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt matters? <hi>i. e.</hi> are you unfit to make peace among the brethren, and to umpire the ſmall differences that happen between them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94519:12"/>This now is the ſignification, and this the uſe commonly of the word in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie unfitly, unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and not always <hi>unworthily</hi> in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of that word.</p>
               <p>But yet this is but the general ſignification of the word, and the particular is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by that particular matter that it is applied unto; ſo that to determine that here in this place, we need only to inquire what that particular <hi>worthineſs</hi> and <hi>becomingneſs</hi> is, which ought to accompany the doing any duty, or ſervice of our Religion; and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking in the Holy Sacrament <hi>unworthily,</hi> will, and muſt needs be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, according to this ſignification of the word.</p>
               <p>Now the great and neceſſary qualification, to render the doing any ſervice of Religion becoming and fit, is great reverence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, out of a juſt ſenſe of the ſacredneſs of that ſervice, and the greatneſs of that God, that it is done unto; and therefore to perform any ſuch ſervice of Religion irreverently, rudely, careleſsly, and profanely, is to do it <hi>unworthily;</hi> and is that very unworthineſs that our Apoſtle intends in this place.</p>
               <p>And that we ought to underſtand it ſo here, I think I may ſafely conclude from theſe two further conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reaſon of the thing, which will not ſuffer us to underſtand <hi>unworthily</hi> in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94519:13"/>
ſtrict and rigorous ſignification of it; for then no man in this preſent lapſed ſtate could avoid eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> after his utmoſt endeavour and care not to do ſo.</p>
               <p>The beſt, and moſt devout Man living, falls ſhort of that worthineſs and perfection in doing this, or any other ſervice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſhould be done with; he fails in many circumſtances of that exactneſs, that ought to grace all religious performances.</p>
               <p>The Lord is great, and cannot <hi>worthily</hi> be praiſed, as our old Tranſlation renders that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> It exceeds the power of Man in this imperfect State, to praiſe the great God in that ſublime manner that he ought to be praiſed: in many things (ſaith S. <hi>James</hi>) we offend all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. and in all (even our beſt things,) it is certain we offend in ſo many circumſtances, that ſhould <hi>God be extream to mark what is done amiſs,</hi> no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the holieſt man living could expect to be accepted by him.</p>
               <p>Who is ſufficient for theſe things? crieth the inſpired S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. and yet he ſpeaks it but of preaching the Goſpel; it were perhaps proper to move the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſervice, and that with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage too. Who is ſufficient or able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it <hi>worthily?</hi> and what Man is he, that can think he diſchargeth it anytime, in every circumſtance ſo as he ought to do? we may ſafely enough anſwer the queſtion, and ſay not one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94519:13"/>So that the very reaſon of the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes us to this ſenſe of the expreſſion; for otherwiſe, no Man living ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, nor could do ſo, without eating and drinking damnation to himſelf; which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſtricteſt urgers of this place (to this purpoſe) do not believe.</p>
               <p>Every Man finds it too true in daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and every good Man puts it into his daily confeſſions, that he doth greatly fail, fall very ſhort of doing this, or any other duty ſo <hi>worthily</hi> as he ought to do, and conſequently doth always eat and drink <hi>unworthily,</hi> if that were the ſignification of that expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing that concludes us to this ſenſe of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> is the expreſſion that the Apoſtle explains it by afterwards in this Text; and we need but let him expound his own meaning, in order to our right underſtanding of it: now that he doth in the laſt clauſe of it, <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body;</hi> this is added by the Apoſtle both as an explanation of the precedent phraſe, <hi>eating and drinking unworthily;</hi> and a reaſon too of that puniſhment that is due to him that doth ſo: <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, doth not diſcern the Lords body,</hi> and he that doth not ſo, <hi>eateth and drinketh dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This expreſſion I ſhall chooſe to explain in the ſecond place, as being indeed the true Key to this Text; and what the import of it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94519:14"/>
is, we may eaſily learn, both from the phraſe, and that particular error and miſcarriage of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which the Apoſtle doth here perſtringe, and which this whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hath a direct regard unto.</p>
               <p>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies not differencing, or diſtinguiſhing the Lords body, and is the word commonly uſed to ſignifie the differencing of meats and other things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; and being applied here to the body of Chriſt in the Holy Sacrament, it ſignifieth plainly the eating and drinking the holy Symbols of it, as common things. The eating that bread, as common bread; and drinking that cup, as common wine; the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no difference between that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that which is holy; the eating the Lords Supper juſt as men do a common Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Meal in their own Houſes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no difference in our reſpects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to the one, more than to the other.</p>
               <p>For it is plain (and I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to ſhew it fully) this was the great miſcarriage and fault of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo ſharply taxeth in this place: they did eat the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Love-feaſts diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and in great confuſion, yea to exceſs and drunkenneſs; and the Holy Sacrament which they are in the cloſe thereof, they are irreverently, and without any due ſenſe of the ſacredneſs of it; juſt as they ate at home in their own houſes, without any ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94519:14"/>
or myſtery in it, and without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any difference between that, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon morſel of bread, or cup of wine.</p>
               <p>This is the particular ſenſe of eating and drinking unworthily in this place, and by this Key we may come to the true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; and though perhaps we may extend it further, and make it to comprehend ſome other failures beſide this, yet we do it but by Analogy and proportion, in which we may poſſibly be miſtaken, and in which our own reaſonings may fail us; but whether they do or not, nothing but this is that <hi>eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> which the Apoſtle means in this place. So that although thoſe other things may poſſibly cauſe Men to eat and drink unworthily in ſome ſenſe, yet not to do ſo in the ſenſe of this Text; and therefore Men ſhould be infinitely careful, how they apply this to other things than what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did, or aſſert the ſame guilt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be incurred equally in one as well as the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The naming of which, brings me to the third and laſt expreſſion that needs to be explained, in his <hi>eating and drinking damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf;</hi> in doing which I ſhall but need to conſider what the ſtrict and particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of damnation is in this place; for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being of a general and indefinite ſignification, and being uſed to expreſs any judgment whatſoever, muſt be fixed only by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94519:15"/>
the circumſtances of the place; and by that we ſhall beſt underſtand what it doth ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to.</p>
               <p>I do not deny, but the word is ſometimes uſed to ſignifie what we commonly reſtrain it to; <hi>i. e.</hi> that eternal <hi>damnation</hi> in hell that is prepared for the impenitent, and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and thoſe other appellatives of vice which the Scripture deſcribes, ſuch as <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers, Extortioners and Covetous, Drunkards, Murtherers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is ſometimes uſed in that ſenſe, therefore to underſtand it always ſo wherever we meet it, is a great miſtake, and ſometimes of very ill conſequence. I could ſhew this in ſome other inſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that under preſent conſideration, were not the truth too viſible in this alone. For by this means Men have been frighted from the Holy Sacrament, and (as I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſate down in a total diſregard and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it; chuſing rather, and thinking it the ſafer ſide of the queſtion, not to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at all, than to run an apparent hazard of <hi>damnation</hi> by doing ſo.</p>
               <p>And I muſt confeſs were this really the caſe, they would have at leaſt ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a reaſon to plead for themſelves; and would almoſt ſtand upon the ſame ground with us, and have the ſame argument againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, which we uſe to perſwade them to the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94519:15"/>The higheſt Argument that we have to this purpoſe, is that it is a plain duty, relying upon the expreſs command of our dying Lord, which wilfully to tranſgreſs muſt moſt certainly be a damning ſin.</p>
               <p>Now the ſame would theſe Men have to plead againſt it, were this the ſenſe of <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in this place; and ſo would run no greater a hazard in not receiving it at all, than they do in receiving it unworthily and amiſs; they muſt be damned in receiving it unworthily, and they can be no more, in not receiving it at all.</p>
               <p>This I call a groſs miſunderſtanding the ſenſe of <hi>damnation</hi> in this place; for whatever it may ſignifie in other places, it is plain it doth not ſignifie ſo in this: And this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we conſider what the puniſhments are, which were inflicted for this ſin, which the Apoſtle inſtanceth in the following verſe, <hi>for this cauſe many are weak, and ſickly among you, and many ſleep:</hi> i. e. This groſs irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of yours towards the Symbols of his own Son's body and blood, hath provoked God to puniſh you with many ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, and ſome among you have been cut off, and have died by them.</p>
               <p>In all which there is not one word of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>damnation,</hi> nor any mention made, but of temporary, of external, or corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only; nor is there any neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the danger of damnation from theſe:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94519:16"/>
for Men may be puniſhed in this world, and ſpared, and pardoned in the next, and it is not only poſſible, but common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Eternal damnation is the final exciſion, and laſt wrathful deſtruction of wicked Men; it is the laſt unmixed cup of Gods vengeance in which there is no allay of mercy, not one grain of favour mixed with it; but ſuch Judgments as theſe here are far from being ſo: they are always medicinal, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to correct and amend former faults; and to prevent the laſt and final deſtruction. They are intended for the ſalvation of Men, and do not always ſo much as preface to their damnation. Yea when they proceed ſo far as to cut off Mens lives, they may be only correcting, and puniſhing of them here, that they may be finally ſpared hereafter.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Apoſtle plainly tells theſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent <hi>Corinthians</hi> that theſe puniſhments were, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world,</hi> i. e. God inflicts theſe judgments upon you, to bring you to a ſenſe of the ſin that cauſed them, and to learn you to reform, and abſtain from thoſe things, whoſe conſequences you have found to be ſo bitter: they are ſo far from intending your eternal damnation, that they are purpoſely deſigned to prevent it. They are the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal chaſtenings of your good Father, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94519:16"/>
are inflicted indeed for this your great fault, but intended as expiations rather of the guilt, than eternal puniſhments for it.</p>
               <p>This now I think is the plain, true expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this place, which I have therefore given in the firſt place; becauſe it may be of good uſe to take off ſomething of the terror that ſeems at firſt ſight to be in it, and to let Men ſee, that theſe words rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the purpoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in uſing them, are not ſo frightful, as at firſt perhaps they might apprehend them to be, and may ſerve therefore in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that, to take off ſomething of that fear, and dread of coming to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which their minds may have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon the reaſon of them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Having in the former Chapter cleared the true ſenſe of theſe words: I proceed in this to the ſecond general that I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to draw ſome general Concluſions from them, which may be proper to be conſidered in the preſent caſe, and to which I ſhall reduce (as to ſo many heads) what I intend further to ſay in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; the Collections that I purpoſe, are theſe three that follow.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. That eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in the ſenſe of this place, is a thing hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be committed by Chriſtians in this age.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſuppoſed danger of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> is not a ſufficient reaſon for Men to abſtain from the Holy Sacrament upon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true purpoſe of this place is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men from irreverence and rudeneſs in eating and drinking in the Holy Sacrament, and ingage them to that devotion and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that becomes them that do diſcern the Lords body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94519:17"/>Theſe are three material Collections, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be conſidered by all ſcrupulous perſons in this caſe; and therefore I ſhall endeavour to the utmoſt of my power and skill, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe them with that plainneſs and evidence that they require and deſerve.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt, eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in the ſenſe of this Text, is hardly to be committed by Chriſtians in this age.</p>
               <p>In order to the clearing the truth of this Collection, it will concern me to do theſe following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew what this eating and drinking <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily</hi> was, and wherein this ſin of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> did conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Circumſtances that all Chriſtians now are in, which ſet them almoſt above the poſſibility of being guilty of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall inquire what can be counted eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking unworthily in proportion to this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And conſider in the laſt place, whether theſe alſo be not almoſt incompetent to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, eſpecially to any that are concerned in our preſent caſe.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>IN order to my diſcharging the firſt thing undertaken, I ſhall need but to repeat a little of what I ſaid in the explication of this Text, and this phraſe in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94519:18"/>Not diſcerning the Lords body is certainly the Key to the meaning of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, and by conſidering the one, we may come to the underſtanding of the other; and by examining how the caſe ſtood with theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> we may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both.</p>
                  <p>By their not diſcerning the Lords body, the Apoſtle means their not conſidering that this was an immediate ſervice of Religion; and that the morſel of bread which they did eat, and glaſs of wine that they did drink were Sacramentally the very body and blood of Chriſt; they put no difference between theſe ſacred Symbolls of our Lords body and blood, and common food and drink; nor ſhewed greater reverence in eating and drinking the one, than doing ſo to the other; they ate in Gods Houſe juſt as they did in their own, and made no diſtinction between this and a common meal.</p>
                  <p>Yea (and which is ſomething worſe yet) they did this not only thus irreverently, but in intemperance, and downright drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for ſo he tells them <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>One is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and another is drunk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How this monſtrous diſorder happen'd among them, hath been hinted already; and may more fully now by giving a ſhort account of the ancient practice of the Church in this matter. Now that briefly ſtood thus, the Holy Sacrament was uſually prefaced unto by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94519:18"/>
a publick feaſt of Charity, which is called in antiquity <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a Love-Feaſt, to which you have frequent reference in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to this Feaſt every one contributed, and brought ſome portion, according to his ability, of which all feaſted lovingly together; reſerving ſome portion for the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they always celebrated in the cloſe of this Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Now this grand profanation of this Holy Service happen'd thus: inſtead of feeding lovingly all together of what was thus brought by all, each one fed ſingly upon his own por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which it came to paſs, not only that the poor had little or nothing to eat, but the rich had too much, which brought them to exceſs, and even to plain drunkenneſs: <hi>one is hungry and another drunk,</hi> in which ſad condition approaching to the Table of the Lord, they were very unfit to conſider the ſacredneſs of it, and very unlike to pay that reverence that was due to it.</p>
                  <p>That both theſe things contributed to their not diſcerning the Lords body, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, we may fully ſatisfie our ſelves, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Apoſtles dealing with them, in the latter part of this Chapter, where he falls upon this Argument.</p>
                  <p>For becauſe they were ſo groſly ignorant in the reaſon and deſign of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he explains that fully to them, from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94519:19"/>
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 22d. <hi>to the</hi> 27th. acquainting them with the Author, reaſon and purpoſe of this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; that it was an immediate ſervice of Religion, inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf juſt before his ſuffering, and inſtituted to no meaner a purpoſe, than to be a ſolemn rite of commemorating his death, which ſhould be uſed in his Church till his coming again to judgment. <hi>For I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you: this do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe through their ſcandalous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance preceding, they ſo horribly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned this ſervice; therefore he ſhews them both the ſin, and great danger of it, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to a ſerious care to reform it: as you may ſee in the 27, 28, 29, <hi>and</hi> 30th. <hi>Verſes. Wherefore, whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of that cup. For he this eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94519:19"/>
damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body. For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep. For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> In which words it is plain he refers to this ſcandalous abuſe of theirs, aggravating both the guilt and danger of it, in words as high and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as could well be thought on; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might bring them to a dread of it, and to the uſe of thoſe means which he preſcribes in order to the reforming of it.</p>
                  <p>This (in ſhort) was the eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> that the Apoſtle ſo ſharply taxeth, and God had ſo ſeverely puniſhed theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> for; and when we conſider ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the horrible groſsneſs of it, I believe we ſhall ſubſcribe to the equity and reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both: this was ſo extreamly foul and groſs a profanation of the Holy Sacrament, that we cannot wonder either at the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the reproof, or ſharpneſs of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: it was ſuch a crime, as was ſcarce ever heard of in a Chriſtian Church, and at the very name of which (I am perſwaded) a Chriſtian heart cannot but tremble: if dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the moſt dreadful ſenſe of the word had been threatned, or had been inflicted up on this ſin, it had been no wonder.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94519:20"/>
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. LET us therefore enquire whether any Chriſtian now needs much to fear, or can well be guilty of the like, and we ſhall ſoon find, that they are almoſt above the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For firſt theſe preceding Love-Feaſts are now aboliſhed, and wholly diſuſed, and have been ſo for many Centuries of years: for theſe Feaſts not only giving ſome colour of a reaſon to the Heathens to traduce the Chriſtians upon, as if they indulg'd to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſenſuality and uncleanneſs in them, as they very well knew themſelves did in their <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> and ſome other Feaſts, but alſo giving too much occaſion to exorbitancy and diſorder among themſelves; and coming in a little time to be abuſed indeed to ſome ill purpoſes, were by publick Order and Canon of the Church prohibited, and wholly laid down, and continue ſo to this day.</p>
                  <p>So that to us there is no ſuch poſſibility of this diſorder and exceſs, becauſe we are out of the reach of that, which was temptation and occaſion of it in them; and that cuſtom and practice is wholly antiquated, and laid aſide among us, which betrayed them into it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſecondly the time of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Holy Sacrament with us, is wholly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94519:20"/>
changed from what it was of old for the ſame reaſon: it was then not only called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, but indeed was ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> in imitation of our Lords practice it was celebrated at Supper time; though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but by the by note, that to me it ſeems plain, it was celebrated <hi>antelucano tempore,</hi> during thoſe hot and raging perſecutions in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time; when the Chriſtians were glad to meet early before day to perform the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their Religion, for fear of diſcovery by their perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>But however that were, it is certain that generally it was obſerved in the Evening, at Supper time; a time which was really more inconvenient in this reſpect, and when men were in more danger of not obſerving it with that reverence and devotion, that became both it, and themſelves too: and that for theſe two plain reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that at night Mens minds and thoughts are commonly more looſened, and far from that ſeriouſneſs and conſiſtency, that they are uſually in a morning. Mark it, and you will commonly find a great difference between a Mans morning and evening devotions: in a morning our thoughts generally are both more clear and united; but by that time the hurries of the day are over, they are more puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and diſordered with the buſineſs that hath employed them; ſo that they cannot ſo eaſily recollect themſelves, and fix upon God and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94519:21"/>
Religion again: upon which reaſon it is thought by ſome Divines, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compared his early devotions to incenſe, but thoſe of the evening to the lifting up of his hands, or to the common ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>So that in this we have greatly the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them, and the wiſdom of the Church hath thought fit upon this reaſon to change the time for the obſervation of it long ago; we receive it now in the morning, and that upon Sundays and Holydays too. <hi>i. e.</hi> both when our thoughts are more active and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and when we are out of all temptation from other buſineſs, and before we can well have diſordered our ſelves with any.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another advantage on our ſide lieth in this, that in the morning we are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally freſh, and free from any ſteams of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and from any temptations to it, which in the progreſs of the day men too often meet with, and by too eaſie compliances with, are too often ruffled and diſordered by before evening.</p>
                  <p>Men are generally ſober in a morning, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought Men could not be drunk at the third hour of the day, <hi>i. e.</hi> (according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> way of dividing the day) at nine in the morning; and though perhaps in this degenerate age and place, ſome exceptions might be produced againſt the Apoſtles rule; yet it is not ordinarily and commonly ſo: Men are neither in ſuch danger of being over
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94519:21"/>
taken, nor ſo commonly ſo in a morning, as (God knows) they too commonly are ſeen to be at night: ſo that upon this reaſon alſo we have ſomething the advantage of them in this reſpect, and cannot well come drunk to the Lords Table, unleſs we be beaſts, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of intemperance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet there is a third inſtance, in which the Chriſtian Church hath taken care to ſecure us in this inſtance. And that is its injoyning us to receive the Holy Sacrament faſting. For this there are ſeveral Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Canons of the Church producible, by which certainly it hath taken the utmoſt, and moſt effectual care poſſible for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſuch profanation of this Holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>For becauſe that the cuſtom of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in the evening continued longer in ſome Churches than in others; though they could not break that cuſtom, yet by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution they thought they provided ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently againſt all poſſibility of this profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and indeed ſo they did, for it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to come drunk to the Holy Sacrament in the evening, who had faſted all the day preceding: this conſtitution would either certainly change the time of the Holy Communion, or it would ſecure it againſt this profanation, or rather (as we ſee it hath done already) it would ſecure both purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94519:22"/>This Cuſtom hath now generally obtained in this, as well as all other Churches. Men generally receive the Holy Sacrament faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I believe few do otherwiſe, unleſs it be out of ſome neceſſary reſpect to health, or ſome preſent infirmity; in which the Church doth, and always did allow a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, well knowing that God <hi>requireth mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To theſe we may add in the fourth place, that high reſpect and veneration, that Men generally have, and have long been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and taught to have for the Holy Sacrament, even above any other ſervice and miniſtry of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, inſtead of profaning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by our Common and irreverent carriage at it, we have run on the other hand into a ſuperſtitious fear and dread that keeps us from it; and I believe there is not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a whole age producible of a Mans being drunk at the Lords Table.</p>
                  <p>The worſt of Men, the worſt profligate and debauched will lay ſome reſtraint upon themſelves, both before, and after the Holy Comunion, and we may commonly ſee that they do ſo. Men have generally more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Religion, than to go drunk to Church, or dare to appear before God, when they are ſo unfit to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>And yet even theſe Men have a higher ſenſe of, and a greater veneration for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94519:22"/>
Sacrament, than other ſervices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a mightier horror and dread of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſly, and without reſpect unto it. Yea the very ſame men that dare ſo irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and regardleſly attend other Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, yet are ſeen to be very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and devout in this. They that can ſit at prayers, as if God were rather petitioning and praying to them, than they to him. They that can lay themſelves down to ſleep at a Sermon, and perhaps ſooner fall into ſleep on a hard bench there, than the ſofteſt down in their own houſes: they (in a word) that can behave themſelves in Gods houſe, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reverence and ſhew of devotion, as they do in a Warehouſe or a Stable: yet when they approach the Table of the Lord, ſeem generally very reverent and devout, and I hope really are ſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is yet a fifth thing that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently be obſerved, as of effect to ſecure Men againſt this profanation of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and that is their having been ſo long taught what a mighty deal of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary to it, and having been ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed with the great danger of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating unworthily in it.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the current Doctrin, and the common way of dealing with Men, for ſome ages. The great buſineſs of the good Fathers was not to perſwade Men to come to the Holy Sacrament, for that they always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94519:23"/>
their neceſſary duty, and till this laſt age, none ever counted to paſs for Chriſtians that neglected it; and therefore their buſineſs was only to direct the zeal and devotion of Chriſtians in this inſtance, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it, to direct and inſtruct Men how to come acceptably and as they ought, and not to argue with them about the duty of coming: and therefore there is ſo much met with in their writings about the neceſſity and way of due preparation, and ſo little about the obligation to come: many books written to inſtruct Men in the methods of due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but there was no neceſſity of inſiſting upon that, which is our chief task and buſineſs at preſent.</p>
                  <p>For in the latter part of this feculent, and almoſt worſt of ages, Men have run their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and doctrins into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; preſſed ſo much the neceſſity of an extraordinary preparation, and aggravated ſo mightily the danger of receiving <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi> that Men are frighted from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather than invited to it; and have thought it (as I ſaid before) ſafer to keep wholly from it, than to run ſo great a hazard in the obſervation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (we find) ſtick faſt in Mens minds yet, and it is a hard thing to diſpoſſeſs them of that ſuperſtitious fear, that theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines have ſtruck them with: Men are now in more danger to run into the contrary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94519:23"/>
extreme, than to fall into this; in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſtay wholly from the Holy Sacrament upon this dread of it, than to run to it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly; and without any due regard of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe reaſons it may (I think) ſafely be ſaid, that Chriſtians now are in little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this ſin; and almoſt out of a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> in the ſenſe of this Text, and which the Apoſtle taxeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for.</p>

                  <p>HAving proceeded ſo far upon the ſtrict ſenſe of this place, and the direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Apoſtle in it: I go on to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſcruple, and a very important inquiry, very fit to be conſidered and reſolved. And that is, whether nothing be eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily</hi> beſides this? doth a Man never eat and drink <hi>unworthily,</hi> but when he comes drunk to the Lords Table? doth not this open a gate to very great looſeneſs and careleſneſs, and make communicating <hi>worthily</hi> a very light and eaſie thing? to what purpoſe needed the good Fathers of the Church, to have taken ſo much pains to direct Men how to fit and prepare themſelves for this ſervice? and have preſſed the obſervance of thoſe preſcriptions with ſo much earneſtneſs, as they did, if this where the only inſtance in which Men could eat and drink <hi>unworthily?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94519:24"/>This I call a very conſiderable inquiry, and therefore I ſhall endeavour to give it as plain and full ſatisfaction, as I am able. It ſeems to conſiſt of ſeveral parts, to all which I ſhall endeavour to ſuit proper anſwers in theſe following propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whatever Men may ſay or think in this matter, this only is that eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> that the Apoſtle means in this place, and to which he threatens this puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>This I have cleared already, and need not ſtand repeating it again: not <hi>conſidering the Lords Body,</hi> but eating the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a common meal, being as regardleſs and intemperate at the Lords Table, as Men commonly are at their own, was that ſin of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which the Apoſtle here taxeth, and which he calls <hi>eating &amp; drinking unworthily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if Men would conſider this, it would be one good ſtep towards their ſatisfaction in this caſe, and of good uſe towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their fear of eating unworthily. For why ſhould men fear incurring the ſame guilt, unleſs they committed the ſame ſin? and while they are very ſure they ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the one, why ſhould they diſcourage, and afflict themſelves with fears of the other?</p>
                  <p>It is neither ſafe nor fair dealing to apply paſſages of Scripture beyond their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intendment: and few things have done more harm in Divinity than this. As we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſtabliſh, or prove the truth of doctrines
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94519:24"/>
from the bare chiming of words; or becauſe ſome ſayings may be found in Scripture, that ſeem to found to our ſenſe and purpoſe; no more ought we haſtily to extend reproofs, and threatnings beyond their own proper matter.</p>
                  <p>As for example, to make this clear in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel caſe. Every failure of a Clergy-man in the diſcharge of his publick duty, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be thought to be <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s offering of ſtrange fire, nor is preſently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like miraculous puniſhment from heaven. No more ought we to conclude, that every failure in eating and drinking the Holy Sacrament, is preſently that eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily</hi> that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of: or that every Chriſtian is therefore liable to the ſame <hi>damnation,</hi> that we think they were threatned withal.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not <hi>diſcern the Lords body,</hi> made no difference between the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a common meal: came drunk to the Lords Table, and in a condition that made them utterly unable to pay any reſpect or reverence to the Symbols of their Lords body and blood, and therefore were ſharply threatned, and puniſhed too: but what is all this to thee, that even trembleſt at the thoughts of ſuch horrible profaneſs? why needſt thou diſcourage and fright thy ſelf from coming to the Holy Sacrament with fear of the ſame guilt and puniſhment, when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94519:25"/>
thou art very ſure, thou ſhall not commit the ſame ſin? and (let me add) when if thou haſt the leaſt ſenſe of Religion in thee, and doſt in any meaſure diſcern the Lords body, thou canſt not commit it.</p>
                  <p>But now ſome Men may yet reply, what did this paſſage ſo ſolely concern the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that it reſpects none elſe? is there no uſe that we may make of it? nor any inſtruction to our ſelves that we may improve it into?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, why yes we may, and there is ſcarce any other ſuch paſſage in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but we may improve ſo too: and there are two very uſeful improvements that we may make of this to our own advantage.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is to ingage our utmoſt care and caution againſt the ſame ſin: and this is the prime, principal, and moſt proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, to take heed that we do not ſin after the ſimilitude of tranſgreſſion that they did.</p>
                  <p>This the Apoſtle tells us in a like caſe; the threatenings of puniſhments, that fell upon the <hi>Jews</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. were our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and intended as admonitions to us, that we ſhould not luſt, and become Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and murmurers as they were. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. and 10. and it ought to be juſt ſo here alſo: the threatnings and puniſhments of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> for their groſs and ſcandalous profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Holy Sacrament, ought to caution us againſt the like irreverence. But I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94519:25"/>
do not underſtand any good reaſon, why we ſhould afflict our ſelves with apprehenſions, and fears of the ſame puniſhment, while (thanks be to God) we are far enough from the ſame ſin, any more than there is reaſon for thoſe men preſently to expect the Plague, the exterminating Angel, the fiery Serpents that deſtroyed the Idolatrous and Luſtful <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> who were never guilty of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, or idolatry like theirs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But we may go further yet in our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of this, and ſuch paſſages in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ingage our care not only againſt the ſame ſin, but any thing that looks like it, or comes near it.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſafe coming within the reach of a danger, nor approaching ſo near as the Verge of a ſin, if a man can help it: a wiſe man will not only beware of the ſame ſin, that he ſees ſo ſharply threatned and puniſhed, but even of any that looks like it. And as every Clergy-man that miniſters before the Lord, may by the ſin and puniſhment of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> learn to be very careful in the diſcharge of his ſacred function: So every Chriſtian by conſidering the ſin of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and what befell them for it, may learn how greatly it concerns him, to be devout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent at the Lords table, and to take heed of every thing that looks like a profanation of that Sacred Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94519:26"/>But as I do not know any reaſon, why he ſhould think every little failure of his, to be the ſame unworthy eating and drinking that they were guilty of, no more do I know any cauſe, why he ſhould preſently dread the ſame puniſhment, that was inflicted upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I advance a ſecond propoſition in further anſwer to this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That although this be the only true notion of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in this Text; yet it is poſſible that Men may fix that notion upon other things, by the rule of Analogy and proportion. I mean there may perhaps be ſome other things that may cauſe a Man to eat and drink <hi>unworthily</hi> in ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did. So that I am far from ſaying that no man needs fear eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> but he that is drunk at the Lords Table. There may poſſibly be other things to bring a man within that guilt, as well as that; and this is as much (I think) as can be required in this objection. But then I ſay withal theſe two things, which I would have always conſidered as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this conceſſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whatever thoſe things are, that men think to bring within the compaſs of this guilt, they do it but reductively, and (as I ſaid) but only by analogy and proportion. Thoſe ſins whatever they be, are not primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended in this place, but brought in only
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94519:26"/>
by our own arts of deduction, and reaſoning, in which we may poſſibly be miſtaken, and which are far from being ſo certain, as the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle is. So that if men will needs bring in other things within the compaſs of this guilt, and within the reach of this puniſhment, beſides what the Apoſtle intends and ſpeaks of; they ought to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely careful, and very ſure that the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy will hold, and that their own deductions be rational and certain. This is abſolutely neceſſary in all arguments that proceed upon proportion: the caſes and circumſtances muſt exactly correſpond, or elſe the argument will not only be weak, but trifling too.</p>
                  <p>And when we conſider how uncertain the moſt confident mens reaſonings commonly are, and how very ſubject they are to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in them, it will be a hard matter to know certainly when their inferences may be depended upon, and when not. So that men have great need to be very careful in their diſcourſes of this matter, what they do determine to be eating and drinking <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily</hi> beſides what the Apoſtle meant: for though they may ſeem to themſelves (and perhaps others too) to have the ſafer ſide of the queſtion, and to purſue a deſign which may ſeem the better of the two, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a mighty reverence to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, above what the other doctrin ſeems to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94519:27"/>Yet they may be ſo far miſtaken, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to occaſion a greater miſchief, and while they go unwarily to ingage men to come with that exactneſs of preparation and care, that they would have them to come with; they may poſſibly fright them from coming at all; and (to deal freely and plainly) I do not know a more likely way to do this by, than by being too free in ſuch inferences, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the notion of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> and extending it to things, which it is certain the Apoſtle never meant.</p>
                  <p>I am very much miſtaken, if this be the ſafer ſide of the queſtion. I think it much better that a man retain ſome ſenſe of his duty, and take ſome competent care to do it; though it be but imperfectly, and far from that exactneſs that it ought to be done with; than that he wholly neglect it, and live as if we were unconcerned in it: and for my own part, I would much rather bring men to do their duty, and ſet about it as well as they can; than by any doctrin of mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to ſit down in a careleſs neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and diſregard of it. I would much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encourage men to their duty, than fright them from it: and therefore as I will not be very forward to make any thing eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> which I have reaſon to believe the Apoſtle did not intend: ſo I will not be haſty in agreeing with them that do, unleſs I be very well ſatisfied that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94519:27"/>
is true, and that the circumſtances in both caſes be the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing that I would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here is this, that nothing can be eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in analogy to what the Apoſtle means here, but that which argueth or infers as great an irreverence to this ſervice, and as groſs a profanation of it, as this of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made them guilty of.</p>
                  <p>Their eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this, and therefore if men make any thing elſe to be eating and drinking <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily</hi> like them, they muſt prove the ſame, or as great irreverence and profanation to be in it. If they can find any other thing, which equally hinders men from <hi>diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> or yielding any more reſpect to the ſacred Symbols of it, than the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, then I will yield that that may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come within the guilt of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> that the Apoſtle here refers to.</p>
                  <p>This is that Key that lets us into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles meaning in this Text, and opens to us his ſenſe of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily:</hi> and therefore if men will uſe it to any other things, they muſt ſee that the wards exactly agree, or elſe it will do no more ſervice to them in this cauſe, than a common Key will do towards the opening a Lock, which it never was fitted for. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> did eat and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94519:28"/>
drink <hi>unworthily</hi> becauſe they did not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the Lords body,</hi> and therefore thoſe that do eat and drink <hi>unworthily</hi> like them, muſt as little <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi> as they did. This is the rule that we muſt proceed by in this caſe; if we will conclude rightly concerning any other thing, it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſets men as far from diſcerning the Lords body, and renders them as unfit or unable to ſhew any becoming reſpect to it, as this diſorder of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did them; otherwiſe it is not eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily in proportion to them: in this the Analogy muſt truly hold, or elſe all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions will miſerably fail.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>HItherto we have been ſmoothing the way, and ſo far (I dare ſay) we have gone upon ſure ground, but now we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to a more uncertain and ſlippery path, and to that in which the difficulty pincheth moſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that is the third thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to inquire what can according to this rule of proportion be admitted to be eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> did: what it is that can hinder us from <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning the Lords body,</hi> and paying that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect to it in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that men ought to pay; as that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94519:28"/>
and intemperance of theſe perſons did them. This is the main queſtion, and the reſolution of it will ſet us pretty well to rights in this difficulty.</p>
                  <p>There are but two things, that (after my beſt conſidering of this queſtion) I dare pitch upon, to bring into any compariſon, with this unworthineſs of the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> and they are theſe, groſs ignorance and wilful reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved impenitence. I name theſe two, becauſe I think I can make the correſpondence to hold, and I name no more, becauſe I cannot ſee that Analogy to hold in any others. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reaſon of one of theſe men cannot, and upon the other they will not <hi>diſcern the Lords body;</hi> and therefore in both caſes are as far from any due reſpect and reverence to it, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were. I ſhall conſider them diſtinctly, and examin them upon this reaſon, of not <hi>diſcerning the Lords body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Groſs ignorance, I mean it in the great principles of Chriſtian Religion, eſpecially in that great myſtery of our redemption by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; when men underſtand little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſts coming into the world, or of the reaſons of it, or that bitter ſuffering and death that he underwent for us. When they know not, what the reaſon of this inſtitution was, or what our Lord would have ſignified in it.</p>
                  <p>If any adult Chriſtian be thus groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and being ſo, communicate in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94519:29"/>
I do not know how to excuſe him from eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did: for it is plain, in this caſe he cannot diſcern the Lords body. He will look upon the Elements, but as common Bread and Wine: he will not conſider that they are the Symbols of Chriſts body and blood, and that the breaking of the one is to ſignifie the breaking of Chriſts body on the Croſs; and the pouring out of the other, the ſhedding of his blood for our redemption, and that our communicating in theſe is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in the bleſſed effects and benefits of both. He doth not know that by this ſolemn rite of Religion, he is to commemorate with gratitude, and tranſport, the amazing love of his dying Lord, and that in this he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thoſe communications of divine grace, that ſhall ſtrengthen and refreſh his ſoul, as really and truly, as his body is by the Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>And being thus profoundly ignorant in theſe things, ſuch a man will eat that morſel of Bread, and drink that Wine, but juſt as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> and their fellow <hi>Grecians</hi> uſed to do the like in the end of their feaſts, as a Concluding Morſel, and as a Grace Cup, in token of that love which was amongſt the ghoſts, for ſo they uſed always to end theſe their conventions. And juſt like them he will be far enough from apprehending any thing of Religion and Myſtery to be in it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94519:29"/>
to that, far enough from that devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence that becomes every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant in this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon why converts in the ancient times of the Church were uſually kept in the rank of Catechumens for ſome time, and competently inſtructed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion, before they were admitted to full Communion, and to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and this is the method that the Church of <hi>England</hi> proceeds in to this day to have all baptized perſons Catechiſed, and competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in their Religion, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Confirmed, before ſhe admit them to the Lords Table. And (by the way) I would to God, that this were ſo carefully kept up and practiſed, as it ſhould be, and then we ſhould have but little reaſon to fear any mens ſuch groſs ignorance, or communicating unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily upon the reaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other thing that we may allow to be the cauſe of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily</hi> in proportion to this of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved wilful impenitence.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe it is as plain the Analogy doth hold, or indeed exceed rather: and the <hi>not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body</hi> is alike in both caſes; a reſolute impenitent wretch doth as little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lords body, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, and (beſides that) doth deſpight to it; inſtead of <hi>ſhewing forth the Lords death,</hi> he comes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it; inſtead of commemorating the love
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94519:30"/>
and bleſſing of it with joy and tranſport, he comes to put a ſcorn and affront upon it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reflecting upon it with ſorrow and ſhame for the ſins that cauſed it, he comes to repeat it, and to juſtifie all the barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities of it: inſtead of improving it into an argument of repentance and reformation, he comes to deride it, to inſult over it, and reſolved to continue in his ſins, in plain defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſpight of it.</p>
                  <p>This in the Language of the Apoſtle is called <hi>Crucifying afreſh the Lord of glory, and putting him again to the ſame open ſhame; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling under foot the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was redeemed, and ſhould have been ſanctified.</hi> Heb. 10.29. And truly is in effect, a ſeconding all the malice and ſpight of the <hi>Jews,</hi> avowing the treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> juſtifying the Sentence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the barbarous and remorſeleſs cruelty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers: yea, and let me ſay, is in him that profeſſeth Chriſtianity really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and outdoing them all.</p>
                  <p>The guilt of moſt of the orher is capable of ſome extenuation, either ignorance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or intereſt: but what ſhall excuſe ſuch a mans guilt? or can be pleaded in extenuation of it? who hath been baptized into the faith of Chriſt, and ſolemnly vow'd love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, as his Saviour and Lord, and yet wilfully outdoeth the greateſt indignities and affronts, that his moſt treacherous ſervant,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94519:30"/>
or moſt implacable enemies could offer to him?</p>
                  <p>This was one great reaſon, why the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church in her primitive times of purity was ſo very ſtrict and ſharp. Why ſhe was ſo quick to obſerve, and as careful to puniſh all notorious and profligate offenders, by ſuſpending them from all Communion with her, and not admitting them to this higheſt act of it, 'till they had given full teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their repentance, and ſound amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; well knowing how unfit ſuch perſons are to communicate in ſuch ſacred and divine myſteries, beſides a great deal of other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that they do. And were this diſcipline preſerved, and duly exerciſed, as the <hi>Church of England</hi> requires, and deſires it ſhould: there would be none to incur this horrible guilt, or be guilty of this lamentable profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the honour of the Holy Sacrament would be ſecured, and this high profanation of it be effectually prevented, and provided againſt.</p>

                  <p>ANd if we conſider things well, we ſhall find that things are not ſo bad among us, but that both theſe inſtances upon which men may Communicate <hi>unworthily,</hi> are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well provided againſt: or however that they are not committable by any Chriſtians
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94519:31"/>
that offer themſelves to the Holy Sacrament, or have any fears upon them of coming <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily</hi> to it; let us conſider how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſtand in relation to both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt as to this groſs and ſcandalous ignorance, how much ſoever ſome men have made it their buſineſs, to cry out againſt, and taken liberty to traduce the members of our Church as a company of blind and ignorant creatures; thinking that there could be light no where, but where themſelves ſhined, and that nothing but darkneſs and ignorance muſt ſucceed, when ſuch lights as themſelves were removed, and their inſtruction of the people ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>Yet thanks be to God, care is taken that people be competently inſtructed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion, and I hope much better than they have been; the generality of the members of our Church I believe do competently underſtand their Religion, and any one is impardonable that doth not. I am ſure inſtruction and knowledge is not hid from them, but they have both in as plentiful a meaſure, as it may be the Church hath ever injoyed. It is not eaſie for them to remain ignorant under ſuch advantages and means of knowledge as they enjoy, and if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their minds to them (as the Church begs them to do) they cannot do ſo.</p>
                  <p>I would not be afraid to have the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon made between the members of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94519:31"/>
                     <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the proſelites to any of the various ſects among us; if the tryal were made, it would be found who are the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: who trulieſt underſtand what Chriſtian Religion means, notwithſtanding they may be undervalued, and reproached by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, conceited and ſupercilious oppoſers. If I may be allowed to ſpeak my obſervation; I would ſay, that of all the people that I ever converſed yet with, ſome that think ſo highly of themſelves, have I found to be moſt truly ignorant. Knowing and well skill'd (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) in the little diſtinctions of their ſects, pert and bold in quarrelling with the Church, and offering their little exceptions againſt it, &amp;c. a ſign that in theſe they are chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; but as really ignorant in the true grounds and principles of Chriſtian Religion, as the meaneſt of thoſe, which they ſo ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and imperiouſly pity as poor ignorant people.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things call me too much out of my way. I only mention them to ſhew, that men cannot well be counted ſo groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as to bring them under the danger of eating <hi>unworthily</hi> upon that reaſon; and that if any ſhould chance to be ſo, it is their own fault only, and the Church is wholly free, and to be acquitted from being in the leaſt acceſſary to it; but I paſs the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this, and proceed to what is more pertinent to my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:94519:32"/>And that is to ſhew by what meaſures a man may judge himſelf, and his knowledge in this matter, and what thoſe meaſures of knowledge are, that will ſet him above all this danger; and I dare pronounce him to have attained to theſe, that hath ſo much knowledge as enables him to underſtand that Chriſt died for the redemption of mankind, to ſatisfie for the ſins of the world; and to purchaſe pardon for men upon the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of repentance, and faith in him; that the Holy Sacrament is inſtituted to be a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of this death of Chriſt, to give God Almighty hearty and devout praiſe for it: and to aſſure us, that if we truly believe in Chriſt and his merits, repenting us of our ſins, and reſolving by Gods grace to lead a good life, we ſhall be pardon'd for what is paſt, and enabled to perform what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for the future truly upon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are no mighty arduous or difficult meaſures of knowledge; a man that is a grown Chriſtian, and hath lived under the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church, can hardly be thought ſo ignorant, as to come within the danger of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> upon this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: he will be able to diſcern the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to underſtand that this is a ſacred and religious ſervice, and to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it, and a common meal: he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what it means, what he ought to do, what to expect, and what poſture to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94519:32"/>
into, when he doth approach to the Table of his Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the more important and ſeeming difficulty is yet behind, and that is to apply what I ſay to the ſecond thing I mentioned, to wilful impenitence, which is both the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſeems to be the more common evill of the two. And yet I think I may ſafely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſay of this, what I did of the other; that it is hardly competible to any Chriſtian, but (to be ſure) not to any that is deſirous to come to the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of my affirming this I ſhall give preſently, when I have premiſed one thing; and that is this, that it be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what I am ſpeaking of, namely wilful, obſtinate, reſolved impenitence. I am not ſpeaking of impenitence that proceeds from meer careleſneſs; from want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, from irreſolution and inſtability of mind; from the violence of temptations, and want of being true to our aids and aſſiſtances againſt them; much leſs of breaking our vows and good purpoſes, and failing to make good our pious promiſes, and reſolutions, after we have repented, and in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and ſo proving eventually and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impenitent.</p>
                  <p>But I am ſpeaking of a wilful obſtinate ſinner, that reſolves to live and die in his ſins, and be damned for ever for them; this is that impenitence that I am ſpeaking of, and this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94519:33"/>
is that man that I am inquiring after if any ſuch be to be found: I ſay, if he be to be found, which I verily believe he is not, at leaſt amongſt thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, and have not wholly renounced their baptiſm; much leſs among thoſe that keep up the practice of religion, and would (but that they are fearful) come to this Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt then let us inquire and ſearch among thoſe that retain the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that keep up a form of Religion, and are not actually turned Renegado's and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from it: let me ſee the wicked'ſt, and profaneſt of thoſe, that dare either tell me, or his own conſcience, that he reſolves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to repent and amend his life: this is a thing next to impoſſible for any, that believes any thing of his Religion; that hath any ſenſe of a future ſtate, and of the terribleneſs of that divine wrath, and thoſe dreadful tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in hell, that all impenitent wretches muſt moſt certainly undergo in it; the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner in the world muſt ſink under the apprehenſion of theſe, and not be able to bear up againſt his own mind, and the terrors of his conſcience, when he reflects upon them; and there are but two ways, by which men defeat the effect of their belief, and fears of theſe things, ſo as to dare to continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent under them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94519:33"/>Either firſt by baniſhing as much as they can all thoughts of, and reflections upon them; bringing themſelves to a ſtupid care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temper of mind, that they may live in a total diſregard and forgetfulneſs of them, without all ſenſe of them, and without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thought becoming a man, or a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: And when they cannot do this, but their thoughts will purſue them, and break in upon them, as ſometimes they will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; then flying to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſenſualities, and thereby diverting, or drowning the clamor of their own minds; juſt as thoſe wretched Parents who ſacrificed their children in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> were forced to drown the noiſe of their diſmal cries, with the louder one of Drums and Trumpets.</p>
                  <p>Or Secondly, by quieting their minds with ſome thoughts and hopes of repenting hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this is the grand cheat that men put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and the common artifice by which they ſooth their own minds, and keep them in peace, and make a ſhift to continue and go on in an unreformed ſtate, although they do believe, and ſometimes think of the diſmal danger thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the two great frauds that the grand enemy puts upon ſinful men, and hath learned them to put upon themſelves too; but for which, it were next to impoſſible for any man that hath the leaſt meaſure of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94519:34"/>
faith, any ſenſe and belief of a future ſtate, durſt continue in an impenitent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but ſtill in neither of theſe caſes, doth the man reſolve to be impenitent, and ſo is not the perſon that I am ſpeaking of; in one caſe the ſottiſh man neglects, and thinks not of repentance, but in the other he thinks, and hath ſome hopes of it too: he hopes he may repent, and reform hereafter, though he be ſo miſerable and vain, as never to put theſe thoughts in execution: ſo that in both caſes he is far enough from obſtinacy, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſolution never to repent; ſo that ſtill I ſay, a reſolved impenitent is ſcarce to be found in the whole crowd of Chriſtians, no not the moſt profligate and profane among them.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs, Secondly, among them that keep up the practice of Religion, and either do, or would come to the Holy Sacrament, if this fear did not hinder them: it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that any of theſe are reſolutely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly impenitent; if they ſhould, they would give the lie to themſelves, have not only their impenitency, but the moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hypocriſie to anſwer for, and ſo be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>unworthy</hi> ſhould they communicate in this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>But this caſe is clear, and needs no further inquiry into; ſuch perſons are in an actual courſe of religion, and the ſervices of it, and far enough from that wilful impenitence that we are diſcourſing about: they are ſo far from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94519:34"/>
reſolving never to repent, that their only fear is, they repent not enough, that they are not reformed and holy enough; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are far enough from the danger of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> upon this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>But this caſe of impenitence may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome further inquiry into, in order to ſome ſcrupulous perſons fuller ſatisfaction in it; for it may yet be doubted, whether no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reſolved wilful impenitence doth bring a man within the danger of this guilt; what are we to think of eventual impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? and what ſhall we judge of the caſe of that man, who goes indeed to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with a purpoſe, and reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and amend his life, but afterwards is falſe to his purpoſe, and fails to execute his good reſolution? doth not this man eat <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily?</hi> were it not better for this man, not to come to the Holy Sacrament at all?</p>
                  <p>This is a caſe that will deſerve to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and the rather becauſe I fear it too often happens, and is known to be matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſcruple in this thing. Men are too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falſe to thoſe good promiſes, that they make to God and themſelves, and thoſe good purpoſes that they fix upon at the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and knowing this too well, they are afraid to come to the Sacrament, for fear they ſhould not be ſo good as their promiſe; their own ſad experience hath taught them how
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94519:35"/>
deſultory, and unconſtant their reſolutions and tempers are; how ſtrong the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they may afterwards meet with, and how weak their own virtuous good purpoſes yet be; and therefore they think it ſafer to ſtay a while 'till they have made ſome trial, and 'till they have a little better ſtrengthened their good reſolutions and tempers, than to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſently upon that ſervice which they may abuſe and profane, by being falſe to the reſolutions they take up, and the promiſes which they make in it: This is the caſe, and to the ſcruple taken up upon it, I return theſe three things in anſwer and ſatisfaction to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every man ought indeed to be true to his vows and promiſes as near as he can; and when he hath taken up ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and given his faith to God he ought to perform it, and to do his utmoſt to ſtand to it.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a dreadful fault to play faſt and looſe with God almighty, to promiſe, and never take any due care to perform what a man doth promiſe: there is not a ſadder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a looſe, careleſs, trifling ſpirit, than to be prodigal in our promiſes, and niggardly in our payments of them; to be forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions to promiſe great things to God, what reformed, what good men we will become and be, but yet to be regardleſs and careleſs afterwards whether we be ſuch or not, and never to apply our ſelves in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to make good what we have promiſed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94519:35"/>
and to put our good purpoſes in execution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But yet Secondly, a mans doing thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, doth not make his Communicating in the Holy Sacrament to be eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily</hi> in any proportion to what is intended in this Text.</p>
                  <p>His having received the Holy Sacrament may aggravate the guilt of his after failure; but that ſubſequent failure doth not ſo affect his precedent communicating, as to render it eating and drinking thus unworthily; if the purpoſe of the mind be then ſerious and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, his receiving the Holy Sacrament is far enough from being unworthy or faulty; and (as I ſaid) his failing afterwards doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it all.</p>
                  <p>But then do I conſider what I ſay? can that purpoſe of mind be ſincere and ſerious, which afterwards is not put in execution? doth not a mans failing afterwards to make it good, ſhew that he was perfidious and an hypocrite in making of it? why no (I ſay) it doth not, a man may be in earneſt and ſincere in making a promiſe, and taking up a reſolution, and yet poſſibly fail of making it good afterwards; his failing afterwards is no argument that he was not in earneſt when he made it: it is argument indeed of his careleſneſs and irreſolution, but it may ariſe from a thouſand reaſons, beſides his falſehood or hypocriſie when he made it.</p>
                  <p>Many a man in the time of affliction, and ſickneſs (for example) makes fair promiſes to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94519:36"/>
God, what he will be, and what he will do, if God pleaſe to ſpare him; and this (I doubt not) really and in earneſt, and with a ſincere purpoſe of mind at that time, to be, or to do as he promiſeth; and yet afterwards that ſenſe of things may wear of, and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of mind abate, and that ſpecious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may come finally to nothing: but this is not becauſe the man was not then really in earneſt, but becauſe afterwards he is careleſs and trifling, and eaſily led away with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that interfere with his former promiſe, and purpoſe of mind.</p>
                  <p>And ſo (I doubt not) it may be, and too often is with men, when they come to the Holy Sacrament, their pious purpoſes for that time may be ſincere, and in earneſt, and yet afterwards wear off, and come to nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore Thirdly, I affirm a man in this caſe doth come with one great qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhould attend his communicating in the Sacrament; <hi>i. e.</hi> a purpoſe of repentance and reformation, and which will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſecure him againſt all poſſibility of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in the ſenſe of this Text, or any like it.</p>
                  <p>So that inſtead of ſtaying away, for fear that he ſhould change his mind afterwards, he ought (I think) the rather to come, that he may not do ſo: the great reaſon certainly lies on this ſide; ſeeing there is not any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe that he can at preſent take to faſten
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94519:36"/>
his good purpoſe, and to ſecure it of effect, than this: for by this means he will make his promiſe more ſolemn, and affecting upon himſelf, cauſe it to ſtick the deeper and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer upon his own thoughts, and receive that grace moſt infallibly from God, which if he be faithful and true unto, his pious reſolution will continue, and he may be enabled to act according to the intention of it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <p n="4">4. I Add now a fourth thing worthy to be conſidered in order to our ſatisfaction in this inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> that whatever the ſenſe of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> is in this Text, or whatever men can think to be like it; <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body</hi> will ſecure them from it.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>diſcerning the Lords body</hi> means I have ſhewed already, and I need repeat very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it again: it means theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, putting a difference between the conſecrated Elements, and common Bread and Wine; the looking upon the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an immediate duty and ſervice of Religion, and conſequently performing it with that devotion and ſeriouſneſs, that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect, that men uſe to ſhew in other ſervices of Religion: the want of this was the cauſe that made the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to eat <hi>unworthily,</hi> and provoked God to puniſh them
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94519:37"/>
with ſundry diſeaſes and death, as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tells them; they did not make any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this, and a common meal in their own Houſes; they did not take it to be any peculiar act of Religion, they came intemperate and <hi>drunk</hi> to the Lords Table; and therefore (to be ſure) were far enough from that reverence and devotion, that ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a ſervice ought to have been performed with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>diſcerning the Lords body</hi> means ſomething more; not only to look upon this Holy Sacrament as a ſolemn and immediate act of Religion, but as the Sacrament and immediate repreſentation of Chriſts body, <hi>i. e.</hi> his body broken and ſlain for the ſins of the world; and the Communicating therein to be the commemoration of his death, and partaking in the bleſſed effects of it; to look beyond the Elements to that which they are deſigned to ſignifie, and Sacramentally are; to look upon the bread not as common bread, but the ſubſtitute of Chriſts body; and the wine not as ordinary wine, but the figure of his blood; and ſo regarding the whole ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, both as the moſt devout and ſolemn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chriſts death and paſſion, for the expiation of our ſins; and partaking as truly and effectually in the benefits and bleſſings of his body and blood, as if we did eat and drink that very body and blood them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:94519:37"/>This is the great end of this ſervice, and the reaſon of our Lords inſtitution of it; and to <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi> is to underſtand it ſo, and look upon it as ſuch; which it is moſt certain theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were far from doing: either ſo ignorant as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſon of it, or ſo groſly irreverent and careleſs as not to conſider it; for had they done either (much more both) they could hardly have been guilty of ſuch profaneneſs, or of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> as they did.</p>
                  <p>And that is what I would ſay in this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, that whatever the ſenſe of eating and drinking unworthily is in this place, the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body</hi> will ſecure men from it; and this I ſhall endeavour to make plain in theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The not diſcerning the Lords body is here made the reaſon of their eating and drinking unworthily; this I have cleared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be the reaſon both of the ſin and puniſhment too: from whence it is plain, that diſcerning the Lords body would ſecure from both; for if men eat and drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, becauſe they do not diſcern the Lords body, then if they do diſcern it, they will not eat unworthily; for the old rule is true in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality as well as nature, and will hold in this inſtance as well as others, take away the cauſe, and the effect will ceaſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94519:38"/>2. But Secondly, this appears clear in the nature of the thing; for there is a direct and immediate vertue and power in diſcerning the Lords body, to cauſe in men all thoſe qualifications, that render them meet for this ſervice, and ſufficiently ſecure them from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, yea and from doing ſo in any ſenſe like unto them.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt in general, if men diſcern the Lords body, they will preſently perceive that this is a moſt ſacred ſolemn ſervice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and not any ordinary thing; and by this will not only be admoniſhed of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion, that it ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with, but ſtrongly induced to it. Men naturally have ſome ſenſe of reverence and aw upon their minds, when they are addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to devotion, and when they ingage into the ſervices of Religion. And ſo they will have here alſo, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a ſolemn ſervice of Religion this is, and hath always been eſteemed to be in the Chriſtian Church; and truly they can hardly be otherwiſe, if they have any ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or any dread of the Almighty upon their Spirits.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, if men diſcern the Lords body here, ſo as to underſtand the ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this inſtitution, that it is to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the mighty love of our Lord in dying for us; that it is to be a religious ſolemn repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94519:38"/>
of his meritorious bitter death, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for our ſins; they will find that it will even naturally beget in them repentance, and faith, and joy, and charity, and thankfulneſs, and a very high ſenſe of the love of God and Chriſt towards poor ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the higheſt and meeteſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the Holy Sacrament, and thoſe qualifications that fit us for the receiving of it; and the death of Chriſt is the higheſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and moſt powerful means of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe in men, that God Almighty hath to offer or can uſe with them. The Apoſtle ſeems to count it irreſiſtible, and ſuch a one as cannot miſs of effect upon men that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all were dead,</hi> &amp;c. And truly if Men do thus <hi>judge,</hi> if they do ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the tranſcendent and amazing love of Chriſt in dying for the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it will even <hi>conſtrain</hi> them to repentance and faith and love, almoſt whether they will or no: if the grace of God be irreſiſtible in any argument of the Goſpel, it is certainly ſo in this; and I will adventure to ſay it is ſo far ſo here, that thoſe are monſters of Men, or they do not conſider things as Men, that can reſiſt, and defeat the effect of it.</p>
                  <p>So that the Holy Sacrament being ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a commemoration of this death, the very viſible repreſentation of it, the evident
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94519:39"/>
crucifying of Chriſt before our eyes, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. the true <hi>diſcerning</hi> of it, and of the <hi>Lords body</hi> in it, will be of the ſame effect to produce all theſe things in us: I appeal to the experiences of good men for the truth of what I ſay: let them tell you what a mighty efficacy they find in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to this purpoſe; and how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they feel their hearts moved to theſe things by it; and truly if we conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſality of things, we ſhall be inclined to think it almoſt impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe: let us conſider them a little ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for repentance, whether it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſorrow for ſin, a ſenſe of its mighty evil and danger, and a reſolution againſt it, or all theſe together, as indeed it doth, what can effect this in me, if the Holy Sacrament do not? can I ſee the Lords body broken, and his blood poured out (as I do in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) for ſin, and to make the great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to the divine juſtice for ſin; I ſay, can I ſee this without a ſorrowful reflection upon my own ſins which had a hand in this ſuffering? Or can I doubt what a mighty evil ſin is, which could not be expiated by a meaner ſacrifice, than the death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of God? or of how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inſupportable effect that puniſhment muſt be, which the Son of God could not bear without horror and aſtoniſhment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94519:39"/>
fainting and death? or laſtly can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all this, without ſome reſolution and purpoſe to reform from ſin, and to beware of that whoſe conſequences and iſſues I ſee to be ſo dreadful and inſupportable? I am ſure I cannot conſider theſe things, but they will have ſome effect upon my mind; and I am ſure, if they have not, I do not duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as for faith, whether it reſpect the gracious declarations, or kind promiſes, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatnings in the Goſpel, or all theſe; can I doubt the truth of any of theſe, when I ſee the ſon of God die to confirm it? can I queſtion whether God be gracious and ready to forgive ſin, when I ſee him expoſing his own Son to death, that he may with honor do ſo? can I doubt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to all penitent ſinners, when I ſee the truth of them ſealed in his Sons blood? or can I think that the divine threatnings of wrath and vengeance againſt all impenitent wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, will not moſt certainly be executed on them, when I ſee God inexorable to his own Son, and letting him ſuffer and die, rather than permit ſin to paſs unpuniſhed?</p>
                  <p>In a word, the whole Covenant that God hath made with man, the new Covenant of grace and mercy, which the Goſpel is the joyful publication of, is here (as it uſed to be of old) ratified and confirmed by blood, and the blood too of the Son of God; which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94519:40"/>
ſuch an aſſurance and confirmation of its truth, as can never fail us, and beyond which our faith cannot deſire a greater.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And then as to a mighty ſenſe of the love of God to poor Man, what can ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and almoſt beyond deſire) aſſure us of it, as the death of his Son? you may ſee how the Scriptures triumph in this, and magnifie it as the mightieſt inſtance, the higheſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the divine love, that is conceivable; and how can I poſſibly queſtion this, when I ſee him parting with his own Son, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, the Son of his boſom and deareſt love? yea expoſing him to ſuffering and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to pain and ſhame, to death it ſelf, nay to that ignominious and curſed death upon the Croſs, rather than poor Man ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally, and there ſhould not be a way to ſave him by?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, as for joy in this love of God, as for praiſe and thankfulneſs for it; what can effect theſe in my ſoul, if the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts death in the Holy Sacrament cannot? had I ſeen him hanging upon the croſs, bleeding, fainting, ſwooning, dying, and with expanded arms ready to receive and embrace me, it could not have affected me much more, than the viſible repreſentation of all this in the Holy Sacrament may do. If I reflect upon it then as I ſhould, (and that I ſhall do if I <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi>) I can ſcarce entertain the thoughts of it with leſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94519:40"/>
than rapture and tranſport: but I am certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt ill natured perſon living, and for ever the moſt unworthy of the bleſſings of it, if I fail in any meaſure of joy, and thankfulneſs, that I am able to expreſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe now are even the natural effects of diſcerning the Lords body, and they are ſuch things as will make us <hi>meet partakers of theſe holy myſteries,</hi> as our Church ſpeaks, <hi>they will ſet us far above that unworthineſs that the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians <hi>were guilty of, yea or any other thing that can be counted unworthineſs in preparation to it.</hi> By all which things my fourth propoſition is I hope made good, and brought to an iſſue. And ſo is all that I intended to ſay on this firſt general Collection.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I advance to the ſecond Collection that I made in order to the taking off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that men make againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, upon the reaſon of theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the poſſibility and danger of eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to abſtain from the Holy Sacrament upon.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Add this Collection, to come up more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the exception that men make againſt this ſervice, and that which they hope to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their neglect of it upon. The danger (they tell us) of receiving <hi>unworthily</hi> is great, and the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly that it is ſo: now we have great reaſon to think our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to come, and to fear we ſhall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, if we adventure to come; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it the ſafer courſe not to come at all, than run ſo great a danger in coming, we are very unwilling to damn our ſelves; and we hold it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſafer way to ſtay away, and venture it to Gods mercy, than by coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily to incur the plain danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This is the great exception, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plea of men in this caſe; and at the firſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94519:41"/>
hearing it ſeems to argue great modeſty, and regard to a mans eternal ſalvation; and therefore deſerves to be conſidered by us. Now though what I have already ſaid was intended to ſatisfie this exception, and if truly conſidered, be (I hope) of good effect in order thereto: for if men conſider that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking unworthily in the ſenſe of this Text, is a ſin that they can hardly be guilty of; and when they conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may be ſure they are not; it may ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enable them to ſurmount this ſcruple; for while they are ſo far from the ſin, they need not be afraid of the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Yet I advance this Collection in order to the further ſatisfaction of it, and when Men are convinced in this point alſo, that if they were in any likelihood, or danger of eating and drinking unworthily; yet that were not a ſufficient reaſon for them to abſtain from the Holy Sacrament upon, then it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be hoped that they will no longer ſtick at this exception, nor hope to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>This therefore is that which I am going to make good the truth and reaſonableneſs of; that the poſſibility of eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily is not a ſufficient reaſon for Men to keep away from the Holy Sacrament upon, nor fit to be admitted as an excuſe in this caſe; and therefore how honeſt and ſincere, how conſcientious and tender ſoever Men
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94519:42"/>
may account themſelves in ſtaying from the Holy Sacrament upon this exception, yet it is a temptation and a ſnare, a very great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and miſtake, and that which will never bear them out in this omiſſion: and this I ſhall endeavour to make good, firſt by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this place, and the Apoſtles diſcourſe in it; and ſecondly, by ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments founded upon the truth of the thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the circumſtances of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in this place; there are many things in it, pertinent to my purpoſe, but I ſhall only briefly obſerve theſe few that follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were groſly guilty of this ſin, they did eat and drink unworthily in the moſt notorious and ſcandalous manner poſſible; the Apoſtle plainly tells them ſo, inſtances in evident matter of fact, and blames them with that ſharpneſs, that ſo foul a matter juſtly deſerved.</p>
               <p>Yea ſecondly, he aggravates the ſin and guilt of this miſcarriage, to a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and threatens it with a very ſharp and ſevere puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And yet thirdly after all this, he doth not give them any the leaſt allowance, or liberty to ſtay from this holy ſervice, till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and reformed ſufficiently this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: he doth not tell them, that their unworthineſs render'd them unfit to come to the Table of the Lord, or gave them a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from it: he doth not adviſe them to ſtay
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94519:42"/>
away for the future, till they had better fitted themſelves, for fear of damnation by coming unworthily.</p>
               <p>You do not read one word ſpoken by him to any ſuch purpoſe, but rather directly the contrary: <hi>let a man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat; and when ye come together tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> in all which the Apoſtle doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to intermit this ſervice, and let it alone, 'till they had better conſider'd it, and better prepared themſelves for it; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them ſtill to keep up the practice of it, but to reform their great faults and errors in it; to come ſtill together to <hi>eat this bread,</hi> only to <hi>examin themſelves,</hi> to conſider what they were going about, what they were doing, that they might eat it becomingly as they ought to do.</p>
               <p>He taxeth very ſeverely and ſharply, the fault in doing the duty, and preſſeth earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reformation of that fault; but he doth not make the fault an exception againſt, or diſpenſation againſt the duty, nor ſay one word, that might allow or encourage their intermitting of it, by reaſon thereof; from whence (I think) I may ſafely collect thus much, that what the Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> concerning the ſin and danger of eating and drinking unworthily, was never intended to hinder Men from eating, nor deſigned to be an excuſe and plea for Mens
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94519:43"/>
not doing ſo, as ſome are pleaſed to make it at this day.</p>
               <p>For if it had, there is no doubt, but he would have given ſome plain intimation of it; or at leaſt have ſaid ſomething, from whence Men might have collected that to be his meaning; we cannot ſuppoſe, that he would have been ſilent in ſo very great, and concerning a caſe; and not have given Men ſome warning, rather than let them run on in a fact which was ſure to pull down ſuch judgments upon their heads.</p>
               <p>It ſeems plain the Apoſtle had no ſuch thoughts of this matter then, as ſome Men have now; he never thought that the ſin, or danger of doing a duty amiſs, might be made an exception againſt doing it at all, or that threatening damnation to eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, ſhould ſcare Men from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking at all; he takes what care he can, that the duty may be performed, and the error in doing it effectually reformed: but he never makes the danger of the one a diſpenſation from the other, nor lets fall the leaſt word that can be interpreted to ſuch a meaning; he tells them indeed what a great ſin it is to eat and drink unworthily, and he tells them what puniſhments it makes them obnoxious unto; but he doth not therefore tell them they may ſtay away from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for fear of committing the ſin, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the danger, or that it were ſafer for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94519:43"/>
them to keep wholly from the one, than venture the hazard of the other: no; and he doth not do this, when they did actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the one, and when they did as really ſuffer under the other.</p>
               <p>Now the Improvement that I make of this procedure of the Apoſtle, and this laſt named circumſtance relating to it is this; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the care, poſſibility, and fear of eating unworthily, ſhould not be thought a ſufficient plea for not eating at all; the Apoſtle did not allow or encourage Men to ſtay away from the Holy Sacrament when they did greatly profane it, when they did eat unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in the groſſeſt ſenſe; much leſs then may Men ſtay away from it, only upon a ſuſpicion and fear of this, and of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due to it.</p>
               <p>This I take to be a true way of arguing, and worthy of conſideration in this matter; the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were extreamly faulty in this thing, not only were in danger of eating unworthily, but actually did ſo in the groſſeſt manner; and yet the Apoſtle ſaith not one word of their ſtaying away upon that reaſon, which he certainly would have done, had he thought this cauſe of juſt exception, and that it had been better for them to ſtay wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Holy Sacrament, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſo great a guilt, and incur ſo dreadful a puniſhment by their coming amiſs, and not as they ſhould do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:94519:44"/>This I confeſs is a negative argument, which is not always, and in all caſes good and concluding; yet in ſuch a caſe as this it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is ſo: if a thing be no where ſaid in Scripture, which (if it were true) is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and importing to be known; and if it be not ſaid there, where it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and neceſſary it ſhould have been ſaid; then we may from that ſilence of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture conclude againſt it: if we deny this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we ſhall hardly be able to make good the ſufficiency of the Scriptures, or the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the inſpired penmen of it; we muſt be forced to entertain mean thoughts of the great S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if we can think that he knew of any ſuch things, and yet would not reveal it, when there was ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for doing ſo, and when it was ſo very neceſſary, and of ſuch advantage to be known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I ſhall proceed to add ſome other conſiderations, which will be as ſo many rational arguments for the truth of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent collection; which was the ſecond way that I promiſed to make it good by: I ſhall inſiſt upon theſe five that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Communicating in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a plain neceſſary duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The poſſibility of doing it amiſs is no greater, than of our doing other duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amiſs, which yet we our ſelves count neceſſary to be done, and do keep up the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94519:44"/>3. The puniſhment or danger of doing this amiſs is no more dreadful, than what may be feared upon the like failure in doing other duties amiſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatever ſin or danger there can be in eating <hi>unworthily,</hi> there is as much, or greater in not eating at all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The danger of eating <hi>unworthily,</hi> is that which is occaſioned only by our own default, and which we may correct, and get out of the reach of.</p>
               <p>Theſe are plain conſiderations, pertinent to our preſent purpoſe, and which it will highly concern all that labor under any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and fears in this caſe, ſeriouſly to weigh, and conſider well.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I begin with the firſt of theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is indeed the foundation of all the reſt, and which when I have cleared, the reaſonableneſs of the other will eaſily follow: the Argument is this, the Communicating in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a plain, expreſs, neceſſary duty.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Should think, I need not be put upon the proof of this in a Chriſtian audience; nor required to make good that, which no one that hath read, and believes the Goſpel can deny: and I muſt confeſs, to me it is matter of great wonder, that any Chriſtians ſhould look upon the Holy Sacrament otherwiſe, than a neceſſary ſtanding duty and ſervice of their Religion. I am very ſure, it relies upon as plain and expreſs a command, and upon as weighty and great a reaſon, as any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in Chriſtian Religion either doth, or can do; and would men conſider both theſe things, they could not remain doubtful in this matter; they could not look upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a thing of choice, and left to their own freedom whether they would obſerve it or not; but tyed upon them by plain and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94519:45"/>
precept, and made matter of their neceſſary and fixed duty.</p>
               <p>And to the end that all Chriſtians may look upon, and eſteem it as ſuch, I beg that theſe few things among many others may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Holy Sacrament is inſtituted, ordain'd, and commanded by our Lord, in words as expreſs and plain, as ever any thing could, or ever was commanded by him: I ſhall need for your ſatisfaction in this, but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repeat the words of the Evangeliſts, three of whom mention the inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament: <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. <hi>and as they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave to the Diſciples ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take eat, this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks and gave it to them, ſaying drink ye all of this: for this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Here it is plain, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is inſtituted by our Saviour, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Diſciples with a command to eat and drink of it; and you meet with the very ſame words, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>In S. <hi>Luke</hi> the matter is ſomething plainer, where it is not only inſtituted by our Saviour, as the others relate it; but a command given for their doing it likewiſe after his death in remembrance of him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them; ſaying, this is my body which is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94519:46"/>
given for you, do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it was not a command that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the doing of this at that time only, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews clearly in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25, 26. where it is obſervable that he ſpeaks of it as a thing, which our Lord charged him alſo with as well as the other Apoſtles. <hi>For I have received that of the Lord, which I alſo delivered unto you; that the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night that he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid take eat, this is my body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me: after the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, this Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me: for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beſeech men to conſider what is ſaid in all theſe places, and then to ſay if any thing can be plainer; if there ever was, or could be a more plain command than this is, <hi>do this in remembrance of me:</hi> if this be not an expreſs command, never any was ſuch; and if we may diſobey this at our pleaſure, I know not why we may not diſobey all others as well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not only a command, a poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that relies only upon the will and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt commanding it, but upon a very great and good reaſon, and is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended upon an argument that ſhews it to be eternally reaſonable and becoming. Not only
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94519:46"/>
                  <hi>do this,</hi> as S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak, but <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> relate the matter; which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repeats again, <hi>as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words make it to relie upon a reaſon that is both becoming, and obliging alſo, even until the final coming of our Lord to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for nothing can be more reaſonable and fit in it ſelf, than to keep up in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, the ſolemn and moſt grateful remembrance of Chriſts death; and they that can think otherwiſe, are unworthy to ſhare in the benefits of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides the inſtituting of it to this end, makes it perpetually obliging alſo. I mean to the end of the world, and as long as there ſhall be a Chriſtian Church in it; for ſo long it will be fit to keep up the memory of it; and this reaſon will not only hold, but improve and grow ſtronger in every ſucceeding age, and period of the world, in which the ſenſe and memory of it will be in danger to expire, and wear off: ſo that every ſuch age will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have greater, than leſſer reaſon, to keep up this ſolemn commemoration of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To theſe intimations I may add one thing very conſiderable to our purpoſe, from the practice of the Apoſtle, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his diſcourſe in this Chapter; a learned Man hath taken notice of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94519:47"/>
me, ſo that I ſhall but juſt name them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Apoſtle takes ſo much pains to inſtruct the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the right way of Communicating in the Holy Sacrament, and to reform the profanation of it, that they were guilty of.</p>
               <p>Now can any man reaſonably think, that he would have done this; if he had not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as a neceſſary duty tied upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by Chriſts own command and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Certainly no, he that gives direction how to do a duty, ſuppoſeth the obligation, and neceſſity of it, or elſe he ſpeaks to little purpoſe. And (as that great Man ſpeaks) can any man think the way and manner of doing an action to be a duty, and yet that action it ſelf no duty? this is not ſuppoſable.</p>
               <p>And we may be ſure, the Apoſtle would never have ſpent ſo great a part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in directing how to eat and drink, how to order and prepare themſelves for it, but that he looked on it as a duty neceſſarily incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them; nor be ſo impertinent as to concern and buſie himſelf, in directing the circumſtances of an action, which was not neceſſary to be done, but arbitrary, and at their pleaſure whether to do it, or no.</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance is what I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, that he did this even when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> run a very great hazard, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a grand guilt, by their profanation of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94519:47"/>
this ſervice, and coming ſo unworthily to it.</p>
               <p>Certainly had the Apoſtle looked upon this, as any thing leſs than a neceſſary duty, he would have gone another way to work with them; he would have diſcourſed to them at another rate, and have told them it were much the better and ſafer way, to ſtay away from the Sacrament, than incur ſo great guilt and puniſhment by coming ſo unworthily: this would have been the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that a great many Men now accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their principles, would have given to them, and indeed do give themſelves, and others too.</p>
               <p>But it is evident the Apoſtle ſpeaks not one word to this purpoſe, nor knew of any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he had to do ſo: he had no authority, to grant them any indulgence, or licence to ſtay away, though they were apt to come ſo very unfitly. He was to recommend it as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty, and to preſs the ſerious and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervation of it; but he had received no warrant from the Lord to diſpenſe with that obſervation: he would have them to look upon the Sacrament as a neceſſary ſtanding ſervice of their Religion; to count it their duty to eat and drink, and his province was only to direct them how they might do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, and not to their <hi>condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all Chriſtians, that this is a plain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, indiſpenſable duty, inſtituted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94519:48"/>
by our Lord, to be a ſtanding ſervice in his Church: 'till his ſecond coming to judge the world.</p>
               <p>And its being ſo, becomes one very good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to our preſent purpoſe, and a good foundation to ſuperſtruct the truth of our obſervation upon; for that which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muſt be done: and the danger of doing it amiſs will not excuſe the neglect of it.</p>
               <p>And this I adviſe all ſcrupulous and timorous perſons in this caſe to poſſeſs their minds in the firſt place with the ſteddy and ſerious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of; as a thing that will go a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſilencing all their exceptions againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament: where ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and fears may at any time ariſe in their minds, let them remember this is a neceſſary duty, and it will be a good anſwer to them all. I may ſin in coming to the Lords Table, but it is my neceſſary duty to come: I fear I ſhall eat unworthily, but God hath expreſly commanded me to eat. What then? What, ſhall I reſolve to ſtay away? I am ſure that is to ſin againſt a plain command of my Lord, and to neglect that which he hath made my neceſſary duty. What then ſhall I do? Why the way is plain, and the ſolution is eaſie. I will reſolve by Gods grace to do my duty, and endeavour with his help to do it as well as I can: this is the true concluſion from theſe premiſſes, and the only ſafe way to take in this caſe.</p>

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:94519:48"/>For if it be a neceſſary indiſpenſible duty, it muſt engage our care to do it, and to do it as well as we can; its being neceſſary muſt ingage our obedience, and care to do it; and the danger of doing it amiſs muſt ingage our utmoſt caution and care to do it as well as our poor power will enable us. The poſſibility of doing it amiſs will not excuſe our neglect of it; only it ſhould ingage our utmoſt heed, that we do not contract a guilt, nor incur a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by any voluntary failing, or wilful care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs in the doing of it.</p>

                     <hi>The ſecond Conſideration that I named as an Argument for the Truth of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is this, The poſſibility and guilt of doing this ſervice of our Religion is no greater, than of doing others amiſs, which yet we count neceſſary to be done, and our ſelves do keep up the exerciſe of.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis will be a conſiderable addition to the former, and I ſhall endeavour to drive it to an iſſue, by an induction of ſeveral depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:94519:49"/>1. Men are as incident to failures in doing other duties of Religion, as in doing this; every whit as apt to do them amiſs, as they are to do this ſo. I will inſtance in the two moſt ſtationary and common, I mean prayer, and hearing Gods word: we are as ſubject to fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures in theſe, as we are in this; and if we conſider ourſelves, ſhall ſoon confeſs we are ſo.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the thing is too evident, and others may ſee it as well as our ſelves. I am not very willing to enter upon this theme, becauſe I would not indulge to any thing that may but look like reflection; but certainly if any will but obſerve our common carriage in the Church both at Prayers and Sermon, he will be tempted to think our zeal and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but ſmall, nor our ſelves very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned whether we diſcharge theſe duties as we ſhould or no.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſo commonly ſet themſelves to gaze, and look upon others, as if they had no other errand hither, but to ſee how others are dreſſed, and who is the fineſt; and thoſe (on the other hand) that lay themſelves down to ſleep, and perhaps can ſooner do it in Gods houſe than in their own. Surely, both theſe ſorts are far enough from that devotion and zeal, that ſerious and cloſe application of mind, that all the ſervices of Religion ſhould be performed with, and need not be told how groſly they fail of diſcharging theſe ſervices of Religion as they ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94519:49"/>If I might be allowed to argue from plain evidence, and matter of fact, I think I might caſt the odds on this ſide; and adventure to ſay that men do not ſo commonly fail in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this duty, as they do in others. I never yet ſaw a man ſleep at the Holy Sacrament, or need to be awaked when the Holy Symbols were to be adminiſtred to him. Men are then generally ſerious and thoughtful, earneſt and zealous, and cloſely intent upon what is before them. So that if we may judge by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and plain fact, the Service of the Holy Sacrament is performed with fewer failures, than other ſervices of Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are: but if upon experience we find, that Men fail as commonly in other ſervices of Religion as this, it will ſerve my turn at preſent.</p>
               <p>Let me beg a Man to conſider himſelf well, and then to give me in the ſum of his own experience, whether he do not find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as incident to failings in other ſervices of Religion as this. How hard a matter doth every man find it, to keep his heart cloſe to God, and his thoughts from rambling abroad, even when he is upon his knees in prayer! who is there ſo intent, and ſervent in ſpirit, upon whom ſome vain and wandring thoughts do not break in, even in the time of his moſt ſolemn devotion? It is the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of all good men, and I never yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſed with the beſt man of this caſe, who did not bewail it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:94519:50"/>Or where is the man that ſo reveres the Word of God, and is ſo awfully and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intent upon the hearing of it, who is not many times diverted by idle thoughts, and vain avocations and ſallies of mind? and who ſees not, that there are but few, that can hold out <hi>watching with Chriſt one hour?</hi> I am very confident I ſhall have experiece on my ſide, and ready to ſubſcribe to this truth, that men are really as incident to failures at other times as this, and find it as hard a matter to pray, or hear Gods word ſo as they ſhould, and ſo as to have hopes of divine acceptation in doing of them, as it is to do ſo in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, yea perhaps (as I ſaid before) much harder.</p>
               <p>And as I dare appeal to common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo I think I can produce ſome good reaſons for the truth of this obſervation.</p>
               <p>For firſt the aids and aſſiſtances of Gods good ſpirit and grace are as ready for us, and may as reaſonably be expected by us, in this ſervice of Religion as any others. So that if we cry out as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> and declame never ſo tragically and paſſionately upon our own utter inability to do any thing that is good; yet we may encourage and comfort our ſelves with the hopes of the divine grace, that is ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us, and can be ſufficient for us, and that in this ſervice of Religion as well as others: or if there be any difference, it may be in this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94519:50"/>
it may be more ready, and plentiful than in others: for upon the ſame reaſon that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls this <hi>a drinking into the ſame ſpirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. upon the ſame may men expect more plentiful effuſions of that ſpirit in this, than in other miniſtries of Religion.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, there are the ſame holy qualifications of mind and temper neceſſary to the diſcharging other ſervices of Religion, as to this, the ſame zeal and fervour of ſpirit; the ſame devotion and height of ſoul; the ſame ſequeſtring our minds from all other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and thoughts; the ſame high thoughts of God and his goodneſs; the ſame cloſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind; the ſame care to free our ſelves from all injuſtice, wrath, uncleanneſs, and every thing that might render us unfit to converſe with our God, and to receive bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings from him. All theſe things, and the ſame meaſures and degrees of them too, are equally neceſſary for us when we pray, as well as when we Communicate in the Holy Sacrament. You will find the Scriptures ſtill ſpeaking thus; and requiring all theſe things, as neceſſary to endear us to God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend any of our performances to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptation. And if ſo, upon what reaſon can we ſuſpect more difficulty in the acceptable performance of this ſervice, than in others?</p>
               <p>I cannot think of any appearance of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſs it be that all theſe divine qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94519:51"/>
were more natural and eaſie in others than in this; or ſomething in them that is more naturally effective of them there than here. Now this is ſo far from being true, that all good men find the quite contrary to be ſo; there is no ſervice in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that carries our ſouls higher in raptures of love, and makes them mount in brighter flames of gratitude and praiſe, than this, nay none like it; when we ſee our Lord crucified before our eyes, behold and taſte the ſenſible pledges of his bleeding and dying love; it is now that our ſouls are ready to break their earthly Manſions: 'tis now that our hearts burn within us, and that our thoughts burſt into pure flames of devotion and love, which unite us to our God, and render our ſervices as acceptable to him, as the brighter flames of Angels and Seraphims above.</p>
               <p>So that if the compariſon between this and other ſervices of Religion, be made either upon experience, or reaſon, this ſhould be accounted the eaſieſt, rather than moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of all.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. THE guilt of failing to do this duty ſo well as we ſhould, is no greater, than what it is in failing to do others ſo; and we are not only as incident to failings in doing other ſervices of Religion amiſs, as well as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94519:51"/>
this, but we contract as great guilt in them, as in this.</p>
                  <p>Some men make a mighty ſtir, and others perplex and puzle themſelves with fears of an extraordinary guilt, if they do not receive the Holy Sacrament, juſt as they ſhould do; and this guilt they dread much more, and think it to be much more terrible, than the guilt of the like failure in other ſervices of their Religion: but for my part, I could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any true reaſon for this: it happens here (as it uſually doth in panick fears) there is no real ground or cauſe of them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I know of, beſides words, and a prejudicated opinion, to incline us to think that there is.</p>
                  <p>It is doubtleſs a great ſin to Communicate <hi>unworthily,</hi> without due reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and without care to demean our ſelves as becomes ſo ſacred a ſervice of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but ſo it is alſo to pray, or to hear Gods word, careleſly and regardleſly; to ruſh into the divine preſence rudely and profanely, and to behave our ſelves in Gods Houſe as irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and far from any ſign of devotion as in our own: to ſay over a few prayers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any due regard to the majeſty of Him we are praying unto; without any juſt ſenſe of the importance of the things we are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and without any cloſe intention of mind to what we are doing: to lay our ſelves down to ſleep, when God is ſpeaking
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94519:52"/>
to us, and when a meſſage is delivered unto us out of that divine word, by which we ſhall be judged at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure theſe are ſins of a very grand guilt, and I am ſure the Holy Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeaks of them as ſuch. I would to God men would ſoberly conſider that they are ſo, we might then hope to ſee the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God performed at another rate, than generally it is. And I add that according to the common language of Scripture, they are ſins every whit as big, of as deep a dye, as grand guilt, as Communicating unduly in the Holy Sacrament is, or can reaſonably be thought to be: when any man will undertake to make out the difference upon any ſound reaſon, we may begin to queſtion this: but till then ſhould not let our own make ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and fears prevail upon us to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and fill our minds with unreaſonable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and perplexities in this matter.</p>
                  <p>It's a bad ſign when men are ſcrupulous only one way: mighty timerous in one thing, but hardy and regardleſs in another; and it's a ſhrewd ſign it is not true conſcience that makes men ſo mighty ſhie and fearful of communicating <hi>unworthily,</hi> but never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at hearing <hi>unworthily,</hi> or praying <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily;</hi> the guilt is really the ſame in one caſe, as it is in the other, and therefore equally to be dreaded and avoided in both: and if it be an honeſt true dread of ſin that is upon us,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94519:52"/>
it will ſtartle us, and render us afraid of it in one caſe, as well as in the other.</p>
                  <p>It's a ſtale cheat that the Enemy of ſouls hath too often put upon men, in rendring them mighty tender and ſcrupulous in ſome things, but careleſs altogether in others; as if care in one inſtance of our duty, would attone our wilful regardleſneſs in another. S. <hi>James</hi> I am ſure tells us another ſtory, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10.11. where in his judgment, he that wilfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgeth himſelf in the breach of one precept of the Law, is guilty of all, becauſe the ſame authority of God is contemned in one, that is in another, or in all: for <hi>he that ſaid do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo do not kill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I heartily wiſh, that men would not put the ſame fallacy upon themſelves: ſin and guilt is to be dreaded in one thing, as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if it be not ſo by us, if we be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous only one way, but not the other: if we be ſo very fearful of ſinning, in doing of one ſervice of our Religion amiſs, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is too plain, the devil, or our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful hearts put a trick upon us: it is ſome other reaſon that governs us, and keeps us from our duty, and not an honeſt conſcience and fear of doing it amiſs: for that fear will make us afraid of the ſame ſin in doing other duties amiſs, and if it do not, it is not that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which prevails with us.</p>
                  <p>I would willingly preſs this Conſideration more home upon all mens thoughts, and beg
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94519:53"/>
them to take heed of a ſuperſtitious fear of greater guilt and danger in doing this ſervice of their Religion amiſs, than in others: this is a very dangerous temptation and a ſnare, and there are two evident ill purpoſes, that Satan intends to ſerve by it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to keep men in the neglect and diſuſe of this duty, which beſides that it is a very great ſin, as being the omiſſion of a neceſſary indiſpenſable duty; is the neglecting of a thing that is ſo highly advantageous to all the great purpoſes of ſalvation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo very deſtructive to that malicious and ſpightful deſign that he hath againſt all men. I am very confident, there is not any one ſervice in Chriſtian Religion that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath a greater ſpight againſt, and dread of, than the Holy Sacrament; nor any thing that it is more his endeavour, and intereſt, to prejudice men againſt, and hinder them from.</p>
                  <p>Now of all the Stratagems that he can uſe to this purpoſe, this is the moſt ſpecious, and with all men of any honeſty the moſt taking; for to ſeem fearful of ſin and guilt, and very ſhie of any thing, in which they fear to incur it, is a very ſpecious thing, it looks well, and is certainly in it ſelf a commendable thing, eaſily embraced, and readily ſwallowed. Yea and let me add, is as hardly removed when men have once given way to it: when men can appeal to their own minds, and be able to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94519:53"/>
ſay, that they are afraid of Communicating amiſs, and ſinning greatly in doing ſo, and that nothing but this keeps them from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament; it is a very hard thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to it; they think they are on the ſurer ſide, and it will not be an eaſie matter to make them change.</p>
                  <p>I am the more earneſt therefore, in begging men to take heed of entertaining this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is a dangerous temptation and a ſnare, and that which this ſubtil enemy (under the ſemblance of a friend) puts upon them, on purpoſe to hinder them from an abſolutely neceſſary, yea and moſt advantageous duty; by the ſin and folly of which he will ruin and deſtroy them more fatally and ſucceſsfully, than they would be ruin'd by any ſin and guilt in Communicating in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they did not Communicate ſo well, and becomingly as they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>Endeavour therefore I beſeech you, to clear your minds from this ſuperſtitious unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable fear, that men have ſo generally in this age; and to which (I wiſh I could not ſay) the doctrins of ſome men have been ſo contributive. Fortifie your minds with the ſteddy and aſſured belief, that there is no more guilt in doing this ſervice amiſs, than in doing others ſo: nor any reaſon (as I ſhall endeavour to prove hereafter) to apprehend God more inexorable and ſevere, or leſs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and ready to pardon our failings in this,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94519:54"/>
than in others. You would find this a great eaſe and relief to your minds, and that which would enable you to addreſs to this ſervice of Religion, with as much chearfulneſs and comfort, with as good hope of divine mercy, acceptance, and bleſſing, as in any others.</p>
                  <p>But 'till you do endeavor this, and get your minds in ſome good meaſure cleared from this dreadful apprehenſion, you will never attain to any conſiderable chearfulneſs and comfort of mind in it: but there will be ſome trembling and dread upon your ſpirits, ſome anxious miſgivings and abodings of mind, which will make this ſervice unpleaſant, and uneaſie to you, and at laſt go near to cauſe you to ſit down in a total neglect of it.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond evil deſign that the Devil hath in this, is to render men careleſs and negligent in all others; for by cauſing their zeal and care to be ſo great about this, he will go near to make it the leſs in them, and by magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guilt of doing this unworthily, he will cauſe the guilt of doing others unworthily to grow leſs.</p>
                  <p>Men may poſſibly imagine it will not be thus, but it is almoſt certain, and ever ſeen in experience to be ſo: men ſhall ſeldom or never appear ſo extraordinarily zealous and careful in one thing, but they may be trap'd, and found careleſs in others: and it may be it would be found upon obſervation to be ſo in this very inſtance; obſerve it, and you ſhall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94519:54"/>
find abundace of thoſe very men, that ſeem ſo over-fearful of ſin and guilt in this caſe, to be very careleſs of it in others, and eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting the ſenſe and fear of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I once more caution men againſt this opinion, it is of very dangerous effects, and is intended to ſerve the very worſt, and moſt miſchievous deſigns againſt them.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. THis equal poſſibility of ſin and guilt in doing other ſervices of Religion amiſs, is not counted by us a ſufficient reaſon to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the doing of them upon.</p>
                  <p>That we judge truly in this caſe, and that this poſſibility of ſin and guilt is not a good reaſon in it ſelf, appears clearly upon theſe two reaſons among many others. Firſt, that it would diſcharge a man from all ſervices of Religion. And Secondly, that it is much better to do a duty as well as we can, though not ſo well as we ſhould, than to diſregard and neglect it altogether.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this reaſon were good, it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a man from all ſervices of Religion, as well as the Holy Sacrament; for there is not any one of theſe which we are not as apt to fail in doing of, as this; and none in which a failure is not in it ſelf as offenſive and provoking to God: both theſe I have made good already; the one relies upon too true
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94519:55"/>
experience, and the other upon plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>We need but obſerve our ſelves, and our own temper, to ſee how oft we offend, or rather to convince us that we cannot tell how oft we offend and do amiſs in our beſt performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James Chap.</hi> 3.2. and truly in all things we offend ſome: we cannot diſcharge any duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon ſo exactly, and ſo truly as we ought, but ſhould God be extream and ſtrict to mark our failings, he might moſt juſtly reject us, and our beſt performances too.</p>
                  <p>Should God deal with us in ſtrict proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by thoſe meaſures that he did with the Jews of old: ſhould he refuſe to accept any ſacrifice, in which there were the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and blemiſh; it were woe with us: our hearts might juſtly tremble within us, as oft as we came into his preſence, and with the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> might cry out with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and dread, <hi>who can ſtand before this holy Lord God!</hi> we ſhould like our guilty proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſt run away from the divine preſence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than come with any comfort or hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and always be afraid to offer any ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to him.</p>
                  <p>For the reaſon is equally true in all; and if it be good in one caſe, it is ſo in another; if aptneſs to do amiſs, and danger to incur Gods diſpleaſure thereby, be a good reaſon to keep men from the Holy Sacrament, it is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94519:55"/>
good alſo to keep them from all other ſervices of their Religion, ſince they are as apt to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and offend God in them, as in this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This cannot be a good reaſon, becauſe it is much better and ſafer to do a duty as well as we can, though we ſin in it, by not doing it ſo well as we ſhould, than wholly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, and not endeavour to do it at all.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo evidently true, that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reaſon of mankind will readily ſubſcribe to the truth of it: it is much better to do a duty as well as we can, than not to eſſay it at all; ſo that ſhould we ſin in doing our duty amiſs, and provoke God in ſtrictneſs of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh us; yet we ſhould ſin more heinouſly, and more grievouſly provoke him, by wholly neglecting, and diſregarding that duty altogether.</p>
                  <p>You need but conſult your own breaſts for this; you would much rather the children or ſervants, &amp;c. ſhould do what you command them, though they do it imperfectly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, than that they ſhould not go about to do it at all; and you can much more eaſily pardon their errors in executing your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, than endure that they ſhould wholly ſlight them, and diſregard what you give them in charge.</p>
                  <p>It argues ſome reſpect to God, and ſome ſenſe of a mans obligation and duty, to do what he hath commanded, though he do not do it ſo well as he ſhould, and perhaps might:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94519:56"/>
but it is next to extremity of profaneſs to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his duty altogether, under a pretence that he cannot do it ſo well as it ought to be done: and certainly God will bear rather with a bungler in his ſervice, than a neglecter of it; and pardon an honeſt endeavour, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many failings, much eaſier than him who never tries, nor endeavours at all.</p>
                  <p>It is our happineſs and comfort, that God hath aſſured us, he will deal with us by theſe meaſures, and accept or reject mens perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances by theſe rules of grace and mercy; for ſo he hath aſſured us in the old Teſtament, that <hi>he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax:</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle hath let us know in the New, that if there be <hi>firſt a willing heart</hi> (an honeſt endeavour to do as well as a man can) <hi>it ſhall be accepted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</hi> Now this muſt needs be a mighty encouragement and comfort to us; and ſufficient to ſet us right in this matter: to make us think it much better and ſafer to do our duty as well as we can (though we be too ſenſible that many errors attend our doing it) than to ſit down in a total diſregard of it.</p>

OUr own confeſſion and practice is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alſo in this caſe; as we do not count this a good reaſon to abſtain from the ſervices of Religion upon, ſo we do act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it; whatever errors and failings attend mens holy things, yet generally they keep up the practice of them; the ſenſe of ſin or guilt in doing them, ſeldom prevails upon them to that degree, as to cauſe them wholly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit, and lay aſide the care of them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe men that are moſt conſcious to themſelves of their errors in hearing Gods word, or in praying to him, yet think it their duty to come to Church, and joyn in the publick ſervice of it; eſteeming it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do ſomthing of their duty, than nothing at all; and judge it a leſſer guilt to err in the manner of doing their duty, than wholly to neglect all doing of it. I appeal to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice: theſe are the meaſures that we act, and judge by in all other inſtances; we do not think we may ſafely neglect our duty, becauſe we fear we ſhall do it amiſs; nor do we think our ſelves diſcharged from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Religion, upon a fear of ſinning, and offending God in the doing of them.</p>

                  <p>NOw from all theſe premiſſes the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion methinks ſhould follow very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince this equal ſenſe of danger and guilt in doing other ſervices of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amiſs, doth not detain us from doing of them, that therefore it ought not to do it in this.</p>
                  <p>In the doing other duties and ſervices of Religion, men do ſo far ſurmount the fear, and danger of ſinning in them, as to keep up the regular and unconſtant practice of them; they do not ſuffer theſe fears ſo far to prevail upon them, as to cauſe them wholly to caſt off the care of them; but they judge it much better to do ſomthing of their duty, than nothing at all; and a much leſs degree of guilt to do their duty, though they fail in it, and fall ſhort of that exactneſs and care that it ſhould be done with; than to ſit down in the total omiſſion of it; to live and die in the neglect of it, as I fear a great many of men do in this.</p>
                  <p>Now in theſe caſes men judge aright, and have both the univerſal reaſon of Mankind, and their own minds to acquit them therein, and certainly they do chooſe the much ſafer ſide of the queſtion. I ask then why they ſhould not proceed by the ſame meaſures, in our preſent caſe? why the ſame reaſon that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94519:57"/>
is ſo evident to us, and ſo effectual upon us in all other caſes, ſhould not be equally ſo in this?</p>
                  <p>I wiſh men would ſoberly conſider things, and judge righteous judgment, and not make differences where there are really none. I told you before, it's an ill ſign when men are ſcrupulous only on one ſide, and when that reaſon which prevails ſo eaſily upon them in one caſe, ſhall not at all affect them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in ſuch a caſe, it is plain mens wills and paſſions make the difference, and not their judgments.</p>
                  <p>And to deal plainly, I am afraid it is juſt ſo in our preſent caſe; men have no mind to come to the Holy Sacrament, and therefore let every little ſhadow of a reaſon keep them from it; it is not becauſe they have any true ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt it, but becauſe they have no inclination to the thing it ſelf. This I take to be the main reaſon, why all our reaſonings with men in this matter, are ſo inſucceſsful; they encounter prejudices, and contrary paſſions, which too commonly are obſtinate and blind, and men will not be perſwaded to quit them, no not when their reaſons are convinced, and all their exceptions and arguments ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>It is not in this caſe only, that men believe with their wills and affections, more than with their judgments; and chooſe, or refuſe things, not as they have true reaſon and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for them, but as they have inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to, or prejudices againſt them. The
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94519:58"/>
main fault of mens being more careleſs to come to the Holy Sacrament, than to other miniſtries of Religion, lies in their wills, more than real judgment; otherwiſe the ſame meaſures would be obſerved in both, and the arguments that prevail with them to act regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in one caſe, would engage them to do ſo in this too.</p>
                  <p>I need not inveigh againſt this temper, mens own reaſon (would they but hear it) would make them aſhamed of it; at preſent I only add, that this argument which keeps men from a neceſſary duty, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to it, can never be divine or true, nor can it be ſafe to relie upon it; ſo that although men were not able to ſee, or anſwer the ſophiſtry of it, nor ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the falſhood of it did lie, yet it would be its own confutation; for that argument can never be of God, which perſwades men to live in the neglect of a duty, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands have made neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when we come to weigh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in this caſe, we ſhould always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline moſt to thoſe, which teach us our duty, and encourage us in it, becauſe this is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſafer ſide. Nay, I add further, that were our minds purely pendulous, were there arguments on both ſides of the queſtion, that appeared equally true and concluding, ſo that we were not able to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, nor knew which to incline un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94519:58"/>
yet this alone were enough to turn the ſcales. One doth invite and encourage me to do my duty, what I ſee the plain command of God for, the other doth diſcourage and fright me from it; and therefore if I were not able to diſcover by any internal ſignatures on which ſide the truth doth lie; yet this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſideration is ſufficient to determine my choice: for it is certainly more ſafe to do my duty as well as I can, than wholly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it; and that argument which encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me hereunto, is certainly on the ſurer and ſafer ſide.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (to conclude this period) ſince we do proceed by this rule in all other caſes, we ſhould proceed by it alſo in this; ſince we do not permit the poſſibility, and fear of doing other duties amiſs, to detain us from them, we ſhould not ſuffer it to keep us from this.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third Conſideration that I propoſed as an argument for this ſecond Collection is this. The Puniſhment threatned to eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> is no greater, than what may be feared upon our doing other ſervices of our Religion amiſs, and is threatned thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is an argument that ought clearly to be proceeded upon, becauſe it comes up directly to that which ſome men make the chief exception againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, and which they commonly urge this place in defence of; they tell us, they are loth to be damn'd, (and I readily grant they have good reaſon to be ſo:) but they are much more unwilling to damn themſelves, (and for this they are not to be blamed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) Now both theſe (they ſay) they are greatly afraid of, if they come to the Holy Sacrament <hi>unworthily:</hi> for damnation is here expreſly threatned to him that doth thus, yea, he is ſaid to eat and drink his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:94519:59"/>Now what I have already ſaid before, might go a great way towards taking off this exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and if Men remember the true noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eating and drinking unworthily in this place, it would go near to relieve wholly their fear in this thing: for I have ſhewed, that it is not every failure in receiving the Holy Sacrament, that brings a man within the reach of eating and drinking unworthily, in the ſenſe of this Text: but only that groſs and ſcandalous profanation of it, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of, or ſomething that in true proportion anſwers to it.</p>
               <p>And conſequently, that it is not every ſuch failure that brings a man within the danger of that <hi>damnation</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; men need not preſently fear being damned upon every error and little failure in doing their duty: they have a more merciful God to deal with, who doth not weigh men by grains and ſcruples, but rates their ſervices, as he doth their lives, by the general frame and bent of them, and provided that men do their duty, and honeſtly endeavour to do it as well as they can, hath promiſed to accept them, though many imperfections ſtick to them; and ſuch as (ſhould he deal in ſtrict juſtice) might cauſe him to reject and abhor them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, it is only that monſtrous profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Sacrament which the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were guilty of; that makes a man to eat and drink <hi>unworthily</hi> in the ſenſe of this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94519:60"/>
Text; and therefore only that, or ſomthing as bad, that brings him in danger of that <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> which is here threatned; ſo that unleſs men be guilty of the ſame ſin, they have no reaſon to fear the ſame puniſhment.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not put the ſatisfaction of this ſcruple only upon this; but conſider it in it ſelf; and examin whether there be any thing in it fit to be made an exception againſt this ſervice; in order to which, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Give the true ſenſe of the phraſe, and ſhew how men miſtake in their apprehenſion of, and deductions from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew that if men did not miſtake the meaning of it, yet they do not deal juſtly and fairly in neglecting the Holy Sacrament upon that reaſon.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt thing to be performed to our preſent purpoſe is to give the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this phraſe, and there are two expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which will need explication. Firſt, <hi>Damnation,</hi> and Secondly, <hi>eating and drinking damnation to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt word to be explained is <hi>damnation,</hi> a word that makes a dreadful noiſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries terror in the very ſound of it; it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſignifies any judgment, or puniſhment whatever: but it is commonly appropriated and reſtrained to ſignifie that terrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94519:60"/>
in Hell, which God hath prepared for all obſtinate, and impenitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Now the thing chiefly incumbent upon me, is to ſhew what the ſignification of it is in this place; and to inquire whether the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it do require us to reſtrain it to this dreadful puniſhment, as thoſe that make this objection always underſtand it: for if men miſtake in their underſtanding it thus, then they miſtake in their exception too, and the reaſon of it falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall need to do very little more, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I ſaid in the literal expoſition of the Text, to my preſent purpoſe: where I ſhewed,</p>
                  <p>Firſt that the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry general and indefinite ſignification; and is indifferently uſed to expreſs any judgment or puniſhment from God or man; temporal or eternal; upon the body, or the ſoul, or both; and accordingly is uſed in Scripture alſo, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for temporal, ſometimes for eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for any external chaſtiſement in this world, as well as thoſe eternal ones in the next; it were eaſie to inſtance the places in which it is uſed in both ſignifications, were the thing neceſſary, or not well known.</p>
                  <p>From this ſignification therefore of the word, we cannot infer any thing certain here; it may ſignifie the one, or it may ſignifie the other; and from any thing in the bare word, or uſe of it in Authors ſacred or profane, we cannot reſtrain it to eternal damnation only;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94519:61"/>
becauſe it is uſed by them to ſignifie tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chaſtiſements and puniſhments as well as that; and therefore as in other like caſes, we uſe to find out the ſenſe of an Author, when he uſeth words of an indefinite ſignification, by conſidering the circumſtances of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe in that place; ſo we muſt do here, fix the ſenſe of this indefinite word <hi>damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by conſidering the circumſtances of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in this place.</p>
                  <p>Which if we do, I have ſhewed ſecondly, that we ſhall ſoon find the Apoſtle doth not uſe the word <hi>damnation</hi> here in the terrible dreadful ſenſe of it; nor intend eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in hell by it: and conſequently that men argue amiſs, and wide of the Apoſtles ſenſe, that fix that dreadful meaning upon it. There are two things plain in the context, to warrant me in this aſſertion. Firſt, that the puniſhments inflicted for this crime are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporal. And Secondly, that they are ſaid to be inflicted on purpoſe to prevent this final <hi>damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, all the puniſhments that he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in are plainly temporary; this you may ſee evidently in the following Verſe: <hi>for this cauſe many are ſick, and many are weak among you, and ſome are fallen aſleep.</hi> This ſin of yours hath provoked God againſt you, and he hath inflicted ſeveral judgments upon you for it; ſundry ſorts of diſeaſes (as our Church ſpeaks) rage amongſt you, and ſome are actually cut off by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:94519:61"/>Where (you ſee) there is not a word of eternal damnation in hell; nothing like it, nor any thing that can be interpreted to that meaning; only ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes, and (at moſt) death: and that you may not think it means eternal death, or ſpoken of as a preface to it, as it is to all thoſe that are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally damned; it is expreſſed by the mild and gentle phraſe of <hi>falling aſleep,</hi> a phraſe that is always uſed in holy Scripture in a good ſenſe; for the death of good men, and men capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mercy, and not of thoſe upon whom the <hi>wrath of God abideth,</hi> and whom he will <hi>turn into hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, all theſe puniſhments are ſpoken of as medicinal; inflicted by way of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and on purpoſe to prevent this final <hi>damnation;</hi> this is plain from verſe 30, 31. <hi>for if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged, but when we are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> The plain meaning of all which is this, you might by judging, and calling your ſelves to account for this ſin, prevent Gods puniſhing of you with theſe judgments; and his inflicting of them, though it be juſt, and juſtly due to ſo great a miſcarriage, yet it is in his mercy, to bring you to reform this error, and to prevent the being further puniſhed for it.</p>
                  <p>Where theſe two things are very plain: Firſt that theſe puniſhments were (as almoſt all the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94519:62"/>
divine judgments in this world are) purely medicinal: <hi>i. e.</hi> intended to amend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe vices in them that ſuffered them, and in them that beheld them: they were not wrathful exciſions, and revengeful cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men off in their ſins, without all hope of pardon, or ſpace given for repentance and amendment; as God ſometimes deals with great and notorious offenders, ſore ſickneſſes, lingring diſeaſes, and great weakneſſes, wherein they had time to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and amend their faults, and over and beſide had a Preacher ſent on purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in theſe things.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, that where the wrath fell heavieſt, and the judgment proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, even to death it ſelf; yet even there that death was in commutation; and the merciful juſtice of God ſatisfied with it, ſo as to proceed no further in puniſhing: <hi>we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From both which obſervations, it is plain, that temporal puniſhments are all that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle inſtanceth in, or relates unto in this place; and theſe without any the leaſt refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to eternal <hi>damnation.</hi> Yea theſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in oppoſition to it, exchanges for it, and means finally to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (I think) ſufficient to our underſtanding the meaning of <hi>damnation</hi> in this place; and that it ſignifies only Gods
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94519:62"/>
judging men, and puniſhing of them with ſome temporary afflictions in this world: ſo that though the word <hi>damnation</hi> do ſignifie, and in ſome places of Scripture intend dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the worſt and moſt terrible ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it; yet it doth neither intend, nor ſignifie it in this place, and therefore they that ſo underſtand it, and argue from it, do both theſe quite beſide the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle in it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>BUT there is another expreſſion here that ſtartles ſome men, and will need explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that is <hi>eating and drinking damnation to himſelf:</hi> by this ſome ignorant people think that ſomething extraordinary is certainly ſignified, and ſome ſuch meaning intended, as if a man were more acceſſary to his own damnation, or more immediately damned himſelf by this miſcarriage, than by any other ſin.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>drink damnation</hi> to a mans ſelf ſounds harſhly, and is a terrible ſaying; and no man needs be blamed for being unwilling to damn himſelf. And truly (by the way) I heartily wiſh every man were ſo, in all other caſes as well as this: but why men ſhould be ſhie and fearful of damning themſelves in this inſtance and not in others, or why they ſhould think they do it in this, more than others, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:94519:63"/>In order to the giving ſatisfaction in this, I ſhall firſt explain the phraſe: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhew that it intends not to ſignifie any greater or more immediate influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans damnation in this, than in other ſins. Thirdly, to which I ſhall deſire may be taken in what I have ſaid before, that no greater guilt is ſaid to be contracted in this, than in many other ſins.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the phraſe of <hi>eating and drinking damnation</hi> to a mans ſelf; it is but a common phraſe, and intends no more than expoſing a mans ſelf to the wrath of God, and making himſelf obnoxious to divine puniſhments. I have ſhewed already what damnation ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in this place, and what the Apoſtle refers it unto, <hi>viz.</hi> not eternal damnation in hell, but external, corporal caſtigations, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this world. And then <hi>eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation</hi> can ſignifie no more, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a mans ſelf to thoſe puniſhments, and provoking God to inflict them upon him.</p>
                  <p>So that in the true intendment and refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of it in this place, it doth not reſpect eternal damnation at all; nor is there any reaſon (that I know of) to dread it more in this, than other tranſgreſſions and ſins: The form of ſpeech is but anſwerable to thoſe well known, and often uſed phraſes in other places of Scripture. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> And <hi>why will ye die O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> &amp;c. in which no more is intended but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94519:63"/>
this, you do by your own follies and faults ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelves to the wrath of God: you provoke him, yea you even force him to afflict and puniſh you, who is otherwiſe merciful and gracious, unwilling and ſlow to puniſh the <hi>work of his own hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I add Secondly, ſo do men do by other failures and miſcarriages as well as this; and there is no more immediate or direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon a mans own miſery or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in one caſe than in the other.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain every mans deſtruction is of himſelf, and there are many ways by which men incenſe God againſt them, and provoke him to puniſh them; and amongſt thoſe this is one: they do in this miſcarriage, as they do in many others, draw down the divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon themſelves; but they do in this, but juſt what they do in others; and for my part, I know no reaſon to make any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference upon.</p>
                  <p>I know too well that ſome men who had deſigns to ſerve, by ſcaring men from the Holy Sacrament, have invented terrible phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and uſed frightful ways of ſpeaking in this matter: but I do not know what reaſon there is for them, nor whether it be worth my ſtay to examin them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have ſo commonly called the Chalice a <hi>cup of poyſon,</hi> and compared unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy drinking the one, to a wilful drinking of the other; I think ſtand accountable to God
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94519:64"/>
for a diſparagement and diſhonour to the blood of Chriſt next to blaſphemy; and are highly concerned to conſider how they can anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that talk ſo dreadfully of mens <hi>ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their own ſouls</hi> in this, and becoming <hi>ſelf-murtherers,</hi> &amp;c. uſe words of fancy, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing but by a figure; and nothing in this caſe more than all others, where men heedleſly or wilfully prevaricate their duty, and incenſe God againſt them.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe that tell us, that men do in this <hi>ſeal their own damnation,</hi> and even covenant with God to be damned, beſide that they ſpeak only of their own heads, ſpeak it upon a great miſtake of the reaſon, why the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſometimes called Seals by Divines, and by the Holy Scriptures too.</p>
                  <p>I know Circumciſion is once called by S. <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Seal, Rom.</hi> 4.11. but I do not know, whether this be preſently a good warrant, for calling all the Sacraments of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seals or not. But if I do allow this Holy Sacrament to be a <hi>Seal,</hi> I muſt have it remembred that it is a Seal on Gods part, and not on ours, and that Divines mean thus, when they thus ſpeak: God Almighty is pleaſed to ratifie and confirm the truth of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant to us, by theſe Symbols, and Seals of it (if you pleaſe to call them ſo) and in ſome ſenſe to <hi>Seal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

how they are Seals on our part, or what we can be ſaid to Seal unto, in any other than a metaphorical and borrowed way of ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, Gods Covenant and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it are made to us upon the conditions of faith and obedience; and though theſe are not only ſuppoſed in them that come to the Holy Sacrament, and may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be promiſed and adſtipulated unto by them at ſuch times, yet that is but a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſecondary deſign of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the prime deſign of it is to confirm our faith in God, and not to <hi>Seal</hi> our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him; and the Sacraments are but juſt ſuch arguments and engagements upon us to become good men, as our faith in the divine promiſes is, which are all made to us only upon that condition: and he that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his belief of thoſe promiſes, doth oblige himſelf to that condition, or elſe he believes like a fool, and upon no reaſon at all.</p>
                  <p>But had I not ſaid one word of this matter, I might ſafely have replied, that whatever men may be ſaid to <hi>Seal</hi> to in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it is not to their own damnation. Why yes ſay ſome, but thoſe that eat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily do ſo: for he that Seals with God for life and ſalvation, upon the condition of faith and obedience, doth in effect Seal to his own damnation, upon his failing to believe and to obey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:94519:65"/>But I ſay ſtill this is a great miſtake, for the Contract or Covenant is only about ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the incurring damnation no part of it at all, but only by conſequence, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mens failing to make good the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof: infidelity and diſobedience will as certainly forfeit ſalvation with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as with it; and I do not ſee that an ill man is in a ſurer way to damnation after the Sacrament, than he was in before it.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſpeak thus to leſſen the obligation, that receiving the Holy Sacrament lays upon all to dead good lives; nor in the leaſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that breaking our promiſes then made to God is not a very great ſin, and that which muſt be ſeverely accounted for; but only to extenuate, or take off that dread of coming to the Holy Sacrament, which is brought upon mens ſpirits, when they hear ſuch terrible things ſaid of it.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill this is a matter beſides our preſent queſtion; for whatever guilt or damnation a man may contract and incur by failing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the promiſe that he makes to God, and ſeems to <hi>Seal</hi> in the Holy Sacrament, it is a thing which reſpects his failing to live as he ſhould after it; and not his eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily in it; the guilt is contracted after his receiving the Holy Sacrament, and not at it: and whatever damnation he may incur by his fault afterwards, yet he did not Seal to his own damnation in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:94519:65"/>I might add another conſideration perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our preſent purpoſe here (but that I have ſaid it already) that there is no reaſon to dread any ſuch extraordinary guilt in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking amiſs, above what may be juſtly feared in doing other duties of Religion amiſs. But this I have conſidered, and (I hope) ſufficiently made good before; and therefore muſt refer to that place for it. And only conſider two ſhort ſurmiſes, that may be entertained againſt this aſſertion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this phraſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is really a greater profanation of Chriſtian Religion, than failure in other ſervices of it is; this is counted the moſt high, ſacred, and venerable ſervice in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and hath always been ſo eſteemed and called in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it hath: and ſuch a groſs profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of, is certainly a very heinous ſin: but that doth not render every imperfection and failure in Communicating, the greateſt ſin that may be; or higher preſently than men can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in other ſervices of their Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Apoſtle ſeems plainly to ſay ſo, Verſe 17. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever that expreſſion may ſeem to imply, it doth really ſignifie no more, than the expreſſion in this Text, that I am all this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94519:66"/>
while conſidering; it means only this in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſuch perſons are guilty of a great diſreſpect, and diſhonour to the body and blood of Chriſt, of which the Bread and Wine in the Holy Sacrament are the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives and Symbols: for a profanation of theſe reflects upon him whom they repreſent, and was ever interpreted and thought to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe is well expreſſed in this Text, <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body;</hi> i. e. not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a ſacred and venerable thing they repreſent, and ſignifie: and therefore uſing them with as little reſpect, or religious regard, as men do common bread, and wine in their own houſes. This I have ſhewed the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> did, and ſomething worſe; and the truth is, the guilt of ſuch a groſs profanation cannot well be repreſented in too terrible a phraſe.</p>
                  <p>So that ſtill for any thing either ſaid in this Text, or that can reaſonably be deduced from the phraſe of it, my argument ſtands firm: <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no greater puniſhment threatned to a failure in this, than may be dreaded upon the like failure in other ſervices of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>Damnation ſignifies here only divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puniſhment at large; and there is no reaſon to reſtrain it only to that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous puniſhment in hell. Yea, there is that plain in the context which is evidently againſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94519:66"/>
that ſenſe of it: for when the Apoſtle had ſpoken of damnation here, he preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in temporal inflictions, being <hi>ſick and weak and falling aſleep,</hi> all which he not only calls being <hi>chaſtened in this world,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaſtened that they <hi>ſhould not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then conſonantly to this, the <hi>eating and drinking this damnation to a mans ſelf,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth no more than expoſing a mans ſelf, and becoming obnoxious to theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and chaſtenings of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (I think) are plain, ſufficient to make out the truth of my argument; and in conſequence of that to ſhew how much wide of the Apoſtles meaning here, thoſe men argue, that talk ſo dreadfully of everlaſting damnation, being eminently due to every fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure in mens receiving the Holy Sacrament; and that they ſtand accountable to God, for a greater ſin, and an higher profanation of Religion in this, then they do by their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in other duties and ſervices of it.</p>

                  <p>WEll, but becauſe it may yet be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the purpoſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whatever the minute and prime ſignification be: yet eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily cannot but be accounted a great ſin, highly affrontive to the body and blood of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94519:67"/>
our Lord, and therefore a high provocation of God, and a fault that he may moſt juſtly puniſh with eternal damnation. Therefore I proceed to the ſecond thing that I propoſed on this argument, that whatever the meaning of damnation be in this place, yet men do not deal fairly in urging it againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament, or ſtaying from it upon that reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſhall endeavour to make good upon theſe two reaſons amongſt others. Firſt, becauſe if it ſhould mean eternal <hi>damnation,</hi> yet it is not threatned to every degree of eating and drinking unworthily, but only to that groſs and monſtrous doing this, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of. And Secondly, becauſe this damnation doth not reſtrain men from other ſins, which they muſt acknowledge to be as damning as this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt of theſe I need but juſt name, becauſe I have inſiſted upon it largely alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: here I ſhall only add two ſhort Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations further, relative to this matter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is not fair dealing with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to extend the ſignification of it beyond the proper intendment and meaning; or to take a liberty of frighting people with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eating and drinking unworthily, upon every failure, when the Apoſtle uſed that phraſe only in the caſe of ſuch a prodigious profanation of the Sacrament, as the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were now guilty of. I have already ſaid,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94519:67"/>
their miſcarriage might well be counted eating and drinking unworthily indeed; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to infer that every failure to eat and drink ſo reverently, ſo fitly, and ſo becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as men ſhould, is preſently eating and drinking unworthily in proportion to them, is putting our own ſenſe upon Scripture, and judging the things of Religion by our own meaſures only.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly I add, that it is unreaſonable, as well as uncharitable, to affright men with danger of the ſame puniſhment, when they are far enough from the ſame ſin. It is Gods prerogative to apportion puniſhments unto ſins, and not ours: and as much our duty, as it is our intereſt, to make a difference there, where it is plain the divine mercy doth. It is greatly for our comfort, and the eaſe of our guilty minds, that we have a God to ſerve, who tranſacts with us by the meaſures of a great mercy, and an infinite goodneſs; that weighs us not (as I obſerved before) by grains and ſcruples, but rates our ſervices and our lives too, by the general frame and bent of them; and provided we be induſtrious, and honeſt in the main, and ſincerely endeavour to do our beſt, will accept them, and not be extream and rigorous to mark every thing that is done amiſs, or every little imperfection that may attend them.</p>
                  <p>This is the great comfort and ſupport of our hopes; and to rob us of this, is certainly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94519:68"/>
a mighty injury and diſſervice to us: and yet this in their proportion they do, that alarm and frighten men with danger of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon every little failure in this matter, though never ſo ſhort of that, to which it is only threatned. I have ſhewed you it is not an eaſie thing for any Chriſtian to be guilty of this ſin, related to in the Text; and I verily believe it: and therefore why they that are really ſo far from it, yea who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the very thoughts of it, ſhould be ſo amuſed and perplexed with apprehenſions and fears of the puniſhments due to it, I know not. I am ſure in all other caſes men deſire we ſhould bend the bough rather the other way, and think themſelves ſeverely judged, and hardly dealt with, if we do not: and therefore to teach men to believe, and fear ſo in this, is <hi>to make them ſad whom the Lord hath not made ſad:</hi> and to bring an evil report upon the divine goodneſs, yea juſtice too.</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond thing upon which I charge men with unreaſonableneſs, in urging the danger of damnation in coming to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, and pretending to ſtay from the one upon a fear of the other, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this fear of damnation doth not reſtrain them from other ſins, which they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs are as damning as this can be. There
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94519:68"/>
are other ſins in which men incur the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eternal damnation, as really as they can be thought to do, in failing to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſo worthily as they ſhould; and yet it is too notorious, that this fear of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not reſtrain them from them.</p>
                  <p>It is a hard ſaying, but it is too true, thoſe very men that are ſo very ſcrupulous, and ſo very fearful of damnation in this, yet appear openly regardleſs, and proof againſt all fear of it in other things, wherein it is as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary to be feared.</p>
                  <p>There are too many men on one hand, that can live and perſiſt obſtinately in plain Schiſm, allow themſelves in rebellions and the moſt factious courſes: oppoſing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpeaking evil of dignities, pride and uncharitableneſs; judging and raſh cenſuring of their brethren, fraud and hypocriſie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and knavery, and all ſorts of ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual vices as theſe, without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
                  <p>And I would to God I could not ſay as truly, that there are too many on the other hand, that will allow themſelves in open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery: make no conſcience of raillery and profaneſs; of intemperance, and uncleanneſs; of whoredom and drunkenneſs, and that curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humour of Swearing, which hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo among us to the ſhame of the Nation, and for which it mourns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:94519:69"/>There are too many (I ſay) of both ſorts, that live without any apprehenſion or fear of damnation in theſe things, who yet when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the Holy Sacrament, or reproved for the neglect of it, ſeem wonderful ſcrupulous, and fearful of damnation if they ſhould come to it, and think to excuſe the neglect of one, with their fears of the other, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways plead in vindication of it.</p>
                  <p>Now I appeal to the reaſon of all men, whether this be fair and honeſt dealing, or whether it be not plain colluſion and ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: were there any true reaſon to fear dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation here (which yet I have ſhewed there is not) yet men were not juſt and fair, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſo much fear of it in this, and yet ſurmounting ſo eaſily that fear in others.</p>
                  <p>I have told you before in this diſcourſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and I ſhall have occaſion to tell it you again, that it's a bad ſign to ſee men ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous only in ſome few things; and there is not a plainer mark of an hypocrite, than to be ſhie and fearful of ſin and damnation in ſome leſſer things, but venturous and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of it in others, that are perhaps far greater. It was this which our Saviour ſo often charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Phariſees, and for which he ſo ſharply condemned them as a pack of fulſom errant hypocrites; and men had need to look to it, for they will draw upon themſelves the ſame imputation, if they be of the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:94519:69"/>If the fear of damnation therefore influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you in this one, let it in Gods name do ſo in other inſtances that are more groſs and obvious. If the fear of damnation in this be true and ſincere, it will do this (for damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtill the ſame thing, and equally to be dreaded,) but if it do not, it is plain you uſe it as ſubterfuge, and artifice: you proclaim your own inſincerity and hypocriſie in it; and the excuſe it ſelf not only aggravates, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes part of the crime.</p>
                  <p>I have added this Conſideration only <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and to argue with ſome men even upon their own pretences; and if they will honeſtly reflect upon it, it will hardly fail of ſome effect on them: but to others that are really ſcrupulous and fearful of damnation, upon every failure to receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo well as they ſhould, and argue their fears upon the reaſon of this Text; to theſe (I ſay) the former Conſideration will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſince it is not this eternal damnation that the Apoſtle means in this place. And let me add, that if eternal damnation be not threatned to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> here, who ſo ſhamefully and groſly profaned this holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, much leſs is it preſently to be feared by thoſe, who receive it as well as they can, though not ſo well as they ſhould; if ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream groſs and ſcandalous a profanation be not threatned with it; ſurely every ſmall fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure needs not fear it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I advance now to the fourth Conſideration, which I propoſed for the truth of our preſent Collection, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatever ſin or guilt there is in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily,</hi> there is the ſame, yea there is greater in not eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe truth and reaſonableneſs of this relies upon a reaſon that I have made good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and that is, that eating and drinking in the Holy Sacrament is a neceſſary indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty, tyed immediately upon all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the command of their Lord; and that upon a reaſon, which will ever have effect upon all thoſe that have any love and reſpect to him: yea which will ſtill improve, and in every age grow ſtronger and ſtronger. I ſhall not, and I hope I need not reſume this argument, becauſe I have diſcharged it pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well already; and therefore ſhall little more than give in the heads of what hath been more fully repreſented.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Then I have obſerved that the command for this duty is as poſitive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, as any command for any other duty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94519:70"/>
is, or can be; and this we ſhall be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, if we look into the ſtory of it's inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is related by three Evangeliſts, and almoſt in the very ſame words. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. from 26. to the 29. Verſ. <hi>As they did eat, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave to the diſciples, and ſaid, take eat, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The ſame you have alſo in the other two Evangeliſts, S. <hi>Mark Cap.</hi> 14.22, 23, 24. <hi>Verſes,</hi> and in S. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo, <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.19, 20. <hi>Verſes,</hi> in all which places our Lord doth not only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dminiſter this Holy Sacrament himſelf, but expreſsly commands them to do ſo likewiſe. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> This that you have ſeen me do, do you take care to do alſo, after that I am gone from you; in which words it is plain, that our Lord inſtitutes this, and enjoyns it to be a ſtanding ſervice in his Church, and to be obſerved and practiſed by all the members of it.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, The Apoſtles were at this time Chriſts little flock, the firſt fruits of that Church which he was going to plant in the world, and it is plain in the ſtory, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred it to them all.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, If we are to reſpect them here peculiarly as Apoſtles, whom he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the firſt and chief Paſtors and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94519:71"/>
of the Church: the argument is equally concluding ſtill; for making it their duty to Conſecrate, and Adminiſter the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, he doth make it the duty of others alſo, to partake of it, and to have it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them.</p>
               <p>And if we take in part of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtory to this, Acts the ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> at the latter end, we ſhall ſee that the Apoſtles did thus underſtand this Command of their Lord, and did practiſe accordingly, as ſoon as ever they had gathered the face of a Church, for they continued <hi>in breaking of bread,</hi> as well as in prayer; and as conſtant and daily in one, as in the other.</p>
               <p>This muſt needs be to our great ſatisfaction in this matter. Our Saviour did inſtitute, and command this ſervice to be in his Church: and his Apoſtles underſtood him ſo, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did practiſe it, and keep it up as a ſtanding Service in the Church, as ſoon as ever they had gathered one; and the members of this Church continued daily in the obſervance of it, as well as prayer; from all which if any thing can be plain, this is ſo, that Chriſt intended the Holy Sacrament to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtanding Service in his Church; and that the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians did accordingly obſerve, and keep up the practice of it, and this too as carefully and conſtantly as the publick Prayers. And if this be not enough to evince it to be every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94519:71"/>
duty to obſerve it, yea to obſerve it as well as any other publick Service of the Chriſtian Church; nothing is, and nothing can be ſo.</p>
               <p>And ſince we are engaged again on this Subject, let me add S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s repreſenting of this matter to the ſame purpoſe: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. 24, 25. <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night that he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and ſaid take eat, this is my body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me: after the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, this cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, this do ye, as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles were all that our Lord immediately and by himſelf conſecrated, and appointed Paſtors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of his Church: and 'tis well worthy of obſervation that he gives this in charge equally to both, and takes care that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould no more go out uninſtructed in it, than his own immediate Apoſtles, but that he ſhould ſet up the practice of it among the Gentiles, as well as they in the Churches of the Jews: <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain terms, that all both Jews and Gentiles that ſhould embrace his Religion, ſhould equally practiſe this, as a ſtanding and conſtant Service in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church: and it is certain, that both theſe Churches did accordingly obſerve and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the ſame.</p>

                  <p>BUT then leſt it ſhould be thought a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary tranſient inſtitution only, which was to continue only while the Apoſtles lived, or ſome little time after, as ſome few other things were. Therefore I obſerved in the ſecond place, the reaſon with which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt is backed, and what our Lord hath declared to be the great end and purpoſe of it: now this is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>in remembrance of me, this do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me;</hi> which reaſon doth clearly ſhew this precept to be no temporary one only, but to be even morally and perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I think I may ſay <hi>morally;</hi> for the pious, grateful, devout, and joyful remembrance of our Saviour, and of his great love in what he undertook, and underwent for our ſakes, is an inſtance ſurely of moral juſtice; and as indiſpenſibly, and everlaſtingly due from us, as gratitude is to a great benefactor, or any inſtance of natural Religion is to God: and certainly he that thinks otherwiſe, diſhonours, and diſparageth this love, and makes himſelf for ever unworthy of it. If ever any love were worthy to be remembred; if ever any thing that God did for man deſerved, and might in juſtice challenge our higheſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and praiſe, this certainly doth; and I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94519:72"/>
would to God, that ſome men would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, and remember this too, how they can hope for the benefit of it, and yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to remember it, and to remember it by that, which himſelf hath appointed to be the ſolemn rite of that commemoration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſaid perpetually obliging too; and this I ſay now, not only upon the former reaſon, that its end is a moral good; and what is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good is unalterably and eternally oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but I ſpeak it upon a particular reſpect to the reaſon of its inſtitution, which is ſo far from wearing out, that it will improve upon our hands, and grow ſtronger in every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding period of the Church than other: there will always be the ſame reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the love of our dying Lord; for that love will always appear the ſame, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it will continue the ſame too; ſo that the reaſon of this ſervice will in every age continue the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But there is another Conſideration which will make it to improve and grow ſtronger, and ſtronger; for time is a grand conſumer and waſter of things: and the memory of the greateſt kindneſs and bleſſing in a long tract of time is apt to decay, and wear off of mens minds; ſo that the further that men live off from the time of our Saviours paſſion, the more danger they are in of forgetting it, and the more need they have of ſomething to fix it the more deeply and indelibly upon their minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:94519:73"/>So that this reaſon will ſtill improve, and we therefore that live at this diſtance of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years from it, had need to be more obſervant of this inſtitution to refreſh our memories, than they that lived but a very few years, or days after it; and ſo every age that ſhall ſucceed us, will have more need ſtill, till the final diſſolution, when <hi>the Lord ſhall come</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) when we ſhall ſee him, whom we now commemorate, and have all our pious acts of remembring him ſuperſeded, by the bliſsful viſion of, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon him for ever.</p>

                  <p>I Might take in ſome other Conſiderations to add to the ſtrength of theſe, all which combine to render this precept more effectual, and obliging, if it were poſſible than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I will little more than juſt name ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This was the laſt inſtitution of our dying Lord; and the thing that he gave us in charge, juſt when he was going to ſuffer, and die for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the peculiar precept of the Goſpel; and that which may be more truly called the command of our Saviour, than any other.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, it is plain, and eaſie to be obeyed, not in the leaſt chargeable or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94519:73"/>
as ſome ſuch inſtitutions before were; nor in any meaſure more difficult than any other ſervice in our Religion is.</p>
                  <p>But I will not enlarge upon theſe here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have done it formerly in another place; and in truth, I only mention them, and what hath preceded on purpoſe to make good the ground of my preſent Argument; to let men ſee that it muſt needs be a ſin, and to convince them (if it be poſſible) that it muſt needs be a very great and heinous ſin, too, to live and die (as I fear too many do) in the neglect of ſuch a duty, and total diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſuch a command of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I cannot tell what notion ſome men may have of ſin; but I think if any omiſſion, and neglect of men may be called a ſin, this may: if ſin be (as the Apoſtle tell us it is) <hi>a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law,</hi> then certainly a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a law muſt be a ſin; and the more arguments there are to inforce this law, and the more reaſons to preſs us to the obſervation of it; the more heinous and provoking muſt it certainly be, to live in the conſtant diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe things be ſo, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of thus much at leaſt; that whatever the ſin and danger of eating unworthily can be, it muſt needs be acknowledged to be a great ſin, and great danger not to eat at all.</p>
                  <p>But I ſaid ſomething more, and that is that what ſin ſoever eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94519:74"/>
can be thought to be, neglecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to eat and drink at all muſt needs be a greater; the reaſon of this is plain from what hath been ſaid before, for one is only failing to do a duty ſo well as men ſhould, and ought to do it, but the other is refuſing the duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and choſing rather to live in a total diſregard of it. And men that do their duty, though not ſo well as they ſhould, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are more excuſable, than thoſe that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſregard and neglect it.</p>
                  <p>The univerſal reaſon (as I hinted before) of all the world will allow this: every man judgeth by this meaſure himſelf, and we are aſſured that God will do ſo too: if I am a Tutor, or a Maſter, or a Parent; I can much eaſier forgive my Scholar, or Servant, or Child, that out of ſome regard to my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and command, goes about what I bid him, though he do it awkardly, and far from that exactneſs that I might expect; than I ſhould if he altogether diſregarded my autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and never took any care at all to do what I commanded him.</p>
                  <p>And God himſelf hath told us, that he will rate mens ſervices by the ſame rules; that if there <hi>be a willing mind</hi> and endeavour to do our beſt, the <hi>will accept it according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</hi> Wilful deſigned failures in duty are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly provoking, I confeſs, and he that eats and drinks unworthily in that ſenſe, I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94519:74"/>
am far from excuſing, or extenuating his crime; but failings that are almoſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the effects of human infirmity and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only, or defects only of knowledge and skill, are greatly pitiable, and ſcarce ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reckoned for, by God, or man.</p>

                  <p>THeſe premiſes being now laid, I advance the Concluſion that reſults from them; that therefore the ſin and danger of eating unworthily, can never excuſe a man from not eating at all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For firſt one ſin can never excuſe for another, and much leſs can the poſſibility of ſinning become a good reaſon for actually doing ſo: apply it to the caſe before us, and the thing is plain; a man may ſin in eating and drinking unworthily, but he certainly doth ſo in not eating at all; and therefore deſerves ſomething a worſe character than a fool only, if he can think that the poſſible danger of the one, can expiate, and attone for the certainty of the other; he doth ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that commits one ſin, but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits another upon the reaſon of the firſt, doth much worſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, It is altogether unreaſonable, and unjuſt to be moved by the fear of ſining in one thing, and yet to ſurmount the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſining in another; if ſin deſerve to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94519:75"/>
be dreaded and ſhun'd in one caſe, it ſhould ſo in the other too; and if it be not, men deal unequally, are partial in the law, and (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being <hi>doers of the law,</hi> they become unjuſt <hi>Judges,</hi> and perverters of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay Thirdly, It is plain fraud, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hypocriſie, to be ſhie and fearful of that which is certainly a leſſer ſin, but regardleſs of that which is greater: this is to <hi>ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel;</hi> and with the Phariſees to be ſcrupulous of every appearance of evil in ſome things, but to live without all ſenſe and dread of the greateſt and groſſeſt ſins in others.</p>
                  <p>The whole world muſt cry out of fraud and pageantry in ſuch dealings; it cannot be conſcience, and honeſty that governs men in them; and they had beſt look to it, that while they think well of themſelves, for being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and fearful of ſin in one thing, they be not condemned as groſs and wretched Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, for being without any ſenſe of it in others: this is a conſideration, that ought to ſtick cloſe upon ſome mens thoughts, who cry out ſo much of the ſin, and danger of <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking unworthily,</hi> and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for tender conſcienced men upon that reaſon; but all the while live in a total neglect of the Holy Sacrament, never thinking what a grievous ſin it muſt needs be, to live in the neglect of that, which the laws of Chriſt hath
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94519:75"/>
tied upon all Chriſtians, and that upon ſuch a reaſon as can never fail of having effect upon every honeſt man.</p>
                  <p>For ſhame let us conſider better, and <hi>ſhew our ſelves men,</hi> and not like weak men and fools, delude our ſelves with ſuch ſilly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pretences as theſe: can we think we deal ſincerely with God, or our own ſouls either, in making ſuch a noiſe with our ſcruples and fears of ſin in doing our duty, but live ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without all remorſe in the great ſin of wholly neglecting it? if we can believe this, we may believe any thing that we pleaſe: we have more need of phyſick, than inſtruction; we may eaſily be cheated into deſtruction, nay we ſuperſede all need of that, for we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably cheat and deceive our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I add a fifth Conſideration to confirm the reaſonableneſs of our ſecond Collection, <hi>viz.</hi> That this danger of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> is cauſed by our own only default, and is what with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent care we may redreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe plain Engliſh of what I mean is this, if men be unfit for the Holy Sacrament, or in any danger of Communicating unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in it, it is their fault, and it is ſuch a fault as they both ſhould, and may redreſs; and therefore they cannot reaſonably expect to be excuſed from coming to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the reaſon of it; it is not fit to be admitted for a good reaſon of their ſtaying from the Sacrament at any time, much leſs for their conſtant ſtaying from it at all times; it will eaſily be apprehended how much this conſideration will contribute to the Collection we are upon; for nothing can well be more unreaſonable than to think that will be a ſufficient excuſe againſt doing a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which men have contracted by their own only fault, and which with any competent care they may remove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94519:76"/>But becauſe this is an argument that may afford ſome things very pertinent to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by men in this caſe; I ſhall branch the purport of it into ſome diſtinct propoſitions, which when I have confirm'd, I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remark the influence that each hath upon the concluſion, that I contend for. I ſhall comprehend all I purpoſe to ſay in theſe four that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That men are in danger of eating and drinking unworthily, is purely and ſolely their own fault; ſo that they cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from eating upon the reaſon of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This danger ought to be removed, and care taken to put themſelves into better cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: otherwiſe it is wilful and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo inſtead of excuſing their not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will highly aggravate the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An ordinary competent endeavour and care with Gods grace may remove it; ſo that upon that reaſon alſo, their neglecting of it, becomes highly culpable, and inexcuſable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though men may have been careleſs, and ſlipped their opportunity at one time, yet they may and ought to uſe more care againſt another; for pretences of continual unfitneſs, or unworthineſs cannot excuſe them.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt propoſition is this; this danger of eating and drinking unworthily, in any ſenſe of unworthineſs like this in the Text, is purely and ſolely mens own fault; and therefore they cannot hope to be excuſed upon the reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>I put the propoſition here in the largeſt ſenſe that can be deſired; and do not confine it only to the ſenſe of eating and drinking unworthily intended in this Text. I believe I need not ſtay proving, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fact was a groſs, and inexcuſable fault, owing to their own ignorance and intemperance: nor that any Chriſtian that ſhould be guilty of the like now, were more inexcuſable than they. This will readily be acknowledged by any that conſiders what hath been ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Chriſtians are in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances now, and ſo fully inſtructed in the nature and deſign of this ſervice, that ſuch a profanation of it now would become the moſt impardonable thing in the world.</p>
                  <p>But therefore I propoſe the caſe more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, let what men pleaſe to think eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> in any proportion to this in the Text, be allowed to be ſo: yet ſtill I ſay this is owing purely to their own fault, if it be upon them, and incurred ſolely by their own careleſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:94519:77"/>There are (I confeſs) ſome little imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and failings incident to men, which it may be their utmoſt induſtry and care (while in this lapſed ſtate) cannot get free from: but theſe are ſuch as need not come into our preſent account; for they neither put mens perſons out of Gods merciful favour, nor their ſervices out of his gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Theſe ſhall never be put upon our account but pardoned upon the merits of our dear Saviour, and that general repentance, which God hath promiſed to accept, in that covenant of mercy and grace, which he hath ſealed to us in his blood.</p>
                  <p>But over and beyond theſe, whatever we can think brings us into the danger of eating <hi>unworthily,</hi> it is occaſioned only by our ſelves, and our own fault. As for example, let it be the looſeneſs and unholineſs of mens lives; their impenitence, uncharitableneſs, worldly mindedneſs, intemperance, ſenſuality, or their being diſturbed and <hi>cumbred</hi> with the buſineſs and cares of this life, or any other vice whatſoever in proportion to theſe: yet ſurely all theſe are our own guilts, and we have none but our ſelves to charge them upon.</p>
                  <p>I know too well how forward men are to excuſe their faults, and willing to transfer their guilts upon ſomething beſide themſelves; but beſides that at the great day all mouths will be ſtopped, and all vicious men become
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94519:78"/>
palpably and inexcuſably guilty before God: I ſay beſide this, I never yet ſaw the man, whom I could not make ſenſible of his own intereſt in his crimes, and whoſe own mind hath not convinced him that he might have done better.</p>
                  <p>Were our tranſgreſſions neceſſary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, they were not ſins: for neceſſity is ſubject to no law, and where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion; and to argue that men cannot but do amiſs, is to argue them innocent in doing ſo; for what men cannot avoid, they cannot help, and where there is no liberty and choice, there is no more ſin, than there is in a ſtone that falls down, and kills a man.</p>
                  <p>It will not ſeem perhaps very pertinent or proper here, to reflect upon the doctrines that have given men any reaſon or encouragement to think otherwiſe of their crimes. I look upon them but as ſo many deſperate ſhifts that men have been put upon to ſhake off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and anguiſh of their own accuſing minds: the uneaſineſs of which hath made them willing to charge every thing, yea God himſelf, rather than endure the torment of their own reflections; ſuch for inſtance is the doctrin of abſolute, fatal, irreſiſtable decrees in God, by which ſome men are concluded under an inevitable neceſſity of ſining: the irreſiſtable inclinations of humane nature to ſin; the inſuperableneſs of thoſe temptations
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94519:78"/>
to evil, that are continually urging and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are doctrins that are either plain bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy againſt God, or impardonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon his juſtice, or the high'ſt affronts to his grace, in derogating from the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it. I am ſure God is holy, and cannot tempt any man to ſin, much leſs force and neceſſitate him to it; and how urging ſoever the inclinations of nature, or importunate the temptations to ſin may be; yet the divine grace is ſtronger, and ſufficient (if men be true to it) to enable them to ſurmount both: and I appeal to the experiences of men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not feel their own minds ſting, and gird, and convince them they might have done better than they do.</p>
                  <p>So that after all the endeavors and wreſtlings of men in this caſe; and after all the doctrins that others have propagated to help them in them: men muſt lay their hands upon their mouth, and take the guilt and ſhame of their ſins upon themſelves only; and I think moſt aſſuredly, that man would ſin grievouſly, and make the heap of his guilts much greater, that ſhould not confeſs ſincerely, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was amiſs with him, or done ſo by him, was purely and ſolely his own treſpaſs and fault.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be ſo, and whatever danger we can be in of eating unworthily muſt be caſt only upon our ſelves, and muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94519:79"/>
our own indiſcretion and folly only; then it will undeniably follow that it cannot be a ſufficient excuſe for not coming to eat in the Holy Sacrament: for I hope men do not think that one fault can excuſe, or attone for another; nor imagine that becauſe by one ſin they have brought themſelves into an unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their duty, that therefore all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they neglect, and the ſubſequent ſins they commit in conſequence of it, ſhall be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: this is to add ſin to ſin, and to mend one thing amiſs, with that which is really much worſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou art in danger of eating unworthily at the Lords Table, if thou come to it; well, but whoſe fault is it, that thou art ſo? and what beſides thine own folly hath brought thee into that danger? and what now, wouldſt thou neglect thy duty, becauſe thou haſt made thy ſelf unfit to do it? thou may'ſt do ſo, but then know thou haſt now a double crime to anſwer for; one for thy firſt ſin, and another for the neglect of that duty, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed thee for.</p>
                  <p>Conſider what the Apology would be, that in this caſe thou couldſt make to God; and how finely it would ſound in thy mouth, to tell the plain truth. I come not O Lord to the Holy Sacrament as thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, but it is becauſe I have unfitted my ſelf for it. I know it is my duty to come, and a great ſin to neglect it, but I hope thou wilt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94519:79"/>
pardon me, becauſe I have committed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, that cauſeth it. I came not to thy Table, but it was becauſe I was drunk, or as bad, when I ſhould have come. Be thine own Judge, doth this ſound well? would'ſt thou be pleaſed thy ſelf with ſuch an excuſe as this from a careleſs Child or Servant? and do'ſt thou think God will take it from thee? or canſt thou hope, that he will pardon thee one ſin, becauſe thou didſt it in conſequence of another? This is ſo abhorrent to all ſenſe and reaſon, that (one would think) no man could relie upon it, or could chooſe but be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aſhamed of it: nothing can be madder than to commit one ſin upon the reaſon of another, unleſs it be hoping that the firſt ſin can expiate and excuſe the ſecond. So that (to conclude this period) if men ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God for unfitting themſelves for the Holy Sacrament, their neglecting of it can never be excuſed upon that reaſon.</p>

and unworthineſs, and as apt to think that will become excuſe for us before God for it, and attone for the neglect of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we therefore diſregard: but can any thing be more idle and unaccountable than this? for ſtill it is our own wilful fault that we are thus unworthy, but it will be our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fault, if we continue ſo: the conſequence naturally draws the other way, <hi>viz.</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of our unworthineſs, and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it (as we ſeem to be) we ſpeedily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove that unworthineſs, and in good earneſt ſet about it.</p>
                  <p>When that great misfortune befell <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the City of <hi>Ai,</hi> (of which you have the ſtory, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.) and <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lay lamenting it before God one whole day: you may ſee how God beſpeaks him, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Joſhua, <hi>get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath ſinned, and taken the accurſed thing: they have ſtollen and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> &amp;c. therefore they could not ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their enemies, neither will I be with you any more, unleſs you deſtroy the accurſed thing from among you. Up, ſanctifie the people, and ſay, ſanctifie your ſelves againſt to morrow: it was not an acceptable thing to God to hear them howling and lamenting their miſcarriage, nor available with him to redreſs the ſame: the true and acceptable way was to beſtir themſelves, ſet to their own
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94519:80"/>
duty, and clear themſelves of that guilt that occaſioned their overthrow.</p>
                  <p>The preſent ſuppoſed caſe is much like this, but the meaſures of our proceeding in it, ought to be exactly the ſame. To ſet reſolutely and vigorouſly about our duty: about bettering our circumſtances, reforming our Lives, and thoſe vices eſpecially that cauſe this unworthineſs, and not ſtand fruitleſly lamenting and bewailing our unworthineſs, with our Arms folded up, without either hope or care to remedy the ſame: vainly thinking it will become excuſe for us with God, for neglecting our duty, which he hath commanded, but we fooliſhly indiſpoſed our ſelves for.</p>
                  <p>Men's duty in this caſe lies very plain, and they themſelves can eaſily preſcribe what ought to be done in all others like it. If our circumſtances be dangerous, and we unfit to do our neceſſary Duty, we need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what we ſhould do, we can direct our ſelves if we pleaſe, and think it much better, not to ſink under our indiſpoſition, and wear away our ſelves and time too, in fruitleſly bewailing, of it; but do what we can to help our ſelves to get rid of our diſtemper, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the evil that hangs upon us. For if things be a miſs, they ought to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And what evils Men have brought upon themſelves by negligence, they ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remedy by diligence and care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94519:81"/>Thus the whole World acts in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſes like this, if a diſeaſe amongſt them, or a wound or bruiſe happen to their Bodies, or any Limb of it, they preſently conſult how to remove the one, and heal the other. And at this rate they act in all other like caſes; as ſoon as they are ſenſible of an Evil, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to redreſs it, and their feeling of it, quickly excites their care againſt it.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely then they ought to ſo do in this caſe too, and ſo much the rather, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions of the Soul are more fatal than thoſe of the Body, and what is prejudicial to our Spiritual and Eternal welfare, much more conſiderable than what affects our temporal only; and I think of all things that affect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger that, thoſe are moſt dangerous, that betray us into Sin, and then hinder us from attending to our neceſſary duty. If Men therefore have any due regard to the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs of their Souls, and any ſenſe of their Duty, upon their doing which, that happineſs doth depend; they will not, they cannot ſuffer ſuch indiſpoſitions to remain upon them, which ſo much endanger the one, by keeping them from the other.</p>
                  <p>But I have ſome things yet to urge further, againſt our neglect in this caſe: wich will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as the undeniable conſequences of it, and become great aggravations thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Men's unworthineſs and unfitneſs is wilful.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:94519:81"/>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is very probable if not certain to increaſe upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That their Senſe of it, and ſorrow for it can never be ſincere, if they endeavour not to redreſs and remove it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IF Men that complain of their unfitneſs, and unworthineſs to receive the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and urge one as an excuſe to the other, do not carefully endeavour to remove that unfitneſs, and whatever it is that renders them ſo unwrothy; it is plain, that unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wilful and affected.</p>
                  <p>He that being Sick ſeeks not after his cure, or will not uſe thoſe remedies that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in order to it, ſtands reſponſible for all the pain that he feels, and all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and evils that attend his ſickneſs; and he that being in thraldom endeavours not his enlargment, hugs his chain, and is in love with his Priſon. And it is certainly thus in the preſent caſe. He that hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unfit to receive the Holy Sacrament, and takes no care to remove that which brings that unfitneſs upon him whatever it be; ſtands doubly guilty before God, and his latter error is much worſe than the former.</p>
                  <p>Whatever of Inprudence, or Careleſneſs, or Temptation, or Surpriſe there might be in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94519:82"/>
the firſt, there can be nothing but wilfulneſs and obſtinacy in the ſecond; there may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſomthing to extenuate the Guilt of the one; but the other is plainly wilful and preſumptuous. Whatever I will not ſtrive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye I plainly chooſe, and it's a plain ſign I am reconciled to that which I willingly lie under. If I bore mine Ear, it's a ſign I love my Maſter, and court Slavery; and how much ſoever I may afterwards regret the conſequences of this, or how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences may inſue upon it, yet I am only accountable for them all, and they are really mine own choice, and there is as much of a Man's will in continuing quietly under an evil, as there was at firſt in chooſing of it.</p>
                  <p>Nay we may go ſomthing further yet, and avow this unfitneſs, upon a Man, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved now into artifice and deſign. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the unfitneſs and unworthineſs may be in it ſelf, or whatever it was at firſt, it is now uſed and cheriſhed, as ſubterfuge and plea; it rendered him unfit for hit Duty at firſt, and now it ſhall be improved into argument and excuſe againſt it. I cannot aptlier illuſtrate this, than by the practice of thoſe Beggers that either make artificial Sores, or cheriſh and keep open real ones, that they may uſe them as motives to Charity from others, and indulgences for Idleneſs in themſelves. This (they ſay) is a common practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch Perſons; and certainly as they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94519:82"/>
are the worſt of Beggers, that beg under ſuch umbrages, and of all vagrants thoſe moſt worthy of correction that chuſe to be ſo, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than work to maintain themſelves in an honeſt calling: ſo thoſe Men that make improvement of their Sins, and cheriſh them upon deſign, and plead them to exempt and excuſe from Duty, are of all other Sinners the moſt fulſom, the moſt abominable and furtheſt from the Charity and Mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>Upon which plain reaſon it muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evident, that unfitneſs to receive the Holy Sacrament in ſuch a caſe, can never excuſe the neglect of it, but will rather greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Guilt of that neglect; how ſufficient a reaſon ſoever it might be in it ſelf, for Mens ſtaying from the Sacrament, yet it ought not, and it reaſonably cannot be pleaded by them, becauſe they have both volenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily brought it upon themſelves, and refuſe to be relieved from it. It is plain artifice and choice, and kept up on purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, and excuſe them from their Duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly ſuch a Man's unfitneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Sacrament, will by being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, increaſe ſtill upon him. I ſuppoſe Mens unfitneſs to receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt ariſe from ſome Sin, that ſticks faſt to them, and which they live in. I know nothing but Sin, that unfits any Man for the Holy Sacrament, nor any thing but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to repent of it, and reform from it that gives it that effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94519:83"/>This I take to be certain, and I make it the Foundation of what I am going to ſay, on this Argument; for therefore care ought to be taken, to get rid of this Sin, in ſome competent meaſure, by repenting of it, and reſolving againſt it, and begging Gods Grace to enable us to do ſo; for otherwiſe I ask what a Man can expect or think of? Thou art unfit to receive the Holy Sacrament, by reaſon of ſuch a Sin, or ſuch a miſcarriage: Well, but wouldſt thou have this unfitneſs to continue on thee, or be redreſs'd?</p>
                  <p>If thou art reſolved ſtill to continue ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by indulging thy Sin, and living in it, and obeying all the motions of it; then I have nothing more to ſay to thee, but that thou mayeſt as well caſt off all regard to other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Religion as this. Thy Religion is contradiction and nonſence, and thy Life is open defiance to it. But if thou wouldſt have it removed, and become fit for this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Service, then the only way to this purpoſe, is to ſet thy ſelf vigorouſly and in earneſt about the redreſſing of it, by care to repent, and reform from it, and not to ſit ſtill idly pining, and bewailing of it.</p>
                  <p>For otherwiſe, firſt, thy Indiſpoſition will certainly ſtill continue, and dwell upon thee. No Man can reaſonably expect that Sin ſhould paſs off of it ſelf, and leave him of its one accord; it ſticks too faſt, and roots too deep, when it hath once taken hold
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94519:83"/>
of us. It is juſt like weeds in a rank ſoyl, it is well if our utmoſt induſtry and care can keep them down or clear on't. But without that care they will certainly grow, and ſpread, and in a little time over-run all. And he that finds it too often a very hard matter, with all his induſtry and care, his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, and ſtriving to maſter a Sin, and ſubdue a vicious inclination, may eaſily preſage the fate of that Man, that ſits ſtill under his Sin, and never ſtrives againſt it, but fooliſhly expects it ſhould leave him of its own accord.</p>
                  <p>Nay ſecondly, ſuch a Man's unworthineſs will ſtill increaſe, and grow upon him. For vice like other things is of a growing nature, and ſeldom ſticks at the ſame ſtay; human nature (as I ſaid but now) is a very rank ſoyl, and vice is a ſeed too ſutable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it; and when we conſider how ſubtil and induſtrious the Devil is to cheriſh this ſeed, and cultivate this Ground, we may well conclude to what a monſtrous extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it will in time grow, if great heed and care be not taken againſt it. So that if Men be in earneſt when they plead their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to receive the Holy Sacrament, and keep from it upon that reaſon, then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequences of that ſhould be the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all poſſible and ſpeedy care to get that unworthineſs removed, otherwiſe they muſt be content, that it continue and grow upon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94519:84"/>
them, and that themſelves periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly under the effects of it.</p>
                  <p>And then there is a third thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to this purpoſe, viz. that among all the arts and methods of redreſſing our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becoming fit for the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Communicating in it is one of the chiefeſt; no Man in the World ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more worthy and fit by ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it, but many have become ſo by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. One of the beſt ways that I know of, for a Man to come to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he ſhould, is to come to it as well as he can. This is that advice that I would give to every timorous Perſon in this caſe: if thou fear thou canſt not go ſo well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as thou ſhouldſt, be ſure to go as well as thou canſt; I am very confident, by this means thou wilt ſtill grow better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the truth of this hath been atteſted by the happy experience of many a good Man; and it relies upon very good Reaſon too. For beſides that God is always ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and cheriſh <hi>the Day of ſmall things,</hi> and to give more Grace and ſtrength to him, that really and honeſtly doth his beſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent proportions and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that he hath. I ſay beſides this, this Holy Sacrament is that very means that he hath appointed to confer this Grace upon us in, and the means which we are to uſe in order to our receiving it from him. So
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94519:84"/>
that if Men want Power and Strength to maſter their Sins, and to get clear of their preſent unworthineſs; I know no better courſe for them to take, than to lye at this Betheſda, where Angels attend, and where the Communications of the divine Spirit and Grace are always ready, for them that accept them, and ſtep down into theſe Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But there was a third thing that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſideration here. And that is, that without this care to redreſs Mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unworthineſs, all their pretences of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and regret for it are plain Hypocriſie and fraud. And this I argue upon theſe two plain reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it ſhews them to be in love with their diſeaſe, to hug their unworthineſs, and to cheriſh it to be excuſe and diſpenſation from duty.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, not to deal truly with God, and their own Souls, in ſtaying from the Holy Sacrament upon the reaſon of it; for either they think coming to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be their Duty, and what they have a mind unto, or not; if not, then they may ſtay away, without alledging their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, as well as by doing ſo. But if they be ſincere in their acknowledgment, then they ſhould be as fearful to neglect their Duty, as to come unfitly to it; there muſt neceſſarily be as great a Sin in that, as there can be in this, yea there muſt needs be ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94519:85"/>
much the greater, by how much it is better to do ſomthing of our Duty, than nothing at all, to do it imperfectly, than to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and neglect it altogether. It's almoſt a certain ſign of a Hypocrite (as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid) to be very ſhy and fearful of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one caſe, but regardleſs and bold in another: and he that is not as fearful of Sin, in ſtaying from the Holy Sacrament, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfitly to it, is fearfull only on one ſide, and ſhall never have that pretence accepted, or counted ſincere, and therefore (to conclude this period) if Men be unworthy, they ſhould endeavour to become worthy, otherwiſe they are hypocrites in that pretence, and inſtead of excuſing their not coming to the Holy Sacrament, it ſhall greatly inhanſe and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Guilt thereof.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The third thing propoſed to Conſideration on this head, is this, An ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent endeavour and care (with Gods common grace) may ſuffice to remove this unworthineſs, and put men out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis conſideration I lay down on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to meet with a further exception that Men make in this caſe, for Men may grant this unworthineſs to be their own fault, that care ought to be taken to redreſs it, and that it were well if it were ſo; and yet be diſcouraged from advancing further, becauſe of the great labour and difficulty, which they think is neceſſary to the redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it. Many Men labour under this prejudice, and are frighted and diſcouraged from fitting themſelves for the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the mighty difficulty that they think there is in doing ſo. There is ſo much time to be allowed, and ſo much labour and pains uſed to this purpoſe; and ſome cannot ſpare ſo much of their one, and others are loth to be at the trouble of the other, and upon this reaſon ſit ſtill, and are diſcouraged from
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94519:86"/>
ever undertaking or going about it.</p>
               <p>Now in order to the ſatisfying this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I propoſe this conſideration, that an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary competent care will be ſufficient to this purpoſe; it is no ſuch difficult a matter to render a Man competently fit for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, and ſo to get above the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Eating and Drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> that he ſeems ſo fearful of.</p>
               <p>In the managing of this Argument, I ſhall proceed in this following method. Firſt, I ſhall premiſe a conſideration to prevent all prejudice or miſtake in what I am going to ſay. Secondly, I ſhall conſider what the Apoſtle preſcribes to theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this place, by way of remedy againſt Eating and Drinking unworthily. Thirdly, Examine it upon the reaſon of the thing, conſider what is neceſſary to Eating and Drinking worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what time or labour is ſufficient by way of preparation thereto.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THe Conſideration I would premiſe is this, that I am not going to leſſen any Man's eſteem of the Sacredneſs of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or his care to prepare and fit himſelf for it as well as he can.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid in the beginning of this diſcourſe, how very apt Men are to run out of one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity into another; and how hard it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94519:86"/>
one error of Men, ſo as that they ſhall not fall into the extremity on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and I obſerve that Men are very incident to the ſame error in this matter; it's a hard matter ſo to ſpeak againſt Men's being too ſcrupulous, as that they ſhall not take occaſion thence to become careleſs, and ſo to reform the error of thinking every preparation for the Holy Sacrament too little, as not to give them ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think, that any preparation at all is enough.</p>
                  <p>My buſineſs at this time is againſt the firſt of theſe Errors, upon which Men are, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be mighty ſcrupulous, and fearful of coming to the Holy Sacrament, even to ſuperſtition, upon an opinion that ſo very great and exact preparation is neceſſary to fit Men for it, and that upon no leſs a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than <hi>Damnation.</hi> So that they are really frighted from any thoughts of coming to it. The danger of coming unprepared is ſo amaſing and frightful, and the pains and labour of preparing a Man's ſelf ſo very great, that they chooſe to ſtay away, rather than incur ſo great a danger, or take ſo very much pains to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>This (I ſay) is the great Error that I am now to reform, and therefore have need to caution the Men I ſpeak to, and deſire them to conſider, that while I endeavour to cure this ſuperſtitious fear and dread on one hand,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94519:87"/>
I do not encourage them to run into care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and preſumption on the other, or from thinking that no preparation is enough, imagining that any though never ſo ſlight is ſufficient. I would not encourage any Man in his ſuperſtition, but I would as little encourage his negligence and profaneſs. I would not willingly ſcare Men from their duty, by telling them ſtories of the difficulty of doing it, and the danger of not doing it aright, but I would be as loth to diſcharge their care from doing it as exactly and well as they can.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome pious and tender Perſons in the World, that think they ought to ſet apart ſo much time, and uſe ſuch a method of preparation for the Holy Sacrament, and conſtantly do it. And for my part, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to live in ſuch circumſtances, that they can eaſily ſpare ſo much time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intrenching upon other neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and without rendering Religion tedious and a burthen to them; I diſcourage them not: they do well, and in Gods Name let them go on. Some time is abſolutely neceſſary for the great affairs of Mens Souls, to ſet all things (ſo far as they can) to rights, between them and God; and no time can be more opportune, and proper for ſuch a care, than when they are going to the Holy Sacrament, and to partake in the greateſt manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pledges of God's deareſt love to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94519:87"/>
Sinners, in giving his own Son to Dye for them.</p>
                  <p>But now I would neither have theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to impoſe this their practice upon all others, nor thoſe others to think preſently, that ſuch things are abſolutely neceſſary, and that unleſs they come up to them, they ought to ſtay from the Holy Sacrament, as being utterly unworthy, and unfit for it.</p>
                  <p>For I conſider that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians received the Holy Sacrament every Day, and in times of Perſecution twice every Day, as ſeems very probable from ſome paſſages in Antiquity; and I can eaſily conſider, and ſatisfie my ſelf, that therefore theſe Perſons did not, yea could not ſet aſide ſo much time, and be ſo curious in their preparation every time that they received it.</p>
                  <p>The plain truth is, they accounted the Holy Sacrament to be as neceſſary, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of their Daily Devotions, as their Prayers, or any other publick ſervice of their Religion; and as in truth no greater prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary for one, than for the other, ſo it is plain, they thought there was not, but went to it as conſtantly and with juſt the ſame devotion, as they went to their Prayers; they thought a Chriſtian good Life, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual preparation for the Holy Sacrament, and a Pious Devotion of Spirit the beſt way of Receiving it. And I am very ſure they thought right in this matter, and as we ought to think too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:94519:88"/>Would Men endeavour really to approve themſelves good Men, by leading regular good Chriſtian Lives (as they did, and as thoſe Perſons that ſeem ſo ſcrupulous and fearful pretend to do) a very little time, an ordinary endeavour and care would ſuffice to render them fit for the Holy Sacrament. Holineſs (as I ſaid but now) is the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for this ſervice, a good life is an habitual preparation, and Chriſtian devotion and reverence with it is always an actual one, and with theſe two no Man can be unfit to Communicate in it: for what thoſe good Men did, we may do alſo, would we endeavour to imitate, and come up to them in their life, we need fear offending God in this ſervice, no more than they did; it is a very little matter that will fit a good Man for the Holy Sacrament, and it is not a little thing that can cauſe him to receive it unworthily.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill I ſpeak not this, to ſuperſede or leſſen any Man's care to fit himſelf for this ſervice, as well as his time, and skill, and care will give him leave; the better and more exactly that any Man is fitted for it, the better it is for him: and he can never be too well prepared. And therefore I enter this caution, that no Man think the contrary of me, from any thing that I am going to ſay on this Argument. I am concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the contrary extreme, and therefore

while I go to ſhew, that with an ordinary care, a Man may render himſelf fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, I deſire that no Man do preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think, that he may be fit, without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor or care at all.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>ANd now having premiſed this, which I muſt beg Men's remembring of as we go along, I proceed directly to make good the aſſertion. viz. That it is no ſuch mighty difficult a matter, to render a Man's ſelf fit for the Holy Sacrament, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and get above the unworthineſs that he ſeems ſo afraid of, which I have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do by three plain arguments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is by conſidering what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here preſcribes to theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to remedy and prevent that their Eating and Drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> which be blames them for. It is not eaſie to imagine any Men more unfit to receive the Holy Sacrament than they were, or to receive it more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily than they did. And therefore the ſame meaſures that he obſerved with them, will be proper for us alſo, in our preſent caſe, and what was thought ſufficient by him to redreſs this unworthineſs in them, may be ſufficient for us to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now all that he ſaith to this purpoſe, is contained in v. 28. and 31. <hi>Let a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94519:89"/>
himſelf, and ſo let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup. And if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi> This is all that he preſcribes in this caſe: for what he ſaith in v. 33. and 34. doth concern the manner of Eating in their love-feaſts, and not in the Sacrament, as is plain to any that reads them. So that in order to our ſatisfaction in this matter, we ſhall need only to conſider what the ſum and import of thoſe two Verſes are.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the latter, both becauſe it is the ſooner diſpatched, and becauſe I do not well know whether it ſo truly intend any thing to be done by them in order to fitting themſelves to receive <hi>worthily,</hi> or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the way of expiating, and attoning for the Guilt of their having Eaten and Drank <hi>unworthily;</hi> but if it do imply ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature, then the meaning of it is only this: Let us judg our ſelves for our errors, and failings, that we may anticipate and prevent God's Judging of us. Now in this ſence it reſpects and injoyns only the matter of Chriſtian repentance, by which we reconcile our ſelves to God, aſſoil our ſelves of our Sins, and ſo become fit to receive the pledges of Divine Grace and pardon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us in that Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But I put this but only upon ſuppoſition, and that I might not be thought to conceal any thing, that can be ſuppoſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94519:89"/>
by the Apoſtle to this purpoſe; for I am apt to believe, that this (as I ſaid before) doth not ſo much reſpect any thing to be done by way of preparation to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but rather to be added by way of advice, how to attone for the Sin of having Eaten and Drank unworthily; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe punniſhments, that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and fear upon having done ſo. The Apoſtle had convinced them of their Sin in this, and let them know that the judgments which they lay under, were the effects of that Sin, and having told them in <hi>verſe</hi> 28. how to reform and prevent the Sin for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he tells them in this how to eſcape the puniſhments that were due to it: <hi>viz.</hi> by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating God's judging of them, becoming Aſſeſſors upon themſelves, and by their own remorſe and ſorrow inflicting that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves, which otherwiſe they might expect from God; this I think is the trueſt account of this paſſage, and of what the Apoſtle means in it.</p>
                  <p>So that the great matter of preparation, that he preſcribes in order to their Eating and Drinking fitly, and becomingly, i. e. <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily</hi> in the ſenſe of that word, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under that examination that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth to <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</hi> And therefore this is the great thing to be explained, by which we may ſee what
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94519:90"/>
a reaſonable meaſure of conſideration and care the Apoſtle thinks ſufficient to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>I do very well know, and as readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that ſome conſiderable Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this ſo, as to comprehend all that ſtrict and critical examination of a Man's ſelf, that may be needful to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly the ſtate of his Soul, with reſpect to his Religion, Faith, Charity, &amp;c. i. e. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men be Chriſtians indeed or not, and whether they reſolve to continue ſo, whether they have truly repented them of all their Sins, both in general, and particularly, and whether their purpoſes of reforming from them be real and ſincere.</p>
                  <p>Yet I think I have reaſon to differ from them a little in this: for whatever may be the meaning of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the New Teſtament, yet I think it is not the meaning of it in this; and by conſidering wherein the error and guilt of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> conſiſted, we may pretty well underſtand the meaning of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in remedy of it.</p>
                  <p>This I have conſidered at large already in this diſcourſe, and the truth is the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it plainly enough, to be <hi>not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> i. e. putting no difference between this and common bread, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eating with as little Reverence at the Lords Table, as they did at their own, in their own Houſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:94519:90"/>This was the Sin, and by conſidering that it was ſo we may eaſily collect the meaning of that examination which he preſcribes againſt it, to be primarily no more than this (which I ſhall borrow the words of a great Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, to expreſs) <hi>let every Man among you conſider well with himſelf, what a Sacred action that is, which he is going about, and what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and reverent behaviour becomes him, that is going to Celebrate the Holy Sacrament, which Chriſt hath inſtituted to repreſent and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his own Body and Blood,</hi> broken and ſpilt upon the Croſs for Man's Redemption.</p>
                  <p>This is what the Apoſtle preſcribes as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt that profanation of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that they were guilty of, and what he thinks ſufficient to preſerve them from it, for the future; to conſider well what a high myſterious ſervice of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, that the Bread and Wine are therein conſecrated into the ſymbols of our Lord's own Body and Blood; that they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger common Bread and Wine, but changed into a great myſtery, and in a Sacramental ſence the very Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>diſcerning the Lord's Body,</hi> and this is the import of a Man's examining himſelf that he may diſcern it; and he that doth this, can never be guilty of ſuch unworthy eating and drinking as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of; for he will ſee clearly what a mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and deference is due to this ſervice, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94519:91"/>
what a profound veneration and reverence becomes thoſe that eat at the Table of the great God, and are admitted to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Son's moſt Sacred Body and Blood: upon this reaſon Antiquity uſed to call theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and dreadful myſteries; and no Man that conſiders them as ſuch, but muſt put a difference between them, and common food, and can hardly but partake of with a Sacred dread of Spirit, and a moſt profound reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion. I only add what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this notion for; <hi>viz.</hi> That this ſelf examination is therefore no ſuch difficult thing as Men imagin it to be: it is what all Chriſtians know, what they can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and what it is indeed the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty for them not to conſider, and be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal.</p>
                  <p>But then ſuppoſe that it did imply ſomething more, and what ſome Men (as I hinted before) do extend it unto, i. e. all that examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Man's ſelf, that is neceſſary to the true underſtanding the ſtate and condition of his Soul; with reſpect to his Repentance, Faith, Charity, and the quality of his life. Firſt, I ſay, I will by no means diſcourage any one from care of this, and ſetting apart ſome time for it, in order to his eating and drinking becomingly at the Lords Table. This is a thing upon many accounts very expedient and fit, and eſpecially in order to our underſtanding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94519:91"/>
with what qualification we ought chiefly to come to this Holy Sacrament, which may, and ought to vary according to the variable circumſtances of our Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this examination of a Man's ſelf is a thing highly neceſſary to the great purpoſes of Religion, and becauſe no time can well be pitched upon for it, more fit and proper than when Men are preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Holy Sacrament; therefore it may be very prudent to take that time to do it in: ſome time is neceſſary for it, and that time may be as fit for it as any other; and thoſe that will ſo imploy it, do well, and are by no means to be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>But then Secondly, I ſay, this examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but juſt neceſſary then as it is at other times, for I ſee not, why it may not be thought as neceſſany to examine our ſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the ſtate of our Soul is, when we go to pray, and when we go to hear God's word, that we may both know what eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to pray for, and how to apply that word to our ſelves, as it is when we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing to the Holy Sacrament. So that whatever it ſignifies, it is no more neceſſary to the Holy Sacrament, than it is to other ſervices of Religion, nor ought to fright us from the one, any more than it doth from the other.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, I add, that ſurely there is no
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94519:92"/>
ſuch mighty difficulty in it in this ſenſe, nor any ſuch long time neceſſary to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. Every Man doth know, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſt eaſily may know his one temper; and what the general bent and courſe of his life is, what he loves and what he hates, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion be the matter of his care or not; a Man can no more be ignorant of his one temper, if he will conſider, than he can fly from himſelf, nor can any great Sins or wickedneſſes which require a particular repentance, ſcape his notice, any more than the viſible actions of every day: and how then can any Man be a ſtranger to, or need any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious difficult inquiry and ſearch, to know thoſe things, which he daily feels, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of?</p>
                  <p>I do not at all doubt but that ſome wicked Men uſe arts to divert their minds and thoughts, from any reflection upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual condition, and ſtudy to live ſtrangers to themſelves; but I am ſure there is real difficulty in this, and perhaps after all ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, their minds will ſomtimes emerge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their preſſures, break looſe from theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual reſtraints, and force them to underſtand their condition whether they will or no; it is natural for a Man to underſtand himſelf, and to reflect upon his own actions, and much more eaſie than to arrive to ſuch a pitch of brutiſh careleſneſs, inſenſibleneſs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as to be perfectly a ſtranger to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94519:92"/>
his one ſtate; it is not in this caſe as it is with a Merchant, who may run on, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do himſelf, before ever he know how his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſtand; for his Books lie out of his ſight, or he may be careleſs, and neglect to look into them, but in this caſe a Mans Books are always open, always preſent and under his view, and he muſt wilfully ſhut his eyes, or look upon them, and ſuſpend the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and even neceſſary exertions of his mind, not to think of them.</p>
                  <p>So that whatever <hi>examining a Mans ſelf</hi> can ſignifie, it can be no very difficult thing, nor require much time for the performance of it. No wiſe Man lives without it, and no Man of the moſt ordinary obſervation and reaſon can be ſuch a ſtranger to his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as to need much time, or pains in the examination of them.</p>
                  <p>The great things of our Souls, and what relate to the condition of them, are always obvious and plain, and there is no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty (that I know of) relating to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only to bring our minds to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and judg honeſtly, and impartially of them. In this I muſt needs confeſs there is ſome difficulty, for ſelf-love is prevalent in all Men, and they are not very willing to condemn themſelves; of all things in the world, the falling under the reproach and cenſure of a Man's own mind is the moſt irkſom, and therefore Men ſtudy arts, and all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94519:93"/>
poſſible ways to avoid it; and in this it is, that the deceitfulneſs of a Mans own heart doth chiefly, if not ſolely conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill this difficulty ariſeth not from the difficulty of knowing, or examining our own ſtate, but from the difficulty of being honeſt, and juſt in judging of it; the caſe is always open, and plain: but the fault lies in partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to it, and in bribing a falſe opinion, and judgment of it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>ANd now having conſidered what it is the Apoſtle preſcribes in this caſe, and ſeen what this examination of a Man's ſelf doth ſignifie, and what little expence either of time or labour is needful for it; I proceed to the ſecond thing, i. e. to examin the reaſon of the thing, to conſider what is neceſſary to eating and drinking becomingly (i. e. wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily) in the Holy Sacrament, and what that preparation is, that is needful in order their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt, what qualifications are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our communicating fitly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingly in the Holy Sacrament, I mean with what tempers we ought to come, and how to behave our ſelves there when we are come; for theſe I think we need look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the exhortations of our Church in the Office for the Communion: they are in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94519:93"/>
our Common Prayer Books, and I wiſh every one would often read, and conſider them, they moſt plainly and fully inſtruct us in theſe things. I ſhall reduce them to theſe four heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Repentance, as it includes a hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our ſins, an humble confeſſion of their guilt to Almighty God, and a reſolution by the help of his grace, to reform for the future from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſtedfaſt humble faith in God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, through Jeſus Chriſt for our pardon, and acceptance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A grateful ſence of God's mighty love to Mankind, in ſending his Son to die for us, with a thankful remembrance of his death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Love and Charity to all Men, forgiving thoſe that have offended and injured us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled (or endeavoring to be ſo) to all that we have offended; and bearing love, and good will to all, ſo as to be ready and willing to do them good according to our power.</p>
                  <p>Theſe contain the ſum of all thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, with which we ſhould come to the Holy Sacrament. Now as theſe things are abſolutely neceſſary to our being Chriſtians, and therefore neceſſary for us to regard, and take care of at all times, ſo there is no more difficulty in them, to fright us from the Holy Sacrament, than from other ſervices of our Religion. If the difficulty of them be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94519:94"/>
an <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ception againſt the Sacrament, it is ſo againſt Chriſtian Religion in general, and we may throw off wholly the one, as well as the other, upon the reaſon of it; but as their is no great difficulty at all in them, nor any reaſon to accuſe Chriſtian Religion, as a heavy yoke in requiring of them, no more is there any cauſe to make them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt coming to the Holy Sacrament: theſe are the conditions of our being Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and with the help of the divine grace they are poſſible and eaſie too, and as eaſie in order to this ſervice, as to any other purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And then if we inquire how we ought to behave our ſelves at the Sacrament, the ſame exhortations will direct us in that alſo, which we may reduce to four heads, as we did the former.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A moſt profound reverence and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſuch as becomes creatures, when they approach the immediate preſence of the great Creator, when they ingage into the moſt ſolemn and myſterious ſervice of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when they dolefully reflect upon their own unworthineſs and demerits, and when they humbly ſupplicate, and beg for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thereof, and which moſt certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all Chiſtians, when they are ſet in the moſt affecting proſpect of the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A moſt affecting exalted joy, and rejoycing in Gods mercy and our Saviours love to us, <hi>who
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94519:94"/>
hath remembred us in our low eſtate,</hi> given us ſuch reaſon to hope for his favor and pardon; and in this Holy Sacrament, lets us feed upon the ſenſible pledges of this love, and viſibly ſeals unto us the aſſurance of the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The moſt devout and raiſed affection, the moſt hearty and exalted praiſe to God, for all this; the magnifying the aſtoniſhing love of our God; and rendring the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout praiſe to our dear Saviour for this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his kindneſs to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Earneſt prayer to God, to accept our prſent poor ſervice, and mean return for this mighty favour, and to enable us by his grace to live for the future, in ſome competent meaſure ſutable to theſe mighty obligations.</p>
                  <p>The four former qualifications render us fit to <hi>partake of thoſe Holy myſteries;</hi> and theſe other make us actually to do ſo, and I pray you but to recollect them, and then tell me what great difficulty there is in them: the truth is, they are all ſo natural to Men at ſuch a time, that I ſhould think the great and only difficulty were, ſo to reſiſt our preſent impreſſions, as not to be affected into them. Who that conſiders what he is then doing, and what benefit and honor he is receiving from the great God, can be otherwiſe than devout and humble? whoſe heart can chooſe but burn with love unto God and Chriſt, and flame out into the moſt hearty adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and praiſe to them, when he comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morates
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94519:95"/>
this amazing inſtance of their love? and who can be affected thus and not break out into moſt ſincere and earneſt prayer to God for his grace, to enable him to live in ſome meaſure anſwerable to the ſame?</p>
                  <p>I appeal to the experiences of all pious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, whether there be difficulty in theſe things; or rather whether they feel not ſuch a mighty ſtrong energy, and power upon their ſpirits at ſuch a time, as cauſeth them readily to break out into them. How na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally do tears of ſorrow and joy flow from our eyes! how do our Souls lick the duſt in humble proſtrations! how are we ſwallowed up with rapturous contemplations of our Lords love! and what bright flames of praiſe and love aſcend from our exalted Souls at ſuch a time! So that we are for the preſent even all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and all love, and taſt what the joys of the ſpirit, and the enraviſhing ſweetneſſes of Religion mean; the Holy Spirit, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace do ſo ſtrongly ſeiſe and pervade our ſpirits then, that theſe things become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſie, and Men muſt offer a certain violence to themſelves, and unreaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ſtrong motions of Gods grace and Holy Spirit, or they cannot neglect, or fail of them.</p>
                  <p>And then as to the ſecond ſort of things that I mentioned, what are the beſt, and moſt effectual means and methods to be uſed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to theſe preparations, and attainments,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94519:95"/>
I think I may reduce all the voluminous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and advices of Men, and the many Books that have been written to this purpoſe, to theſe three plain heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To conſider ſeriouſly and truly what our ſpiritual condition is, that we may know what manner of preparation either of repentance and ſorrow, of faith and hope, of love and joy, we are eſpecially concerned to make and come with; for though all theſe ought ſtill to be conjoyned, and are neceſſary and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming every Communicant; yet ſome ſeem more peculiarly neceſſary and proper for ſome, than for others, according (as I ſaid before) as their circumſtances, and conditions chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are. Repentance is not improper for the beſt Men living: but it is more abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them, who have great ſins to anſwer, and beg pardon for; love and joy and praiſe become bad Men, and are mighty due, for the hopes of mercy and pardon that God hath given them: but they are more becoming and juſt from thoſe good Men, who live in the bleſſed ſenſe and fruition of this love, and goodneſs to them, and there receive the actual pledges, and aſſurances of it.</p>
                  <p>So that though all theſe be fitting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet ſome are more ſo than others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Mens conditions are better or worſe, and by ſeriouſly conſidering how our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual circumſtances ſtand, we ſhall eaſily know, what preparation is moſt proper for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94519:96"/>
us to make, and what tempers of mind chiefly to come with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sober and ſolemn meditation, upon the great things of Religion, eſpecially upon this myſtery of our redemption by the ſufferings and death of the Son of God, by which we ſhall affect our Souls with a deep ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, and vileneſs, of the evil and danger of ſin, and of the immenſe and aſtoniſhing love of God and Chriſt to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Humble and devout prayer to God, to aſſiſt us, and help us in theſe Preparations, and addreſſes; for beſides that prayer in it ſelf hath a ſtrange efficacy and power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in us all theſe excellent diſpoſitions and tempers, it is the moſt certain way to receive thoſe aſſiſtances from God, that will help us to the attainment of them; for theſe are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freely to all, and are always ready for thoſe that will ask them, that will accept them, and that will be true to them. <hi>For every one that asketh receiveth, and every one ſhall find that ſeeketh, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then (to conclude this period) if there were any difficulty in theſe preparations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our own ſingle unaſſiſted ſtrength; yet conſidering how we are backed, and may be aſſiſted with this almighty grace and ſpirit of God, there can, and there ought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of difficulty imagined or feared to be in them.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>BUt becauſe I have a mind to clear this point to the utmoſt, I ſhall conſider this matter of preparation yet more diſtinctly, both with reſpect to a good Man, and to one that hath too much reaſon to doubt himſelf, or conclude that he is evil, and under the power of ſin; ſhew what preparation is neceſſary for each of theſe, and that a reaſonable portion of time and care will eaſily diſpatch it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt for a good Mans preparing of himſelf for the Holy Sacrament, a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matter will diſpatch it. Holineſs (as I hinted before) is a conſtant habitual preparation, for this, or any other Service of Religion, &amp; a good Man hardly will be at any time unfit for it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Virgins that have Oyl continually in their Lamps, and thoſe Lamps conſtantly burning too, can quickly awake, and ſoon trim them for the Bridegroom's coming, and he whoſe heart keeps a veſtal fire of love alwayes alive, can eaſily fan it up into an actual flame, and make it fit either for ſacrifice, or incenſe. Such a Man's Soul is always well inclined, and ſtands continually the right way; ſo that when an opportunity of actual devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offers it ſelf, he readily cloſeth with it, and God no ſooner calls upon him to ſeek his face, but his heart eccho's to the call, and readily anſwers with the devout Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:94519:97"/>When we have ſaid all that we can on this ſubject, a good life is the beſt preparation for the Holy Sacrament, and he that lives ſuch a life can never be unfit for it, he is always habitually fitted, and whatever curious dreſs he ſhould at any time be in, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pious and devout temper will eaſily be improved and heightened into it. He that hath a Wedding Garment always ready, and clean kept, can eaſily put it on, and he whoſe loyns are always girded, and Lamp burning may be ſooner ready to wait upon his Lord, whenever he calls.</p>
                  <p>Or if we ſhould ſuppoſe the worſt of ſuch a Man, and that he ſhould through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or ſurpriſe of a temptation have let down his Watch, and indiſpoſed himſelf, yet a little matter will recover, and ſet him to right again; a light that is newly extinguiſhed may ſoon be kindled again, and an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual goodneſs though it have been diſordered, will eaſily recover its temper; a little matter will diſpatch the buſineſs of a good Mans repentance, and no great labour is needful to waſh off that ſpot, that is the ſtain of a Child, and that ſome external accident hath caſt upon the outſide only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the more material thing, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the caſe of a wicked Man, who upon examining his condition finds too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude ill of himſelf, and to ſtate that preparation that is neceſſary for him to make in order to this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:94519:97"/>For firſt I do not think this Man unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, but as much obliged to come to the Holy Sacrament as another, if not rather more; the command for the obſervation of it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and no Chriſtian is excepted; or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with; our Lord adminiſtred it to all his diſciples, to Judas as well as St. Peter; St. Paul when he comes to give directions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame matter, excepts none but rather includes all, he commands indeed every one to examin himſelf, but having done ſo, then to eat and drink: yea he commands thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> to do this, that of all Men (one would think) were the unfiteſt to do it.</p>
                  <p>And upon the whole matter, there is ſo little reaſon to keep ſuch a Man from the Holy Sacrament, becauſe he is in an ill condition, that there is therefore the greater need why he ſhould come; it is very ill arguing as ſome do, I fear my condition is bad, therefore I muſt ſtay away, the true reaſoning holds juſt the other way. My condition is bad, why therefore come that it may be made better; there is but own thing to be ſuppoſed to the truth and ſafety of this arguing, i. e. that ſuch a Man deſires his condition ſhould be amended; if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to continue wicked, then he may ſtay away, but ſo he may from all other ſervices of Religion too; for ſuch a Man's Religion is all contradiction and nonſence, and he may throw off all care of it, as well as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:94519:98"/>But this caſe I have argued before, and need determin no more upon it now, I only add one obſervation more at preſent, and that is, that the great and main qualification that the Church requires in them, who come to the Holy Sacrament, is repentance, and the greateſt part of the ſervice ſhe appoints in order to it, conſiſts in humble confeſſions, in ſad and paſſionate deprecations of the divine wrath, and moſt earneſt imploring Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, all which is to me a plain argument, that ſhe thinks no Man unfit to come to the Holy Sacrament, that doth repent of his former ſins, how great ſoever they may have been, and that doth deſire, and reſolve with Gods help to lead a better life for the future.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure no Man hath more need to come, than ſuch a Man, nor is any Miniſtry in Religion more proper for him to apply to; which is ſo peculiarly fitted to his needs, ſo efficacious to faſten his pious purpoſes and inſtituted on purpoſe to be a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring that divine grace, which is neceſſary to enable him to live up to them.</p>
                  <p>I know the Church in ſome caſes adviſeth ſome to ſtay away, and commiſſions her Prieſts, to ſuſpend, and keep away others: but the firſt are only thoſe, whoſe conſciences are yet perplexed, and troubled for ſome grievious ſin; and the ſecond are ſuch as living notoriouſly in groſs ſins, are become a publick ſcandal unto others; but neither of theſe are either to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94519:98"/>
keep off themſelves, or be kept off by others, but only till the one by repentance, prayer, and conſulting their ſpiritual guides, get their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences relieved and eaſed, and the other by ſome publick teſtimony of repentance recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themſelves to the Church, and give ſome hopes of their amendment; ſo that repentance, and promiſes of amendment is thought by the Church ſufficient to qualifie even bad Men for the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>This then being cleared, we may proceed readily in the ſecond place to conſider that preparation which is neceſſary for ſuch a Man, and inquire whether any ſuch long time, or mighty labour be neceſſary for it; and what hath been ſaid juſt now, will be of uſe to us in this inquiry, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the great thing that ſuch a Man hath to regard, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſorrow and grief to confeſs his ſins to almighty God, to implore and beg his mercy for the pardon of them, and his grace to enable him to reform from them.</p>
                  <p>To this there is nothing neceſſary to be added, but faith, as it implies a great and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of Gods mercy, in ſending Chriſt to die for us, and giving repentant ſinners ſuch hope of pardon and ſalvation in him, and upon his merits; and as it implies hope too of the ſame mercy and pardon to us, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our repentance, together with an humble and ſteddy reliance upon Gods grace, to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94519:99"/>
enable us to repent and reform.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things comprehend the ſum of that preparation that is neceſſary for the worſt Men to make for the Holy Sacrament, and I pray conſider, what great difficulty there is in theſe, or whether any ſuch great deal of time be neceſſary for them, that Men ſhould except againſt coming to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament upon that reaſon; if Men make them an exception againſt this ſervice, they may as well make them an exception againſt Chriſtian Religion in general, for they are the great and neceſſary poſtulata's of Chriſtianity, and the only reaſons upon which it promiſeth ſalvation to any; and therefore are no further any exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Sacrament than they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our whole Religion, and upon the ſame reaſon that we abſtain from it becauſe of them, we may renounce our Baptiſm, and the name of Chriſt by which we are called.</p>
                  <p>If Men charge the Holy Sacrament to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and a hard ſervice becauſe it requires theſe preparations, we may charge our Religion as well to be unreaſonable and hard, for they are made neceſſary by the one, as well as required in order to the other. So that if it be difficult to communicate becauſe they are required, it is difficult to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian upon the ſame reaſon, and as becauſe we count them neceſſary to Salvation, we ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all the objections and pleas of their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94519:99"/>
being difficult or hard, ſo we ought to do in this caſe alſo, eſpecially ſince we know how to have them become light and eaſie, and where to have that aſſiſtance which will render them truly ſo to us.</p>
                  <p>So that I may conclude ſafely upon the whole matter, that this preparation that is neceſſary to be made for the Holy Sacrament, is neither ſuch a mighty great matter in it ſelf, nor ſo very difficult unto us, but that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent endeavour and care may ſuffice for it, and therefore the more eaſie the preparation to be made is, the more inexcuſable are thoſe Men that neglect it, and cry out againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Holy Sacrament, becauſe of the difficulty of it. And I may make uſe of the reaſoning of Naaman's ſervants with him, and apply it to our preſent caſe. <hi>My Father if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not have done it? how much more when he ſaith waſh and be clean?</hi> if there were really ſome very great difficulty in that preparation that is neceſſary to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and if ſome conſiderable portion of time were needful for it to be made in; yet ſince God hath made it our neceſſary duty, and neceſſary to ſuch mighty purpoſes of gain on our ſide, we ſhould, and we ought in duty and wiſdom too, to take care of it; how much more then, when neither much time, nor great pains are needful to it? and how inexcuſable are thoſe, that plead want, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94519:100"/>
difficulty of preparation to excuſe them, when ſuch an ordinary endeavour would ſuffice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both?</p>
                  <p>Surely the regarding ſuch a neceſſary duty is a matter of greater neceſſity and importance, than to be baulked upon ſo very frivolous and vain an excuſe, and there depends more upon it, than will permit Men to think that every little pretence will be diſpenſation from it. In ſuch caſes Men pull off the vizard, and through all the thin pretences the true reaſon may be ſeen. It is not becauſe Men cannot prepare themſelves for the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but becauſe they will not, it is not becauſe there is any ſuch difficulty in the thing, but becauſe Men have no mind to it, and would gladly upon any pretence be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I go on now to the fourth thing that was propoſed on this head, <hi>viz</hi> that though men may have been careleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed themſelves for the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one time, yet they ought to be more careful to prepare themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next, for continual indiſpoſition can excuſe no man; ſo that if ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition be upon a man now, yet care ought to be taken for its removal, that he may be fitted and prepared to Communicate the next time that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls him to it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I proceed to the direct purpoſe of this period, I ſhall take occaſion by way of premiſal, to ſpeak ſomthing to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it, and to examine a caſe that we ſee often happens upon the reaſon thereof; it is too common a thing, for Men that make ſome conſcience of communicating in the Holy Sacrament, yet frequently to intermit it, and to ſtay from it upon the reaſon of ſome preſent accidental indiſpoſition, whether real or pretended I examin not, I will ſuppoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94519:101"/>
it in their eſtimation to be real, becauſe I will not think that any good Man will, or can ſtay from the Holy Sacrament upon any but what he thinks to be ſo. I would fain hope this is the reaſon, why many good Men, regular ſteddy Chriſtians, do indulge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty of neglecting the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo often as we ſee them do; I would fain hope (I ſay) it is upon the reaſon of ſome fancied indiſpoſition that is upon them, and not either out of any diſreſpect to it, or opinion, that it is at their choice, when to obſerve it, or when to turn their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; the practice is too common, but the reaſon of it worſe, and ſuch Men muſt be let know, that it is not left to them when to come to the Holy Sacrament, and when not, and that a preſent indiſpoſition will not warrant or excuſe their ſtaying from it. I think it a very neceſſary thing to offer ſomthing in cure of this opinion and practice, and to that end beg the conſideration of theſe following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is greatly queſtionable whether the ſuppoſition of the caſe be allowable. <hi>viz.</hi> whether any thing can ſo far indiſpoſe a regular good Chriſtian, as to bring him into any guilt or danger in coming to the Holy Sacrament; I do really believe, that if a Man be fit for other ſervices of Religion, he is fit for this, and ought no more to ſtay away from one, than he doth from the other. I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94519:101"/>
cannot but wonder upon what reaſon it is, that Men that abſtain not from other ſervices of Religion becauſe of that preſent indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, do yet abſtain from this, or conclude themſelves unfit for the one, when they think they are fit for the other. I am ſure the Primitive Church thought otherwiſe, and by Canon made it neceſſary for thoſe that joined in the other publick ſervices of the Church to communicate in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if we ſhould allow the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and grant that ſuch a Man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome indiſpoſition, that doth render him unfit to communicate for that time, yet he muſt be told, that that indiſpoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, cannot ſo warrant his ſtaying from the Sacrament as to excuſe him from ſin in it.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not tell you that I ſpeak of moral indiſpoſitions now, and not of natural: ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes, miſchances and hurts, &amp;c. ſuppoſing them not to be cauſed by our own follies and vices, do not come into our preſent account, or fall under this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; they are our miſeries indeed, but not our ſins, and the not performing the ſervices of Religion becauſe of them, is not our guilt; in all ſuch caſes that of the Prophet holds true, <hi>that God will have mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſpeak here of moral indiſpoſitions,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94519:102"/>
ſuch as either through carleſneſs, or humane infirmity, or the ſurpriſe and violence of temptation, or the cares of the World, and hurries of buſineſs, Men have fallen into, or from what other cauſe ſoever it may ariſe; and I ſay, howſoever thoſe things may indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man for the Holy Sacrament, yet they do not excuſe his ſtaying from it. So that Men ſhould take great heed in this caſe, and not think that they may preſently ſtay away from the Holy Sacrament, as often as they find themſeves indiſpoſed, or unfitted for it.</p>
               <p>No Man needs propoſe the queſtion to me, whether it be better to come in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to ſtay away, for neither is ſo much as good, and 'tis impertinent to inquire which is beſt; and there is no neceſſity of either in the preſent caſe, there is a happy medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, which always is open, and ſhould alwaies be taken by Men in this caſe. <hi>viz.</hi> to do their duty, and do all they can to remedy that which would indiſpoſe them for it. A Man may be ſenſible of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition and ſorry for it, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and pray againſt it, implore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy for the pardon, and grace for the removal of it; and this he ſhould do, but by no means ſit down under it, and neglect ſo neceſſary a ſervice of Religion by reaſon of it. I think it much better, and therefore ſhould adviſe a Man rather to go to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94519:102"/>
Sacrament, though ſome preſent indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition were upon him, than ſo far to yield to the one, as to neglect the other. I am ſure a neceſſary duty ought to be done, and it is much better to do it as well as a Man can, then wholly neglect it, becauſe he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unfit to do it ſo well as he ſhould.</p>
               <p>Now if Men would conſider this, and remember that they never do well in ſtaying from the Holy Sacrament upon this reaſon, and that they are not innocent in it, did they believe that every time they ſtay away from it, they ſin in doing ſo, it would perhaps give ſome check to that liberty, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take in this caſe; and that they ought thus to believe, and thus to conſider, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plain upon theſe two reaſons which I but juſt name, becauſe I have conſidered them already.</p>
               <p>Firſt that the Holy Sacrament is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſervice of Religion, and it is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indiſpenſible duty, to partake of it, when he may. The Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is on all hands granted neceſſary to the being of a Chriſtian Church, and the partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them neceſſary to the being a true member of that Church; God hath neither left it to our liberty and choice, whether we will receive it at all or not, nor whether we will receive it at this time, and not that; it is our neceſſary duty, and it is our ſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant duty, at leaſt every time that the Church doth call us unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:94519:103"/>So that upon the ſame reaſon that Men think themſelves obliged to go to Church, every Sunday, and joyn in the publick Prayers and Service of it, and do not count every little indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon them a diſcharge from it, upon the ſame they ought to think it their duty to go to the Holy Sacrament, every time the Church adminiſters it, and that every accidental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition can no more excuſe them from the one, than the other; for the neglecting it at any time, is neglecting a duty, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting a duty is a ſin, and whatever any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition may do towards the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of it, yet it can never warrant or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the ſame.</p>
               <p>And that ſecondly, becauſe that indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever it be, is our own only fault. This I have proved before; whatever indiſpoſitions may be upon us, whatever it is that we think renders us at preſent unfit to communicate, it is come upon us by our own only care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and neglect: we ſhould, and with the help of God's grace we might live ſo, as to be reaſonably fit for this ſervice at any time, and it is our own folly and fault if we be not. And if this be true, it will ſoon ſatisfie any Man in this matter, unleſs he be ſo groſs, as to think that one ſin can excuſe another, or that a Man's ſins not in neglecting that duty, which his own folly and vice hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed him for.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>ANd now I reſume the purport of this fourth conſideration which is this. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome preſent indiſpoſition and unfitneſs be upon a Man, and ſuppoſe it could be a ſufficient excuſe for his not receiving the Holy Sacrament, yet it would be ſo but for that own time only; ſpeedy care ought to be taken againſt it, and all endeavour uſed for the removal of it againſt the next time; for continual unfitneſs can't poſſibly excuſe any Man from it.</p>
                  <p>I lay down this againſt thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies complaining of their unfitneſs for the Holy Sacrament, and upon that reaſon ſtay always from it, hoping to be excuſed in ſo doing. Few things are more common than this; and we ſee it inſtanced almoſt every Day: there are ſome careleſs negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on one hand, that care not to come up to the full communion of the Church, and there are ſome diſaffected perſons on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are prejudiced againſt it; but both ſides when preſſed to the Holy Sacrament, have the ſame plea of their unworthineſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make, and think to be excuſed upon the reaſon of it. One ſort of Men plead it honeſtly, and upon real ſcruple, but it is to be feared another ſort plead it upon deſign, and uſe it as an artificial excuſe againſt that which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94519:104"/>
they have no mind unto. I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe ſorts of people diſtinctly and ſeparately, but apply my ſelf to the removal of this evil, and argue the unreaſonableneſs of it, upon ſuch conſiderations as may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the cure of it, from what cauſe ſoever it may ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt I deſire to know, whether ſuch Men count their unworthineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs a Sin or not, and I ask this queſtion, becauſe I really fear a great many do not.</p>
                  <p>Men talk of their unworthineſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of unfitneſs, and I fear count it a piece of humility to do ſo; and an acceptable thing to confeſs it, without ever reflecting ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon it as their great guilt, and that which they are obliged to reform. It's no new thing to hear ſome Men declare tragically againſt themſelves, and to ſeem mighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in confeſſing of thoſe Sins, which they are far enough from hating, or reſolving to amend, and we know too many that count it enough to confeſs their Sins, without any care to forſake them. And I am very much afraid, it is ſo with too many in our preſent caſe, they call themſelves unfit, and unworthy for the Holy Sacrament, but I do not ſee them much concerned or troubled that they are ſo, no nor condemning or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe of themſelves becauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to any that pleads this in bar of his coming to the Holy Sacrament, I
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94519:104"/>
would make this inquiry in the firſt place, whether they look upon this unfitneſs as a crime, as a Sin in them or not? and one would be ready to think, that Men could never impoſe ſo far upon themſelves, as not to think ſo, and that they muſt be under ſome great deluſions, if they do; let us agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this in the firſt place, and we ſhall better go on to what remains; this is really a great fault, which Men ought to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and to grieve for, and not to look upon with indifferency, and unconcernedneſs, much leſs to value themſelves upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since then it is, and ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a Sin, and a very grievous fault, I deſire they will pleaſe to conſider, and tell me if it ought not to be reformed and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? one would think there were no need to ask this queſtion, nor to doubt whether Men ſhould amend their faults or not, this is a thing not to be ſo much as deliberated about, by any that conſider what an evil Sin is in it ſelf, what a train of miſchiefs it draws after it, and what a dreadful thing it is, to live in that, which expoſeth a Man to the wrath of an Almighty God; and ſuch a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs for the Holy Sacrament is, if it be a Sin.</p>
                  <p>I would therefore have Men as ſenſible and fearful of Sin in this, as they appear to be of it on the other ſide, and then they would no more dare to continue in this, than
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94519:105"/>
be guilty of the other. We ſee ſome Men mighty ſenſible of the Sin of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily,</hi> and very fearful of being guilty of it. Now I would fain have them as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Sin, of being <hi>unworthy,</hi> and unfit to eat, and as much afraid to continue in it, the guilt is the ſame in both caſes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they be afraid of Sin upon a true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in one, they will be ſo in the other alſo. I have often ſaid (and ſome Men cannot be told it too often) that it is a bad ſign to ſee Men ſcrupulous and tender only on one ſide, and 'tis an unaccountable thing to ſee Men ſo fearful of ſinning in coming to the Holy Sacrament, but never to ſcruple or be afraid of ſinning in ſtaying from it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfit to come. Starting and trembling at the thoughts of Sin in the one, but being regardleſs and inſenſible of it in the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be then a Sin, and what Men ought to amend, I ask in the third place, when Men intend to ſet about it, and endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fitter? muſt it be poſtpon'd, and put off as many other good and neceſſary things are, to hereafter, and to a time to come no body knows when? this is that unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able folly, that Men are ſo ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all others for in other caſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not allow in themſelves here.</p>
                  <p>All the great arguments, that combine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the folly and danger of procraſtinating in repentance, and putting off good purpoſes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94519:105"/>
to hereafter, unite againſt this; and Men that can urge them ſo readily to others in thoſe caſes, ſhould not reſiſt them themſelves in this. Beſides all which, there is one conſideration which ſeems peculiar in this caſe, and ought to be of effect in it, and that is, that coming to the Holy Sacrament is one good means to become fit, and to redreſs the unworthineſs that Men complain of. I ſaid once before in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that few Men become more fit by ſtaying from it, but many have by coming to it; the longer Men ſtay away, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in all probability they will be, and one good way of coming fitly, is to come as well as they can.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not only here as it is in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, the ſooner Men ſet about redreſſing the unfitneſs, the eaſier the doing it will be, but the very ſetting about it, is a good part of it; and I not only ſay, that the longer Men continue unfit, the more guilt they contract, and the heavier will the burthen of their Sin be; the greater hazard they run, and put their duty upon the greater uncertainty and chance; but they aggravate their unfitneſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſe their indiſpoſition, and contribute to the difficulty of removing the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Having got thus far then, that this is an evil, that it ought to be reformed, and the ſooner the better in all reſpects; it will eaſily be conſidered, that if Men do ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their unfitneſs, it is plainly wilful and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94519:106"/>
affected. Men that know their faults, and how greatly they are concerned to reform them, and yet do not ſhew themſelves to be greatly in love with them, or enſlaved to them; and Men that will not ſtrive againſt their diſeaſes, ſeem pleaſed with them.</p>
                  <p>Now in ſuch a caſe the evil of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition doubles, and whatever guilt reſults from it, ſwells in the ſame proportion: he that wilfully indulgeth to a Sin, enhanſeth the guilt of it, and he that neglects a duty, becauſe he cheriſheth that which unfits him for it, hath a double guilt to anſwer for; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, unaffected indiſpoſitions that come upon Men by ſurpriſe, by the violence of temptation, or upon the ſcore of unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infirmity, are pitiable, and capable of mercy, but he that cheriſheth them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him from duty, ſtands doubly guilty before God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To all which conſiderations I only add this one more, that whether Men do, or do not endeavour to redreſs their preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs for the Holy Sacrament, they muſt be let know, and they ought ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that continual unfitneſs can never excuſe them from it.</p>
                  <p>The receiving the Sacrament (I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is a neceſſary indiſpenſible Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for which nothing that I know of, but natural incapacities can excuſe Men, much leſs ſuch moral indiſpoſitions as both ſhould,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94519:106"/>
and eaſily may be removed; a preſent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental indiſpoſition (how fair ſoever it may bid) yet can never excuſe a ſingle omiſſion of the Holy Sacrament; and if ſo, then I am ſure no indiſpoſition can excuſe the total continued neglect of it.</p>
                  <p>And of all things certainly it were moſt ſtrange, if Men ſhould hope to be excuſed in the continual neglect of their duty, upon pretences of continual unfitneſs to do it, this is ſo abhorrent to human reaſon, that it cannot be believed. No Man living will allow it in a Servant, in a Child, or in any that owes duty to him, and therefore hath no reaſon to hope that God will allow it in himſelf, eſpecially when he conſiders, that that unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath come upon him through his own fault, and might be redreſſed by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent care.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are now come to the third and laſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection which was made from this Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That the true and only deſign of the Apoſtle in theſe words, and in this form of ſpeaking, was to engage the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to that reverence and devotion in the Holy Sacrament, that became ſo ſolemn a ſervice of Religion, as that is. I ſhall not need to ſtay long on this Argument, for I deſign but two things only upon it, and a little will ſuffice to diſpatch them both.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Shall endeavour to prove that this is really the ſenſe of theſe words, and the Apoſtle's great deſign in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall repreſent the reaſonableneſs of the thing, and ſhew how fit and neceſſary devotion and reverence is, for them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is really the deſign and purport of the Apoſtle in theſe words, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make good from theſe three conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Firſt, what the crime of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> was that theſe words were intended
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94519:107"/>
to reform. Secondly, the phraſe of the Text in which he endeavours that reformation. And thirdly the things that he preſcribes in order to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the firſt of theſe I have given account already, and ſhewed that this crime of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which he ſo ſharply taxeth, was a monſtrous ſhameful diſreſpect, and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Holy Sacrament, to which I ſhall only add that it was occaſioned by theſe two precedent errors, and miſcarriages. Firſt, their not <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> Secondly their intemperance in eating and drinking in the love-feaſt that preceded this Service.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They did not <hi>diſcern the Lords Body,</hi> they did not know, or they did not conſider that this was a ſolemn ſervice of Religion, and that there was a myſtery in it, they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſon of its inſtitution, that the Bread was Sacramentally the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine in the ſame ſenſe his Blood, that both were to repreſent his Sufferings and Death, and that our partaking of them was religiouſly to commemorate and gratefully to adore the love of God to ſinners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>In plain terms, as both the Sacramental Bread and Wine was part of what they had eaten and drank in the love-feaſt juſt before, ſo they looked upon them to be ſtill the ſame, and but only a concluding morſel, and a grace Cup, with which that feaſt was to be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94519:108"/>
ended; for that (as we ought to know) was the common cuſtom among the Jews, and theſe Grecians too; to conclude their feaſts with a Loaf, or ſmall parcel of Bread, of which every one took a little piece, and a Glaſs or Bowl of Wine, of which every one drank, in token or in pledg of that unity and love, that then was, and afterwards ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue among the gheſts that had then feaſted together.</p>
               <p>Now being ſo ignorant and uninſtructed (as it ſeems they were) in the reaſon of the Holy Sacrament, they might eaſily ſlip into this miſtake, and knowing that their former feaſt was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a feaſt of love, and inſtituted to be a means of creating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing love among them, they might eaſily take the Sacramental Bread and Wine, (being a portion of what they had eat and drank before) to be but a <hi>teſſera cheritatis,</hi> ſuch a pledge and token of love among them, as was uſed at their other feaſts.</p>
               <p>This is the true ſtate of this matter, and it gives us one plain account of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and profanation of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which theſe perſons were guilty of, and how ſtrange ſoever the thing may appear to us, yet when theſe circumſtances are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the wonder ceaſeth, and the reaſon is plain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet this was not all, nor the worſt in this matter, for their intemperance was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94519:108"/>
worſe than their ignorance and would more fatally prejudice their reverence and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; intemperance in eating and drinking is the greateſt hinderance of devotion poſſible, and plain gluttony and drunkenneſs utterly inconſiſtent with it.</p>
               <p>Now this you find the Apoſtle charging them roundly and plainly with, at leaſt the richer ſort of them, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>one is hungry, and another is drunk;</hi> which though it may ſeem very ſtrange, and one would think incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to a Chriſtian, yet we have a plain account given us alſo how this happened.</p>
               <p>For theſe love-feaſts were upon a common ſtock, to which every one contributed his ſingle portion; the poor (you may well think) could bring little or nothing, but the rich brought more, every Man (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>according to the ability which God had given.</hi> And perhaps among theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> (than whom no Grecians were more vain &amp; proud) every one might ſtrive to exceed the other. Now hitherto all was tolerably well, only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſome vanity might mingle with theſe contributions; but here was the firſt fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, theſe richer perſons inſtead of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſymbols to the common ſtock, feaſted upon their own ſingle portions, and having much to eat and drink, did eat and drink accordingly, and commonly to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as to be downright drunk, by that time they came to the Holy Sacrament, which was
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94519:109"/>
always celebrated at the end of theſe feaſts, of ſuch a portion of Bread and Wine, as was ſeparated out of the publick offertories.</p>
               <p>Now coming to the Holy Sacrament in this ſad condition, no wonder if they profaned it indeed, and ſhewed ſo little reverence and regard to it: a drunken Man is every way as unfit for devotion as an ignorant Man can be; but when Men are both theſe, no irreverence can ſeem ſtrange, that they are guilty of.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things occaſioned this terrible irreverence and profanation of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that our Apoſtle chargeth them with, and from which theſe words are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reform and affright them for the future, and by conſidering this, we may ſurely collect what the great purpoſe of them was: for as when we know a diſeaſe, we can gueſs eaſily what the deſign of the Phyſick preſcribed in cure of it is; ſo by conſidering what the errror and miſcarriage of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> was, we may conclude what the deſign of the Apoſtle is in theſe words, which he uſeth in remedy of it; and therefore ſince the great fault of them conſiſted in their horrible irreverence, and want of reſpect to this ſervice, we can aſſure our ſelves, that what he intended was to reform that fault, and bring them to that reverence and devotion that became a ſervice of Religion, and that ſo ſolemn too, as he had inſtructed them the Holy Sacrament was. So that ſince their eating and drinking ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94519:109"/>
and profanely, was that eating <hi>unworthily</hi> that he ſpeaks of; their doing this worthily, would be by communicating with that Religion, reverence, and devotion that became a ſervice ſo ſacred as that was.</p>
               <p>This (I am confident) is really the ſenſe of theſe words, and a true account of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's intent and meaning in them; the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which would be a great relief to ſcrupulous and timorous perſons in this caſe, and let them ſee how much others pervert, and they themſelves miſtake the ſenſe of this Text, who conclude every error and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in communicating, to be that eating and drinking <hi>unworthily,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo ſharply blames, and ſo ſeverely threatens in theſe words.</p>
               <p>I conclude by only adding this obſervation, if eating and drinking irreverently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely, be that eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily which the Apoſtle means in this place, then eating and drinking with that reverence and devotion that becomes ſuch a ſervice of Religion, will ſet Men above the danger of that unworthineſs; and if to bring Men to this was the only thing he aimed at, then Men do very ill to put other ſences upon this Text, and to fright themſelves and others, with the ſound of words that do not concern them.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THere is a ſecond thing alſo (I told you) to confirm us in this account of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's meaning here, and that is the phraſe of the Text, both that in which the Sin, and the cauſe, and the puniſhment of it too, is expreſſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word expreſſing the Sin is <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi> which cannot ſignifie ſtrictly, according to the literal ſenſe of the word, nor ought to be extended to every indiſpoſition, and to every failure to eat ſo worthily as Men ſhould; for then neither could any Man living eat worthily, nor with his utmoſt care avoid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>unworthily;</hi> this is a ſtate of inſuperable imperfection, and while we are in it, ſome ſtains will ſtick to our beſt performances, our beſt and moſt devout ſervices will need the merits of Chriſt to expiate, and the mercy of God to pardon the failures of them. And had we not ſuch a compaſſionate mediator to interceed for, and ſuch a merciful God to pity and pardon us, we ſhould have little reaſon to hope, that any of our ſervices ſhould be accepted by him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if this were the ſenſe of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unworthily,</hi> there might be reaſon to fright Men from the Holy Sacrament as ſome teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have done; nay and the command of our Lord to keep up the practice of it in his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94519:110"/>
Church would be ſtrangely unreaſonable, it would be a hard thing to tie up his votaries to the obſervation of that, which they could never do ſo, as to hope to be accepted in the doing of, but muſt moſt infallibly incur a certain danger of very great puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>unworthily</hi> in this place muſt ſignifie indecently, unbecomingly, i.e. in other words irreverently and profanely, juſt as if Men were about common things; for the great indecency in performing ſervices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to do them careleſly, rudely, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as if they were, or we looked upon them to be common ordinary things, things which by our behaviour we were not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh from the common ſervices of life, and upon which we were not to believe that the momentous concerns of the divine favour and eternal happineſs did depend upon. This the word doth ſignifie, and when both the nature of the thing, and the matter of fact related to, do require that ſignification; then I am ſure we have all to juſtifie that expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that in reaſon can be deſired.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words alſo in which the cauſe of this miſcarriage is expreſſed, conclude for this expoſition of the Text alſo; now thoſe are <hi>not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> which (as I have often ſhewed) ſignifie the not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reaſon, purpoſe and deſign of this ſervice, looking upon it as a common thing, and taking the Bread and Wine, to be but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94519:111"/>
juſt like thoſe, with which their common feaſts uſed to be concluded with.</p>
                  <p>So that by conſidering what the cauſe of this miſcarriage was, we are as planily ſhewed, what it was, and wherein it did conſiſt, as can be wiſhed; for if they did not underſtand that this was a Solemn ſervice of Religion, and if becauſe of this they did eat <hi>unworthily,</hi> then that unworthineſs muſt mean irreverence, common behaviour, want of devotion, that being the moſt natural and immediate effect of <hi>not diſcerning the Lords Body;</hi> the cauſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points us to the effect, and gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what it was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the word in which the puniſhment threatned to the miſcarriage is expreſſed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines with the other alſo in aſſuring this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, now that is this ſtartling word <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which (as the next verſe ſhews plainly,) ſignifies here temporal puniſhments; inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, and at moſt but corporal death.</p>
                  <p>Now I obſerve that theſe were thoſe chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which profaning Sacred things, and the Services of Religion uſed to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed under the Law; inſtances of theſe are frequent in the old Teſtament, and well known to thoſe that have conſidered it.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> being drunk (as the circumſtances of the ſtory plainly ſhew) and in that diſorder, and that miſtake which it cauſed offering ſtrange fire, are immediately
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94519:111"/>
ſlain, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. and thus <hi>Corah</hi> and his two hundred Men with him, that durſt uſurp the Prieſts office, and preſume to offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, as if it had been a common or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing, are deſtroyed by fire that came from God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.35. Thus when the Men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> had ventured to rifle the Ark of God, and to look temerariouſly into it, they are ſmitten with divers puniſhments and Death, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. And thus when <hi>Uzzah</hi> being a common perſon put forth his hand to touch it, he is ſmitten dead upon the place, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6, 7. And ſo when King <hi>Uzziah</hi> in his wrath and pride would perform the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credotal office, and preſume to offer incenſe, the Leproſie preſently broke out upon him, 2. <hi>Croni.</hi> 26.18, 19.</p>
                  <p>By which and many more ſuch it appears that this was the puniſhment, with which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the Services of Religion, and Sacred things uſed to be puniſhed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and this being the puniſhment threatned, and actually inflicted upon theſe indevout <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> it is a fair preſumption, that as their Sin was a profaning the Holy Sacrament, as a common thing, ſo the deſign of the Apoſtle was to correct, and prevent that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation for the future, and engage them to that devotion and reverence that became ſo Sacred a Service, and inſtitution of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhment plainly points to the Sin, and by knowing one, we may judge pretty
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94519:112"/>
well what the other was, and by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what both were, we may conclude what the Apoſtle's deſign was in theſe words. <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent that Sin, and that puniſhment too for the future, and to bring them to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with that Religion, awe and devotion, that ſuch an inſtitution of Religion might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and challenge from them.</p>
                  <p>I think theſe circumſtances obſervable in the Text to be fairly argued from, and to conclude ſtrongly for that account and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that I have given of it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>ANd yet there is a third thing obſervable to unite with theſe to warrant the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument, and that is to conſider the things that he preſcribes to this purpoſe, and to remedy the precedent evil. I ſhall need to mention only theſe three following, all which are plain in the following part of the chapter. The firſt is the difference that there was, and ought to be made between their one Houſes and that of God. The ſecond is his inſtructing them in the nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Service; and the third is his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſerious conſideration of theſe things; there is a fourth that may be of ſome uſe to conſider alſo, though it more immediately relate to the love-feaſt that preceded.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing I obſerve uſed by the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94519:112"/>
Apoſtle to remedy this fault among them, is to conſider that difference that there was, and ought to be between their own Houſes, and that of God, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>what have you not Houſes to eat, and to drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Houſe of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The plain meaning of which is this; you have Houſes of your own to perform the common acts and ſervices of life in; but God's Houſe is appropriate to the ſervice of Religion, and all things that you are required to do there, you ought to eſteem as ſuch, and conſequently to look upon them as things that require great reverence and devotion, and a very differing reſpect and carriage, from what thoſe things to be done in your own Houſes do.</p>
                  <p>From whence as it is evident, that eating and drinking in Gods Houſe, with as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Religion as they did in their own, was the fault; ſo what he deſigned in this diſcourſe, was to bring them to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that became the Houſe of God, and thoſe ſacred Services of Religion that it was ſet apart, and appropriated unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing that he uſeth to the ſame purpoſe, is inſtructing them fully in the nature and reaſon of this ſervice, which it ſeems they were ſo ignorant of; this he doth from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to 27. where he lets them know, firſt that it was the laſt inſtitution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a little before his being betrayed. <hi>The Lord Jeſus in the ſame night that he was betrayed took Bread, and when he had given
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94519:113"/>
thanks he brake it, and ſaid take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you; after the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſaying this Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> And therefore this was a great deal more, than that common concluding mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and draught, which they had taken it to be; it was a ſolemn Service of Religion, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſtitution of Chriſt, and therefore to be obſerved with another kind of temper &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, than they had profanely treated it with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the ſober and ſerious conſideration and remembrance of all this, is what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in the third place, as the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cure of this miſcarriage, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</hi> let him examine himſelf whether he underſtand theſe things, whether he know and conſider wherefore this Service was inſtituted. Let him conſider what a ſacred Service of Religion this is, and what a meaſure of reverence and devotion becomes him, who doth approach the Table of the Lord, and there partake of the ſymbols of his moſt precious Body and Blood.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of all this will moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually cure and reſtrain from all this rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and profanation, and powerfully ingage to that awe and reverence, that muſt needs poſſeſs all thoſe that diſcern the Lords Body, and underſtand what they are doing, when they eat that Bread, and drink that Cup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:94519:113"/>From theſe three things I think it ſufficiently plain, that rudeneſs and irreverence towards the Holy Sacrament was the great fault of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo taxeth here, and endeavours to reform, and that therefore to bring them to reverence, devotion, and a ſence of Religion in it, is his great deſign in all this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a fourth thing that perhaps may be pertinent to obſerve here to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that is what he adviſeth <hi>verſe</hi> 33, 34. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren when ye come together, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one for another, and if any hunger let him eat at home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I confeſs ſeems more directly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the love-feaſts, and to reſpect the redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe faults that they were guilty of in them; but yet they do ultimately refer to the Holy Sacrament: for feaſting together chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably like friends and Brethren, and eating and drinking at home that they might not do ſo then to intemperance and exceſs, would preſerve them in the fitter temper for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and from that intemperance and diſorder, that was one great cauſe of their ſcandalous irreverence and profanation of it.</p>
                  <p>But I need no artificial and collateral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in this caſe; the matter is made plain by the former conſiderations which are all pertinent, and direct to this purpoſe, and render what I am contending for evident. So that it is really a wonder why many Men
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94519:114"/>
ſhould make ſuch a pother and ſtir about the ſenſe of this place, and the meaning of <hi>eating and drinking unworthily;</hi> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing the minds of ſcrupulous Perſons, and frighting them from ſuch a neceſſary part of their duty, as communicating in the Holy Sacrament certainly is.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>A very little may ſuffice on this, becauſe the reaſon of the thing is plain, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the common practice; of all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in our Religion this is commonly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt, and how indevout and careleſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men are in others, yet they are alwaies ſeen ſerious and devout in this: the truth is Men rather offend on this hand, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94519:114"/>
I do not mean in being too devout and reverent at the Holy Sacrament, for that they never can be, but I mean in thinking ſo highly and awfully of it, as to be poſſeſſed with even a ſuperſtitious fear of it, which the great deſign of this diſcourſe hath been to remove, and in order thereto to rectifie ſome miſtakes of Men, that may have contributed to the ſame.</p>
               <p>So that it is only to prevent that roving extravagant fancy of running into extreams (which I told you in the beginning of this diſcourſe giddy minds are ſo incident unto) that I add this in the concluſion of this diſcourſe, let Men ſee that I do not encourage any Mans light opinion or diſeſteem of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, but contend for it as earneſtly as any Man, and to that purpoſe go on to remark the reaſons upon which the becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs, and neceſſity of it doth rely; I ſhall need little more than juſt to name them.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>ANd firſt I deſire it may be conſidered, that this is an immediate Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is an inſtitution of our dear Lord, and the obſervance of it an immediate act of worſhip, and expreſſiono four Homage and duty to our God.</p>
                  <p>How much ſoever Men may indulge to careleſneſs and indifferency in common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet the univerſal reaſon of all Mankind
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94519:115"/>
conſents in this, that Religion is a ſerious thing, and that the profoundeſt reverence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion becomes them, who ingage into the ſervices of it, and worſhip their God. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe teacheth Men to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Temple, and a common Houſe, and that Mens carriage in the one ſhould be very different from what it is, or may be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thoſe perſons that can behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as lightly, and irreverently in the Church, as on Stage, &amp;c. affront Religion and the ſervice of it; give the open lie to their one pretentions in ingaging into it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Keep thy foot when thou entereſt into the Houſe of God, and be not haſty to offer the Sacrifice of Fools, ſaith Solomon, Eccle.</hi> 5.1. and they that do not both keep that, and their whole Man too, do not poſſeſs themſelves with an awfull reverence of that great God they come to adore there, and whoſe immediate ſervice Religion is, will not only offer the Sacrifice of Fools, but of ſomthing worſe, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the end, and acceptance of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but turn it into guilt, and an argument againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not only a ſervice of Religion, but the higheſt, and moſt ſolemn ſervice of it; ſo it hath been alwaies accounted in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and for that reaſon ſhe hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſummate and end all others with it; it is her moſt auguſt and Solemn Sacrifice, the great and chief rite of Prayer, and her moſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94519:115"/>
devout and ſolemn Euchariſt, and expreſſion of praiſe.</p>
                  <p>And let me add (if it may ſignifie any thing with this Generation) it is the only band and teſtimony of our full communion with the Chriſtian Church: our Baptiſm admits us into the Church, gives us a right to all the priviledges and bleſſings of it, and our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church and ingaging into the ſtanding Services of Religion may procure us the Name of Chriſtians, and cauſe the World to repute and take us for ſuch; but it is this Holy Sacrament that makes us to be in full Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſts Church.</p>
                  <p>It is a vain thing for Men to ſay, they are no Papiſts, no Sectaries, &amp;c. they are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of the Church of England, when they do not communicate in Sacraments with her, they may be of any Church, or of no Church for all they do without this; and for any thing I know to the contrary, they do as actually cut off themſelves from the communion of the Church, by the neglect of the Holy Sacrament where they may have it, as they can do ſo by Hereſie, Apoſtacy, ſchiſm, or can be cut off by the higheſt cenſures of the Church herſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is a thing that ought to ſtick faſt upon ſome Mens thoughts; for if there be no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of the Church of Chriſt, and thoſe be not in this Church that do not join in her communion, and thoſe do not do this, who do not communicate in her Sacraments,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94519:116"/>
then ſome Mens conditions muſt be very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, and then we may aſſert the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as well as duty of the Holy Sacraments in order to Mens Salvation: the neceſſity I mean of them, where they may be had.</p>
                  <p>Nay I know not why I may not ſay more, <hi>viz.</hi> that the neglect of this Holy Sacrament doth as really forfeit Church memberſhip as the want of Baptiſm doth hinder it; and thoſe that live and dye amongſt us, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are no more true members of our Church than they that dye unbaptiſed; thoſe that have been admitted into the Church, and come not up to the terms of its communion, may forfeit that memberſhip as truly, as they who were never admitted into it, cannot pretend to it. For though Men may enter their names into a ſociety, yet unleſs they ſubmit to the Laws, and uſages of it they will neither be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted members of it, nor ſuffered to injoy the immunities and priviledges thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I add it not only is, and hath ever been accounted the higheſt ſervice of the Church, but that in which we are thought to have a nearer acceſs unto, and a more intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God than in others.</p>
                  <p>I do not urge its being ſo lively and viſible a repreſentation of that which is the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting meditation in Chriſtian Religion, and that upon this reaſon the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt had been ſet forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94519:116"/>
their Eyes, and Crucified among them, Gall.</hi> 3.1. though that alone were argument e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ingage Men to all reverence in it.</p>
                  <p>But I argue it upon another reaſon, namely that herein we are admitted to the Table of the Lord, where we not only feed with him, but feed upon him; <hi>we eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood;</hi> we partake of him, and are incorporated into him: <hi>we are made one with him, and he with us; we dwell in him, and he in us;</hi> as our Church ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>I do not here undertake the diſpute about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> that hard word, and that worſer thing, which the Church of Rome hath taken upon her to teach as an article of neceſſary faith, contrary to the nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carament, to the plain ſence of Scripture, to the doctrine and beliefe of the Primitive Church and Fathers of it, and to the common ſence and reaſon of all Mankind. It is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that came forth with the doctrine of their infallibility, and methinks 'twas very fit thoſe two monſters ſhould be born toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to let the World ſee how Gigantick the faith of a Romaniſt is; and I will ſay, thoſe that can believe the infallibility of their Popes, after ſo many inſtances of their having erred, and contradicted one another, may believe the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, contrary to all, and the plaineſt evidences of things, that it is poſſible for Mankind to have.</p>
                  <p>But I am not for admitting diſpute, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie into this diſcourſe, and therefore let
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94519:117"/>
that Doctrine paſs, as a thing more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and abhorrent to humane reaſon, than any that is to be met with even in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Poetick Theology.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, I add, and ſtill aſſert, that we do as truly, and to all real effects partake of Chriſt in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if we did literally eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood; our advantage is as real and true by the one, as it could be by the other.</p>
                  <p>The Church of England is for a real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Holy Sacrament, but it is that real preſence which the Primitive Church and good Fathers of it were for, and meant, when they ſpake to that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a real Spiritual preſence, a conferring all the great effects and benefits of his Body and Blood, as truly as if they themſelves were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent there. A Spiritual preſence is as real a preſence, as a Bodily, and the effects and benefits of Chriſts Body and Blood are real things too. So that the Body and Blood of Chriſt may be ſaid to be really and truly there, where all the effects and Bleſſings of them are really beſtowed; and the Church of England doth truly ſay, that they are <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper;</hi> when all the real benefits and effects of them are taken and received by them.</p>
                  <p>This (I am pretty well aſſured) is all that the Primitive Church and Fathers meant by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94519:117"/>
the real preſence, and this is ſufficient both for our faith, and comfort too; and while we are ſatisfied and aſſured of this, we neither need more, nor are obliged to puzle our ſelves about any further queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſurely is ſuch an argument and obligation to reverence and devotion in this ſervice, as can never miſs effect upon them that entertain the thoughts of it.</p>
                  <p>For if we do thus <hi>diſcern the Lords Body</hi> and take the Bread and Wine in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only to be the ſigns and ſymbols of our Lord's Body and Blood, but in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſenſe the very Body and Blood them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and by the grace and bleſſing of God upon them, to convey to us all thoſe effects and benefits, which the very Body and Blood, and our feeding upon them could do. Then certainly we cannot but pay all poſſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration to Chriſt when we partake of them, nor partake of them, without the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reverence, that our Souls are capable off. And as I may well think, that thoſe who can be rude, irreverent and profane, when they partake of theſe Holy Symbols, would be ſo to Chriſt were he viſibly and corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſo I may ſafely ſay, that upon the ſame reaſons that we would pay reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to our Lord, were he ſo preſent, we may, and we ſhould pay it, when we partake of thoſe things, which he hath inſtituted, and commanded us to obſerve as repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and memorials of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:94519:118"/>The truth is, the argument in this caſe, is rather too great, than any way defective, and upon every good Heart the effect muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording. It can ſcarce fail of running our devotion into rapture, and our reverence into extaſie and tranſport, to conſider that the great God ſhould put ſuch an honor upon poor creatures, not only entertain us at his own Table, but give us his own Sons Body and Blood, and all the bleſſed effects and benefits of them to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord! what is Man, that thou art ſo mindful of him, or the Son of Man that thou ſo regardeſt him!</hi> and what name is bad enough for that Man, whom ſuch love and condeſcenſion, ſuch Majeſty, and ſuch Bleſſing, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and ſtrike into the profoundeſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion, when he actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates in the Bleſſed Pledges of them all?</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>ANd now I have brought this diſcourſe to its deſigned concluſion, and have little more than to beg of God, that it may have at leaſt ſome part of that effect upon Men, that was deſigned in it.</p>
               <p>I do think a ſcruple of this nature neceſſary to conſidered; and I have endeavored to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it as well as I can; and I hope no Man will blame the undertaking, how defective ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may think the performance to be.</p>
               <p>Is it not great pity that any ſcruple ſhould keep Men in a total negligence of a neceſſary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94519:118"/>
duty, and cauſe them to think themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in it?</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſtrange thing, and lamentable, that Men ſhould lye under ſuch fatal miſtakes, as to think themſelves at liberty, whether they will obey the laſt dying command of their dear Lord? or that their love and homage to him can conſiſt with a conſtant diſregard of it?</p>
               <p>Is it not pity that Men ſhould be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſlight that, which is ſo mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to all the great purpoſes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Salvation? and in which the greateſt kindneſs and honour is offered to Men, that God can put upon them?</p>
               <p>Is it not pity and a ſhame that ſo many ſhould call themſelves Chriſtians, and of the Church of England too, and yet neglect that which is the higheſt duty of Chriſtianity, and the great band of communion with the Church?</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſhame for a Church to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sacraments, or for that Church to have members that never communicate in them?</p>
               <p>If any things in the World can be pitiable, theſe things are ſo. And if any thing can be neceſſary, it muſt be to conſider, what that thing is that is the great cauſe of them. Now this I would fain hope, is a fear that Men have taken up upon the reaſon of what is ſaid in theſe words; I would gladly hope that it is neither obſtinacy in ſome, nor careleſneſs in others that keeps them from the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94519:119"/>
but only fear and ſcruple in all, fear of coming <hi>unworthily,</hi> and incurring that <hi>Damnation,</hi> that is threatned by the Apoſtle to all that do ſo come.</p>
               <p>If this be the caſe of Men, they are really pitiable, and it is for the ſake of them, that this diſcourſe hath been undertaken, in which I hope ſomthing hath been offered, that may be conſidered to good purpoſe, and Men may find their account in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt Men by attending to it, may underſtand what the notion of eating and drinking <hi>unworthily</hi> is, and upon what reaſon the Apoſtle chargeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with it. <hi>viz.</hi> their not <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> their being drunk at the Lords Table as well as their own, and putting no difference between theſe and common things, and that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now can be guilty of the like Sin, but by ſomthing that ſets them as far from diſcerning the Lords Body, and paying due reſpect to it, as they were.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſecondly, by conſidering this, Men may perceive both how far they themſelves are from the Sin, and how little they need to be afraid of the ſame danger; if they find that by the grace of God they are ſecured from the one, they may confidently hope, that his mercy will ſecure them from the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may hence alſo learn what a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable meaſure of knowledge, devotion, and care will moſt certainly ſet them above all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94519:119"/>
poſſibility of this unworthineſs, and of that damnation threatned to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And fourthly by conſidering that it is their neceſſary duty, and the mercies and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God as great, and ready to pardon, the common infirmities of humanity in this as in any other Services of Religion, they may learn to ſlight, and ſurmount all their fears in this, as they do in them, and to come with as much chearfulneſs, ſenſe of duty, and hopes of divine acceptation in this, as in others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This diſcourſe may be of ſome uſe, to the directing, and encouraging Men in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for this Holy Sacrament, and not fright them by the labour, difficulty, length of time, and curiouſneſs of preparation, that ſome have accidently done.</p>
               <p>The effect of all which ſhould be the rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mens minds of thoſe unreaſonable and ſuperſtitious fears that they have too general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up, in prejudice againſt the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and addreſſing themſelves conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and chearfully unto it.</p>
               <p>And I have nothing more, but to beg them to give it this effect, to take heed that they ſhut not their eyes againſt clear light, that they pretend not ſcruples to keep them in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of a known neceſſary duty, and that they cheriſh not thoſe ſcruples, and wilfully retain them, againſt all reaſonable ways of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there is not a worſe, nor a more dangerous temper of mind than this, and he that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94519:120"/>
that for this cauſe God gave up the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to a <hi>reprobate ſence, to vile affections,</hi> and left them at laſt to follow things which reaſon and nature did abhor, had need to fear tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the ſame temper of mind leſt he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the ſame dreadful puniſhments.</p>
               <p>It were certainly much better to look upon our ſcruples of this ſort to be, as they really are, diſeaſes of our minds, and be as deſirous and ready to have the cure of them, as we are of the diſeaſes of our Bodies, to give God Almighty thanks, whoſe providence orders us theſe helps for the one, as well as the other. That ſo (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>both he that ſowes, and they that reap may rejoyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The one for that they are ſatisfied and relieved, and the other for that God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him ſo far as to be an inſtrument in it. Which I pray God almighty grant may be the iſſue of all at laſt. Amen.</p>
