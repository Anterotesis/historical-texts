            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were written, and ſent euery minute by thoſe that were fauourers of Goodneſſe, ſhewing what militarie diſcipline the Foe vſed in his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, and what Forts (if he were put at any time to flight) he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to; what ſtratagems he would practiſe, and where he did determine to lye in <hi>Ambuſcado.</hi> They that could not ſerue in perſon, in <hi>this Noble quarrell,</hi> ſent their <hi>Auxiliary</hi> Forces, well armed with Counſell. So that the <hi>Bel-man</hi> (contrary to his hopes) ſeeing himſelfe ſo ſtrongly and ſtrangely ſeconded by friends, doth now brauely aduance forward, in maine battalion. The day of encounter is appointed to be in this <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas Tearme:</hi> the place, <hi>Paules Church-yard, Fleetſtreete,</hi> and other parts of the Citie. But before they ioyne let me giue you note of one thing, and that is this.</p>
            <p>There is an <hi>Vſurper,</hi> that of late hath taken vpon him the name of the <hi>Bel-man,</hi> but being not able to maintaine that title, hee doth now call himſelfe the <hi>Bel-mans</hi> brother, his ambition is (rather out of vaine-glory then the true courage of an experienced Souldier) to haue the leading of the <hi>Van,</hi> but it ſhall be honor good enough for him (if not too good) to come vp with the <hi>Rere.</hi> You ſhall know him by his Habiliments, for (by the furniture he weares) he will be taken for a Beadle of <hi>Bridewell.</hi> It is thought he is rather a Nevvter then a friend to the cauſe: and therefore the <hi>Bel-man</hi> doth here openly proteſt that hee comes into the field as no fellow in armes with <hi>Him.</hi>

            <p>Howſoeuer it be ſtrucke, or whoſoeuer giues the firſt blow, the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie depends vpon the valour of you that are the Wings to the <hi>Bel-mans</hi> army, for which conqueſt he is in hope you will valiantly fight, ſithence the quarrell is againſt the head of monſtrous abuſes, and the blowes which you muſt giue are in defence of <hi>Law, Iuſtice, Order, Ceremonie, Religion, Peace,</hi> and that honourable title of <hi>Goodneſſe.</hi>

                     <p>And yet (euen out of all that <hi>Irregularity,</hi> vnhanſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fountaine of <hi>Barbariſme)</hi> doe they draw a kinde of forme: and in ſome wordes, (aſwell ſimple as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds) retaine a certaine ſalte, taſting of ſome wit, and ſome Learning. As for example, they call a cloake (in the <hi>canting</hi> tongue) a <hi>Togeman,</hi> and in Latin, <hi>Toga</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a gowne, or an vpper garment. <hi>Pannam</hi> is bread: &amp; <hi>Panis</hi> in Lattin is likewiſe bread, <hi>caſſan</hi> is chéeſe, and is a word barbarouſly coynde out of the ſubſtantiue <hi>caſeus,</hi> which alſo ſignifies chéeſe. And ſo of others.</p>
                     <p>Then by ioyning of two ſimples, doe they make almoſt all their compounds. As for example: <hi>Nab</hi> (in the <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Dialect of Canting.</note> tongue) is a head, and <hi>Nab-cheate,</hi> is a hat, or a cap: Which word <hi>cheate,</hi> being coupled to other wordes, ſtands in very good ſtead, and does excellent ſeruice: For a <hi>Smelling cheate,</hi> ſignifies a Noſe: a <hi>Prat-ling cheate,</hi> is a tongue <hi>Craſhing cheates,</hi> are téeth: <hi>Hearing. cheates</hi> are Eares: <hi>Fambles</hi> are Hands: and there vpon a ring is called a <hi>Fambling chete.</hi> A <hi>Muffling chete,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb facs="tcp:10043:6"/>
a Napkin. A <hi>Belly chete,</hi> an Apron: A <hi>Grunting chete,</hi> A Pig: A <hi>Cackling Chete,</hi> a Cocke or a Capon: A <hi>Quacking chete,</hi> a ducke: A <hi>Lowghing chete,</hi> a <hi>Cow:</hi> A <hi>Bleating chete,</hi> a Calfe, or a Shéepe: and ſo may that word be marryed to many others beſides.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe,</hi> or <hi>Cuffin,</hi> ſignifies a Man, a Fellow, &amp;c. But differs ſomething in his propertie, according as it méetes with other wordes: For a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is called a <hi>Gentry Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe:</hi> A good fellow is a <hi>Bene Cofe:</hi> a Churle is called, a <hi>Quier Cuffin; Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſignifies naught, and <hi>Cuffin</hi> (as I ſaid before) a man: and in <hi>Canting</hi> they terme a Iuſtice of peace, (becauſe hée puniſheth them belike) by no other name then by <hi>Quier cuffin,</hi> that is to ſay, a Churle, or a naughty man. And ſo, <hi>Ken</hi> ſignifing a houſe, they call a priſon, a <hi>Quire Ken,</hi> that is to ſay, an ill houſ.</p>
                     <p>Many péeces of this ſtrange coyne could I ſhew you, but by theſe ſmall ſtampes, you may iudge of the greater.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe, a Language is nothing els, then heapes of wordes, orderly wouen and compoſed together: and that (within ſo narrow a circle as I haue drawne to my ſelfe) it is impoſſible to imprint a <hi>Dictionarie</hi> of all the <hi>Canting</hi> phraſes: I will at this time not make you ſurfet on too much, but as if you were walking in a Garden, you ſhall openly plurke here a flower, and there another, which (as I take it) will bemore delightfull then if you gathered them by handfulls.</p>
                     <p>But before I lead you into that walke, ſtay and heare a <hi>Canter</hi> in his owne language, making Rithmes, albeit (I thinke) thoſe tharmes of <hi>Poeſie</hi> which (at the firſt) made the barbarous tame, and brought them ciuillity, can (vpon theſe ſauage Monſters) worke no ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

The great Lord of Limbo did therefore command all his blacke guard that ſtood about him, to beſtirre them in their places, and to defend the court wherein they liued: threatning (beſides) that his curſe, and all the plagues of ſtincking Hell ſhould <note place="margin">Graucolentis Auerni.</note> fall vpon his officers, ſeruants, and ſubiects, vnleſſe they either aduiz'd him, <hi>how,</hi> or take ſome ſpéedie order them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to puniſh that ſaucie intelligencer, the <hi>Bel-man</hi> of London.

                     <p>Another, thinking to cleaue the very pinne with his arrow, drew it home to the head of Wiſdome (as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) and yet that lighted wide too.

                        <p>THis <hi>Gul-groper</hi> is commonly an old Mony-monger, who hauing trauaild through all the follyes of the world in his youth, knowes them well, and ſhunnes them in his age, his whole felicitie being to fill his bags with golde and ſiluer: hée comes to an Ordinary, to ſaue charges of houſe-kéeping, and will eate for his two ſhillings, more meate then will ſerue thrée of the guard at a dinner, yet ſweares hée comes thether onely for the company, and to conuerſe with trauailers. It is a Gold-Finch that ſildome flies to theſe Ordinary Neſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hundred or two hundred pound in twenty ſhilling péeces about him. After the tearing of ſome ſeauen paire of Cardes, or the damning of ſome ten baile of Dice, ſteps hée vpon the Stage, and this part hée playes. If any of the <hi>Forlorne Hope</hi> be a Gentleman of Meanes, either in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> or in <hi>Poſſe,</hi> (and that the olde Foxe will be ſure to know to halfe an Acre) whoſe money runnes at a low ebbe, as may appeare by his ſcratching of the head, and walking vp and downe the roome, as if hée wanted an Oſtler: The <hi>Gul-groper</hi> takes him to a ſide window and tels him, hée is ſorry to ſée his hard lucke, but the Dice are made of womens bones, and will cozen any man, yet for his fathers ſake (whom hée hath knowne ſo long) if it pleaſe him, he ſhall not leaue off play for a hundred pound or two. If my yong Eſtrich gape to ſwallow downe this mettall (as for the moſt part they are very gréedy, hauing ſuch prouander ſet before them) then is the gold powred on the board, a Bond is made for repaiment, at the next quarter day, when <hi>Exhibition</hi> is ſent in: and becauſe it is all gold, and coſt ſo much the changing, the Scriuener (who is a whelpe of the old Maſtiues owne bréeding) knows what words will bite, which thus he faſtens vpon him, and in this Net the Gull is ſure to be taken (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer:) for if hée fall to play againe, and looſe, the hoary Goat-bearded Satyre that ſtands at his elbow, laughes
<pb facs="tcp:10043:16"/>
in his ſléeue: if his bags be ſo recouered of their Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicknes, that they be able preſently to repay the borrowed gold, then <hi>Monſieur Gul-groper</hi> ſteales away of purpoſe to auoide the reccipt of it; hée hath fatter Chickens in hatching: it is a fayrer marke hée ſhootes at. For the day being come when the bond growes due, the within named <hi>Signior Auaro,</hi> will not be within: or if hée be at home, hée hath wedges enough in his pate, to cauſe the bond to be broken, or elſe a little before the day, hée féeds my young Maiſter with ſuch ſwéete words, that ſurfetting vpon his proteſtations, hée neglects his paiment, as preſuming hée may doe more But the Law hauing a hand in the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bond, laies preſently hold of our yong Gallant with the helpe of a couple of Serieants, and iuſt at ſuch a time when old <hi>Erra Pater</hi> (the Iew) that lent him the money, knowes by his owne Prognoſtication, that the Moone with the ſiluer face is with him in the waine. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then can frée him out of the phangs of thoſe bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, but he muſt preſently confeſſe a iudgement, for ſo much money, or for ſuch a Manor or Lordſhip (thrée times worth the bond forfeited) to be paid, or to be entred vpon by him, by ſuch a day, or within ſo many moneths after he comes to his land. And thus are young heires coozend of their Acres, before they well know where they lye.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is another Fraternitie of wandring Pilgrims who merrily call themſelues, <hi>Iackes of the Clocke-houſe,</hi> and are very néere allyed to the <hi>Falconers,</hi> that went a Hawking before. The Clarke of <hi>Erebus</hi> ſet downe their names too in his Tables, with certaine bréefe notes of their practiſes: and theſe they are.</p>
                     <p>The Iacke of a Clocke-houſe goes vpon Screws, and his office is to doe nothing but ſtrike: ſo does this noiſe, (for they walke vp and downe like Fidlers) trauaile with <hi>Motions,</hi> and whatſoeuer their <hi>Motions</hi> get them, is called ſtriking.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Motions are certaine <hi>Collections,</hi> or wittie Inuentions, ſome-times of one thing, and then of an other (there is a new one now in towne, in praiſe of the <hi>Vnion.)</hi> And theſe are fairely written and engroſſed in Vellum, Parchement, or Royall paper, richly adorned
<pb facs="tcp:10043:24"/>
with compartiments, and ſet out with letters both in gold, and in various coulours.</p>
                     <p>This labour being taken, the Maiſter of the Motion hearkens where ſuch a Nobleman, ſuch a Lord, or ſuch a Knight lyes, that is liberall: hauing found one to his liking, The Motion (with his Patrons name fairely texted out, in manner of a Dedication,) is preſented before him: hée receiues it, and thinking it to be a worke onely vnder-taken for his ſake, is bounteous to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, eſtéeming him a Scholler, and knowing that not without great trauaile, hée hath drawne ſo many little ſtragling ſtreames into ſo faire and ſmoothe a Riuer: whereas the Worke is the labour of ſome other (copied out by ſtealth) by an impudent ignorant fellow, that runnes vp and downe with the Tranſcripts, and euery Ale-houſe may haue one of them (hanging in the baſeſt drinking roome) if they will be but at the charges of writing it out. Thus the liberallitie of a Nobleman, or of a Gentleman is abuſed: thus learning is brought into ſcorne and contempt: Thus men are cheated of their bountie, giuing much for that (out of their frée mindes) which is common abroad, and put away for baſe prices. Thus villanie ſome-times walkes alone, as if it were giuen to Melancholy, and ſome-times knaues tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a knot, becauſe they may be more merry, as by a mad ſort of Comrades whom I ſée leaping into the Saddle, anon it will apeare.</p>

Looke what difference their is betweene a ciuell cittizen of Dublin, &amp; a wilde Iriſh Kerne, ſo much difference there is betweene one of theſe counterfeit Egiptians and a true Engliſh Begger.

As the ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer has his wench and his Cocke with him when he goes to the warres, ſo theſe vagabonds haue their harlots with a number of little children following at their héeles: which young brood of Beggers, are ſometimes caried (like ſo many gréene géeſe aliue to a market) in payres of pameres, or in doſters like freſh-fiſh from Kye that comes on horſebacke, (if they be but infants.) But if they can ſtradle once, then aſwell the ſhée roagues as the hée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roagues are horſt, ſeauen or eight vpon one iade, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pineond, and ſtrangely tyed together.</p>
                     <p>One Shire alone &amp; no more is ſure ſtil at one time, to haue theſe Egiptian-tice ſwarming within it, for like flockes of wild géeſe, they will euermore fly one after another: let them be ſcattred worſe then the quarters of a traitor are after hées hang'd drawne and quartred, yet they haue a tricke (like water cut with a ſword) to come together inſtantly and eaſily againe: and this is their pollicy, which way ſoeuer the formoſtranckes lead,
<pb facs="tcp:10043:28"/>
they ſticke vp ſmall boughes in ſeuerall places, to euery village where they paſſe, which ſerue as enſignes to waft on the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Their apparell is old, and phantaſticke, tho it be neuer ſo full of rents: the men weare ſcarfes of Callico, or any other baſe ſtuffe, hanging their bodies like Morris-dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <note place="margin">His Furniture.</note> with bels, &amp; other toyes, to intice the countrey people to flocke about them, and to wounder at their fooleries, or rather rancke-knaueryes. The women as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly attire them-ſelues, and (like one that plaies, the Roague on a Stage) weare rags, and patched filthy mantles vppermoſt, when the vnder garments are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and in faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The battailes theſe Out-lawes make, are many and <note place="margin">His mannes of fight.</note> very bloudy. Whoſoeuer falles into their hands neuer eſcapes aliue, and ſo cruell they are in theſe murders, that nothing can ſatiſfie them but the very heart bloud of thoſe whom they kill. And who are they (thinke you) that thus goe to the pot? Alaſſe! Innocent Lambs, Shéep, Calues, Pigges, &amp;c. Poultrie-Ware are more churliſhly handled by them, then poore priſoners are by kéepers in the counter it'h Pouitry. A gooſe comming amongſt them learnes to be wiſe, that hée neuer will be Gooſe any more. The bloudy trage dies of al theſe, are only acted by the women, who carrying long kniues or Skeanes vnder their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, doe thus play their parts: The Stage is ſome large Heath: or a Firre-buſh Common, far from any houſes: Vpon which caſting them-ſelues into a King, they incloſe the Murdered, till the Maſſacare be finiſhed.

                     <p>The Cabbines where theſe Land-pyrates lodge in the night, are the Out-barnes of Farmers and Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (in ſome poore Village or other) who dare not deny them, for feare they ſhould ere Morning haue their thatched houſes burning about their eares: in theſe Barnes, are both their Cooke-rooines, their Supping Parlors, and their Bed-chambers: for there they dreſſe after a beaſtly manner, what ſoeuer they purchaſt after a théeuiſh faſhion: ſometimes they eate Veniſon, &amp; haue <hi>Gray-hounders</hi> that kill it for them, but if they had not, they are <hi>Houndes</hi> themſeiues and are damnable <hi>Hunters</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fleſh: Which appeares by their vgly-faced queanes that follow them, with whom in theſe barnes they lye, as Swine doe together in Hogſties.</p>

To theſe Markets of vnwholeſome Horſe-fleſh, (like ſo many Kites to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whereas in buying all other commodities, men ſtriue to haue the beſt, how great ſo euer the price be, onely the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſer is of a baſer minde, for the worſt Horſe-fleſh (ſo it be cheape) does beſt goe downe with him. Hée cares for nothing but a fayre out-ſide, and a hanſome ſhape (like thoſe that hyre whores,) though there be an hundred diſeaſes within: he (as the other) ventures vpon them all.</p>
                     <p>The firſt leſſon therefore that a Horſe-courſer takes out, when he comes to one of theſe Markets, is to make choyce of ſuch Nags, Geldings, or Mares, eſpecially, as are fat, fayre, and well-fauor'd to the eye: and becauſe men delight to behold beautifull colours, and thath ſome colours are more delicate (euen in beaſts) then others are, hée will ſo néere as hée can, bargaine for thoſe horſes that haue the daintieſt complexion: as the Milke-white, the Gray, the Dapple-Gray, the Cole blacke with his proper markes (as the white ſtarre in the fore-head, the

                     <p>Some of theſe <hi>Horſe-hunters,</hi> are as nimble Knaues in finding out the infirmities of a Iade, as a Barber is in drawing of téeth: and albeit (without caſting his water) hée does more readily reckon vp all the Aches, Crampes, Crickes, and whatſoeuer diſeaſe elſe lyes in his bones: and for thoſe diſeaſes ſeemes vtterly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him, yet if by looking vpon the Dyall within his mouth, he finde that his yeeres haue ſtruck but fiue, ſixe, or ſeuen: and that he prooues but young, or that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are but newly growing vpon him, if they be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or haue but hayre and ſkin to hide them, if they be inward, let him ſweare neuer ſo damnably, that it is but a Iade, yet he will be ſure to faſten vpon him.</p>

and in Smith-field a common forſworne Villaine. Hée will ſweare any thing, but the faſter hée ſweares, the more danger tis to beleeue him: In one forenoone, and in ſeiling a Iade not worth fiue Nobles, will hée forſweare himſelfe fiftéene times, and that forſwearing too ſhall be by <hi>Equiuocation.</hi> As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>SMithfield</hi> is the Stage vpon which the <hi>Mountibanke Engliſh Horſe-courſer</hi> aduancing his banner, defies any diſeaſe that dares touch his Prancer: Inſomuch that if a horſe be ſo olde, as that foure legs can but carry him, yet ſhall he beare the markes of an Nag not aboue ſixe or ſeauen yeeres of age: and that counterfeit badge of youth, hée weares thus: The <hi>Horſe-courſer</hi> with a ſmall round yron made very hot, burnes two blacke hoſes in the top of the two out-moſt téeth of each ſide the out-ſide of the Horſe mouth vpon the nether téeth, and ſo likewiſe of the téeth of the vpper chap, which ſtand oppoſit to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the qualitie of which markes is to ſhew that a horſe is but yong: but if the iade be ſo old that thoſe téeth are dropt out of his head, then is there a tricke ſtill to be fumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about his old chaps, and in that ſtrooking his chin, to pricke his lips cloſely with a pin or a naile, till they be ſo tender, that albeit be were a giuen horſe none could be ſuffered to looke him in the mouth (which is one of the beſt Calender to tell his age) but a reaſonable ſighted eye (without helpe of ſpectacles) may eaſily diſcouer this Iugling, becauſe it is groſſe and common.</p>

You ſhall know that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (in the late Quéenes time) many yéeres together
<pb facs="tcp:10043:44"/>
in the office of an High-Conſtable, in that Countie, wherein I now dwell, I drew from the examination of ſuch lewd perſons as came before mée, the truth of all thoſe villaynes which here I publiſh.</p>
                  <p>In the muſtring of this damned Regiment, I found, that whether they were Roagues taken in Romboyles (that is to ſay, in Watches or Wardes) by the Petty <hi>Harman Beck,</hi> (who in their Company, ſignifies a petty Conſtable) or whether they were ſuch as in the Canting tongue are called <hi>Mawnderers</hi> (of begging or demanding,) whether they liued in <hi>Bowſing Kennes</hi> (Ale-houſes) or what other courſe thread of life ſoeuer any of them all ſpunne, it was euer wound in a blacke bottome of the moſt pernicious making vp that the Diuell could teach them: inſomuch that albeit the very Sun-beames could poſſibly haue written downe the diſcouerie of any groſſe villanies, by them committed, they would as eaſily ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon damning, in denyall of it with oates, as if there had beene no hell for ſuch offenders.</p>
                  <p>For my better painting forth theſe Monſters, I once tooke one of them into my ſeruice (being a ſturdy, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limde young fellow) of him I deſired ſome knowledge in their gibriſh, but hée ſwore hée could not <hi>Cant,</hi> yet his Roague-ſhip ſéeing himſelfe vſed kindly by mée, would now and then ſhoote out a word of <hi>Canting,</hi> and being thereupon aſked why with oathes hée denyed it before, hée told mée, that they are ſworne neuer to diſcloſe their ſkill in <hi>Canting</hi> to any Houſholder, for if they doe, the other <hi>Mawnderers</hi> or Roagues, <hi>Mill</hi> them (kill them,) yet hée for his part (hée ſaid) was neuer ſworne, becauſe hée was a <hi>Clapperdogeon,</hi> that is to ſay, a Begger-borne. This <hi>Clapperdogeon</hi> ſtaid with mée ſo long as hée durſt, and then <hi>bingd a waſte in a darkmans,</hi> ſtoole away from mée in the night time. So that what intelligence I got from him, or any other trained vp in the ſame Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Roaguery, I will briefely, plainely, and
<pb facs="tcp:10043:44"/>
truely ſet downe, as I had it from my Diuelliſh Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, whom I call by the name of <hi>O per ſe O.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of him I learned, that the cauſe why ſo many of this wicked Generation wander vp and downe this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, the frée command, and abundant vſe they haue of Women: for if you note them well, in their marching, not a <hi>Tatterdemalion</hi> walkes his round, (be hée young, be hée olde) but hée hath his <hi>Mort,</hi> or his <hi>Doxie</hi> at his héeles, (his Woman, or his Whore) for in hunting of their Raſcall-déere this Law they hold, when they come to ſtrike a Doe, if ſhée will not <hi>wap for a wyn;</hi> let her <hi>Trine for a make,</hi> if ſhée will not—<hi>O per ſe O</hi> for a penny, let her hang for a halfe-penny.</p>
                  <p>And this libertie of Wenching is increaſed by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite numbers of tipling houſes, called <hi>Bowſing Kennes,</hi> or of <hi>Stalling Kennes,</hi> that is to ſay, houſes where they haue ready money for any ſtolne goods: vnto which neſts, birds flye of the ſame feather, that the owner is of: for if the Ale-ſeller, be a Horſe-ſtealer, a Cut-purſe, a Robber by the High way, a Cheater, &amp;c. of the ſame coate are his gueſts. Theſe houſes are the Nurſeries of Roagues and Thorues: for how could they beſtow cloakes, ſhéetes, ſhirts, and other garments being ſtolne, if they had not <hi>Stalling Kennes</hi> to receiue them? Why ſhould <hi>Grunters</hi> (Pigges) goe whining out of the world, hauing their throates cut by Roagues, if they had not <hi>Bowſing Kennes</hi> to eate them in? In the Ceremonie of whoſe ragged Aſſemblies, the <hi>Bell-man</hi> a little miſtooke himſelfe, for <hi>Driggers, Filchers</hi> and <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> being all (in Engliſh) Stealers, vſe neyther roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate, nor ſpits in their Feaſtings, as hée furniſheth them, but when they entend to ſtrike a hand, they leuie their damnable troopes in the day, but they ſally forth, &amp; ſhare the ſpoyles in the night. For ſome one ſturdy hell-hound aboue the reſt, vndertakes to be the <hi>Miller)</hi> that is to ſay, the Killer:) I hope this can be no diſgrace to any
<pb facs="tcp:10043:45"/>

The Ouens mouth being thus dawbed vp, out flye the little Diuels (more dambde then the Ouen) eyther to breake an houſe ſome two or thrée miles off, or to doe as bad a Villanie. The piece of Seruice being performed, a Retraite is ſounded, and about mid-night they returne merrily, fall to their good-cheare manfully, and then diuide their ſpoyles of ſtolne ſhirts, ſmockes, or any thing elſe, moſt théeuiſhly. In which Partnerſhip the Hoſt and Hoſteſſe are chiefe ſharers, but ſuch ſubtill ſhop-kéepers are theſe Habber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhers of the Diuels ſmall Wares, that they neuer ſet out to ſell, but when the coaſt is cleare, and that (as théeues doe among Brokers) the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cryes</hi> throate be ſtopt that went balling after them: for about a ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, (when all is huſhd) to the <hi>Stalling Kenne</hi> goes the <hi>Duds</hi> for <hi>Loure,</hi> to the théeuing houſe are the ſtolne cloathes ſent roundly for money: which being told out and diuided, away flye theſe Rauens ſcatteringly, the next prey that they light vpon, being euer at ſome Faire, or elſe a market.</p>
                  <p>And now that we talke of Fayres, let my penne gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop ouer a few lines, and it ſhall bring you (without ſpurring) ſwiftlier into Gloceſſer-ſhire, then if you rode vpon Pacolet: there if you pleaſe to alight néere Tewkſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, at a place called Durreſt-Fayre, (being kept there vpon the two Holy-Roode dayes) you ſhall ſée more Roagues, then euer were whipt at a Carts-arſe through London, and more Beggers then euer came dropping out of Ireland. If you looke vpon them, you would thinke you liued in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt time, and that <hi>Iacke

Cade,</hi> and his rebellious rag-amuffins were there mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring. Dunkirke cannot ſhew ſuch ſharkes. The wilde Iriſh are but flockes of wilde-Géeſe to them. And theſe ſwarmes of Locuſts come to this lowſte Fayre, from all parts of the Land, within an hundred myles compaſſe. To deſcribe the Boothes is loſt labour, for let the Hang-man ſhew but his wardrop, and there is not a ragge dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwéene them. None here ſtands crying, <hi>What doe you lacke?</hi> for you can aſke for nothing that is good, but here it is lacking.

The Shoppe-kéepers are Théeues, and the Chap-men Roagues, Beggers and Whores: ſo that to bring a purſe-full of money hither, were madneſſe: for it is ſure to be cut.</p>
