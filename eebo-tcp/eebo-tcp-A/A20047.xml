            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This word <hi>canting</hi> ≈ø√©emes to be deriued from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>verbe (canto)</hi> which ≈øignifies in Engli≈øh, to ≈øing, or to make a ≈øound with words, that is to ≈øay, to ≈øpeake. And very aptly may <hi>canting</hi> take his deriuation <hi>a cantando,</hi> from ≈øinging, becau≈øe among≈øt the≈øe beggerly con≈øorts that can play vpon no better in≈øtruments, the language of <hi>canting</hi> is a king of mu≈øicke, and h√©e that in ≈øuch a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblies can <hi>cant</hi> be≈øt, is counted the be≈øt Mu≈øitian.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the Dialect or phra≈øe it ≈øelfe, I ≈ø√©e not that it is grounded vpon any certaine rules; And no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if it haue none, for ≈øithence both the <hi>Father</hi> of this new kinde of Learning, and the <hi>children</hi> that ≈øtudy to ≈øpeake it after him, haue b√©ene from the beginning and ≈øtil are the <hi>Breeders</hi> and <hi>Nori≈øhers</hi> of al ba≈øe di≈øorder, in their liuing and in their <hi>Manners:</hi> how is it po≈ø≈øible, they ≈øhould ob≈øerue any <hi>Method</hi> in their ≈øp√©ech, and e≈øpecialy in ≈øuch a Language, as ≈øerues but onely to vtter di≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of villanies?</p>
                     <p>And yet (euen out of all that <hi>Irregularity,</hi> vnhan≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and fountaine of <hi>Barbari≈øme)</hi> doe they draw a kinde of forme: and in ≈øome wordes, (a≈øwell ≈øimple as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds) retaine a certaine ≈øalte, ta≈øting of ≈øome wit, and ≈øome Learning. As for example, they call a cloake (in the <hi>canting</hi> tongue) a <hi>Togeman,</hi> and in Latin, <hi>Toga</hi> ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a gowne, or an vpper garment. <hi>Pannam</hi> is bread: &amp; <hi>Panis</hi> in Lattin is likewi≈øe bread, <hi>ca≈ø≈øan</hi> is ch√©e≈øe, and is a word barbarou≈øly coynde out of the ≈øub≈øtantiue <hi>ca≈øeus,</hi> which al≈øo ≈øignifies ch√©e≈øe. And ≈øo of others.</p>
                     <p>Then by ioyning of two ≈øimples, doe they make almo≈øt all their compounds. As for example: <hi>Nab</hi> (in the <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Dialect of Canting.</note> tongue) is a head, and <hi>Nab-cheate,</hi> is a hat, or a cap: Which word <hi>cheate,</hi> being coupled to other wordes, ≈øtands in very good ≈øtead, and does excellent ≈øeruice: For a <hi>Smelling cheate,</hi> ≈øignifies a No≈øe: a <hi>Prat-ling cheate,</hi> is a tongue <hi>Cra≈øhing cheates,</hi> are t√©eth: <hi>Hearing. cheates</hi> are Eares: <hi>Fambles</hi> are Hands: and there vpon a ring is called a <hi>Fambling chete.</hi> A <hi>Muffling chete,</hi> ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies

a Napkin. A <hi>Belly chete,</hi> an Apron: A <hi>Grunting chete,</hi> A Pig: A <hi>Cackling Chete,</hi> a Cocke or a Capon: A <hi>Quacking chete,</hi> a ducke: A <hi>Lowghing chete,</hi> a <hi>Cow:</hi> A <hi>Bleating chete,</hi> a Calfe, or a Sh√©epe: and ≈øo may that word be marryed to many others be≈øides.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe,</hi> or <hi>Cuffin,</hi> ≈øignifies a Man, a Fellow, &amp;c. But differs ≈øomething in his propertie, according as it m√©etes with other wordes: For a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is called a <hi>Gentry Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe:</hi> A good fellow is a <hi>Bene Cofe:</hi> a Churle is called, a <hi>Quier Cuffin; Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ≈øignifies naught, and <hi>Cuffin</hi> (as I ≈øaid before) a man: and in <hi>Canting</hi> they terme a Iu≈øtice of peace, (becau≈øe h√©e puni≈øheth them belike) by no other name then by <hi>Quier cuffin,</hi> that is to ≈øay, a Churle, or a naughty man. And ≈øo, <hi>Ken</hi> ≈øignifing a hou≈øe, they call a pri≈øon, a <hi>Quire Ken,</hi> that is to ≈øay, an ill hou≈ø.</p>
                     <p>Many p√©eces of this ≈øtrange coyne could I ≈øhew you, but by the≈øe ≈ømall ≈øtampes, you may iudge of the greater.</p>
                     <p>Now becau≈øe, a Language is nothing els, then heapes of wordes, orderly wouen and compo≈øed together: and that (within ≈øo narrow a circle as I haue drawne to my ≈øelfe) it is impo≈ø≈øible to imprint a <hi>Dictionarie</hi> of all the <hi>Canting</hi> phra≈øes: I will at this time not make you ≈øurfet on too much, but as if you were walking in a Garden, you ≈øhall openly plurke here a flower, and there another, which (as I take it) will bemore delightfull then if you gathered them by handfulls.</p>

It is a Gold-Finch that ≈øildome flies to the≈øe Ordinary Ne≈øts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hundred or two hundred pound in twenty ≈øhilling p√©eces about him. After the tearing of ≈øome ≈øeauen paire of Cardes, or the damning of ≈øome ten baile of Dice, ≈øteps h√©e vpon the Stage, and this part h√©e playes. If any of the <hi>Forlorne Hope</hi> be a Gentleman of Meanes, either in <hi>E≈ø≈øe,</hi> or in <hi>Po≈ø≈øe,</hi> (and that the olde Foxe will be ≈øure to know to halfe an Acre) who≈øe money runnes at a low ebbe, as may appeare by his ≈øcratching of the head, and walking vp and downe the roome, as if h√©e wanted an O≈øtler: The <hi>Gul-groper</hi> takes him to a ≈øide window and tels him, h√©e is ≈øorry to ≈ø√©e his hard lucke, but the Dice are made of womens bones, and will cozen any man, yet for his fathers ≈øake (whom h√©e hath knowne ≈øo long) if it plea≈øe him, he ≈øhall not leaue off play for a hundred pound or two.

                     <p>THere is another Fraternitie of wandring Pilgrims who merrily call them≈øelues, <hi>Iackes of the Clocke-hou≈øe,</hi> and are very n√©ere allyed to the <hi>Falconers,</hi> that went a Hawking before. The Clarke of <hi>Erebus</hi> ≈øet downe their names too in his Tables, with certaine br√©efe notes of their practi≈øes: and the≈øe they are.</p>
                     <p>The Iacke of a Clocke-hou≈øe goes vpon Screws, and his office is to doe nothing but ≈øtrike: ≈øo does this noi≈øe, (for they walke vp and downe like Fidlers) trauaile with <hi>Motions,</hi> and what≈øoeuer their <hi>Motions</hi> get them, is called ≈øtriking.</p>
                     <p>Tho≈øe Motions are certaine <hi>Collections,</hi> or wittie Inuentions, ≈øome-times of one thing, and then of an other (there is a new one now in towne, in prai≈øe of the <hi>Vnion.)</hi> And the≈øe are fairely written and engro≈ø≈øed in Vellum, Parchement, or Royall paper, richly adorned
<pb facs="tcp:10043:24"/>
with compartiments, and ≈øet out with letters both in gold, and in various coulours.</p>

Thus the liberallitie of a Nobleman, or of a Gentleman is abu≈øed: thus learning is brought into ≈øcorne and contempt: Thus men are cheated of their bountie, giuing much for that (out of their fr√©e mindes) which is common abroad, and put away for ba≈øe prices.

in the office of an High-Con≈øtable, in that Countie, wherein I now dwell, I drew from the examination of ≈øuch lewd per≈øons as came before m√©e, the truth of all tho≈øe villaynes which here I publi≈øh.</p>
                  <p>In the mu≈øtring of this damned Regiment, I found, that whether they were Roagues taken in Romboyles (that is to ≈øay, in Watches or Wardes) by the Petty <hi>Harman Beck,</hi> (who in their Company, ≈øignifies a petty Con≈øtable) or whether they were ≈øuch as in the Canting tongue are called <hi>Mawnderers</hi> (of begging or demanding,) whether they liued in <hi>Bow≈øing Kennes</hi> (Ale-hou≈øes) or what other cour≈øe thread of life ≈øoeuer any of them all ≈øpunne, it was euer wound in a blacke bottome of the mo≈øt pernicious making vp that the Diuell could teach them: in≈øomuch that albeit the very Sun-beames could po≈ø≈øibly haue written downe the di≈øcouerie of any gro≈ø≈øe villanies, by them committed, they would as ea≈øily ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon damning, in denyall of it with oates, as if there had beene no hell for ≈øuch offenders.</p>
                  <p>For my better painting forth the≈øe Mon≈øters, I once tooke one of them into my ≈øeruice (being a ≈øturdy, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limde young fellow) of him I de≈øired ≈øome knowledge in their gibri≈øh, but h√©e ≈øwore h√©e could not <hi>Cant,</hi> yet his Roague-≈øhip ≈ø√©eing him≈øelfe v≈øed kindly by m√©e, would now and then ≈øhoote out a word of <hi>Canting,</hi> and being thereupon a≈øked why with oathes h√©e denyed it before, h√©e told m√©e, that they are ≈øworne neuer to di≈øclo≈øe their ≈økill in <hi>Canting</hi> to any Hou≈øholder, for if they doe, the other <hi>Mawnderers</hi> or Roagues, <hi>Mill</hi> them (kill them,) yet h√©e for his part (h√©e ≈øaid) was neuer ≈øworne, becau≈øe h√©e was a <hi>Clapperdogeon,</hi> that is to ≈øay, a Begger-borne.
