            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

True it is, that if I be not deceiued through the ſelfe liking of my owne labour, the truth herein ſo clearely repreſented, the free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of euery ones profit in ſundry ſortes, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and notable euente of ſo many accidents doe ſufficiently promiſe vnto mee a gratious acceptance, euen at the handes of the more gentle and better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſort of ſtrangers, who being farre from my knowledge, and thereby leſſe tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with enuie, (an ordinary compagnion of the liuing) ſhall be more rightly able to iudge of my labours. I doe leſſe doubt, how ſmall or much pleaſing ſoeuer the firſt Treatiſes of this Hiſtorie ſhal be, but that all wil euen haſten to ſee the progreſſe and iſſue therof, ſome allured thereunto through the pleaſure, which the diuerſitie of ſo ſtrange and memorable an Argument offereth vnto them, and other of a curioſitye praiſe worthie, to be willing to know the meruailes of Gods iudgments, the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds and ſmall charitie: So many peaces broken, ſo many warres renewed, ſo ſtrange cruelties, ſo ſmall fauours: in ſumme al the Potentates of chriſtendom at banding for, and againſt the French, who moſt miſerably haue made themſelues the foole in the play, and the vnhappy end &amp; variable reencounter of more rare miſeries, then euer worldlings did practiſe. I cleane contrarye knowing the verye cauſes and meanes through which wee haue beene cunningly ledde to ſuch pouertye, endeuour as much as poſsibly I may, to eſtrange from my ſelfe the conſideration of ſo miſerable effects, and fetch my hiſtory from more high, reaching ſomewhat beyond the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our ciuill warres, where wandring in a true diſcourſe of forraine affaires, and ſuch as are common vnto vs, with our neighbours; I ſeeke the recompence of my paines.

while, to forget our calamities paſſed, from which I may boldely borrow ſo much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as I ſhall eſteeme neceſſarie, to turne awaye for a ſeaſon ſo ſorrowfull and pitious a remembrance, as thereby I am howrely put in minde of: and albeit the memory of ſuch greefes ought not any wayes to cauſe a vertuous diſpoſition to ſwarue from the truth, no more then the frendſhip of ſome, hatred of other, or reſpect of great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould doe, and though hee is verye rarelye to be found, which is not ſpyed in the ende: if not throughlye gained, yet at the leaſt tempted by ſome one of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, eſpecially in ſo confuſe, graue, and deepe a matter: I will notwithſtanding be found ſo little partiall as all men ſhall haue more cauſe in other matters to diſgrace me, then in the truth of ſuch accidents as are heere ſet foorth: which if they ſhal bring a form of a more agreeable ſetting forth, either by the number of ſtrange occurrents, or exceeding by a more excellency of deliuery, the rudenes of my naturall language: howſoeuer it be, ſo farre am I from enuying ſo great a benefite to thoſe of my age, that I ſhall holde my ſelfe for well ſatisfied, when I ſhall not gather any other profite of my long watchings, then to ſee my ſelfe at the end of ſo great trauailes, to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken more for the pleaſure of others, then my owne particular. And now that among Hiſtoriographers my name reſteth as obſcured, their high valour &amp; number which are able to ſhadow the light, wil bring me ſome comfort: ioyned therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is, that my qualitie holding more of action then of contemplation, doth diſpence with me to make any profeſsion of writing, but in matter of conſequence wherein I am moſt delighted: which being the cauſe that I beſt iudge of my inſufficiency: for being able to conduct and profit ſo labourſome a trauaile, I will call vpon his grace which is able to bleſſe the beginning, purſuite, and laſt end of ſuch a labour.</p>
            <p>Being then reſolued to lay before your eyes the eſtate of Fraunce and her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſince fortye peares paſſed, and conſidering how the cauſes of humaine acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are maintained by an eternall bonde, and knowne of fewe people, I thought I ſhould make my worke a great deale more commendable, if I did fetch the matter from more high, thogh not from the firſt ſpring, yet at the leaſt from the more appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t occaſions which haue brought forth ſo ſtrange occurrents.

But ſuch was the eternall prouidence, or to ſpeake naturally, the vndiſcreet lightnes of the French, ioyned with a too vaine ambition of their neighbours, drawing from ſo euill guided a paſsion, a lamentable ſpring of all our miſeries to come, that ſo yong a peace could not be ſuffered to wax old among the Chriſtians, who too tickliſh in their eaſe, &amp; as it were leaping with a deſire of new cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, ſeemed to ſeek nothing elſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from this reſt, which alredy ſeemed too noiſome vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now as according to the infinite reencounter of humaine accidents, they could not long want matter to entertaine the fire of their ancient enmities, the occurrence of the protection of Parma preſented it ſelfe but too ſoone to heate the well neere tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered affections of theſe Princes, of their people and allies, by a new motion which ſo greatly changed their counſailors harts, not yet ful cooled of their burning enmities, that there needed no long time to perſwade them to make warne, and fall together by the eares with greater ſtomack then euer.

Of which leauing vnto the hiſtorie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the ouer-plus vnto you, I will but deliuer the matter of <hi>Parma,</hi> which reuiuing their halfe dead contrariety of affections, ſeemed vnto them a ſufficient occaſion and fit meanes to be throughly reuenged of whatſoeuer had bene before paſſed.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Paul 3.</hi> had exchanged certain of the church lands, by the conſent and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Colledge of Cardinals, with <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Plaiſance,</hi> in which he inueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſonne <hi>Pierre Loys Farneze,</hi> and in the end obtained the Emperours conſent (for that in time paſt they had appertained to the Dutchie of Milan:) Vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome recompence, and the marriage of his naturall daughter with <hi>Octauian,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne to <hi>Pierre Louys.</hi> Who imagining to aſſure the inſolences of his fraile and arrogant life, thorough the rigorous carriage of himſelfe, and his ſtrong fortreſſes which he there built, eſpecially at Plaiſance, was notwithſtanding in the end ſtabbed in with a Dagger, by the Paluoyſins his Subiects and others as he ſate at dinner. But ſhortly after <hi>Ferdinande Gonzague</hi> Lieutenant for the Emperour in the Dutchie of Milan was readie to enter, both with horſe and foote to ſeaſe of Plaiſance to the vſe of the Emperour, which made men to thinke that he fauoured the plat: So the Pope greatly offended as wel at the loſſe of his ſonne, as of his lands, and eſpecially by him who had beene ſo greatly benefited, by him and his houſe, to which he was himſelfe alied, found no more ready way for the defence of the reſt (knowing that a number of the countrie about Parma yeelded day by day to <hi>Gonzague,</hi> and others for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) then to ſend <hi>Camillo Vrſino,</hi>

The which being made at Chaſteau-Briant where then he was, the 27. of Iune 1551. was called the Edict of Chaſteau-Briant: by vertue whereof all the ancient Edicts which puniſhed Heretiques were reuiued and made in force; the ſoueraigne knowledge giuen to the <hi>Preſidiaux,</hi> to the end to make ſpeedie expedition, and among ſundry other articles for the puniſhing of Printers, Booke-binders, and other ſellers of ſuſpected bookes, it was enacted that the Eſtates of Iudicature thereto ordeyned, and Regentes of Schooles ſhould bee bound to bring proofe to witneſſe that they were well reputed of among good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Chriſtians: that information ſhould be made againſt the negligence of ſuch Iudges as ſlacked their puniſhment from three moneths to three moneths, that the Mercuriales ſhould be in force in ſoueraigne Courtes, in which ſhould be chiefelye

Now for that to the end the eſtate of Fraunce might be the better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and maintained, the Kings at all times haue beene contented to yeelde this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to that Parlament of Paris (being aſſembled of the moſt remarqued French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for their knowledge, experience and other vertues, as well Clergie as Layetie) to iudge whether the letters, ſtatutes, Edicts, and ordinances, although they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolued of by the Priuie counſell, were fit to be put in practiſe throughout the Realme, to the end they ſhould be either receiued, publiſhed, and engroſſed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in their Courte, or ſent backe againe to the King if they were not found iuſt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and aduantagious to the eſtate: together with their declarations which they muſt ſend both in writing and worde of mouth, by ſome one of their owne body, which to that purpoſe they diſpatch. The Edict was preſently carryed to the Kinges Counſell (which are his Proctor and 2. Aduocates ordained for his aſsiſtance) at the earneſt ſute of the Clergie, requiring to haue it engroſſed of record in the Court, but it was refuſed for many conſiderations, which a number of Counſellers alleadged, that at that time ſtoode ſuſpected, and ſince found to bee Lutherans, as heereafter I will declare. In the end notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by the earneſt and continuall inſtance of the Cardinals and other of the Cleargie about the King, who beſides would make him ſelfe appeare moſt Chriſtian throughout all Europe, eſpecially for the reaſons aboue mencioned,<note place="margin">Religion well maintained preſerueth all eſtates.</note> the Court was ſo preſſed, that all the articles of the Edict were there in publique audience read, the 3. of September 1551. in the Chamber called Doree. Of all which <hi>Pierre Seguier</hi> the Kings Aduocate, demaunding the ingroſsing of the behalfe of the Proctor generall, ſaide that it was well knowne how the Kinges of Fraunce had bene alwaies zealous protectors of chriſtianitie, of the faith and vnion of the Church, for which they worthily deſerued the name of moſt Chriſtian: that there was no doubt but zeale of Religion was one of the principall cauſes, for which it pleaſed God to maintaine the eſtate of that Realme in that greatnes it was vntill that day, that hiſtoryes did witnes, among all the misfortunes and vnhappines which fell out betweene the Romaine Kings, the raigne of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to haue beene found moſt long, happie and peaceable, becauſe hee was moſt zealous in Religion. And <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> write, <hi>Quod Numa Primus condidit templum fidei: primus fidei ſolemne inſtituit.</hi> And albeit that the Religion of <hi>Numa</hi> was not ruled after the worde of God, yet hauing had ſo great an increaſe of good fortune in his Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe Religion, it may verye well cauſe vs to thinke that the care and zeale which the Kings of Fraunce haue had for Chriſtian religion, hath greatlye auailed and helped towards the maintenance and enlarging of the Monarchie of Fraunce. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe negligence of Religion, the leauing and apoſtacie of faith, and the ſciſmes and diuiſions in the Church, are the beginning and ſpring of all miſchiefes, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of deſolation and ruine to a Common-wealth. The examples are verye common <hi>De neglecta Religione,</hi> both in <hi>Valerius</hi> and other our owne Hiſtories, as the Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> doe teſtifie, that the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they helde themſelues vnited in the faith of God, and precepts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> proſpered and ouercame all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, but when they withdrew themſelues from religion, they fell into great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. The moſt Chriſtian King conſidering and well vnderſtanding theſe things, hath ſtudiouſly &amp; diligently ſearched by all poſsible meanes, how the error of the <hi>Pſeudo-chriſtians</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21992:10"/>
might bee extermined, and cleane rooted out of this Realme, and to this end hath commaunded theſe letters now read, to be approued in this Courte: and further ſaid that he could not omit to yeelde due thankes vnto the King for his moſt gracious, royall, and moſt Chriſtian will, moſte humblye beſeeching God that it would pleaſe him to preſerue the King in this charitie, deuotion and zeale, many yeares, and hereupon concluded, and required the publication and approuing of the letters, enioyning the Prelates and Cleargy in what appertained to their charge, to obey the contents thereof. Then the Preſidente after the counſellers had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their opinions, gaue this ſentence.

And gaue in charge to the Court of the ſaid Iudges, that after iudgement giuen vpon the ſaid criminall endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ſhould make them ſafely to be kept by ſuch Greffiers as the court ſhould appoint, to haue diligent care of the ſame, to the end they might both deliuer &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the ſame, whatſoeuer they ſhould be called vpon. Moreouer, he warned &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Court, the Archbiſhops, and Prelates that reſorted thereunto, enioyning them to keepe and fulfill the contentes of the ſaide letters, in whatſoeuer might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, the 3. of September 1551. Now let vs handle againe the imperials prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes againſt the French: you ſhal belowe ſee in place fitter for it, the ſecond meanes which the King had to iuſtifie himſelfe for his actions in the occurrence of Parma.</p>
            <p>If the Emperor were angry knowing of the Kings reſolution in fauour of the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezes,</hi> Pope <hi>Iulye</hi> made no leſſe ſhew thereof,<note place="margin">Pope Paul ſeeketh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Farneze.</note> and thereupon the 11. of Aprill hee bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly accuſed <hi>Octauian</hi> by a writing publiſhed to that end. When (ſaid he) he receiued Parma at my hands, and the eſtate of Supreame Gouernour, hee promiſed me vpon his faith that he would neuer ſerue other Prince, nor put any Garriſon of Strangers into Parma without my leaue: and aſſoone as any apparance was of any change, I oftentimes very louingly admoniſhed him by men expreſſely, and by his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinall <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he ſhould remember his dutie. But becauſe he anſwered very ſtrangely, I threatned him by letters vnder great paines, if hee ſhould forget himſelfe: hoping in time to haue wonne him. But ſince being aduertiſed how farre he ſwarueth from the accord, I haue great cauſe to be extreamelye angrye, that one whom I had enriched and aduanced to honor, ſhould offer me ſuch an iniurye. Now then though it were lawfull for me to pronounce iudgement in ſo apparante and cleare a matter, yet to the end to make him know my curteſie, I charge him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at Rome within 30. daies, to anſwere to his accuſations, and to put in good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his comming: if hereof he make no accompt, I condemne and holde him for guilty of treaſon, diſloyaltie and other crimes, willing and meaning that all his goods ſhalbe confiſcat: for which I require aide of th'emperour; that he will holde a ſtrong hand to helpe me to puniſh the ſame, forbidding all in generall to yeelde him any releefe or ſuccour.<note place="margin">Paul de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes with the Pope in the French Kings behalfe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The King of Fraunce in the meane time to appeaſe the Pope and his Cardinals, declared by his Embaſſador <hi>Paul de Termes</hi> of purpoſe ſent vnto Rome, that he was no whit at all to blame for receiuing of <hi>Octauian</hi> into his protection, conſidering
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21992:11"/>
it a matter proper to the office of Kings to ſuccour the afflicted. Beſides, ſayth hee, he ſought no particular profit to himſelfe, but all for the benefit of the Church of Rome, according to the example of his progenitors, which had inriched the ſame more than all other, and oftentimes defended it with the ſword: for conſidering that Parma was of the patrimonie of the Church, he would eſpecially ſeeke to preuent, that it might not fall into the handes of anie ſtranger, which was the verie reaſon that hee was at ſo great &amp; ordinarie an expence. Therfore he earneſtly beſought him to take it in good part, and not to remaine in that harde opinion hee had conceiued of him, a matter which ſhould bring great profite to the commonwealth. But if refuſing all ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he preferred warre before peace, he might wel perceiue the danger which would inſue to the whole Church, &amp; to Europe it ſelfe, in that it was vnpoſſible in the mean time to aſſure or eſtabliſh anie matter of religion, beſides the trouble which would fal out among Chriſtians, the Councell ſummoned coulde not aſſemble, or if it did, it muſt of neceſsitie bee diſſolued, for that as the caſe ſtoode hee ſhoulde not bee able to ſende anie of his Biſhops to the Councell of Trent. Aboue all things no fault coulde bee layde vpon him, who not onely deſired the conditions of peace, but alſo was readie to embrace them, the which hee publikely proteſted. But <hi>Iuly</hi> relying vpon the Emperours promiſes, would neuer a whit relent for this: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing condemned the Duke <hi>Octauian,</hi> as a rebellious vaſſall of the church, gaue leaue to the Emperour to recouer Parma in what ſort hee could. Wherefore <hi>Fernande Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> aſſembling with all ſpeede the garriſons of Millaine and Piemont, and beſides ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the troupes which <hi>Iohn Baptiſta</hi> lead vnder the Apoſtolique title and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, began to braue it in the countrie about Parma, and in the end beſieged Parma &amp; Mirandolle, which the French ſayde were adiudged by <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, to bee helde vnder the protection of King <hi>Henrie</hi> and his ſucceſſors, who ſhortly after ſent thether <hi>Horace Farneze,</hi> brother to <hi>Octauian,</hi> with <hi>De Termes, D' Andelot, Cypierre,</hi> and ſundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: commanding <hi>Briſſac,</hi> his lieutenant in Piemont, to put as many as hee was able into the field, to make <hi>Fernande</hi> raiſe his ſiege, and to annoie him as much as in him laie. Which hee ſo readily performed, that hee tooke Quiers, Saint Damian, &amp; other places of the Marquiſate of Mont-ferrat, readie to haue reached further, if <hi>Gonzague</hi> had not well beſtirred himſelfe to hinder his enterie into the Dutchy of Millaine. Behold then theſe Princes which with the fire of their miſerable Countrie begin to feele, or at leaſt to foreſee the ruine of theyr poore ſubiects.</p>
            <p>Now as they might well thinke, that many would eaſily know and at leaſure iudge, that this fire of eternall ambition had ſoone made them forget the couenants &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſo generall a peace, of the yeere 1546. ſo did euerie of them, as well by their writings, as Embaſſadors into all partes, ſeeke to laie the fault &amp; firſt motion of breach of peace vpon his enemie. The king of France to this end, and by the ſelfe ſame hand to be meete with ſuch rumours as his enemies might cauſe to bee giuen out of him, contrarie to his owne meaning, ſent the Abbot of Bellozane to the councell of Trent, where ſundrie Princes and Prelates were aſſembled by the Emperour and Pope <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as well for the matter of religion, as affaires of the Empire, and other particulars, the Cardinall <hi>Creſcence</hi> there as chiefe in the name of the Pope. The Emperour had ſent thether <hi>Frances</hi> of Toledo,<note place="margin">The French king tearmeth the Counſell of Trent but an aſſembly.</note> 
               <hi>Hugues</hi> Earle of Mont-fort, and <hi>Guilliaume</hi> of Poictiers: and for that the Councell daie fell on the firſt of September, the Abbot preſented him ſelfe there with his Letters addreſſed to the aſſembly. After that hee had deliuered them to the Popes Legate, and that the ſuperſcription was read, they conſulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why hee rather tearmed it an aſſembly than a councell: ſome being of opinion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21992:11"/>
that they ought not at all to haue beene receiued, except the Embaſſador ſhewed his warrant for the ſame. Thereupon aroſe a great tumult, with a long houting, which chiefely proceeded from the Spaniſh Biſhops. But when the Embaſſador aunſwered that his commiſſion was contained in the Letters, the Popes Legate roſe vp, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the fathers into the priuateſt place of the Temple, debated of the matter, where it was agreed that he ſhould bee heard, conſidering that the ſuperſcription might bee as well conſtrued in good part. After then that the Letters had beene read in priuate, by which the King declared in briefe the wrong which was done him, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure which thereof hee conceiued, requiring credite to bee giuen to whatſoeuer his Embaſſadour ſhould deliuer, they fate all down againe. And after that the Letters were ther publikely rehearſed, they anſwered, that they could not take in euill part, the King tearming of the Councell an Aſſembly, not willing to miſtruſt anie euill, by ſo great a King, ſurnamed Moſt Chriſtian: that if he ſhould haue anie other intention or meaning, in that caſe they held them as not written, and ſo commanded him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer what hee had in charge. Then he began his Oration, which was long,<note place="margin">The French Embaſſadors oration in the Councell of Trent.</note> wherein the King recited all that had paſſed betweene the Pope and the Senate of Cardinals, by his Embaſſador <hi>Paul de Termes,</hi> and that by no meanes hee could doo anie good, albeit hee had doone as much as in him laie for peace. But that Pope <hi>Iuly,</hi> who by the example of his anceſtors ought, if not cleane to appeaſe, yet at the leaſt to mittigate the debates and contentions of Princes, had contrarywiſe lighted a great fire in a moſt vnſeaſonable time: to wit, when the ſtate of Chriſtendome was maruellouſly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſince it is ſo, that hee carrieth ſo bitter and eager a heart againſt him which is the eldeſt ſonne of the Church, hee proteſted, as before hee had done at Rome. Firſt, that for the great affayres and inconueniences whereof his hands were full, it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull nor conuenient that anie Biſhops of his realme ſhould be ſuffered to goe to Trent. Beſides, that he doth not hold it for a publike &amp; general councel, but rather for a priuate congregation made to ſerue ſome mennes particular profite and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, &amp; not for a commonwealth. And that touching anie Decree which they ſhould there make, neither hee nor anie of his realme could bee liable, or ſhoulde bee bound thereto: and farther, that if the matter ſo required, hee woulde ſerue himſelfe wyth ſuch remedies as his anceſtors were accuſtomed to doo in like caſes. True it is, that he woulde alwaies carrie a pure heart, beare a good affection to religion, and the church of Rome, and keepe himſelfe from doing ought worthie of reprehenſion. But forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he found himſelfe highly grieued at the iniuries and hatreds of ſome, which he neuer deſerued, he could doo no otherwiſe for the preſent time, &amp; that they ſhould take this his proteſtation in good part, &amp; make him an act whereby he might informe all other Princes and chriſtians of all that had beene paſſed. The Kings Letters being read, the fathers ſayde that they woulde aunſwere him in the firſt Seſſion, prouided that the King ſhould acknowledge it for a councel which was held at Trent, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which then paſſed, they receiued it as farre forth as the lawe woulde permit. Wherefore they could not deliuer vnto him any act or teſtimonie whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Whereas the King ſaid, that hee woulde vſe the remedie his anceſtors were wont to practiſe, it grew thus. In France as well as other countries,<note place="margin">The choiſe of Biſhops and Cleargie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the Pope.</note> if anie Biſhoprick or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey became voyde, thoſe whome they tearmed Chanons or Monkes had lybertie to chooſe: the other Benefices which were not electiue, were beſtowed by the Biſhops and Patrones, and all ſuites for matter of Benefices were determined each one in his owne prouince. But the Popes by lyttle and lyttle beganne cleane to alter theſe elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to drawe for themſelues all the profit to Rome, by reſeruations and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21992:12"/>
graces, and cauſed all ſuites to bee brought thether, euen at the firſt inſtance. This change began in France in the time of <hi>Lewes</hi> the ninth, who notwithſtanding ſtoutly reſiſted it, by the aduice of his Councell and Parliament, and made an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the yeer: 1267. by which hee commanded the ancient cuſtome ſhould be maintained, and for all that no man to paie ought to the Pope, which lawe ſtoode in force many yeeres after. But the authoritie of the Popes became in the end miſtreſſe, ſcattering among the Cleargie throughout Chriſtendome their graces and reſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were moſt chargeable and odious vnto euerie man, vntill the Councell of Baſle vtterly aboliſhed this manner of taking, relying vpon the ancient lawes of colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and elections, and forbidding the exaction of <hi>Auates.</hi> So as <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth after that hee had ſummoned a Councel of the choiceſt men of all his realme, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that Decree of the Councell,<note place="margin">The enacting of <hi>La Pragma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tique Sanction</hi>
               </note> and in the yeere 1438. confirmed it by an Edict, which was commonly called <hi>La Pragmatique Sanction.</hi> Yet afterwarde <hi>Eugene</hi> the fourth pronounced this councel of no valour, ſo as the Popes which ſince ſucceeded, haue vtterly refuſed this Decree, &amp; named it <hi>Schiſmaticall.</hi> Yea Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, ſent his Embaſſadour to <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth ſonne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, by whom he tooth and naile inſiſted to make <hi>La Pragmatique Sanction</hi> to be aboliſhed. But the king tooke councell of the Parliment of Paris, which is the moſt renowmed of all France, compoſed of learned perſonages, and experienced in the Ciuill and Canon lawe, and in matters of eſtate, or other publike charge. Who fetching many things from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie and ordinances of the verie Popes themſelues, and Councels in time paſſed, alleadging lykewiſe what his progenitours <hi>Clodo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, Iohn</hi> the firſt, &amp; finally what his owne grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had ordained therein. And taking occaſion thereby to ſhew how exceedingly France then flouriſhed, and how in preſent ſhee was deſolate and weakned, deliuered vnto him boldly, that if the ancient lawes ſhould not remaine in force, all order of the Cleargie would come to vtter confuſion, and that France would bee in the ende left cleane vnhabited, by reaſon many retired themſelues to Rome, by little and little ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the whole treaſure of the realme, whence would inſue that the Churches and ſuch like buildings would in the end be vtterly ruined throughout the whole realme. As concerning the treaſure, ſayd they, if the lawe of your Father take not place, there will yeerely bee tranſported to Rome a million of golde. For, omitting the reſt in the time of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> at the leaſt twentie Biſhoprickes were voyde, whereof euerie one paide as wel for the <hi>Anates,</hi> as other charges, ſix thouſand crownes: about three ſcore Abbeyes, whereof euerie one payde two thouſande, and aboue two hundred other Benefices, of which euerie one paide aboue one thouſand crownes. Beſides, that there is in your realme more than an hundred thouſand pariſhes, from which a maſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is drawen by this inuention of the Popes. Followe then your Fathers traces, and ſticke faſt to the Decree of Baſle. Such was the counſell which the Parliament gaue him. But the Kinge ouercome with the authoritie or ſubtiltie of the Pope, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned the aboliſhing of <hi>La Pragmatique Sanction,</hi> by meanes of the Cardinall <hi>Balne,</hi> one verie familyar about the King, and deeply bound to the Pope. Notwithſtanding the Kings Proctor generall, and the Vniuerſitie of Paris, which had a greate intereſt therein, couragiouſly withſtood it, and appealed from the Pope to a Councell. <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelfth was at great oddes with <hi>Iuly</hi> the ſecond about the ſame, and it was referred to the Councell of Latran. But <hi>Frances</hi> the firſt agreed thereunto, vpon certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, in the Citie of Bologne la Graſſe, after that hee had gained all Lombardie. To wit, that a Biſhopricke or Abbey becomming voide, the Chapter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21992:12"/>
ſhould not haue power to chooſe, but that it ſhould appertaine to the King, to name ſome one within ſixe moneths to the Pope, which he thought meet for ſuch a charge. This was the matter which the King ment, when hee ſpake of a remedie by his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador: for this was the raigne wherewith the Kings euer brideled the Popes, and when they fall a quarrelling with them, they preſſe to haue <hi>La Pragmatique Sanction</hi> reuiued, cheefely in this time in which Popes commaundementes are not ſo much reuerenced as heretofore they haue beene: and in reſpect that Fraunce is large and rich, Rome cannot wel miſſe the mony without great loſſe. Now the King ſince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in deed, what he threatned heere to Pope <hi>Iulye,</hi> as we will handle hereafter. <hi>Philip le Bel</hi> King of Fraunce, vſed the ſame remedy againſt <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he had charged him to paſſe the Seas, and to make warre againſt the <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,</hi> not taking in good parte his excuſes, hee forbad him to leuie any monye vpon the Churches, (which the King of neceſſitie was conſtrained to doe) and if he would not obey, excommunicated him. The King ſent for all his Lords and eſtates of his Realme to Paris, where after hauing diſcourſed of the outrage of <hi>Boniface,</hi> and that all the Biſhops, Princes, and Gentlemen confeſſed that they helde all their ſubſtance meerely of his grace, bounty, and liberalitie, he forbad that any mony after ſhould be tranſported to Rome, and to that end cauſed a diligent watch to be kept in all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and paſſages. The ſumme which was found in the account of the Parliament of Paris, of that which the Biſhoppricks and Abbies being voide did paye, muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of the time paſſed, for at this preſent the Taxes are augmented, and paſſe the annuall reuenues, ſo as ſome of the Clergie haue beene faine to leaue their Buls in the banquers hands for the ouer-great exaction. Now there are in Fraunce twelue archbiſhoppricks, Aix, Vienne, Lyons, Narbonne, Tholouze, Bourdeaux, Aux,<note place="margin">12. Articles in Fraunce.</note> Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Tours, Rouen, Reims, and Sens: there are about 96. Biſhoppricks, by the vacaties of which is carried to Rome a maſſe of monye, and of the Archbiſhopprickes about threeſcore thouſand, three hundred crownes, as it is apparant by an account made in the time of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King of Fraunce not content with the rigorous purſuites hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againſt the Lutheranes,<note place="margin">The K. letters and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope.</note> to the end that notwithſtanding the warre hee was reſolued of againſt the Pope, he might entertaine the Catholicke Princes in good opinion of his faith and Catholicke religion, would make further ſhewe of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and iuſt occaſions of warre, by a writing ſent vnto the Pope, of whoſe deepe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace hee ſtoode well aſſured: declaring therein what iniurye was doone him. The cauſe of the warre of Parma, and why receiuing of <hi>Octauian</hi> into his protection, he forbad vnder great penaltie any mony to be tranſported to Rome: for conſidering that monye was the very ſinew of warre, what follye were it ſaide hee to nouriſhe a mans enemye with his owne wealth? The propertie of Popes was to pacifie quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles among Kings, which Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third did, who altogeather creeping with age, came as farre as Nice into the Country of Genes, to reconcile his late Father to th'emperour. But <hi>Iulye</hi> ranne a cleane contrary courſe, for hauing no ſooner publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the counſell moſt neceſſary for the common-wealth, he preſently mooued a warre, whereby the French Church one of the moſt principall of Chriſtendome, was cleane excluded: requiring a lawfull counſel might be ſummoned, to amend as wel the faults of the Prelates and other Miniſters of the Church, as a number of other thinges being there handled, to correct the vices of euery one.

cauſed the cleane contrary to be giuen out and proclaimed, in which the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the warre of Parma was ſpecified, where hauing ſhewed how great reaſon the Pope had to be angry with <hi>Octauian</hi> and the Lord of Mirandolle, how contrary the King of Fraunce was bent, that ſought all occaſions and wrought all meanes to hinder the moſt honeſt enterpriſes of the Emperour, gaue notwithſtanding to wit, that <hi>Charles</hi> of Auſtria who helde his practiſes for little worth, would moſt couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſtoutly purſue the ende thereof. And whereas <hi>Octauian</hi> gaue out, that he was conſtrained by neceſsitie to put himſelfe vnder the ſafegarde and protection of the King of Fraunce, by reaſon of the outrages and pranckes of <hi>Ferdinand Gonzague,</hi> it was cleane refuted, for had there beene anye occaſion of feare (quoth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) he was the motyfe, who had often ſought meanes to cauſe him to be killed: it was after declared how Plaiſance was rendred vp to th'emperour, by reaſon that <hi>Pierre Louis</hi> the Popes Baſtard, enioying Parma and Plaiſance, behaued himſelfe ſo cruelly in his gouernement, that hee drewe the wrath of God vpon him, and euery mans hatred: by the example of <hi>Nero,</hi> eſpeciallye for his execrable wickednes, not onely with women, but very men: wherefore hee was moſt iuſtly murthered in his owne houſe by the Cittizens, which could not endure his cruelty any longer. This doone, the inhabitants forſeeing their apparant and imminent danger, if they ſhould fall againe into the ſubiection of the Pope and Church of Rome, could finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuge or more aſſured libertie, then to render the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the Emperour: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hauing beene at other times vaſſailes of th'empire: they ſollicited then <hi>Gonzague</hi> and praied him to receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the Emperours protection, otherwiſe they would thinke of ſome other ſuccour and defence: it is but counterfait then in making ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of feare, for the Emperour neuer gaue him occaſion, as one that had greatlye benefited the <hi>Farnezes,</hi> hauing choſen <hi>Octauian</hi> for his ſonne in law, and giuen the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Nouarre for euer to his father <hi>Louis,</hi> and beſtowed on him the honor of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe: but both of them oftentimes ſhewed themſelues maruelouſlye vngratefull, and eſpecially when they made ſhew of ayding him againſt certain rebels of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for in the meane time they endeuoured to take from him both Lombardie, and Gennes it ſelfe: for proofe whereof <hi>Ioannin Dorie</hi> a vertuous man, if euer were any was moſt villanouſly murthered in the tumulte, while he faithfully employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the Emperour, and ſought to deliuer the Countrie from that daunger into which he ſaw it moſt ready to fall:<note place="margin">The K. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Emperours obiection.</note> there was ſhortly after an anſwere put in print vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the King of Fraunce, in which was rehearſed how the Emperour deſiring to winne vnto him <hi>Paul</hi> the third, had beſtowed vpon his ſonne <hi>Pierre Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis,</hi> the tytle and dignitie of Marqueſſe, had taken <hi>Octauian</hi> ſonne to <hi>Pierre</hi> for his ſonne in law, yeelding goodly benefites to <hi>Alexander</hi> his other ſonne, beſides which he had made an alliance with the Pope, wherin was eſpecially ſet down, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould confirme the decree of the conſiſtory of Cardinals, namely, that the Emperour ſhould confirme the principallitie of Parma and Plaiſance to the familye of <hi>Farnezes.</hi> Now whereas the Emperour made warre in Germany, puniſhing ſome priuate rebellions vnder pretence of ſetting vp of religion: this ſleight meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly diſpleaſed the Pope, conſidering by this meanes he ſhewed well enough that hee had no regarde but to his perticular profit, and making of himſelfe great. And in truth ſaide the King, the Pope was no whit therein miſconceiued, for as ſoone as the warre was finiſhed, and the Emperour no more in need of the <hi>Fernezes</hi> aide, he publiquely declared his euill meaning conceiued againſt the Pope: for his Liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Italie had already found meanes to compaſſe Plaiſance, and anon after mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21992:13"/>
were hired to kill <hi>Pierre Louis</hi> in his chamber: and before that euer the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens had notice of the murther, men of warre were ſent in to ſeaze of the Caſtle in the name of the Emperour, who if he had beene ſo ignorant of the fact, it had bene great reaſon that after the death of Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſhould haue ſought the deliuery of the Cittie to the Church of Rome: but ſo farre was he from it, as he went about to take Parma out of the hands of his owne Nephewe, yea while Pope <hi>Paul</hi> liued, hee made purſuite thereof, in ſuch ſort that <hi>Paul</hi> taking a conceite thereat died for griefe. Afterwardes Ruffians were found at Parma, which of their owne accorde confeſſed that <hi>Fernande Gonzague</hi> had giuen them in charge to murther <hi>Octauian.</hi> He then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing himſelfe in this diſtreſſe, that ſuch as ought to haue preſerued him, yea his own father in law, ſought to take from him not only his ſubſtance but his life, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuccour of the King, and yeelded himſelfe into his handes, which hee could not by any meanes gainſay, preſſed thereunto by ſo many teares and reaſons. The caſe ſtanding thus, and for theſe occaſions all the Princes being animated, euery one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred him to doe the worſte he could againſt his enemie. Captaine <hi>Powlin</hi> hauing in readines his gallies and fleete at Marſeilles, furniſhed and victuailed for Scotland, tooke certaine Merchants Ships of Flaunders, vpon the Engliſh Sea, the which hee rifled, alleadging that vnder colour of traffique, they tranſported the victuail and munition of the Realme, to make themſelues the better able to preuaile againſt Fraunce. Elſe-where the Gouernours of the frontires prepared themſelues openly to the war: the Queene of Hungary in like ſorte being gouerneſſe for her Brother in the Lowe countrie, made ſtay of all Frenchmen and their goods, neere at the ſame time, that th'emperour diſcharging of <hi>Marillac</hi> Embaſſador for the King about his perſon, with many hard and angrye ſpeaches againſt his Maiſter, had reſolued to paſſe an armie into Fraunce, to be reuenged of the wrong which he faide he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained. And becauſe it was doubted that hee would enter by Champagne, where <hi>Bourdillon</hi> was with certaine Troupes, the Duke of Neuers was ſent thither with 10. companies of men at armes, which hee diſtributed for the better ſtrengthening of the weaker Garriſons, prouiding as well as he could for the fortifications and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe places, where he beſtowed the eight olde bandes which the King had ſent vnto him: while it was thus in working, they put out into the fielde, to be the better able to put in execution ſome ſoddaine ſurpriſales, according to their olde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, whereof very few tooke good effect. Then eche partie tarrying for the maine of his armye, made many little skirmiſhes, now with good, and now with bad fortune, as well on the one ſide as the other. In the meane time happened the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of a number of <hi>Bourgonians,</hi> which the company of <hi>Gaſper de Coligny</hi> called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon,</hi> defeated neere vnto Montcornet in Ardennes: leauing fiue hundred dead on the place, for recompence whereof, other making a ſhew but of a ſmall company of Harquebuſiers, preſenting themſelues neere vnto Mauber-Fontaine, charged and killed in an ambuſcade, the Captaine <hi>Gourdes,</hi> accompanied with fiue and twentye olde ſouldiers, too ventrous and ill aduiſed, in not tarrying for <hi>Bourdillon</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who being arriued after their death, followed the <hi>Bourgonians,</hi> already retyred ſafe by the benefite of the wood, into which for want of Harquebuſiers, they could not hinder more then two partes of them that had the victorie, to retreat in ſurety: as <hi>Mazaeres</hi> ſtoode in great want of prouiſions, ioyne thereto that a Souldier loueth beſt to get from the enemy, and keep his own for his neceſſitie: Captaine <hi>Villefranche</hi> hauing in the night planted a number of matches fiered, vpon the toppe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Ditches at Lumes, while that the Imperials diſcharged at them both Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21992:14"/>
Culuerins, and other ſhotte, tooke all the cattell and other prouiſions which the inhabitants kept by fauour of the Portes: out of which, ſome of the moſt couragious hauing ſallyed by little, ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo bepelted with Harquebuſies, that they were conſtrained to let their prouiſions be carried to Maizieres. But the <hi>Burgonians</hi> hauing ſurpriſed the Caſtle of Aſpremont, which the yong Earle yeelded vp to the Duke of Neuers, and in a courſe killed Captaine <hi>Ligneres,</hi> and defeated the greateſt part of his company betweene Hedin and Monſtreuilſe, greatly bragged that they had beene ſo well reuenged. At the ſame time the Garriſons of Pickardie vnder the Duke of Vendoſme, and his brothers the Duke of Anguien and Prince of Conde, were no leſſe often and painefully awakened, then thoſe of Champaigne all the long winter, in which their maſters notwithſtanding were buſied about more high enterpriſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe before mentioned, as I will make you well to perceiue.</p>
            <p>Beholde theſe Princes hard at it, and the originall and preparation of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: whereupon I think good before that I paſſe any further to fetch the affaires of the Chriſtians from more high, to the end I may not giue any occaſion that ſhould turne you from the knowledge of that which I will entreate of: for as I ſpeak of war, of Religion, pollicie and other humane actions, when you ſhall ſee the Counſell of Trent mentioned, and not know to what end, when, nor by whome it was helde: the Lutheranes &amp; obſtinate purſued with fire and bloud, of the time wherof you ſhould be ignorant, and of the places where they came into the worlde, by whome, and in what doctrine they ſtood inſtructed: if I ſpeake of the Proteſtantes banded, againſt ſo great Potentates, and you not know whence they deſcended, nor why their Father was ſo named, nor the variable ſucceſſe of their enterpriſes, nor how, nor why they were ſuccoured by the Kings of Fraunce, England, and other Princes, with a number of things which would remaine vnknowne vnto you, for that you could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their beginning and progreſſe, you would take very ſmall delight therein: at the leaſt you will take double contentment, if all the whole be made manifeſt and plaine, as you would your ſelfe deſire: ſince then that the knowledge of naturall things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not the ſpirite, if the cauſe and reaſon thereof reſt vnknowne amidſt many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, a ſomewhat leſſe agreeable diſcourſe, by reaſon of the ignorance of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, ſhall ſatisfie the more curious ſorte, if in repreſenting therein vnto you their very ſpring and true motife, I ſhall not fetch it from ouer farre.</p>
            <p>As the iudgements of men are diuers and oftentimes contrary, ſo is there not any thing ſo common or generall whatſoeuer, that receiueth not alteration in ſome perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,<note place="margin">The originall and differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſtian religion in Fraunce.</note> which may eaſily be ſeene in all vocations, eſpecially in the doctrine which all embrace to the conduct of their ſaluation.

And if wee ſhal ſeeke further examples then the memory of our fathers, it is moſt certaine that religion planted in Fraunce in the time of the Pagans, growne vnder the lyne of <hi>Clouis,</hi> was no ſooner eſtabliſhed vnder <hi>Pepin</hi> and his ſucceſſors, but the authoritie and conſequently abuſe of certaine of the Cleargie, encreaſing with the abundance of wealth, the zeale and curioſitie of ſuch as would reforme the diſcipline and life of the officers, encouraged

men by little and little to attempt to the ſubſtance, and ſome to band themſelues ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and by writings, others with open mouth, againſt the Articles of doctrine, which they little iudged of, leſſe vnderſtoode, or worſe practiſed. As notwithſtanding the Paſtors confirming their generall receiued doctrine, by a better life then ours, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed both by one and the other thorough a ſeuere puniſhment of iuſtice, to the example of euery one; ſo the reformation being hindered to grow by the diligence and ſtudie of the Biſhops and iuſticers, it could not ſpread ſo farre but that at this day, (when all eſtates are onely curious of their pleaſure and particuler profit) they haue themſelues giuen entrie to what they moſt complained off &amp; leaſt doubted. So many held their peace, and the hardeſt could not gaine ſo much, as to make any other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion runne among the people then the common, vntil that the officers of the Church and iuſtice, ſurpriſed in their dutie, by ſuch as ſpied but an occaſion fit to giue entrie vnto their opinions, ſaw themſelues ſooner beaten then aſſailed, by thoſe whoſe very firſt March they alwaies before deſpiſed.<note place="margin">How the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Vaudois and Albigeois was diſperſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Europe</note> Then after manye and light brunts with the common faith receiued in Fraunce, (ſince the ſure and publicke eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhmentes of Chriſtian Religion) by <hi>Berenger</hi> of Tours, <hi>Abeyllard Breton, Amaury</hi> of Chartres, <hi>Arnold</hi> of Breſſe, and other, followed by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sectaries as well in this Realme as elſe where, it neuer was ſo earneſtly aſſaulted as by the <hi>Vaudoios</hi> and their ſucceſſors in Guienne and Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which they named Albigeois of the towne of Alby chiefe of Albigeois, ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate betweene Languedos and Quercy. Who in ſpight of all the Potentates of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome ſowed about the yeare 1100. and euen ſince their doctrine ſmally differing from the Proteſtants at this day: Not onely through Fraunce, but almoſt all the Countries of Europe.

After that this doctrine had a while crept thorough Fraunce, in the end as the heate of burning coles doth exhalate and pearce thorough by little and little, the thickneſſe of the Sinders not able to quench it, it grew more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, by Prayers, publike exhortations, adminiſtrations of Sacraments and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſes, the courſe whereof the Clergie not being able to hinder, ſought vnder the authoritie of the Pope, aide and force at the hands of Chriſtian Princes,<note place="margin">Opinions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner changed by eaſe and reſt then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence</note> whome they ſpeedely armed againſt the Albigeois.

So as all the French anon! after returned to the ſame doctrine, from which their fathers had ſo much ſwarued, except ſuch as retired themſelues into the mountaines, chiefely the <hi>Prouencaux, Sauoyarts, Dauphinois,</hi> and <hi>Piemontois:</hi> of whome there were many ſent into Lombardie, Calabria, Pouille, Sicille, Germaine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to the end they might plant the fruite of that doctrine which they ſtoode aſſured was the moſt true &amp; auncient of Chriſtendome.

Which hauing beene conceiued and explaned by manie, in the end fell from hand to hand into the heade of <hi>Wicklife,</hi> about 50. yeares after, a greatly renowned Diuine in the Vniuerſitie of Oxford, and Curate of Luteruorth in the Dioceſſe of Lincolne.

But 40. yeares after his deceaſe, his body was puld out of the grounde by the Popes commandement, and his bones burned at Oxford 1410. before the Abbot of Shrewsberie then Chancelor. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that 13. yeares after his death, 1401. his doctrine was vtterly condemned in open Parliament, with an Iniunction to all men to ſeeke out thoſe Lollards, (ſo called they ſuch as profeſſed that order of doctrine,<note place="margin">Lollards in England, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia Serma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp;c.</note> according vnto thoſe of Pologne, and borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers vnto it) yet for all that, could it not hinder the multiplying thereof as well in that Countrie as elſe where. Chiefely in Germanie, by reaſon of the great learning which was taught by the famous Fathers of the Vniuerſitie of Oxford: Wher among other,<note place="margin">How the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Vaudois and Wicklife was carried into Polonia, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</note> a Scholer of Bohemia, being much delighted in a booke of <hi>Wicklifes</hi> called <hi>The Vniuerſales,</hi> caried a Coppie thereof with him into his Countrie, where the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Prague was of great commendations. In which <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> more renowned then the reſt for his quicknes of ſpirite, made himſelfe for all that much better knowne after the reading of thoſe bookes: which he explaned and ſo much thereby encreaſed the doctrine which long ſince was ſpread abroad in thoſe quarters, that many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Scholers, and of the very Nobles and Clergie themſelues, followed the ſame as a matter worthy to bee receiued among men. Now among the reſt of the people which for their conſcience were perſecuted, the Bohemians had beene long before <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi>

And by the Pope, who long before that, had ſent thither an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor of the ill affected of the faith, who (<hi>Iohn Hus</hi> liuing) was named Biſhop of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Be it then that the perſecutions either coolled this kinde of people thorough out Chriſtendome, or that the Princes and Cleargie made no accounte of thoſe, who ſtanding fauoured by no great perſonages became all ſimple people and inhabitants of the Montaignes, as thoſe of Piemont, Sauoye, Calabria, and other, the Bohemians ſtoode at that inſtant moſt renowned and worſt ment to.

which they deliuered vnto him, confeſſing further that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully puniſhed. But as they let him goe neuer a whit the ſooner for that, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon certaine <hi>Carmos</hi> of Bohemia being come with new accuſations, he recanted and ſtucke ſo faſt to his firſt opinion, that the councell condemned him as before they did <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> whence he appealed vnto <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo that (ſaid hee) after one hundred yeares you ſhall make account for me: but the hangmen did as much for him as the other. <hi>Poge Florentin</hi> being preſent at all, greatly commended in a wrighting which he ſent vnto <hi>Leonard Aretin,</hi> the eloquence, grace, knowledge, and maruellous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of <hi>Hieroſme:</hi> thinking nothing wanting in him but a conformitie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith.

            <p>The pardons which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> publiſhed throughout the world, 1517. to get mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and prouide for a warre pretended againſt the Turke,<note place="margin">Generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed through Chriſtendom 1517.</note> were an occaſion together with the abuſes his Treaſorers offred in the leuying thereof, (as the moſt learned and notable writers as well of Germany as Italy hath left) that <hi>Luther</hi> firſt declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an enemy to the ouercharging of conſciences, then a Cenſor of Popes and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall abuſes, to reforme in the ende the more receaued doctrine in the Chriſtian Church, for firſt he found himſelfe agreeued at the pardons, next banded himſelfe againſt the inſolencies of Receiuers, and hauing put in queſtion the autoritye of the Pope, which defended them, he came by little and little cleane to contemne the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of Rome: next to reforme it, and in the end vtterly to reiecte it. Now as <hi>Leo</hi> (ſay they) vſed too licentiouſly the authoritie of the Romiſh Sea, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch graces as the Court gaue of ſpirituall and beneficiall matters, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Laurens Puccy</hi> Cardinall of the title of 4. Sains, ſo hee ſcattered throughout, without diſtinction of time or place, his generall pardons of pleanary remiſsion, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the quicke as the dead: and deliuered ſoules out of the paines of Purgatory. And becauſe ſuch fauours were deliuered ſo there were mony, and that the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers bought their offices at the Popes handes, and that little which did come vnto his hands was ſpent badly enough in other affaires, that hee ſawe many of his Miniſters ſell for ſmall price, yea play away at Tauernes, power to deliuer ſoules out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye, and that the Pope (who by the meekenes of his owne nature, exerciſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things his pontificall office with little enough Maieſtie) had at one blowe giuen vnto his ſiſter <hi>Magdelaine</hi> the profit of ſuch Indulgences as might be reaped in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Countries of Germany, who deputed for her the Biſhop <hi>Arebaut,</hi> that executed his charge but with too much couetouſnes and extortion: and that <hi>Leo</hi> had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King of Fraunce, to vſe the laſt payments of his own Realme as ſhould pleaſe him vntill the warre againſt the Turke; all ſauing 50. thouſand crowns which he gaue to <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> his Nephew. <hi>Luther</hi> a Regent Doctor in diuinitie, thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had read, ſeene, and heard enough to deſpiſe ſuch Indulgences, and to be able to taxe therein the authoritie of the Pope: but afterwards a great number of Auditors running thither, to the end they might heare ſome noueltye to delight them, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular winde, no leſſe then the fauour of the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> one of the electors of the Empire, and the greateſt landed of all Germany, ſo egged him forward that hee did not only band himſelf againſt the power of the Popes, and authoritie of the Church of Rome, but yeelding himſelfe to the anger conceiued, for the iniuries and ſharpe purſuites of the Receiuers, and ſuch as ſpurned againſt him, hee grew in the ende to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21992:17"/>
make open warre againſt the doctrine of the Church. The Pope as they ſay beſtirred himſelfe well in the beginning for to quench this fire, but not vſing the proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; medicines,<note place="margin">Luther cited to Rome.</note> he did but impaire ſo great a maladie, for he cited <hi>Luther</hi> to Rome, he forbad him to preach, and after ſeeing of his diſobedience, he gaue him ouer to the cenſure of the Church, neuer himſelfe in all this time abſtaining from many things of euill example: which hauing bene with reaſon blamed by <hi>Luther,</hi> were by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, leſſons, and writings, rendred a great deale more odious to euery man: ſo as proceeding againſt him with Eccleſiaſticall weapons, without amending matters of euil example in his own Court at Rome, (and which ſince they were made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to reforme) ſo much the more grew the reputation of <hi>Luther</hi> among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they ſawe him more perſecuted for the innocencie of his life, and pure doctrine which he preached then any thing elſe. And albeit that many were of opinion both at Rome and elſewhere, that it were leſſe inconuenience to diſſemble the fire of ſuch follie, which peraduenture would growe of it ſelfe into ſmoake, then in kindling and blowing it through the ſharpenes of ſuch purſuites, to make it encreaſe and growe in greater blaze then before: and chiefely for that a little wealth and honor had in the beginning, made him to eate his worde, namely, at ſuch time as hee was baniſhed by the Emperour at the Diet of Wormes, aſſuring themſelues to haue ſeene him in ſuch a fright, as if the iniurious and threatning wordes of the Cardinall <hi>S. Xixte,</hi> Legat had not led him to a laſt diſpaire, hee would gladly enough haue beene reconciled to the Church, and beene made to leaue his opinions. So it came to paſſe (as men are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enclined to remedie inconueniences by vehemency and rigour, then fair means and curteſie) that not onely the perſecutions which augmented daylye againſt him and his <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> but alſo a terrible excommunication being reſolued againſt the Duke of Saxe, rendred this Prince more feruent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer, to the defence of the cauſe. True it is that the opinion which was helde among many Princes, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this doctrine were no leſſe enemies to the temporall Lordes, then to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Churchmen, was an occaſion that many ſoueraign and other Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">What cauſed a ſtay of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> diligently hindred, and with great ſeueritie, the publication therof in their countries. Beſides that the multitude and contrariety of moſt abſurde hereſies, which crept in at that very time, did maruelouſly retarde the beginning, yea and bring a maruellous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement to the doctrine it ſelfe: but the liberty which the people in the end reſumed in their manner of life, (I will holde my peace as concerning the merite of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine) and the couetous obſtinacy of great ones, who could neuer be broght to leaue any more their ancient manners, then the goods which they vſurped of the Church, did adde vnto him ſo ſtrong winges, that many preſaged his more high and loftye flight, then hath as yet beene ſeene, howſoeuer in a worde to teach perticularlye the beginning of his reformation.</p>

Afterwards the fire of an ambitious anger, inflamed by the vndiſcreet couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of certaine Queſtors, encreaſed by the iniurious gain-ſayinges of ſuch and other his aduerſaries, ioyned thereto the zeale which he had to guide the more ſimple ſort, in a way which ſeemed better vnto him, encouraged him to reforme and in the ende to reiect almoſt all the doctrine which had beene generally receiued of our fathers, as ſoone as he ſaw himſelfe excommunicated by the Pope, and baniſhed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, 1519.

As things newly ſprung vp cannot cary any great force, but if by delay a miſchiefe be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow ſtronger, it is to be feared, that afterwards it may grow vncurable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that day by day the euill encreaſed, in which nothing is more to be ſhunned then delay: <hi>Luther</hi> would not goe thither, ſaying that the place ſtood very ſuſpitious and dangerous for him, but ſollicited to haue the cauſe debated in ſome free place of Germany. The vniuerſitie of Witemberg wrote in his fauour to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> to whom hauing proteſted that he would neither think nor ſpeake againſt the faith receaued in the holy Sea,<note place="margin">Luther appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before Caietan the Popes Legat.</note> gaue notwithſtanding atteſtation of his good life and better doctrine, and beſought him to ordaine indifferent Iudges in Germanie: <hi>Frederic</hi> in the end dealt ſo farre with <hi>Caietan,</hi> that by the ſafe conduct of the Emperour, hee ſhould be admitted to defende his cauſe at Ausbourghe before him, without going at all to Rome: who ſet before him that hee ſhould repent himſelfe by acknowledging of his errour, and that hee ſhould no more wright ought which might trouble the peace of the Church: for the firſt, he ſaid he could not acknowledge that he had failed, but for the ſecond he would obey it. But <hi>Caietan</hi> telling him that he did not eſteem ſo highly of the Popes authoritie as he ought, &amp; that in his propoſitions he ſhould ſay the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Chriſt were not the treaſure of Indulgences, (contrarye to the decree of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the ſixth) and that faith is neceſſary to ſuch as would receiue the holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in ſorte that they aſſured themſelues their ſinnes wer pardoned; It is falſe (ſaid he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diuers witneſſes, one Notaire, and foure Councellers of the Emperours: &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he had euer honoured &amp; reuerenced the Church of Rome, and that if he had ſaid ought repugnant thereunto, he would not abide by it: but in that hee was vrged to renounce his errour, hee ſaid hee did not think that euer hee ſpake any thing contrary to the ſcripture, opinion of ancient fathers, decree of Popes, or the right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe. Notwithſtanding for that he confeſſed he might faile, a matter naturall to

man, hee ſubmitted himſelf to the knowledge of the holy church, &amp; refuſed not that the vniuerſities of Germany and Paris ſhould yeeld their opinion, requiring then that the knowledge of the fact might bee ſent to the Pope, nothing being able to come more pleaſing vnto him, then to haue the voice of the Church vpon the ſame: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged how he had bene too bitter and leſſe reuerent towards his dignitie, but the faulte was to be laide vpon th'importunitye of the Queſtors, and praied that hee might be pardoned, promiſing euer after greater modeſty, and that euen in his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings he would content the Pope, and would ſpeake no more of pardons, if they would likewiſe ſhut vp the mouthes of his aduerſaries:<note place="margin">Luther apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietan.</note> wherupon ſeeing that <hi>Caietan</hi> preſſed him ſo ſore to recant, otherwiſe threatned him with paines ordained by the Pope, and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication if he repented not, he was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celled to appeal from him to the Pope. The appeale contained that the queſtion of Pardons had bene diſputed by many, and yet neuer certainly determined; &amp; that in ſuch queſtions it was lawful eſpecially for Diuines to diſpute, the which he the rather did, by reaſon of ſo ſottiſh Queſtors, as exacted the people in ſo many kinde of ſorts, and yet not to affirme any thing therin, but the better to know the truth, leauing the whole to the iudgment of the moſt learned &amp; <hi>Leo</hi> himſelf. Notwithſtanding by the aduiſe of the B. of Scoli and Prieras his Iudges eſtabliſhed by the Pope, he had bene cited to Rome, &amp; from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the cauſe ſent back to <hi>Caietan,</hi> whom as ſuſpected he might well haue refuſed, yet for all that he rendred all obedience, but ſeeing himſelfe ſtill preſſed to recant, threatned with great paines, yea and ready to haue had worſe, greeued with ſuch preiudicies,<note place="margin">The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.</note> hee appealed from an ill informed Pope to a Pope better councelled. The decree of <hi>Clement</hi> which hee ſo vrged, is in the extrauagants of the Cannon, where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the benefite of Chriſt, he ſaith that one droppe of his bloud was ſufficient to haue redeemed mankinde, but ſo much being ſhedde as nothing whole and entyre reſted behinde, it was lefte for a great treaſure to the vſe of the Church, commaunding <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors to diſtribute the ſame as good Stewardes, to ſuch as ſhould be truely repentant, and confeſſe their ſinnes, in pardoning them ſuch temporall paines as were due vnto their ſinnes, adding thereunto the merittes of the Virgin and other Saintes, ſo as this treaſure could not be drawen d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ye. Now as hee founded the vertue of pardons vpon this decree, <hi>Luther</hi> on the other ſide maintained that there was nothing committed to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors but the Keyes and adminiſtration of the word, by which Chriſt would that in a full affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in him they ſhould pronounce remiſſion of ſinnes to the beleeuers: and if that the decree did agree with ſo true a ſence of the Scripture it was then good, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, falſe: beſides that the merittes of Saintes were cleane repugnant to the word, for what men ſoeuer they be, they doe neuer more then they ought, nay they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come neere their dutie, and therefore not ſaued but by the meere mercie of God. As touching that councel which approued the ſouerainty of Popes to be aboue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, ſee what it is in the 4. &amp; 5. ſeſsion of the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as in ſundry other, it was ordained that the Pope ſhould obey the ordinances of the councell, and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 3. and 8. ſeſsion of that of Baſle, but <hi>Eugene 4.</hi> not willing to be preſent at that of Baſle, as much as he was thither cited, declaring it of no force, aſsigned another at Ferrara 1438. from Ferrara they went to Florence, where the Popes ſoueraigntye was eſtabliſhed aboue the Church and all Chriſtians, whereas <hi>Luther</hi> referred himſelfe to the Vniuerſitie of Paris, it was for that <hi>Gerſon</hi> a Doctor in Diuinity, much renowned at Paris, hauing bene at the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſent thether among others by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie, and hauing greatlye allowed that decree by which the Pope was made in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21992:20"/>
ſubiection, he therin was followed by them of Paris, and a number of others, he died 1429. And before that <hi>Luther</hi> had euer put any thing in light, that Vniuerſitie had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to a Councell, becauſe that he with <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt had aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <hi>La Pragmatique Sanction,</hi> verye profitable for Schollers, to whome it opened the doore of offices, charges and honors throughout the whole Realme.</p>
            <p>Now as ſince vpon <hi>Leo</hi> his ſending to <hi>Frederic, Charles Miltit</hi> a Germane his groom of his Chamber, with letters to ſundry other to cauſe them to abandon <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Miltit</hi> ſeeing of him more ſupported, had found ſundrye meanes to appeaſe him, and reconcile himſelfe to <hi>Leo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luther eager againſt the Court of Rome.</note> had not the diſputation of <hi>Eccius</hi> at Lipſe againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which hee grounded vpon the difference of the Popes ſupremacie, cleane da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all theſe hopes: for <hi>Luther</hi> not able to leaue his eagerneſſe againſt the Courte of Rome, proffered greater iniuries then euer, tearming it more wicked and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt then Babilon or Sodome, that ſhe was the ſincke of impiety, to wich nought could be added, and that Antechriſt put therto his helping hand: ſaying that he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greeued that <hi>Leo</hi> did remain among them like a Lambe among wolues. S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> quoth he, lamented the eſtate of Pope <hi>Eugene,</hi> when as Rome was leſſe filthye: but now that ſhe is the receate and bottomles gulfe of all villanies, there is much more reaſon to bewaile her: further he beſought by letters the new Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, as a puiſſance eſtabliſhed by God, to render iuſtice, and to ſupporte the weake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the iniurie of the more mighty, that he would protect him, conſidering that he wrote nothing but by conſtraint of his aduerſaries, and what was approued by the beſt men of knowledge in all Germany: ioyned withall that he offred to recant, if his errors might be proued: he profeſſed as much before the Electors, the B. of Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg and others. In ſumme all the Princes lightly regarded it ſaue <hi>Frederic,</hi> who in the ende flatlye refuſed to ſend him to Rome, and leſſe to puniſh him. Now <hi>Frederic</hi> ſtanding in much awe of the Pope, and yet carying ſome affection to <hi>Luther,</hi> for that he ſaw him ſo much profite his Subiectes and other of his Vniuerſitie, was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that this difference might haue bene paſſed ouer with meekenes, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing the one ſide or the other: but being ſollicited on both partes, in the end hee reſolued to behaue himſelfe according to the aduiſe of the moſt ſufficienteſt perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all his Countrie: therefore not attributing ſo great authoritie to himſelfe, as to be able alone to iudge of this doctrine, hee demaunded the opinion of ſundry aged and learned men: yea oft of ſuch Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen as were of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: Among other hee would needs heare <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeake at a Diette which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift helde in the Cittie of Cologne, after his coronation: cauſing him then to come vnto him, hee declared amiably, that amidſt all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, hee had rather the earth ſhould open and ſwallowe him vp quicke, then cleaue to any falſe opinions, or fauour them the leaſt that might be, againſt the generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued doctrine: but that if <hi>Luther</hi> iuſtly taxed the errors, and ſet forth the ſpringes of a more pure doctrine, he would neuer contrary the truth, what euil ſoeuer ſhould befall him or his, as hee foreſawe it, that hee would not too much ſtick to his own aduiſe,<note place="margin">Eraſmus his opinion of Luther.</note> but deſired to vnderſtand the minde of the more learned, coniuring <hi>Eraſmus</hi> freelye to deliuer vnto him his opinion. Who beginning his ſpeech with a kinde of ſmyling, ſaying that <hi>Luther</hi> had committed two great faults: firſt in touching the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of the Monkes, next the crowne of the Pope, then comming to the matter, confeſſed that <hi>Luther</hi> had great cauſe to taxe certaine errors, conſidering that faults in the Church, encreaſing by as naturall a corruption as diſeaſes did in mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, reformation then was, and all times had beene neceſſarye in the Church,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21992:20"/>
but that it ought to be handled with diſcretion, without difiorming the Church, no more then mans bodie, to reſtore it to health. He added likewiſe that the ſummarye of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine was true, but that hee could haue wiſhed a greater temperance and modeſty in the proceeding thereof: <hi>Laurence</hi> Biſhop of Virtzbourge, wrote the very ſame to th'elector <hi>Frederic,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Pope Leo.</note> affirming he had taken the opinion of many learned men therin, ſo as <hi>Frederic</hi> perſwaded by the authoritie of ſuch and like perſonages of valew, made afterwards no difficultie in maintayning <hi>Luther</hi> againſt the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. About the ſixt of Iulye 1520. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> hauing called together the Senate, the Colledge of Cardinalles, and a number of learned men as hee affirmed in his Letters to <hi>Frederic,</hi> ſent euery where his Bull out, in which after alleadging cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine textes of Scripture fit for his purpoſe, I pray Chriſt, ſaith hee, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the hee and ſhe Saintes of Paradiſe, to turne away ſuch danger from the Church, as <hi>Luthers</hi> writinges might bring, afterwardes reciting certaine articles drawne out of his doctrine, hee reproued them, commaunding all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and other to ſhunne it, vnder a paine ſet downe to euery one according to his qualitie, as a thing repugnant to Chriſtian charitie, and to the reuerence which all men ought to beare towards the Sea of Rome: further willing that ſuch books of <hi>Luther</hi> as contained like doctrine, ſhould be publiquely burned: commaunding him to meddle no more with teaching; to whome he gaue threeſcore dayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe, aboliſh his bookes, and publiquely recant his doctrine, otherwiſe hee abandoned him as an Heretique and excommunicate perſon, and willed hee ſhould be puniſhed according to the lawes: forbidding all men to haunt him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending vnder the ſame lawe all ſuch as ſhould doe the contrarye. But he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aduertiſed of his condemnation at Rome, repealed his appeale the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Nouember 1520. and more croſſely then euer maintained the Pope to perſiſt in his tiranny and impietie: as being ſo farre out of the way, as to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, without calling him, hearing him or conuicting him of any errour; his appeale grounded vpon many points: Firſt, for that without hauing heard the matter, and without being conuicted, hee condemned him at his pleaſure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee commaunded him to reiect all faith neceſſary to the Sacraments. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee preferred his owne opinions and rauinges before the Scriptures, and that hee referred nothing to any councell, which hee offred to approue whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaſed his ſuperiours. Then hee beſought the Emperour and the reſt of the Magiſtrates, that for the honor of God and defence of a Councels libertye,<note place="margin">Luther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed againe from the Pope.</note> they would receaue his appeale, that they would bridle the tirannie of the Pope, that they would not account his Bul any manner of way able to touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that they would innouate nothing, vntill the cauſe might be worthely pleaded: for all this notwhithſtanding the Pope vrged <hi>Frederic</hi> to burn all his Books, and that he ſhould either cut of his head, or making him Priſonner deliuer him vp to be punniſhed in example. <hi>Frederic</hi> praied him not to proceede ſo eagerlye, but to chooſe good and skilfull Perſonages, to confer of the whole matter amyablye to giue ſure ſafe-conduct to <hi>Luther,</hi> and that his bookes might not bee burned before hee had defended his cauſe, then if he were conuicted by ſure teſtimonies of the ſcripture, he would not approue his enterpriſe, albeit that alreadye hee conſented not to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and though he ſhould not be able to maintain his fact, yet hee hoped the Pope would not require at his hands a matter which he could not performe: for the reſt he hoped (by Gods aſsiſtance) to fulfill the office of a Prince of th'empire and of an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Sonne to the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:21992:21"/>To which the deputies of <hi>Leo</hi> hauing in vaine replyed, the end of the conference was that neceſſity preſſed them to do according to the contents of the Popes Bull, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anon after they burned <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes: then began he much more eagerlye to goe to worke,<note place="margin">Luther pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law and Popes Bull.</note> for being aduertiſed of all this paſſed, hee aſſembled together all his ſchollers of Witemberge, and in the preſence of many learned perſonages, hee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely burned the Cannon law, togither with the Popes new Bull, the 10. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Afterwards to render reaſon of his exploite he alleadged theſe: Firſt, that it was an ancient cuſtome to fling corrupt bookes into the fire, as it is ſeen in the Acts of the Apoſtles: beſides, it is his part which is baptized into Chriſt, which is a profeſſor and publique teacher of the Scriptures, to combat againſt falſe doctrine, and propoſe that which is wholſome for mankinde; as touching the Pope and his ſequel, they are ſo miſerable and accurſed, that they doe not onely withſtand the holy ordinances, but condemne the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to make their owne ſhine for the brighter: from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth he imploied himſelfe euer after to write againſt the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue abuſes and miſchiefes, which hee ſaid was in the Court and doctrine of Rome, as others on the other ſide very bitterly maintained the contrary, each with many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and reciprocall inuectiues far vnworthy of Chriſtians. So as a certaine deſire of honor, ſtirred vp by a dutie to the explaining, according to his charge of the holye ſcripture, made him become ſo reſolute and ſtubborne, by the peeuiſh thwarts of his aduerſaries, that then he became open banker out to the catholicke and romain doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſo as hauing bene ſummoned to the Diet of Wormes, whither he had the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſafe-conduct, to render an account of his faith, there to be puniſhed or iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according as he ſhould maintaine; he ſaid frankely the 18. of April 1521. that he would not recant one inch, except lawfully they made the contrary to appeare vnto him, being the cauſe that the Emperour on the next morrowe ſent his letters to the aſſemblye of Princes, in which hee contained that his anceſtors who had made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtian Religion, had euer obeyed the Church of Rome: now ſince <hi>Luther</hi> oppugned the ſame, his dutye was to followe the ſteppes of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and to defende Chriſtian Religion, in ſuccouring the Church of Rome: wherefore hee determined to baniſhe <hi>Luther</hi> and his Adherents, and vſe other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies fit for the quenching of this fire: but becauſe of his faith, which he had pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee would ſend him home ſafe. The 24. of Aprill the Archbiſhop of Treuues, and other of the Lords called him to them, where after hauing wiſhed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, or at the leaſt ſubmit his writinges to the iudgement of the Emperour, and of the councell of the Princes and generall councell to come: hee would not in any caſe but that all ſhould be reſolued by the authoritie of the holy ſcripture, which <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the Lawyer and others ſaide was not reaſonable, conſidering the diuers ſence of Scripture, which euery man interpreteth after his owne fanſie: and that further, by this meanes ſhould neuer any thing be ſure or clearely determined, that it was not to be ſuffered that euery man ſhould aske a reaſon of euery point, as of a matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in nature. Breefe, that ſince it was not a thing reaſonable, to diſpute a matter alreadye reſolued or condemned by the Church, men ought ſimply and abſolutely to holde that doctrine which their good Fathers had left vnto them.

Now albeit the lawes forbid to heare a manifeſt heretique, ſo many times condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſeperated from the communion of the Church, yet to ſtop the paſſage to all calumnie, he ſent him a letter and diſpatched his Herald with ſafe conduct, to cauſe him to come vnto him and render account of his writings: afterwardes hauing reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the propoſitions, deſſeines, <hi>Luthers</hi> anſweres and all that had paſſed at Wormes, he ſaid that in caſe <hi>Luther</hi> did ſtill defend his errors, and wilfully perſeuere in them, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Popes bul, and to witnes that he would maintain it, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Luther</hi> as an author of ſchiſm, and an obſtinate heretique, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding al men to hold him for ſuch: and after 21. daies which he gaue him of fauour to reclaim himſelf he charged euery man with all force to endeuour to take him and deliuer him vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands: he baniſhed alſo all ſuch as any manner of way whatſoeuer fauoured him, enioyning his bookes to be vtterly aboliſhed, with great paines from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for any booke-binders that ſhould ſell any of them; and ordained that his decree made in the councell of the Princes and all the eſtates ſhould remaine for euer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> then much ſpiting at his hauing beene thus condemned, and his bookes burnt by the Deuines of Cologne and Louaine, after 1521. by thoſe of Paris, was at Rome giuen vp to the Diuell, the 28. of March 1521. by the Pope, togither with all heretiques, Pyrates, Impoſers of new tributes, falſefiers of Buls, Marchants furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the enemies of the faith with weapons, or other thinges forbidden, Maſſacrers, poſſeſſors by violence, &amp; other which they are accuſtomed to condemn &amp; curſe the Maundy Thurſday before Eaſter, in the Bull which they call <hi>In caena Domini:</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards baniſhed by the Emperour in a generall aſſemblie of the Princes of th'empire: you may not doubt if he were then put into a heate to skirmiſh more eagerly then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he did, ſo as that being publiſhed throughout, and otherwiſe pricked forward by the threates and outragious ſpeeches of Cardinall S. <hi>Kiſte</hi> and other his aduerſaries, and beſides ſeeing himſelfe ſupported as wel by <hi>Frederic</hi> Duke of Saxe his Mecenas, as many other Lords, gentlemen, and great perſonages, attempted (a matter which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before he durſt ſo much as haue dreamed of) cleane to aboliſh the Maſſe by his writings which he publiſhed, to that end at Witemberg.

Shortly after 1523. 1524. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did as much at Zurich in Suizerland, and many other Cantons in like time followed after.

turning the effect of their hatred vpon his diſciplines, gaue a beginning to moſt cruell and continuall perſecutions of the euill affected towards the faith. Now as the ſeede of this reformation was taken out of the conuent of <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> ſo did they make ſeene the firſt treates of their bitter puniſhments vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Henry, Auguſtine</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Bruſſelles, who after many diſputations with <hi>Iaques Hocſtrat,</hi> the Inquiſitor a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin,</hi> hauing bene depoſed of the prieſtly order, diſgraded of the leſſer orders,<note place="margin">Adrian dieth, Clement 7 de Medices ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</note> clad with laye and prophane habites, after deliuered vp to the ſecular Iuſtice, were burned aliue the firſt of Iuly 1523.

Then <hi>Clement</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth beſides his priuate letters full of hope and comfort, ſignified from Rome the 20. of March 1525. to the Parliament of Paris, that he had vnderſtoode by letters from the regent, how thoſe wicked hereſies began to ſlide thorough the whole Realme; and whom by great prudence and good aduiſe, they had deputed certaine, to whom they gaue charge to ſee the puniſhment of ſuch as ſtroue to aboliſh the faith and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion: whom ſo deputed he confirmed by his owne authoritie. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, ſaith he, that againſt this great and maruailous diſorder, ſprong from the malice of Satan, and the rage and impietie of his ſupporters, the whole world ſhould bend their forces, to preſerue the common health: conſidering that this forcenerie woulde not onely confound and broyle Religion, but alſo, all principalitie, Nobility, lawes, orders and degrees. For his owne parte he would neither ſpare any diligence or labor, to remedie ſuch an inconuenience: that they in like ſorte whoſe prudence and vertue hath euery where beene highly renowned, ought to employ themſelues to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the true and right faith: And moreouer, that to the end the weale of their Realme, and dignitie of their eſtate ſhould be exempt, from the perill and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call miſteries which this pernitious and peſtilent hereſie ſowed round about, they needed not to bee pricked forwards, conſidering how great teſtimonie of their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they had already yeelded; yet to make his dutie appeare, and ſhew the good will which he bore vnto them he would doe no leſſe then adde this. For that which they hetherto had done, was moſt agreeable vnto him, and was the cauſe why he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, from thence forth to keep good watch againſt ſo miſchieuous a plague of heretiques, for the honour of God and ſafetie of the Realme. In ſome hee aſſured them that this their diligence ſhould bee greatly acceptable to God and worthy of much praiſe before men, that he in like ſorte would ſet to his helping hand, and giue vnto them aide and all poſsible fauour.</p>
            <p>Vpon this then the Diuines of Paris, during the impriſonment of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt tormented greatly among other, <hi>Iacques Le Feure</hi> of Eſtaples,<note place="margin">King Francis writeth in the behalfe of Iacques Faber</note> who hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him many bookes in Philoſophie, and Diuinitie.

That if it had beene ſo, ſaith he, he gaue charge to the greateſt perſonages and moſt notable in all erudition to canuiſſe out his bookes and writings wherewith he was charged, which they diligently executing, &amp; euery thing thoroughly examined, a moſt ample and honorable teſtimonie was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto him touching the ſaid <hi>Feure,</hi> conſidering then that the truth is ſuch as hee did afterwards vnderſtand: that he was highly eſteemed among the Italians and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards for his doctrine and vertue, he would ſtand maruailouſly diſcontented, if they ſhould offer any iniurie, or put in any danger ſo innocent a perſon. And for that, at that inſtant he ment to haue iuſtice more rightly &amp; rigorouſly adminiſtred thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Realme then before; as alſo for that he reſolued to ſhew all fauour and amitie towards learned men, to that end hee commaunded that if they had put any men of knowledge in queſtion ſince his departure, that it ſhould be ſuſpended by his mother the regent to the end he might be aduertiſed by her, and that they ſhould therein at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his intention and good pleaſure: In the meane time not to proceede any further: but ſurceaſe vntill his returne, which he hoped would be ſhortly by the grace of God, or vntill that he or his mother ſhould bee otherwiſe aduiſed.

The firſt Article purported that they ſhould imploy them ſelues to the repelling of the Turkes ſtrength and courſes, together with the peſtiferous ſect of <hi>Luther,</hi> no leſſe dangerous then the Turkes. Now as the Emperour, perceiuing the King to grow verie ſicke in reſpect the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded accord could take no good effect, feared leaſt by the encreaſing of his ſickneſſe he might looſe thorough a ſuddain death, ſo certaine aduantages as preſented themſelues he went to ſee him at Madril, comforted him and put him in better hope then euer. In the end the 14. of Ianuarie 1526. the treatie was concluded. Among the Articles whereof, it was ſpecially ſet down that the Emperours and Kings principall end was to haue the enemies of the faith and hereſies of the Lutherans cleane rooted out: And that a peace being concluded between them,<note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Emperor Charles and Francis y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt</note> they ſhould ſettle the common wealth, and vndertake a warre againſt the Turkes, and heretiques excommunicate, and cut off from the communion of the Church. A matter aboue al moſt neceſſarie, and to which the Pope had often dealt and ſollicited them to become watchfull. To ſatisfie then his good pleaſure, they reſolued to beſeech him to commaunde Embaſſadours from all Kinges and Princes, to meete at a day in ſome certaine place, with generall charge and commiſſion, to aduiſe how they might well make a war againſt the Turke and defeate the heretiques enemies of the Church, that the Pope would permit eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Prince according to cuſtome, to leauie money in his owne Countrie, for ſo holy and charitable a worke: and alſo ſuffer them to leauie ſome diſmes vpon the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.

But in Germanie the Lutherans helde vp their heade, fearing nothing but the Emperour and ſome few other, againſt whoſe enterpriſes they began already to league them ſelues. Now whereas the Emperour had aſsigned a day at Spire, to reſolue there of the matter of Religion, of the decree of Wormes, and warre againſt the Turke, it was agreed that they ſhould attend a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: and that for the decree of Wormes euery man ſhoulde in the meane time ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe in his Religion, without altering ought in any ſort,<note place="margin">The decree of Spire permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maintaine his Religion without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</note> as he might bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to render a good account to God and the Emperour.

by order a narration of all the matter in which they appealed from the day of Spire, and decree there made to the Emperour, and a lawfull generall councell to come; or a nationall of Germanie, and in effect to all Iudges of whom there was no cauſe of ſuſpition: and thereupon they diſpatched men to the Emperour, to beſeech him not to miſlike any thing therein, and in the meane time offred vnto him all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſeruice, and other duties which hee could deſire at their handes, the which I haue beene willing to deſcribe ſomewhat at large vnto you, becauſe there will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall out ſpeech of theſe Proteſtants and their league, whereof the matter fel out thus.</p>
            <p>I haue already deliuered vnto you how the Saxon and Landgraue had heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the ſame day of Spire, made entrance to a certain confederation and alliance, which was afterwards ſufficiently and diligently purſued, and as principallye a man aduiſeth himſelfe more vpon an occaſion then at any other time: in like manner after this decree they much more diligentlye bethought themſelues, ſo as they did ſome little matter at Noremberg, as a proiect which was ſince mightily increaſed. And in October the Deputies of theſe Princes and townes being at Schuabach, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the name of <hi>Frederic</hi> and <hi>George</hi> of Brandebourg, that ſince the defence of Religion was the very motiue and foundation of this alliance, it was aboue all things neceſſary that all their wils were of accorde therein: wherefore they recited a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marye of doctrine,<note place="margin">The opinion of the Supper being diuers among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is cauſe of great inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which was approued of all, but they of Strasbourgh and Vlme ſaid, that in reſpect there had no mention at all bene made thereof in the precedent aſſemblie, it paſſed their charge to deale therein. The opinion of the Supper grew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which was the onely hindrance thereof: the one holding the opinion of <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> that men tooke the body of Chriſt by faith: the other of <hi>Luther,</hi> that men eate it really: which being the cauſe that at that time they could not conclude of ought, they ordained an other aſſembly at Smalcade 13. of December. The Proteſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties being brought into Plaiſance in Lombardie, to giue the Emperour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſons of their appeale, had anſwere, that that was done for feare of nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to be meete as well with all kinde of ſectes to come, as ſuch as at this daye wandred throughout, and to eſtabliſh a peace in all Germanye, ſo as they ought not to make any difficultie for letting it paſſe; ioyned withall that the cuſtome did not carrye, that what was ratified by the greater parte of th'empire, ſhould be diſanulled by a few, which muſt needs cauſe him to write to the Duke of Saxe and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, commaunding them to conſent thereto, or elſe he would cauſe ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as all ſhould take example thereby, which they of themſelues ought to haue done, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering how much the Turk at this day waſted Hungary: &amp; albeit that they furniſhed all againſt the Infidels, yet except there were a mutuall conſent by a peace, and brotherly beneuolence among the eſtates, no thing could be brought about ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious againſt ſo puiſſant an enemye: the Deputies notwithſtanding gaue vp their appeale in writing, and in the end had leaue to departe, ſo as all being deliuered in councell, the 14. of October 1529. the Princes and others aſſembled towardes the end of Nouember at Smalcade, where the difference of Religion hindering as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſolution, they departed vnder condition, that whoſoeuer would in each point conſent to this doctrine and receiue it, ſhould meet at Noremberg the ſixt of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 1530. there to deliberate of what were to be done. Now they concluded nothing but to tarry vntill the day which the Emperour ſhould publiſh in the Spring, which was at Ausbourg, the 8. of April 1530. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift elected Emperour in Iune 1519. at Francforde vpon the Rhyne, (notwithſtanding the contrarye purſuites of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21992:24"/>
the French for their Prince) after the death of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the 12. of Ianuary, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred at Aix in the end of October, was crowned at Bologne le Graſſe the 24. of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, by <hi>Clement.</hi> And whereas vpon the 20. of Iune, when the day aſſigned by him at Ausbourg where he made his entry began, he commaunded the Duke of Saxe to carry the Sword before him going to the Maſſe, (according to the office of Marſhall to the Empire, Hereditarie to the houſe of Saxe) the Elector would firſt take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of his Doctors, who perſwaded him that it was lawfull, conſidering that he went thither to execute his office, and not to heare the Maſſe: he was there then onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by <hi>George</hi> of Brandebourgh. After many affaires propoſed and debated, in the end he cauſed to be publiſhed this decree for religion, that hauing reiected the confeſſion of the Proteſtants faith, hee ordained in ſumme that nothing ſhould be changed in matters concerning faith and diuine ſeruice, that whoſoeuer ſhould doe the contrary, ſhould be puniſhable both in body &amp; goods, that reparation ſhould be made of all the iniuries which had beene done to the Churchmen; and to the end this decree ſhould remaine inuiolable for religion, he aſſured that he would imploye all the meanes which God had giuen him thereto, euen to the ſpending of his bloud and life: yea it was forbidden that any ſhould be able to pleade in the impery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all chamber which aſtoniſhed a great many: for the Emperour took good aſſurance of all the reſt for the execution thereof: whereupon the Proteſtants being aſſembled the 22. of December 1530. at Smalcade, concluded a forme of alyance to ſuccour one another: to the which the Princes at that inſtant bound themſelues, and with them many other Lords and free Citties, thinking good to trye therein the King of Denmarke, and Princes of Pomerania and Magdeburg, with all to write to the Kings of Fraunce and England, to diſſwade them from ſuch falſe reportes, as their enemies might make runne of them and their religion, which they accordingly did the 16. of February 1531. The Landgraue allied himſelfe with them of Zurich, Baſle, and Strasbourg, in Nouember, vpon condition to ſuccour one another for their religion; but after the breaches betweene the fiue little Cantons and the reſt (which paſſed in certaine reencounters where the reformed had the worſt) and the accord made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them ſince that, in October 1531. was put this clauſe, that they of Zurich, Berne, and Baſle, ſhould quit the allyance of the Landgraue, and Strasbourgh with the fiue Cantons of K. <hi>Ferdinandes.</hi> Afterwards the 29. of March 1531. they met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at Smalcade, where they receiued but ſlender anſwers from Denmark and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meranye, they conſulted of meanes how to haue ſuccours ready at need, of men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and munition, and for that they had had the opinion of learned men before they confederated together, and that <hi>Luther</hi> had before taught and publiſhed in writing, that it was not lawfull to reſiſt the Magiſtrate, hee now changed his minde, for when as their Lawyers did declare in this meeting that ſuch a caſe might bee offred as the Lawes permitted a man to reſiſt; as they did in this, he ſaid he was cleane ignorant of that point, for that the Goſpell did not impugne the lawes pollitick, but often times confirme them: and becauſe they ſayd that ſuch an accident might ariſe in which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and duetie of conſcience did put the ſworde into their hands, he made a book by which he admoniſhed all men in generall not to obey the Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">The King of Fraunce and England, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranes.</note> if he ſought to imploy them in ſuch a warre, for they ſtoode well aſſured how that the Emperour ſollicited by the Pope and other, went about ſome miſcheefe for them, vnder colour of hauing a care for the common wealth of Germany: King <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt wrote curteouſly back vnto them the 21. of April 1531. with offer of his helpe, ſo did the K. of England the 3. of May. Now after the decree of Ausbourg the Emperour being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21992:25"/>
ſollicited by the Pope and other of the Cleargye, ſeemed that he would make the Proteſtants range themſelues to the common doctrine: but for that certain Princes more peaceably addicted among the Catholicks, ſaw that that could not be brought to paſſe but with great inconueniences to all Germanye, conſidering that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes and confederate Citties had already prepared themſelues, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the Emperour to aſſigne ſome daies, to examine therein their doctrine, and to ſeeke meanes of peace and accord in religion, which often had bene aſſaied and euer in vaine, by reaſon of the great difference thereof: and that the Princes (as <hi>Luther</hi> at other times had done by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Bull) had appealed from the Decree of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh to a future councell, to whom properly appertained the debating of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the end notwithſtanding about the beginning of October, the Princes wrote againe to the deputies Embaſſadors for peace, that if any did thinke or could proue that their doctrine propoſed at Ausbourg were erronious in any point, or in default of ſo doing, would ſubmit himſelfe to the teſtimony of the holy Scripture, they held it moſt agreeable, that if the Emperour would aſſigne a day at Spire, and giue ſafe conduct and oſtages to themſelues,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> their aſſociates and <hi>Luther,</hi> which they ment to bring thether, beſides if he would permit their free and publique preachinges, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vſe of the Supper according to Chriſts inſtitution, and not conſtraine them to make difference of meates, they or their Deputies would be preſent with ful power: and if their doctrin were not confuted, they truſted the Emperour would no more hinder them in their Religion. In the mean time ſince that they had formed an appeale to a lawfull Councell, they beſought the Emperour that he would not in the meane ſeaſon innouate ought againſt them. Now beſides the point of religion, the election of <hi>Ferdinande</hi> to be K. of Romans,<note place="margin">Election of the K. of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> was propoſed by the Emperour, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly refuſed by the Duke of Saxe, (who died about the 13. of Auguſt 1532.) and other Proteſtantes,<note place="margin">Frederic of Saxe elector dieth.</note> in fauour of whom the King of Fraunce had already conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one hundred thouſand crownes. But in the end of Iune 1534. by accord made betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the ſonne of <hi>Frederic</hi> late departed, it was ſaid among other things, that he ſhould acknowledge him for K. of Romanes without preiudice to come to the Electors,<note place="margin">Accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric K. of Bohemia and the D. of Saxe.</note> and that within two moneths the Emperour ſhould ratifie the ſucceſsion of <hi>Frederic,</hi> as well to the goods of his Father as his Grandfather: and ſhould confirme the mariage paſſed with the Duke of Cleues. In ſumme the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of peace, the Biſhop of Maience and elector Palatin, preuailed ſo farre, and the Turkes comming into Auſtria more, that the Emperour to haue ſuccour of all handes,<note place="margin">Peace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout Germany and Religion free.</note> in the beginning of Iune 1532. at a day helde at Noremberg, confirmed a generall peace throughout all Germany, with forbidding any ſhould be troubled for Religion vntill a Councell, or if that helde not, vntill the Eſtates had found meanes to appeaſe that difference, vpon greeuous paines to the breakers thereof, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe would be a meanes to the Pope, that a Councell ſhould be publiſhed within ſixe moneths, to begin one yeare after: or if the Councell ſhould not holde, aduice ſhould be taken in the imperiall daies, to reſolue the whole: to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants promiſed to doe all dutie againſt the Turke. Concluded the 23. of Ianuarie, and ratified the ſecond of Auguſt, by the Emperour, and afterwards publiſhed, the Emperour holding a day at Ratisbone.</p>
            <p>Since the Emperour being returned from Vienne in Auſtria, went into Italye, where he aſſured himſelfe of <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. from thence paſſed into Spaine. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Clement</hi> at the requeſt of King <hi>Frauncis,</hi> came from Genes to Marſeilles in the Automne 1533. Where to confirme a reciprocall and euerlaſting amitie, hee gaue
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21992:25"/>
               <hi>Katherine</hi> his Neece to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Orleans, being 15. yeares of age, a mariage no leſſe coueted of the one ſide then the other. True it is that <hi>Clement</hi> would neuer aſſure himſelfe throughly thereof, vntill he ſaw them in bed togither. The K. in like ſorte (notwithſtanding any offers and aſſurances which the Emperor &amp; other Princes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto the Pope, ſo as he would not perſeuere therein,) tooke no reſt vntill it was accompliſhed, as well for the dignitie and ſingular recommendation of that race, and the hope which his affaires might breede in Italye, as contrariwſe, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour might ſoone enough thereby be impayred: Now to the ende that ſuch as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye ſuffer themſelues to bee commaunded by their paſsions, or in like ſorte iudge euery thing according to the reporte and opinion of others, may haue the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of what they ought to beleeue, of the houſe of Medices.</p>

But ſo greatly were his graces recommended through Italy, that euen as hee liuing, they balanced his vertue in counterweight of the vices of the Chriſtian Potentates for maintaining of whole Italye and all the Princes adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in peace, ſo hee being departed, all the Lordes of Italye before rayned with the brydle of his wiſe councelles, tooke ſuch a libertye to their free paſsions, that <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, drawne in by the Duke of Milan againſt the King of Aragon, for the conqueſt of Naples, and as ſoone the reſt of the Potentates banding againſt him, and ſince among themſelues Italye neuer had from that time other occaſion, then to mourne the loſſe of his preſence, whome they knewe not ſufficiently enough to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, conſidering the greatnes of his deſerts: hee lefte behinde him <hi>Pierre, Iulian,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.</p>

that they had taken out their tongue, and gagged: Afterwards the K. to the ende that might not be a meanes of diminiſhing of the Princes of the Empire their amitye towards him, and to turne away the wrath of God which hee feared would fall vpon his Realme, for the opinion of theſe people made a ſolemne and generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion to be made at Paris, where the relique of Saint <hi>Geneuiefe</hi> patrones of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians deſcended, which happeneth but rarely.

After the 12. of December 1535. by a decree made at Smalcade on Chriſtmas euen, they renewed for ten yeares their alliance which expired at the end of that yeare, and deliberating among the reſt of prouiſion and munitions, it was there concluded that they would all receiue the confeſsion of Ausbourgh, and be content to runne the ſame race: among other there were the Princes of Pomerany, <hi>Vlrich</hi> of Witemberg, <hi>Robert</hi> of Bauiere, he of Deux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponts, the Citties of Ausbourg, Franckeforde, Campodum, Hambourg, and Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry, with many more, who ioyned themſelues at Franckford in April 1536. and after <hi>Guillaume de Naſſaw,</hi> and albeit that the Landgraue did not accord with them there, in reſpect of their claim which was made to the ſignory of Heſſe, yet he promiſed that if there ſhould be any outrage for the profeſsion of the Goſpel, he would not abandon them whatſoeuer enſued theron. In the end of March 1538. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> K. of Denmarck and <hi>Iohn</hi> Marqueſſe of Brandebourg, brother to the Elector, were both receued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now for ſo much as <hi>Helde</hi> who had bene ſent from the Emperour to the Germane Princes, to bring them to agree to ſuch a Councell as the Pope had aſſigned, and therein to reſolue vpon all their differentes in religion, &amp;c. could gaine nothing, charging them euery way, if they refuſed ſo reaſonable conditions of Peace, hee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a League, of which he ſaide the Emperor &amp; King <hi>Ferdinande</hi> were the authors, the aſſociates to be the Archbiſhops of Mayence, and of Salisbourg, <hi>Guillaume</hi> &amp; <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis</hi> of Bauiere, <hi>George</hi> of Saxe, <hi>Eric</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> of Brunſwich, that it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded vpon at Noremberg, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition that if any were troubled for the ancient religion, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

This was alſo confirmed in a daye at Spire, in Iune 1544. And other daye was helde at Wormes in Aprill and May 1545. where the Emperour referring the matter of Religion to a Councell, (for the Pope had courſed him that he ſhould vndertake to decide the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by a conference of Laye men, appertaining onely to him) would meddle only in taking order againſt the Turke: the Proteſtants contrariwiſe ſaide,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants oppoſe themſelues to the decree of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> that they would contribute nothing towards it, and much leſſe goe themſelues, if they had not firſt an accord or an aſſured peace for Religion, by reaſon of which, their wiues, children, and ſubiects, might be tormented in their abſence: ſo as nothing being done, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ordained a Colloquie for Religion at Ratisbone among the beſt learned, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1546. where the Diſputers, witneſſes, and auditors, being choſen, the Saxon ſaide that he would not approue of the conditions of the colloquie and reuoked his people, after the Landgraue and other of the Proteſtants did the like, promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne if the colloquie continued. Hereupon the councel of Trent, publiſhed the yere paſſed on the 15. of March, began in the end of the yeare 1546. The Pope hauing ſent thither as his Legats, <hi>Iohn Maria de Monte, Marcel Seruin,</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21992:29"/>
and his dutie and obedience towards the holy Sea, and that which ſhould be orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But more then the Monkes orations to the fathers, and publication of the Bul of the Popes great pardons, there was nothing done, becauſe the Fathers haſtned no whit thither, ſauing that the 7. of Ianuary where beſides the Cardinalles, were foure Archbiſhops, thirtie three Biſhops, two French, fiue Spaniards, one Illiric, the other Italians, thirtie fiue Monkes, and twelue not Monkes: as the number of Biſhoppes grewe ſomewhat greater the Councell began, and after they were all aſſembled in the great Temple, and that Maſſe was ſaide, the Legats read their Orations to the Fathers. Afterwards it was declared how that the Councell was helde for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: to roote out hereſies, reſtore the diſcipline of the Church, and recouer peace: vpon that they ſaid that the fault of the preſent calamitie ought to be imputed to the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, conſidering that none did their dutie, nor diligent to labour in the fielde of the Lord, whence hereſies ſprung vp like thornes, and albeit that they were not of their owne parte the inuenters of any hereſies, yet they were to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for not well tylling of the Vineyard, they haue not ſowen the fielde, they haue not plucked vp the Darnell which began to ſpring vp, that they then ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and euery man to examine his owne conſcience, and trye if he haue perfourmed his dutie: it is certaine that they were to be blamed, for that all the diſcipline of the Church had been ſo trodden vnder foot: the third euill is warre, which is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent from God, in reſpect of careleſneſſe in religion and want of diſcipline: for Chriſtendome ſtandeth not onely inuaded by Turkes and ſtrangers, but alſo by ciuil and domeſticall armes: during that the Kings combate, or that they which are reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the obedience of their Paſtors, doe ouerthrowe all order, and pyll the goods of the Church, they haue adminiſtred the occaſion to the euils, by their moſt wicked example of life through ambition and couetouſnes. God then is the iuſt Iudge, which afflicteth them by theſe meanes, and yet the paine is much more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle then their deſerte. True it is that ſuch are happy as endure for righteouſnes ſake, which may not be applyed to thoſe which are worthye of more rude chaſtiſement, that euery one then acknowledge his ſinne, and endeuour to appeaſe the wrath of God: for if they doe not acknowledge that, there will neuer be any amendment, and for no end ſhall the Councell be helde, and in vaine ſhall the ayde of the holye Ghoſt bee called vpon, it is a ſingular benefite of God, to haue giuen vnto vs the meanes to begin a councell, after the Church deliuered from ſo long and greeuous a ſhipwrack, taking harbour, is no more nor leſſe reſtored, then was Hieruſalem after ſo long a captiuitye. <hi>Eſdras, Nehemias,</hi> and the other Captaines, being returned out of Iudea, earneſtly admoniſhed the people of Iſrael, to confeſſe their owne ſinnes and their Fathers, and to call vpon the diuine mercie, we ought to follow the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He found in that time ſcoffers, which ſought to hinder, and mocked the Iewes, which reedified the Cittie of Hieruſalem: we in our time haue no want of people, which vndertake the like, and in effect perfourme it: but we muſt march on hardly, in the aſſurance of Chriſt, whoſe commaundement is heere executed, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſet in hand. But for ſo much they are heere as Iudges, they ought well to aduiſe, not to ſuffer themſelues to be ledde by their affections, but holde themſelues neate from the hatred of wrath and enmitie, not ordaining ought to pleaſe man in this world, nor accommodating themſelues to the eares or deſire of any perſon, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe yeeld all honor and glory to God alone: for all eſtates are ſtraied out of the right way, and there is none which doth good. God himſelfe and his Angels are the beholders of this aſſembly, and there is no thought of any the aſſiſtantes, which is hid
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21992:29"/>
from him, that they ſhould then proceede roundly and ſoundly, and that the Biſhops which are ſent from Kinges and Princes ſhould ſo furniſhe their charges, that aboue all thinges they haue the reuerence and honor of God before their eyes, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of hatred or fauour: for conſidering the aſſembly is helde to eſtabliſh peace, they muſt caſt farre from them all contention and partialitye. The Oration finiſhed, the decree of the Synod was read by <hi>Iohn Fonſeca</hi> B. of Caſtrimare, a Spaniard, by which all Chriſtians were admoniſhed to amend their liues, feare God, often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues, and often viſite the Monaſteries of Saintes,<note place="margin">Decree of the Councell of Trent.</note> that they ſhould pray to God for a publique peace; that the Biſhops and other Prieſtes ſhould be attentiue to praiers, and ſay Maſſe at the leaſt euery Sunday, praying for the Pope, Emperour, and whole Chriſtendome: that they likewiſe exerciſe themſelues in faſting and doing of almes in the great Temple; that euery Thurſday in the weeke they ſay a Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, and during the ſaying thereof, that all be attentiue to the Prieſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in time of the Sacrifice, and that they keepe themſelues from chatting; that the Biſhops liue ſoberly, taking away all ſuperfluitie of their tables, ſhunning all idle and light diſcourſe, that they accuſtome their people to like diſcipline, in ſorte that they ſhew themſelues honeſt in words, apparell, and whatſoeuer they ſhall doe. And for ſo much as the end of the Councell is to endeuour that the darkenes of errors and hereſies, which ſince a good while haue raigned vpon the earth, being chaſed away, the light of the truth may ſhine forth; all are admoniſhed, and eſpecially men of knowledge, carefully to aduiſe by what meanes this may be brought to paſſe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering of their opinions that they followe the decree of the Councell of Toledo, and doe all thinges modeſtlye without cryes, nor be riotous or obſtinate, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſweetely and leaſurely. The other Seſsion was the fourth of Februarye, where nothing was diſpatched nor reſolued, ſaue onelye that they confeſſed the Creede of the faith, and put ouer the other Seſsion vntill the eight of Aprill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch as were already on their way, whom they thought good to attend, to the end the authority of the decrees might be of greater waight.</p>

In ſumme, the Proteſtants loſt there a faire occaſion, to haue broken the Emperour, who yet had not his campe well entrenched, nor the ſuccour of ten thouſand Fantaſſins, and foure thouſand Horſe, which the Counte de Bure brought vnto him, they alſo loſt the time at Nerlinge, ſo as the Emperour being ſeaſed of the places bordring of Danube, and hauing it ſo at his deuotion, as he could cauſe all ſorte of victuall to be brought, purſued them then with great aduantage: for they ill husbanding the opportunities which preſented themſelues, and adding thereunto that they were two heads equall, and banded in their opinions, Schertelin firſt, afterwards other, retyred themſelues from them. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> in the meane time had praied his Coſin the D. of Saxe by his Father in lawe the Landgraue, to take in good parte that he ſeaſed of his liuing, but perceiuing himſelfe refuſed, ioyned with <hi>Ferdinande,</hi> who to enforce the Bohemians to ouerrunne Saxe, (vtterly refuſing it, conſidering the alliance which they had made with that houſe, and for that they verilye thought hee had wrong doone him) cauſed his cauallerie of Huſsaries of Hungaries to come downe, and ſome Sileſians,<note place="margin">Maurice war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againſt his coſin and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> with whome he put all Saxe to fire and ſworde: <hi>Maurice</hi> euer ſaying, that hee had rather ſeaſe thereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then a ſtraunger ſhould, conſidering that the mynes of ſiluer were common to him with his couſin, and that his landes were ſhutte in within the others, which hee made ſure by this meanes: beſides that hee did nothing but by the aduiſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, who had written to that end to his Coſin: and further that the Emperour had ſworne vnto him, that hee ment no harme but to the Rebels, and not to Religion: wherefore in all caſes the faith excepted, one ought to obeye that Magiſtrate, which ſuffered in his Countrie the exerciſe of religion; and ſo determined to purſue his owne right, and the differentes which ſo long time he had had with the Elector, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt his landes ſhould fall into the handes of Strangers: offering when hee ſhould be reconciled to the Emperour and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that he would reſtore vp al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whereof he certified his Coſin and his Sonne, ſo as the Hungarians follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For which he was miſliked by euery man, rendring ſo poore a recompence vnto him, whom he ought to haue held for a father, &amp; author of all his good.

The Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the meane time triumphed thoroughout Germanie, ordayning and impoſing great ranſomes to al the Princes, and Proteſtant Cities, euen to the Elector Palatine, who before as a Neutre, was readye to haue reformed his Churches by <hi>Paul Faggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> had not this accident fallen out, and was faine to haue pardon of the Emperour for the 400. horſe which hee had ſent to the Proteſtants: albeit hee proteſted that it was not ment againſt him, but by right of Obligation, carried by a particular contract with the Duke of Witemberg.

            <p>Afterwards the Emperour purſuing of the Saxon, the 22. of Aprill 1547. ariued at Miſnes which <hi>Frederic</hi> had quit, and burning the woodden bridge, encamped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at Mulburge neare the riuer of Albye; the Emperour ſtill haſtening for feare he ſhould encloſe himſelfe within Witemberg. So as with a thouſand Spaniſh Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers, which waded into the water, to paſſe forward, he aſſailed the garde on the other ſhoare notwithſtanding the Cannon ſhot, which ſhowred downe on euerie ſide. Afterwards with the ſmall Boates which <hi>Frederic</hi> had abandoned, hee made a bridge, ouer which the Hungarians of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the light horſe paſſed firſt, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the reſt, haſtning to follow <hi>Frederic,</hi> who was reencountred 3. leagues from Albye, neare the forreſt Lochane, where hee charged him ſo hard, that after a long combat, he was defeated, hurt, taken and brought by the Duke of Alua vnto him,<note place="margin">The Elector hurt taken &amp; broght to the Emperour.</note> to whome hauing ſaid, <hi>I render my ſelfe thy priſonner, moſt mercifull Emperour; and pray thee to giue me entertainment worthy of a Prince,</hi> he anſwered. Now then thou doeſt acknowledge me an Emperour, but I wil handle thee according to thy deſert. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after being condemned to death, the Elector of Brandebourge ſo much appeaſed the Emperour, that he had his life, not refuſing any conditions offred vnto him, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to obey the Emperours ordinances or the Councell, chuſing rather to die. It was then ordained that the Emperour ſhould confiſcate all his goods, which he gaue to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> vpon condition that <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhould yeerely pay vnto the Saxon and his children fiftie thouſand crownes. If it ſo ſeemed good to the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and <hi>Maurice,</hi> he ſhould enioy Gote, ſo as he rayſed the Caſtle and fortefied not the Towne. And for that hee was much in debt, <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhould giue vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren one hundred thouſand crownes, to be employed to the payment of his debtes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21992:31"/>
growne before the league of Smalcade: and that <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhould diſcharge all ſuch debts as his lands, which had beene confiſcat, and giuen vnto him by the Emperour were lyable vnto: And ſo all ſuites to be had at an ende, and his children to haue the vſufruite of the goods mentioned, if they approued theſe conditions, and the people likewiſe. And in reſpect his life was ſaued, he ſhould for euer after remaine priſoner to the Emperour, and to his ſonne the Prince of Spaine. Hee ſurrendred likewiſe his right and dignitie of Elector into the handes of the Emperour, who put <hi>Maurice</hi> as well in poſſeſsion of the dignitie as lands of <hi>Frederic.</hi> And by his decree it was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if the other ſhould chaunce to dye without heires maſles, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his children ſhould be in remainder thereunto, which was doone the 24. of Februarie 1548. at Witemberge. <hi>Frederic</hi> regarding the ceremonies of his houſe all the Electors preſent, the Landgraue vnder ſuertie of <hi>Brandebourge, Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fange</hi> his ſonnes in law, rendred himſelfe almoſt to the diſcretion of the Emperour, who afterwards propoſed a league at Vlme, to appeaſe all ſuch troubles as might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue either for Religion or otherwiſe: But the whole was referred to Ausbourge. Hereupon the Landgraue hauing demaunded, and receiued pardon, and promiſe that he ſhould not remaine priſoner, was ſtayed and commaunded to follow the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, after that he had accompliſhed all the reſt of the conditions.<note place="margin">Great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes which the Emperour had of the Germaines.</note> For which <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> and <hi>Brandebourge,</hi> being his ſuerties for his libertie grew in great rage; ſo as the Emperour to defraye the expence of his warre got, what with theſe ranſomes, and otherwiſe among the Catholiques, and Lutherans aboue ſixtene hundred thouſand crownes, and well fiue hundred peces of Artillerie, which hee ſent into Spaine, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Milan, and the low countrie.</p>
            <p>The Emperour after theſe victories aſsigned a day firſt at Vlme,<note place="margin">The Emperor would haue the Councell remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bolonia to Treat.</note> then at Ausbourg to accord points in Religion, reforme the Iuſtice of the chamber, &amp; obey the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The Palatin, <hi>Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Brandebourge</hi> would not conſent to any but in place free and ſure. In the end, that thereby they might the ſooner get the Landgraue out of priſon they accorded one, and by their example, the more reſolute Citties, by writing graunted ſomewhat of their demaunde: So as the Emperor being very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thereof, made great inſtance towardes the Pope, that hee woulde remoue the Councell to Trent from Bologne where he had appointed it to be held 1544. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vnholſomnes of the aire ſaid <hi>Hieroſme Fracaſtor</hi> who monthly had a great penſion from him. And vpon the difficultie which the Pope made therein, hee ſent <hi>Mendoza</hi> to proteſt of his parte before the Pope, and the reſt of Bologne, that hee held of no account whatſoeuer ſhould be there concluded: declaring that he would prouide thereto well enough, by a lawfull conuocation of the eſtates of Germanie, 1548 which were of his very opinion being aſſembled at Ausbourge. And further for that he would not haue the Councell to bee cleane in diſpaire of being held, the delaying thereof ſo much importing him, when as power was giuen vnto him to chuſe the Collocutors, Iudges, and witneſſes, he tooke <hi>Iules Flug</hi> Biſhoppe of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, <hi>Michael</hi> of Sidoine, <hi>Iohn Alebe Agricola,</hi> who 18. yeares before had beene a Lutheran, <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Brence,</hi> who very ſecretly wrote a Booke of Religion, and after they had againe peruſed and corrected it, preſented it vnto him: But <hi>Bucer</hi> finding many things contained therin, refuſed to ſigne it, ſaying that the Popes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was there manifeſtly confirmed, and ſince that in like ſorte they added ſundrie other things: So as both the Pope and Proteſtants alowed of it, albeit ſmall reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was had therein of any ſuch Articles as were generally receiued of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. <hi>Romee</hi> generall of the <hi>Iacobins</hi> wrote againſt it at Rome, and ſo did <hi>Robert</hi> Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21992:32"/>
of Auranches in Fraunce, for that this booke permitted marriage to Prieſts, and the Supper vnder both kindes. The Emperour notwithſtanding preſſed the eſtates hard to ſticke faſt vnto it, and not to innouate any thing either in their preachings or writings to the contrarie, attending the decree of a Councell. Afterwards the fiftenth of May the Archbiſhop of Mayence cheefe of the Electors, thanked him for his ſo great care of the publike, in the name of them all, and ſaide that all ought to obey his decree: The which he accounted as a common approbation, and woulde not for euer after admit of any other reaſon or excuſe to the contrarie, whoſoeuer would ſay that they had not conſented thereunto: In ſort that he cauſed it to be imprinted both in the Latine, and vulgar Germaine tongs. Fower daies after he beſought the eſtates to contribute by hed, towardes the remedying of ſuch inconueniences, as either for Religion or otherwiſe might fall out in the common wealth, and that the money might bee reſerued as a publike treaſor in ſome places fitteſt for that purpoſe, to haue ſuccours readie at neede: and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> required as much to releeue him againſt the Turke the fiue yeares of truce being expired. Afterwardes the Emperour ſomewhat and ſuperficially reformed the ſtate of the Church about the end of Iune 1548. and cauſed a Booke to be imprinted: <hi>Maurice</hi> departing from Ausbourge about the end of 1548. went into his owne countrie, where his eſtates vrging him with his promiſe to maintaine among them the pure confeſsion of Ausbourge, in the end hee cauſed to be made a forme of Religion which all ought to holde: from whence great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale aroſe. All the Princes and Cities except Breme, and Magdebourge conſented to the decree of Ausbourge, an occaſion that the latter was by the Emperour expoſed as a pray to all ſuch as would warre vpon him in the yeare 1549. Now as this decree of Ausbourge was alreadie as it were generally receiued throughout all Germany, ſo greatly did the victorie and Spaniſh Garriſons of the Emperour, together with the Saxons and Landgraues impriſonment, aſtoniſh the people, at ſuch time eſpecially when there was an apparant chaunge of Religion thoroughout all the countries of <hi>Maurice,</hi> the miniſters of the Churches of Lubec, Lunebourg, and Hambourge confuted well at length the Booke and decree of Ausbourge, by another contrarie, which they cauſed to be put in printe, whereof <hi>Iohn Epin</hi> was the principall author. Shortly after the Doctors of Magdebourge, <hi>Nicholas Amſtroff,</hi> and aboue all <hi>Mathias Flaccius</hi> an Illiricque, borne in the Citie of Albonne, who ſince was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall authors of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie of Magdebourge, and <hi>Nicolas Le Cocq</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues ſtoutly againſt them of Witemberge and Lipſa, and condemned them in ſundrie printed Bookes as diſſemblers, ouer ſimple, to timorous, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and meane things how they had made a high way to the papiſticall Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the which at the firſt proceeding from a good beginning, grew in ſimplicitie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſuffered it ſelfe to corrupt thorough a diſordinate lycence of ſuch thinges among the Chriſtians of the primitiue Church: who ouercome by little and little, with to great a feare of diſpleaſing, and roundly reſiſting ſuch as at the firſt woulde bring in their fantaſies for ſure rules of Faith, in the end cleane marred, vnder a Maske of things indifferent and ſuch like humaine traditions, the true and pure worde of God. For concluſion they ſet downe this rule, that all ceremonies and faſhions, how indifferent ſoeuer they may be of themſelues, are no more neare at this preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the vertue, opinion and neceſsitie of ſeruice is now annexed thereunto, and that the occaſion of impietie is yeelded thereby. <hi>Illiricque</hi> one of the authors of this learned and laborious Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, had beene certaine yeares an Auditor and Diſciple of <hi>Melancthon:</hi> but in this different, retyred himſelfe to Magdebourge:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21992:32"/>
and cauſed a Book to be imprinted wherein he rendred the reaſon of his act. They of Hambrough wrote likewiſe to them of Witemberg, &amp; eſpecially to <hi>Phillip Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> making a Catalogue of ſuch things as they termed Neuter, or indifferent, &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe what might bee receiued, and together prayed them to write openly of their ſide, what they would haue comprehended vnder that name, to the end men might agree on ſomwhat, &amp; follow it without varying. And for feare leaſt the name of Neutralitie might giue occaſion to ſundry other errors, which by little and little might bee engraued in the braines of men, <hi>Melancthon,</hi> a man ſweete; fearefull,<note place="margin">Melancthons anſwere</note> and a great enemie to all ryots, anſwered among other thinges that ſome ſeruitude might well be borne, prouided that it were without any impietie.</p>
            <p>Now not to long to leaue behinde, the perſecution of the Catholikes againſt the Lutherans in the Realme of France,<note place="margin">Perſecution of Lutherans.</note> K. <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeing at Paris the 19 of Nouember 1549. the Edicts of his father very euill executed by the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Eccleſiaſtical Iudges which was complained of vnto him (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tending with the ſoueraigne courts &amp; other Iudges of their natural iuriſdictions &amp; powers) ordained the better to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme himſelfe to the title of <hi>Thriſe-Christian:</hi> that the Royal iudges ſhould take knowledge, ioyntly of the ſaid faults as the caſes ſhoulde offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: as touching the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; decree only, after hauing well executed the decree, &amp; examined the accuſed, they ſhould deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to the Church, to iudge of the errors, or ſimple hereſie, in caſe it proceeded rather of ignorance, error, &amp; humaine frailtie, lightnes &amp; britlenes of the tonge of the accuſed, then of meere malice or will to cut himſelfe off from the vnion of the Church: and in caſe together with hereſie were found any publike ſcandall popular commotion, ſedition, or other crime importing any publike offence &amp; conſequently in caſe priueledged, then to be tyred by the Royal Iudges, &amp; of the Church together.

And for that the Iudge Eccleſiaſtical had not the ſeaſure of mens perſons out of their Pretoire, for the aide wich the one Iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice ought vnto the other, it was now giuen by priueledge vnto him, &amp; as far as ſhould pleaſe him, that in this crime only he might cauſe, vnder his authoritie, by their ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, to be put in execution the decrees of ſuch areſt of bodies as ſhold be iudged by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without asking any permiſſion of any ſecular Iudges, for feare that in delaying, the accuſed might be aduertiſed therof, &amp; ſo eſcape, &amp; if the eccleſiaſtical iudge ſtood in need of any aide; it was enioyned to all officers Royal to execute the Eccleſiaſticall decrees, without taking any knowledge of the cauſe. And in caſe the accuſed, or any ſuch as it ſhould bee decreed againſt, ſhould abſent themſelues, it was ordained that the Iudge Royall, within three dayes ſhoulde proceede againſt them by ſeaſure of their goods, that the accuſed ſhould bee deliuered vp to the iudge of the Church, to bee proceeded againſt as aboue ſaide. Afterwardes vpon the engroſing of this Edict in Parliament at Paris the twentie nine of Nouember, the Court ordayned at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Proctor generall, that vppon the plight ſhoulde bee ſet downe at the charge, that the Iudge Eccleſiaſticall ſhal not condemne any man, for crime of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, be he lay or Clarke, in any pecuniarie fine: &amp; further that when in crime of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie he ſhall haue giuen any iudgement, either of perpetuall priſon, or otherwiſe hee ſhall no more in the ende of the condemnation vſe theſe accuſtomed wordes, <hi>Salua miſericordia Domini:</hi> And that forbidding ſhoulde bee made as well of the one, as the other.

               <note place="margin">Diet of Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourge.</note>Hereupon the 27. of Iuly the Emperour began the day of Ausbourge, propoſing there to continue the Councell, to keep the laſt decree of Ausbourg, to puniſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, &amp; reſtore the iuriſdiction and goods of the Church. But <hi>Maurice</hi> declared by his Embaſſadors, as it were alone againſt all the reſt, that he could not avow the councel except all begun a freſh, and that the Diuines of the confeſſion of Ausbourg might bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hard, with power to decide the matters, that the Pope ſhould not ſit as chief, but ſubmit himſelfe to the Councell, that he ſhould abſolue all Biſhops of their oth made vnto him, to the end they might freely deliuer their minde.

Hereupon Pope <hi>Iuly</hi> aſſigned the Councel at Trent the firſt of May 1550 by his Bull which he ſent vnto the Emperour.

This was during the fower Seſſion, in the yeere of grace 1432. <hi>Maurice</hi> then being thereof aduertiſed by his people, ſollicited the Emperour, &amp; earneſtly inſiſted vpon the ordinance of Baſle, both as being the laſt, &amp; moſt conuenient for that time.

The ſame very day that thoſe which had beene beſiedged went out, which were 2000 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and 130 horſe, <hi>Maurice</hi> cauſed fiue enſignes of Fanterie to enter in, and the next morning himſelfe entred the Citie with his Cauallery. The Senate went out to meet him, to whome he cauſed an oath to be miniſtred to become true to the Emperour, th'empire and himſelfe, afterwards hauing left a ſufficient Garriſon, he cauſed al the reſt to voyd. That doone hee ſent for the preachers, and greatly complayned by his Councellors <hi>Facius, Calebric,</hi> and <hi>Mortiſe,</hi> of the iniurie which they had doone vnto him, in little Bookes, and Pictures imprinted by them, as if he had beene one reuolted from the Doctrine of the Goſpell, &amp; had made war againſt the Citie for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant profeſsion of the truth. Wherefore he ſaid, he had iuſt cauſe to be reuenged of them if he would follow his owne affections, but he quitted all to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring from thence forward that they ſhoulde exhort the people to amendment of life, &amp; to beare reuerence to the Magiſtrate, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded alſo that they ſhould make publike praiers for the Emperour, for himſelfe, and for all other Magiſtrates. He ſaid further that the Councell was then held at Trent, to which he would preſent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true doctrine, as well in his owne name as of al the reſt of the Princes &amp; eſtates, that they ſhold pray to God then to proſper the enterpriſe, &amp; take heede here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after from proceeding in like iniuries as they had accuſtomed. The miniſters after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conſulted together anſwered, that it was not they themſelues which had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe Pictures, &amp; yeat they could not eſteeme them worthy of any reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that it was not to be denied, but ſince three yeares laſt paſt many of his Countrie were reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure doctrine; beſides that it was an eaſie matter to proue how the Cittie had beene beſieged for the Goſpels ſake, if they would onely regard but who were the firſt authors of the warre; that they had euer doone their dutie in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing of the people, which they would in like ſort doe euer after: as touching the Councell which was aſſembled to deface the truth, and in which the Pope was as cheefe, that was not lawfull for them to make any other praier vnto God, then that it would pleaſe him to breake in ſunder, bruſe, and ſcatter their deuiſes &amp; imaginations, for nought could they elſe attend from thence then all my miſchiefe. The Articles of compoſition were then publiſhed. But it is certaine that they were put in good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their libertie &amp; Religion: Beſides that <hi>Maurice</hi> choſe rather, that the towne ſhold be yeelded to him then to the Emperor, as the iſſue afterwards declared. Now the end of the miſeries of Magdebourg, was the beginning of a war to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who had beene the authors of their afflictions as we wil tell you. In the meane while that <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> remained in the towne, he ſufficiently open himſelfe, &amp; gaue out that it ſhold coſt him his life, but he would ſet his father in law at liberty: yea ſo far as the next morning he did not ſticke to tell it franckly to one which was talking with him. He had before ſent his Embaſſadors to the Emperor, for the deliuery of the Landgraue, hauing aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated vnto him the K. of Denmarke, &amp; ſundry Princes of Germanie as we will ſhew you, being reſolued to proceede therein by force, if he could not otherwiſe obtaine it beſides that he had already made a couenant with the K. of France,<note place="margin">Embaſſage from the king of Fraunce to Maurice.</note> who had ſecretly ſent thither <hi>Iohn de Ferſne</hi> B. of Bayonne. Who hauing a long time negotiated in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many had good vnderſtanding of the tong. But it ſeemed, that the Emperour made very ſmall accounte of all theſe matters, and dreamed of nothing elſe then the warre of Parma, and Councell of Trent.</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21992:35"/>Hereupon the children of the Landgraue wrote againe to the Emperour for the deliuerie of their father, whereof they would faine ſee an end.

                  <hi>You know moſt mercifull Emperour, in what paine remaine at this day the moſt excellent Princes Electors</hi> Maurice <hi>and</hi> Brandebourge <hi>for the detaining in hold of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, a matter happening vnto them beyond all expectation, ſuch time, as thorough a ſingular affection which they carried vnto you, by reaſon whereof they were deſirous to prepare vnto you the way to an eaſie and notable victorie, they ſought nought elſe then to eaſe you of a great charge by a long warre, and reſtore the Countrie to peace and tranquillitie. For which reſpect they haue ſo often bene ſuters vnto you, as wel in their proper perſon, as by their Embaſſadors, that it might pleaſe you to regard them, and releaſe the priſoner: your anſwere to their laſt Embaſſador was, that you could not doe it vntill you ſaw the iſſue of the day prefixed to bee held, beſides that you made no other promiſe, but that he ſhould not alwaies remaine captiue if he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> cpt the accord: But for ſo much as they being buſied about other affaires, haue not beene able at the ſame day to bee in perſon themſelues, they againe ſollicited you at Ausbourge, by their Councellors and reiterated letters. In anſwere whereof you wrote backe vnto them the reaſons of your conceiued diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt him, pronouncing the Princes abſolued of their obligation towards the children of the Captiue. Wherefore they determyned to importune you in the like againe. And had come themſelues in perſon, had it not beene for what you know, they were both of them employed in the warre of Magdebourge, beſides that</hi> Brandebourg <hi>himſelfe was ſicke, which was the cauſe that they haue giuen vs in charge, to declare vnto you for the firſt point. That when you did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine that the Landgraue ſhould yeeld himſelfe vnto you vpon condition, they vnderſtoode your intention by the B. of Arras, which was, that he ſhould receiue, and keepe ſuch conditions, as you had propoſed and imparted vnto them. If it ſtoode a matter needfull to perſwade him to yeelde himſelfe in ſuch ſort, it was as needfull to declare vnto him that he ſhould not bee kept as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, nor worſe dealt with then the treatie of peace contained. The Princes then were his pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which your Councellers alſo well enough vnderſtoode. And where as the Landgraue ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that they ſhould declare vnto him ſome Articles of th'accord, and required that for the diſpatch thereof he might not be ſtayed aboue ſixe daies, it was graunted vnto him, after that the matter had beene propoſed to the B. of Arras. As touching the reſt of the points the Princes obtained therein more then they demaunded. And admit that in this proceeding matters ſhould not be a like vnderſtoode of the one ſide, and the other, &amp; that the Landgraue being come was impriſoned againſt the faith promiſed, yeat had the Princes neuer accuſed you for the ſame, had they not the ſame time, hauing bene graciouſly promiſed by your ſelfe, gon themſelues in perſon to Halle, &amp; ſet him thence, at ſuch time as the Landgraue approaching ſent vnto them to come vnto him to Numbourg. For at that time they ſpoake with you, ſignifiyng vnto you that they had perſwaded him to ſtand to the conditions propoſed, and that he was not far off, yea that if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you they would goe and meete him: In the meane time praying you that ſince hee yeelded himſelfe vpon their faith and aſſurance, he might be charged no farther, to which you condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. Now in the laſt diſpatch, there was no mention at all made either of priſon or detention, as your owne people the Biſhoppe of Arras and of Selde can verie well witneſſe. For the firſt had all the charge in this matter, and ſometimes called the other to aſsiſt him: for after that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21992:35"/>
conditions were accepted of, and pardon demaunded, the Princes ſtood fully aſſured, that he ſhuld be incontinently releaſed; which they had reaſon to imagine for ſundry cauſes. Firſt, for that the Councellors neuer made once mention of retaining him, which was a principall point in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which the</hi> Landgraue <hi>perceiued, and conſidered of aboue all. Moreouer, ſundry thinges are contained therein, which is not poſsible for any Prince captiue to accompliſhe, but for him onelye which is at libertie. After that he had beſought you pardon, you remitted his fault, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to reuoke his baniſhment, and giue him letters of reconciliation, beſides that you receaued pledge and aſſurance, wherein it was ſet downe, that if he did not perfourme the accord, the people ſhould deliuer him vp vnto you, and the pledges ſhould by force of armes conſtraine him to do his dutie. All theſe things certes, had ſerued to nothing, and had beene meere ſuperfluous, if they had thought he ſhould haue endured corporall puniſhment: but they imagining nothing leſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering eſpecially that the Councellors neuer made men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Such was their intention, which was ſince more confirmed, when after great requeſt the Duke of Alua inuited them to Supper at his houſe with the</hi> Landgraue. <hi>It was not poſsible for them to conſter in ſo ill a ſence, this ſummons and hoſpitalitye (conſidering the cuſtome and faſhion of the Princes of Germany) that he ſhould goe into the D. of Alua his houſe, as into a priſon: and that they ſhould goe with him ſide by ſide, and beare him company thither, which had they neuer ſo little made doubt of, who can imagine what they would haue done? for conſidering how they are Princes of Germany, and alſo Electors, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from right honourable familyes, neuer would they haue bene a meanes that a Prince of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent houſe, both their allie and freend, ſhould haue bene brought to ſuch a banquet to fall into ſo great troubles, and that they ſhould leade him as captiue, and they were no whit at all made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to the fact, vntill after ſupper when the D. of Alua tolde him, that hee muſt remaine in the Caſtle as in priſon: howſoeuer the matter was, they went to worke with a good meaning, as we ſayde in the beginning; and for ſo much as they haue plighted their faith, you may well perceiue how hard and greeuous a matter it will be both to them and their children, if after hauing bene often put in minde of their promiſes, and after caution giuen, the</hi> Landgraue <hi>he detayned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: you perceiue likewiſe (moſt puiſſant Emperour) you, who deriue your race from the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, (conſidering that the Children of the Captiue Prince purſue their right, &amp; preſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to redeliuer him vnto them, according to the condition of the bond) what becommeth them to doe according to the ancient cuſtome of the Nobilitie of Germany, for to preſerue their honour and good reputation, and how they ſhould be inexcuſable towards all the reſt of the Princes, when the power of citing ſhould be taken from them, or the inſtrument of the bond, in ſuch forme as remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in their handes, that if perchaunce the</hi> Landgraue <hi>who neither is priſoner by faith giuen, nor by compoſition, but by occaſion before ſpecified, through the griefe and impatience of his ſo long reſtrainte, haue ſought ſome meanes to eſcape, and that his men haue attempted ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Guardes, the Princes beſeech that it may turne no waies to their damage: but for that by reſon of the obligation they are in ſo extreme diſtres, out of which you alone after the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God, are able to deliuer them, and that you are moſt certaine how they ſtand enwrapped in theſe inconueniences; beſides that you ſtand fully aſſured of their good affection, loyalty, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for that in your aduerſities they neither haue ſpared their goods, nor bloud for your profit, according to the example of their anceſtors, they beſeech you as much as is poſsible, that you will ſuccour them in deliuering of the priſoner, and that therein you weigh not ſo much the fact of the</hi> Landgraue, <hi>as their perſons who holde you in ſingular reuerence, conſidering cheefelye that many of their families haue neither ſpared goods or liues for your anceſtors, and for the houſe of Auſtria and of Burgundie: and if perchaunce you feare that when he ſhall be at libertie, he will breake the accorde, you doe very well when the matter ſhall proceede ſo farre, but the Nobilitye
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21992:36"/>
and people of Heſse ſhall promiſe the contrary vnto you by oath, and as the Princes haue made themſelues pledges, ſo if you deſire any further aſſurance they haue often offred it, and do at this preſent, hauing giuen power vnto vs to doe as much with you: as touching ſuch conditions as they haue bene able to accompliſh, they doe not thinke that ought is lefte remaining; and when you ſhall know the cauſe for which their fortes haue not beene ſo ſoone raiſed, they make no doubt but that you will eaſily excuſe and purge the children of the captiue: if there reſt any other thing they will in euery reſpect employ themſelues to content you. Therefore if they, their Fathers or Grandfathers, haue euer done ſeruice to your ſelfe, to the Emperour</hi> Maximilian, <hi>or any your anceſtors, or if you think that in time to come they may pleaſure you in any occaſion, they beſeech you affectionately that you ſuffer them to taſte ſome fruite thereof, and that you will cauſe them to ſee ſome effect of the hope and promiſe, which you gaue them firſt at Halle, ſecondly at Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, and thirdly at Ausbourg: to the end in time to come they may haue the greater courage to honour you, being able to glory in that the fidelity and ſeruice which they haue done vnto you, hath bene by you acknowledged according to their deſerte, if they be refuſed, you may well thinke (excellent Emperour) what inconueniences will enſue, when they ſhall be enforced to appeare and approue their innocencye: but they hope well that you will regarde their praiers, which they will receiue for a ſingular benefite; and as well they, as the</hi> Landgraue <hi>with his children and alliance, ſhall for euer endure all paine to acknowledge it. And forſomuch as this matter tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſo neerely their honour, they haue ſolicited the reſt of the Princes to entreate with them, whoſe Embaſſadours you ſee heere preſent, to the end that what themſelues haue not bene able to obtaine at your hands vntill this preſent, either by praiers, meſſages, or letters, theſe here may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by their credit and fauour, beſeeching you to take it in this parte.</hi>

               </q> The King of Denmarke in like ſorte had ſent his owne Embaſſadour, who made the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>The Emperour made anſwere certaine daies after, that the matter was of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and required ripe deliberation, and for ſo much as he was aduertiſed that <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> purpoſed to make his repaire very ſhortlye vnto him for other matters of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in ſorte as hauing written vnto him he attended him dayly, hee would defer it vntill his comming, hoping that the matter might then be entreated of moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly in his preſence, for their partes they might returne again to their Princes, and tell them as from him, that he would well carry in remembrance their demandes, and ſo guide himſelfe in this action, that they ſhould well vnderſtand that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation caried great weight towards him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Maurice</hi> not able to picke any certainty out of all this, and cauſing himſelfe in the preſence of many to be importuned by the <hi>Landgraues</hi> children, who threatned to put both him and <hi>Brandebourg</hi> in ſute for breach of promiſe, had no ſooner reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the Embaſſadour of Fraunce, (whoſe charge euery man was almoſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of) of what ſuccour he was to draw thence, then he determined to make open warre againſt the Emperour, but for all that, the better to couer the fainednes of his intents, he ſent his deputies to Trent, to demaund ſuch another ſafeconduct as the Bohemians had at Conſtance, that the Pope ſhould ſubmit himſelfe vnto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and acquite the B. of their oathes,<note place="margin">Maurices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds at the councell.</note> that all Nations might haue free acceſſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that whatſoeuer had beene decreede before the comming of the diuines ſhould be cancelled. <hi>Srasbourg</hi> and the D. of Witemberg his Embaſſadors ſaide as much. This comming of the Embaſſadours, and the promiſe which he made ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after to be with the Emperour, tooke away all ſuſpition of warre, for the very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour wrote to the Archbiſhops of Mayence, Treues, and Cologne, to leaue Trent, and to goe home and defend their Countries from ſuch ſouldiers as had bene retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the ſiege of Magdebourg: and as the Emperour had in like ſort prayed them to do, they receiued very curteouſly: <hi>Maurice</hi> his deputies giuing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, ſaying that they had ſummoned thither all Nations, that all were free there, but that reaſon and their dutie would by no meanes permit them to diſanull or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ought, and much leſſe to ſubmit the Pope to the councell. The Embaſſadours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hauing examined their ſafeconduct, found it different from that of the Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and after that they had haſtely read it ouer, they found the principal articles chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the reſt cleane omitted: for in the ſafeconduct which was giuen out to the Bohemians, there was among other thinges, that they ſhould haue power to decide, that in all differents they ſhold take for iudge the holy ſcripture, the practiſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, ſuch councels and interpreters as agreed with the holy Scripture, that it ſhould be lawfull for them to ſay diuine ſeruice in their houſes, in a tongue which they vnderſtoode, that nothing ſhould be proffered in contempt and blame of their doctrine, the firſt, third, and laſt of theſe points were cleane omitted, the ſecond which is the principall, was altogether altered: this being conſidered of according to the forme of the decree of Baſle, they preſcribed another ſafeconduct, and anſwered that it was not lawfull for them to exceed their commiſſion, which carried that they were not to take any ſafeconduct, but according to the contents of that at Baſle.

But hauing heard the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes and greefes of ſundry Princes, Lords, and States of Germanye, as touching the tirannie and violence which the Emperour vſed ouer them, vnder colour of reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting thoſe whome the diuerſitie of religion had ſeparated and diſioyned, of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of abuſes, and ouerrunning the Turke, a common enemye to Chriſtendome. And ſeeing that herein he went about nothing elſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to encroche vpon the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and make it ſucceſsiue to the houſe of Auſtria: for theſe conſiderations the K. remembring that he was deſcended from the bloud of the ancient <hi>Franks</hi> or <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> iſſued out of Germany, and the perpetuall alliance and amitie, which in all time had bene betweene the Gallique nation and the Germane, the which the Emperour and his Grandfather euer went about to breake, he could doe no leſſe then haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde thereunto, and prouide for ſuch miſchiefes as are offred themſelues on that part, as the Emperor ſhuld execute his plats and enterpriſes.

be the cauſe, greatly iniurying his own reputation, and doing wrong to that which he oweth to the ancient league betweene Gaule and Germany.

And that that was true, a man might ſee with his eye, how he had fleeced the Empire, the Citties, comminalties, and other places, as Gueldres, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trech, Cambray, and Conſtance, which he had made become proper to the Houſe of Auſtria: and that by a thouſand deuices he went about to encroche vpon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Treues, and the Dukes of Cleues and Witemberg, and cleane to ruine the principalitie of Heſs.

This diſcourſe and other matters finiſhed, he concluded that he had made an alliance with ſundrye of the Princes of Germanye, and that togither with them hee was reſolued to imploye both his forces and his perſon, for defence of the libertye of whole Germanye: without expecting any other recompence, then the honour, in hauing doone his dutye, and tyed vnto him ſo puiſſant a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Germane, of which this his deſire and pretence, hee gaue aſſurance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his oath, taking God to witneſſe, and ſwearing that in the woorde of a King, and faith of a Prince: and that in generall hauing no other intention, then to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the eſtates of Germanye from the oppreſſion of the Emperour, and of his: in particular, hee pretended to doe it in fauour of his moſt deare and moſt beloued Coſins, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Saxe, and <hi>Philip Landgraue</hi> of Heſs, detained in miſerable ſeruitude by <hi>Charles,</hi> whatſoeuer hee had promiſed or ſworne to the contrarye, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to get immortal praiſe as ſomtimes did <hi>Flaminius,</hi> for hauing affranchiſed Greece.

            <p>I will not paſſe any further without informing you of a moſt notable occurrence which happened in this time amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Prouencials, I haue before told you of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigeoiſe religion,<note place="margin">The Vaudois of Prouence how, when, by whom, and wherefore perſecuted as Heretiques.</note> and how by force the Albigeoiſe quitting of Fraunce, went to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in diuers cuntries of chriſtendom, eſpecially among the mountains of Sauoy, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont &amp; Prouence, where continuing the exerciſe of their religion, they were named Vaudois. Now for that in all times they neuer acknowledged the ſupremacye of the Pope, from whoſe doctrine theirs differed in many points, cheefelye after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and publiſhing of his writings, which they couragiouſly embraced, as neerer approching to their ancient doctrine, they were oftentimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and purſued, as Heretickes and Rebels to the Magiſtrate, ſo as with the zeale of the Cleargie, encreaſing the perſecution vpon all Lutheranes, in the yeare 1540. at the inſtance of the Kings Proctor in the Parlament of Aix in Prouence, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes of Merindol, were adiourned in the perſon of certaine named in the arreſt (which wee will recite) to appeare perſonally, according to which adiournement, the within named came to Aix to preſent themſelues to the Court.

Notwithſtanding one ſecretly and aparte aduertiſed them, that they were not to preſent themſelues to the ſaide Court, except they were ready, and prepared to endure to be burned, yea at little fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any forme or figure of triall: for that had already beene concluded of among them. With theſe ſpeeches the Merindoliens were greatly aſtonied, and more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when indeed they ſaw ſundry of their ſect to be cruelly murthered, hauing no other cauſe alleadged for their condemnation, but that they had ſpoken and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch matters, as had bene declared Lutherane, by the cenſures &amp; determinations of the Doctors in Diuinitye, which they of Merindal perceiuing, retired themſelues without euer appearing at the aſſignation, ſo as defaulte was pronounced againſt them, by vertue whereof the Court ordained an Arreſt, which euer after was called the Arreſt of Merindol, the tenor whereof was in this wiſe.

by way of acte and force, was againſt all forme and order of iuſtice, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the culpable, and innocente. Now it was ſo as this Preſident had put in light and publiſhed in print, a booke intituled <hi>Catalogus gloriae Mundi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Catalogus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae mundi, made by Chaſsane, and printed at Lions.</note> in which by way of paſtime he ſet downe the proceedings which he fained had ſometimes bene helde againſt the Rats, by the officers of the ſpirituall Courte of the B. of Authun, as if it were, that through all the Bailliwick of Lauſſois, there had beene ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titye and great multitude of Rats, that they deſtroied and eate the corne of all the Country, whereupon it was thought good that ſome body ſhould be ſent to th'offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Authun, to excommunicate theſe Rats, and that thereupon the Official hauing heard the plaintife of the Proctor fyſcall, ordained before that he would proceede to excommunication, that a warning ſhould bee giuen by order of iuſtice, wherby the Rats ſhould be cited at 3. peremtorye dayes, and for default of apparance then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, &amp;c. The three daies being paſſed, the Proctor preſented himſelfe againſt the Rats, and for fault of apparance obtained default: by vertue whereof he demaunded that they would proceede to excommunication: wherupon it was iudicially conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Rats ſhould bee prouided of an Aduocate to heare their defence, &amp;c. conſidering it was a queſtion of their totall rooting out and deſtruction. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſeruing his turne herewith, ſaide to the Preſident. Sir, remember the councell which you wrote in a matter of nothing, when as being the K. Aduocate at Authun, you defended the Rats, and declared that the time giuen vnto them to appeare in was to ſhorte, and moreouer how there was ſo many Cats in the villages, as the Rats had ſome reaſon to abſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp;c. with many other rightes &amp; paſſages alleadged by you, and amply handled in your book made at pleaſure. Now ſo it is Sir, as by ſuch a pleading of a matter of vaine importance, you haue gotten the brute to haue rightlye ſet downe the manner whereby iudges ought to proceede in criminall matters: now will you not learne right by your owne booke, which wil euen manifeſtly condemne you, if you proceed any further to the deſtruction of theſe pore people of Merindol? is it not as conuenient that they ſhould haue as much law and equity as you wil giue to Rats? Through theſe perſwaſions the Preſident was ſo much moued, that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently he reuoked the commiſſion which was giuen, and cauſed the men of war to retire who was come within one league &amp; a halfe of Merindol, whereof they of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol rendred thanks to God, comforting one another, and animating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for euer to retain the feare of God, and ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to his prouidence. The brute of this enterpriſe, and execution of the ſaid arreſt together with the patience &amp; conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of them of Merindol, grew ſo great, and eſteemed of ſuch importance, that it was not hid to K. <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſent letters to <hi>Langeay,</hi> who at that time was his lieutenant in the country of Piemont, to make dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enquiry of the truth of the whole matter:<note place="margin">Guillaume du Bellay.

And as touching the life &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of the ſaid perſecuted perſons, they made report that the greateſt part of the inhabitants of the country of Prouence, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that thoſe which were perſecuted were people of great trauaile, &amp; that ſince 200. yeares they retired out of the country of Piemont, to dwell in Prouence, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſee farme many hamlets deſtroied by the wars, and other deſolate places: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſo great labourers they were, &amp; ſo good husbands, that in the places where they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21992:41"/>
inhabited was great abundance of corne, wine, oyle, hony, almonds, and great cattell, ſo as the whole country about was releeued thereby, yea that before they came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in the ſaid countrie, Merindol was vſed to be let for foure crownes by yeare, and now it amounteth to aboue <hi>350.</hi> crownes yearely rent to the Lord: and that it was euen ſo in Lormarin, and ſundry other places of Prouence, which dad beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts and laide open to theeues, vntill ſuch time as they came thither to inhabite. They found likewiſe by information made in Prouence, that the Merindols &amp; other of the perſecuted, were a peaceable people, beloued of all their neighbours, of faire conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, keeping their promiſes, and paying wel their debts, without ſute or brabling, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, not ſuffring any to be in need, of great almes to ſtrangers, and other poore paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers according to their power. The Prouenaeals affirmed likewiſe, that they of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol, and the reſt might very well be diſcerned from all other of the country of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence, for that they could neuer be brought ſo much as to name the Deuill, or any waies to ſwear, if it were not in iudgement, or paſſing of ſome contract. A man might likewiſe know them for that if they were in any companye where laſciuious ſpeeche were vſed, or blaſphemy againſt the honor of God, they would incontinently depart out of the ſame: we know not any other matter againſt them, ſauing (ſaid they of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence) that when they go to the market or about the towne, they are ſo ſeldom ſeene go into the Minſter, and if they do chance to goe in, they ſay their praiers without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding of either he or ſhe Saint, and that in the high way as they paſſe by croſſes and images, they vſe no reuerence. The Prieſtes being likewiſe hard as touching the ſame, ſaid that they did not cauſe any Maſſe to be ſaide, nor <hi>Libera me,</hi> nor <hi>De Profundis,</hi> and that they neuer took any holy-water, and if any were giuen them at their houſes, that they would neuer ſay grandmercie to him that brought it, and they perceiued very well that they conned him ſmall thanks, that they neuer went on pilgrimage to gaine pardons, that they neuer made the ſigne of the croſſe when it thundred, but only loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp into heauen ſighing, and prayed without croſſing themſelues, or vſing any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-water, that they were neuer ſeene make any offring, either for the liuing or for the dead.

In concluſion they beſought the King to giue credit to their

ſaying, offering themſelues to proue it falſe, if ought elſe had beene otherwiſe repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt them, whenſoeuer it ſhoulde pleaſe him to giue them audience. In the meane time the Biſhoppe of Aix, and of Cauaillon, purſued the execution of the arreſt; ſo as it was ordered by the Court of Parliament of Prouence, that according to the Kings letters pattents, maſter <hi>Iohn Durandy,</hi> a Councellor of the Court with a ſecretarie, and the Biſhop of Cauaillon, with a doctor in Diuinitie, ſhould goe to the place, and perſwade the inhabitants of Merindol, and cauſe them to abiure thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which moſt plainely they ſhould make appeare vnto them, and in caſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted by the word of God to haue followed and lyued in errors, and hereſies, they would not make recantation, that then of all that had beene doone, Verball proces ſhould be made, to proceede againſt them as the Court ſhould thinke good. But as the Church-men were in hand with them to make them recant their doctrine, they refuſed, offering to proue it, by the word and truth thereof, and offering to renounce if they could be proued heretiques thereby. They were queſtioned with, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſimply: ſo as by little the perſecution, not the hatred ceaſed againſt them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vpon the ſuddaine death of <hi>Caſſane,</hi> the Preſident, of <hi>Iohn De Roma</hi> Monke a ſeuere inquiſitor, who woulde fill Bootes with hot ſcalding greaſe, and after make them to pull them on. Of which and ſuch like behauiors, <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond being aduertiſed, gaue commaundement by his letters pattents to the Parliament, that hee ſhold be arreſted, &amp; his proces made. But hauing warning therof he fled to Auignon, where being ryfled of his owne ſeruants, and from great wealth become a begger, he was tormented with ſo horrible griefes, that nothing could yeeld him any reſt. So as no man being able to endure the ſtincke of his vlcers, he deſired nought, but to dye, which he did. In the ende <hi>Iohn Minier,</hi> of Oppede, Preſident, neare to Merindol, and Cabriers, (the inhabitants whereof had at an other time made heade againſt him, and put him to his heeles) hauing giuen the King to vnderſtand, that as many of them being aſſembled as came to fiftene thouſand, they were gon in armes to take Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and to Cantoniſe it, beſides that all the Countries round about were in great danger of being loſt, being all Lutherans, hee obtained letters, to enable him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the arreſt, by meanes of the Cardinall of Tournon, and other, ſo as he prepared himſelfe to the execution of the arreſt againſt Cabrieres, Merendol, and twentie two Villages. Whereof they being aduertiſed, repayred again to King <hi>Francis,</hi> in the yeare 1544. to whom they gaue to vnderſtand how from the yeare 1540. his Maieſty hauing perceiued the euident oppreſſion, and nullitie of the ſaide arreſt of contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, had cauſed the execution thereof to be differred, forbidding there ſhould be any more proceeding in ſuch rigour. And how notwithſtanding many had oppreſſed them, and ment to oppreſſe them more, and more, briefly they preſented vnto him the whole proceedings as aboue ſaid. An occaſion that he reuoked the execution of the arreſt of contumacie, and all ſuch proceedings as had beene before doone, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by the Parliament as well from which, as from his Proctor generall, hee tooke away the Coniſance of the cauſe, vntill he might be informed by one of the maſters of requeſts of his houſe, and a D. in Diuinitie of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, whome hee had deputed to goe to thoſe places, to the end they might well and amply inquire of the life,<note place="margin">The proceedings vſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them of Merindol.</note> faith, and conuerſation of thoſe of Merindol, and the reſt. This reuocation was publiſhed in Parliament, and inſinuated to the Proctor general in the end of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober following. The Parliament at the inſtigation of Oppede, commaunded <hi>Philip Courtin</hi> Huſſer of the Parlament, to make great ſuite for the obtaining of the K. letters to execute the arreſt, and notwithſtanding the interdiction, the Articles and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21992:42"/>
were made by the ſaid preſident, with a requeſt ſigned by the Proctor generall; yea the purſute was made for money, which had beene ordained by the Parliament, for the charges of the ſuite: Whereupon <hi>Courtin</hi> did ſo much by his diligence, and ſubtiltie, that thorough the fauour of the Cardinall of Tournon, he obtained letters in the moneth of Ianuary following, vnder the name of the K.

               <hi>Iohn Minier</hi> cheefe Preſident, hauing receiued the letters ſent vnto him in Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 1545. which he concealed vntill the 12. of Aprill, aſſembled the Court, and there recited the K. letters, by which it was commaunded that the arreſt ſhould be put in execution, ſo as certaine of the Parliament were appointed Deputies for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Minier</hi> promiſed to aide them, for becauſe in the abſence of <hi>Grignan</hi> he was lefte his Liuetenant, in the gouernement of Prouence,<note place="margin">The war lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit of Minier vpon the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of arreſt.</note> he had before at the K. commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement leuied troupes of men of warre, to goe againſt the Engliſh, but he ſerued his turne with them againſt theſe. Moreouer he had ſent a commaundement to Marſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Aix, and Arle, vnder great paines to all ſuch as caried armes, that they ſhould put themſelues in readines, and march at their firſt call: there came likewiſe ſuccours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him out of the Countye of Auignon, a poſſeſsion of the Churches. Their firſt courſe notwithſtanding was not againſt Merindol, but ouer the Countrye neere to the towne of Pertuis, ſo as the 15. of April Minier accompanied with a number of Gentlemen and Captaines, came to Cadenet, in the time that ſome of his companie ouerrunne two Villages neer vnto Durance, where practiſing a thouſand pillages and inſolences, they put all to the fire and ſworde, except a great number of Cattell which they carried away with them, there was no leſſe done in other places. They of Merindol ſeeing all on a fire round about them, preſented a ſupplication to <hi>Minier,</hi> crauing onely liberty to depart in their ſhirts with their wiues and children into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, but hauing for anſwere that he would ſend them all to inhabite in hell among the deuils, they abandoned their houſes, and fled into the woods, paſſing that night neere the Village of S. Falaiſe in great fright. The inhabitants of the Village were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready determined to flie: likewiſe the B. of Cauaillon vice-legate of Auignon, had giuen charge to ſome Colonell to make a ſhort diſpatche of the worlde, ſo as the next morning they got ſomewhat further into the wood, for there was euery where dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger throughout: and <hi>Minier</hi> had forbidden vpon paine of death, that no ſoule ſhould helpe them, but that they ſhould be all alike ſacked whereſoeuer they were found. The like forbidding was made in all places round about, bordering vpon the Popes territorie: beſides that the Biſhops defraied a great parte of th'army: The poor pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants then marched on through a monſtrous vile way, carrying their little children vpon their ſhoulders, in their armes, or in cradles, yea ſome of their wiues following the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great with child. Being arriued at the place apointed, they found many who had ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues there, after hauing loſt all: but ſoon enough newes was broght them, how <hi>Minier</hi> had gathered together all his men of warre to come and followe them: This was towards night, an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that after a whiles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation, they took a ſodain and an haſtie deliberation, and for that they were to paſſe by hard and rude wayes, they left their wiues, daughters &amp; children, with ſome other, among which was one of their Miniſters: th'other went on to Muſsi, as they had agreede, hoping the enemy would take ſome pittie of ſuch a multitude, without weapon, and vnable to defend it ſelfe: Euery man may well geſſe what groanes and ſighes, what teares, what imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings they made one with another at the parting, hauing trauailed ſore all night, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21992:43"/>
in the end gained the toppe of the Mountaine of Lebron, they could diſcouer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a number of villages and farmes all on fire. <hi>Minier</hi> hereupon deuided his troupes into two partes, and for that he had vnderſtanding by a ſpye which way they of Merindal were gone, he went to the village and ſent the reſt to followe them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe men had entred the forreſt, a certaine <hi>Quidam</hi> of pittie being moued, ranne before, ſo as being at the brim of the Rocke, and hauing caſt two ſtones where he geſſed thoſe people reſted, cryed out to them that had repoſed themſelues, that they ſhould flye to ſaue their liues, albeit that he no waies perceiued them. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante two of thoſe that were gone to Muſsi, gaue them warning that their enemyes were comming, and then they made the Miniſter runne awaye, with the reſt which were left to garde the women, ſhewing to them a high way throughout the Forreſt, by which they might eſcape: hardly were they departed, but that the ſouldiers were come with faire naked ſwordes, and great howtes, crying that all ſhould paſſe by the point and edge of their ſwordes: notwithſtanding they put none to the ſworde. But after many inſolences, they led away the women bare both of victual and mony, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of doing worſe by a Capten of horſe, who by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce paſſed by, and threatned that they ſhould dy if they did the contrary: but commaunded them with all ſpeed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to <hi>Minier,</hi> ſo as the enterpriſe was cleane broken of: in ſorte that hauing left the women, which were aboue 500. they ruſhed on vpon the butyn, and cattell. <hi>Minier</hi> in the meane time came to Merindol, and finding it cleane voide of inhabitantes, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and burned it, after an horrible execution done of whatſoeuer was found therin, for hauing met with a yong lad, he made him be tied to an Oliue tree, and ſlaine with harquebuſe ſhot: from thence he went to the towne of Cabrieres, battred it with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and by meanes of Captaine <hi>Poulin,</hi> perſwaded the inhabitants to open vnto him the gates, and yeeld themſelues, promiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould ſuſtain no iniury: but anon after that the Souldiers became maſters, euery one was cut in peeces, without regarde of age, ſexe, religion, alliance, neighbourhoode, or any other reſpect, ſome fled into the temple, other into caues of the caſtle, but they were all drawne thence, and ledde through a medowe, where being ſtripped bare, they paſſed all by the ſharp of the ſworde, not onely men, but women, and of them ſome great with childe: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Minier</hi> made about 40. women to be encloſed into a barne full of hay &amp; ſtraw, where he ſet it a fire, and as ſome ſtroue to quench it with the winde of their gownes, and preuailed nought, other ran to the windowes of the barne, into which they were wont to pitch in the haye, with intent to haue leaped downe: but being driuen back from thence with blowes of Pikes and Clubs, they were all burnt the 21. of April. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Minier</hi> ſent one parte of the armye againſt La Coſte, they ſo no ſooner were departed, then thoſe were found which were thruſt together in the caue of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Cabrieres, then all cryed out againſt thoſe that were ſhut in the caue, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back thoſe which were gone to La Coſte, they made likewiſe as ſtrange a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, without reſeruing any one: eight hundred were counted for dead, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as within: ſundry infantes which were ſaued were rebaptiſed, that done <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> ſent his troupes to La Coſte: the Lord whereof had already perſwaded the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to carry all their armes into the Caſtle, and to raze the towne in foure places, promiſing vpon his credit with <hi>Minier,</hi> that no iniury ſhould be offred vnto them, he was beleeued and obeyed: but departed from thence to beſeech <hi>Minier,</hi> he was not farre vntill he found the army, which ſpared not to paſſe forward: at the firſt entrye they did nought to the towne, but the next morrow they gaue a more freſh aſſaulte, vpon a few that defended it, ſo as hauing ſet the fanebourges on fire, they tooke it at
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21992:43"/>
their eaſe, becauſe that many that were fearefull ſlunke away, and ſlipped downe by ropes, abandoning their companies, and the place ordained for their defence. In ſumme, the towne being taken and pilled, with great murther of all ſuch as were met there, they runne all to a garden neere vnto the Caſtle, where without any regarde they enforced the wiues, and maides which were retired thither with a great fright: yea hauing ſhut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a whole day and a night, they intreated them ſo inhumanely, as ſuch as were with childe and the yong maides died preſentlye after. In the meane time they of Merindol and their companions, wandring through the woods and rockes, if they were taken, as ſoone ſlaine, or ſent to the Gallies, ſauing thoſe which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of famine. About 25. were hidden neere vnto the towne of Muſsi, within a caue, but being diſcloſed they were all as well ſtrangled as burned, There was not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinde of cruelty that was not practiſed, ſome but very few eſcaped the ſlaughter, who ſaued themſelues at Geneue, and places bordring vpon it. Now for that the K. before continued the perſecutions and burning paines againſt the Lutheranes.<note place="margin">The princes of Germany write to the King of Fraunce in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſuch of his ſubiects as were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> In the moneth of May the Proteſtant Princes of Germany, beſought the K. by letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from Ratisbone, for his ſubiects who were ſo reſearched &amp; purſued for the ſame faith which they helde. And for that ſome made their owne peace, redeeming their life, their goods, and eſtates, by abiuration of their faith, they beſought him that that condition might be taken away, declaring how da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a thing it was ſo to wound and make ſeruile the conſciences of men. But the brute of ſo ſtrange an effuſion of bloud animated them the more, and offended many, which greatly abated the credit which the King had gotten throughout Germanye: no leſſe then in Zuizerland where the reformed ceaſed not as neereſt neighbors, to be mediators towards the K. that he would take pittie of th'eſcaped: but for a full anſwere, he ſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, that for iuſt cauſe he had commaunded that execution to be done, and that they had no more to doe with what he did in his owne country, or what puniſhment of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice he made ouer his malefactors, then he had to intermeddle with their affairs. See now how the will and nature of men changing with the affaires and reportes: King <hi>Frauncis</hi> ordained a puniſhment for the Authors of this tragedie: how his ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> carryed himſelfe in the execution thereof, and all that which followed, to ſerue for moſt remarqueable occurrences, which may poſſible happen to any eſtate.</p>
            <p>That which moued <hi>Henry</hi> 2.

                  <p>Our Proctour in our great Councell, appointed by vs Proctour in cauſes after mentioned, hath cauſed to be deliuered and tolde vnto vs, how in the yeare 1540. the 18. day of Nouember, there was a certaine iudgement giuen in our Court of Prouence, which they would call and terme the arreſt of Merindol, by vertue of which 14. or <hi>16.</hi> particular men therin named, inhabitantes of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol, ſtoode condemned for defaulte and contumacy, to be burned as heretiques and Vaudois: and in caſe they could not be apprehended, to be burned in picture, and their wiues, infants, and maidens, were defeated and abandoned: and in caſe they could not be taken, they were then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced baniſhed, and their goods confiſcate, a matter notoriouſly iniuſt, againſt al law &amp; reaſon. And albeit that the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ſaid Merindol were neuer heard nor called to their anſwer, yet by the ſaid iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it was ſet down that al the houſes of the ſaid Merindol ſhould be thrown down, &amp; the town made vnhabitable. And in the yere 1544. the ſaid inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts made their repair to the late K. of famous memory our father laſt deceaſed, whom God abſolue, &amp; others who were likewiſe helde for heretiques, declaring how againſt all truth they were tearmed Vaudois, and heretiques. They obtained letters of our ſaid late Lord and father, whome they had let to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how they were dayly troubled and moleſted by the Biſhops of the Countrie, and by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents and Councellors of our Parliament of Prouence, who had already ſued for their confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and landes for their kinsfolkes, minding hereby to driue them cleane out of the Countrye: beſeeching our ſaide late Father, that he would ſearch out the truth. Whereupon it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that a Maiſter of Requeſts and a Doctor of Diuinity, ſhould goe downe to thoſe places, and throughly enquire of their manner of liuings and for that the ſaid Lord could not ſo readilye ſend thither, he ſhould in the meane time take into his owne hands, all ſuch ſutes as were depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by reaſon thereof: and forbid all cognoiſſance thereof to the people of our courte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Prouence, the which euocation was ſignified to our ſaid court the 25. of October following: which ſtanding much diſcontented with the contents therof, ſent to the K. an Huſsier to purſue letters of reuocation, which were obtained the firſt of Ianuary after, by which vpon information made to the late Lord the King, how they had beene in armes, in great aſſemblie, forcing towns and Caſtles, pulling priſonners out of priſons, and rebellious to all iuſtice, keeping it in ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſaide late Lord permitted them to execute the Arreſtes giuen againſt them, reuoking the ſaide letters of euocation, in regarde of the relapſe hauing not abiured: And ordained that all ſuch as ſhould be found charged and culpable of hereſie, and the Vaudoiſe ſect, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. And that to that end the Gouernour of the Countrie, or his Lieuetenant, ſhould ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to imploy his forces, wherby iuſtice might be obeyed: which letters were not ſignified but kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the 12. of Aprill following, which was the day of Quaſimodo, on which day after dinner, the firſt Preſident Maſter <hi>Iohn Minier,</hi> cauſed the ſaid Court to aſſemble, and cauſed our Proctour to preſent the ſaide letters, and require execution of the ſaide pretended Arreſt, of the 18. of Nouember 1540. of which no mention was made in the ſaid letters, but only in generall termes of arreſts giuen againſt the Vaudois: and hereupon it was ſet downe, that the ſaid pretended ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould be executed according to the forme and tennor, making like errour as before. And that the ſaide Commisſioners already deputed, ſhould goe to the ſaide place of Merindol, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places requiſite and neceſſary for the execution thereof, and that all thoſe that were of the ſaide ſect ſhould be extermined, and ſuch as were taken priſonners ſhould be led into the Gallyes for a priſon: there were appointed for the executioners, Maiſter <hi>Francis de la Fond,</hi> ſecond Preſident, <hi>Honore de Tributiis,</hi> and <hi>Bernard de Badet</hi> Councellors, with whome likewiſe, M. <hi>Iohn Minier</hi> Preſident, went as Lieuetenant to our ſaide late Father, to giue as hee ſayde a ſtrong hand onely to iuſtice, and to that ſhould be needefull thereunto: and carried with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Alſo he ſet forth another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion in theſe termes; yee Captaines and Souldiers, who haue in charge to ruine and waſte the perſons &amp; goods of the Vaudois, touch not the tennants of the L. of Faulcon, who was his kinſeman, forbiddance was alſo made by ſound of trumpet, as well by the authoritie of the ſaid <hi>Minier,</hi> as of the ſayde <hi>de la Fond,</hi> not to giue either to eate or to drinke to any of the Vaudois, without knowing who they were, and that vpon paine of the Iibbet: by reaſon whereof many women, children, and olde people were found along the waies eating and feeding vpon graſſe like brute beaſts, and in the end dead for extremitie of hunger. After the ſaid cruelties and inhumanites thus committed and done, they ſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners to informe who they were which were ſuſpected of hereſie, and made a number be caried to the Gallies, by forme of priſon, where a great parte ſince is dead: other their inditements being made, they enlarged <hi>quouſque,</hi> ſauing vnto our Proctor more amply to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and other they condemned in little fines, other they purely and ſimply abſolued, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſubiects of the Lady Cental, as appeareth by the iudgements produced: and yet all their houſes ſhould remain burned, and their goods pillaged: for this cauſe the ſaid firſt &amp; ſecond Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the ſaid <hi>de Tributijs</hi> &amp; <hi>Badet</hi> councellors, ſeeing how euilly they had proceeded, and contrary to the tenor of the ſaid letters of our ſaid late Father, which required cognoiſance of the cauſe, ſeeing alſo how the people of our ſaid parlament of Prouence, had giuen iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to al right &amp; reaſon, the better imagining to be able to couer their faultes, aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the 5. of May following, and vpon the ſpeech &amp; report of the ſaid <hi>Minier</hi> &amp; <hi>de la Fond,</hi>

The ſame daye the Embaſſadours repaired to the King, with whom was the Cardinal of Lorrain, the Prince of Vendoſme, and the Conſtable, where they recited as much as had bene deliuered by them to the Conſtable, at two parlies, and preſented vnto him as much Oates as they had done before Wheate, and a little more Wine; beſeeching him that for the ancient amitie which the ſignorie of Strasbourg had with the King of Fraunce, and for his owne curteſie, hee would take in good parte their offer, the rather for that there was a great Garriſon within the Towne, called thether for feare of ſurpriſe, and a great number of Paiſants were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe retired thither out of the Countrie, which cauſed the Cittie not to be ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpare her prouiſion.

As touching his demaund of making an allyance betweene them, they beſought him to haue regarde to their honour and good renowne, for that they could not by any meanes perfourme, by reaſon of their faith, by which they were bound to the Empire; notwithſtanding they would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their endeuours to the eſtabliſhing of a publicke peace.

Theſe letters being receiued contrary to his expectation, and knowing well that the Queene of Hungary with troupes of men of warre, had taken Satenay, and burned whatſoeuer ſhe met without defence, iudging beſides of <hi>Maurices</hi> purpoſes as he thought good, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of his returne, ſo as hauing deuided his army into three partes, the better to conduct it with fewer diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, and to make it march by diuers waies, and yet arriue altogither at one place, he left Germany; but before his departure hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Princes Deputies,<note place="margin">The K. anſwer to the Deputies.</note> that he had obtained that, for which hee was come into Germany with all his army, for the Captiue Princes ſhould be deliuered which was the occaſion of the warre: hee had then attained glory enough, if euer it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that Germany ſhould ſtand in neede of him, he would neither ſpare trauaile nor expence, nor would faile to put himſelfe againe into all dangers, for to ſuccour them; at this preſent he would retire into his owne Realme with his armye, for hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that the enemy did ouerrunne his Countrie. As touching the complaintes of the poore people, he receaued great diſpleaſure thereat, but diſcipline can neuer be ſo good in a Campe, but that militarie licence will breede ſome damage; for his owne parte he gaue the beſt order that he was able, that no man ſhould be intereſſed, if not, yet the leaſt that might be, and that the offendors ſhould be rigorouſlye puniſhed: As touching that which they wrote of the Emperour, and of a peace, he referred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them; through his trauaile, diligence and proweſſe, Germany ſtode now freed from thoſe miſeries in which ſhe ſtoode enwrapped: henceforward it was for them to looke to it, that they did not villanouſly looſe that liberty, which he ſo honourably had rendred vnto them, he could not deny their demaund, on the behalfe of thoſe of Strasbourge, albeit that at ſuch time as hee was with his armye vpon their marches, many behaued themſelues inſolently and immodeſtly towards his people; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to entertain his confederates, and to haue a man alwaies in Germany, which might aſſure him of the true eſtate of the affaires, as they paſſed betweene the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles and the confederates, and the better to be aduertiſed of the Emperors intents, he lefte <hi>Du Freſne</hi> B. of Bayonne his Embaſſadour about <hi>Maurice,</hi> who did there as you ſhall vnderſtand, after hauing repreſented vnto you the eſtate, in which in the meane time ſtoode the armies of the Emperour, and of <hi>Maurice</hi> ioyned with his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, together with the conduct and laſt end of their enterpriſes; in which it ſhalbe an

neceſſary, ſaid he, that the lawes ſhould be examined at the very firſt aſſembly, <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> propoſed theſe things and ſundry other more, requiring to haue them amended, conſidering how they touched the Empire, and that the Empire might be reſtored to her antient brightnes, and that it might not be lawfull for other to ſcoffe them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them: the Commiſſioners after hauing conſulted together, iudged that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds contained nothing in them but great equitie, and yet to the ende the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours honour might be preſerued, and that himſelfe might the rather be perſwaded thereunto, they were of opinion that many matters which concerned the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publique eſtate might very well be reſerued to an imperiall day.</p>
            <p>There was alſo <hi>Du Freſne</hi> the French Embaſſadour, who made his oration in full audience of all the Princes,<note place="margin">The French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the 13. of Iune, ſaying: <q>
                  <hi>That in olde time and long before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the name of French was heard of among men, there had bene ſo great a conformitie of life betweene the Gaulois and the Almans, that at other times they were called by the Latins, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, as brethren to the Gaulois: but after that the French had ſeated themſelues in Gaul, the two nations were ſo vnited together, that it was one ſelfe ſame Empire, vnder the ſame Prince and the ſame lawes. Afterwards as in change of time the empire was transferred to Germany, ſo did the Saxons and other Emperours alwaies entertaine amitie with the French, for becauſe they were deſcended from the Kings of Fraunce: in ſuch ſorte as</hi> Philip Auguſtus <hi>cauſed to be engraued in letters of golde, that ancient alliance which was as it were cleane aboliſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough antiquitie, and to be ſet vp in the moſt holye place, and not without cauſe, for whileſt that this coniunction endured, the common welth of both the people flouriſhed, and the force of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many was ſo great, as it gaue lawes not onely to the Hungarians, Bohemians, Pollakes &amp; Danes, but alſo to the very Italians: and the Kings of Fraunce in like ſorte curious to amplifie Religion, did often beare armes againſt Sarazins, Turkes, and other enemies of Chriſtendome, through A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Affrica, and Europe, in atchiuing of moſt glorious victories. Since that, we are come in a more vnhappie age, when as ſome Emperours as it were engraffed in, and not of the naturall ſtocke of Germanes, and vnworthye of their eſtate, haue cleane abandoned this amitie of the Kings of Fraunce: whereupon there enſued great misfortunes in the Common wealth. But this ſoare was healed by the grace of God, by meanes of the noble families of the Princes of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg, out of which ſome Emperours deſcended, men of high renowne, and great freendes to the Kings of Fraunce, for the Father of</hi> Charles <hi>the fourth died in fighting for the King of Fraunce. The Princes of Auſtria haue bene in like ſorte affected, among whome</hi> Albert <hi>the firſt could not poſsibly be induced by any of the Popes promiſes or threats, to make warre againſt Fraunce, which hee recited to the end it might be vnderſtoode, how ill ſome of the familiars and and ſeruants to the moſt puiſſant emperour</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth order the common wealth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeking by all their trauell to diſioyne theſe two moſt excellent Nations the one from the other, but before this thorough their ſubtilties and wilines they haue preuailed ſo farre, as the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prince King</hi> Frauncis <hi>was condemned for an enemy without being heard. It is true that that redounded to their particular profite, but to the great dammage of the Common-wealth, for it may euidently enough be perceiued, how hard a matter it is to decay the liberty of Germanye, and to build their Realme to make it laſt ſo great and ſo long, as the amity betweene theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath endured, for becauſe at this preſent ſtanding in feare of the French armies, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede therein more ſlackely, and inſiſt not ſo liuely to impoſe their Spaniſh yoke: they be they for certaine, which haue obtained peace at the Turkes handes, by praiers and tributes, and who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Religion and obedience, haue brought a thouſand enormities and factions into Germany, which haue beaten her with her owne rodde, warring againſt her with her owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which haue drawne monie from all, and rendred the condition of Germany into ſo pitious an eſtate, as may be wel ſeene by the Spaniſh Garriſons, diſpoſed on the one ſide and the other, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21992:51"/>
haue vnfurniſhed thoſe places of armes where they were kept in ſtore, which haue made open the way to the examination of the treaſure, for it is growne to that paſſe at this day, that the ſeale of the Empire, and the iudgement of the Chamber, and the right or priuiledge of imperiall dayes, is in the ſleeue of the B. of Arras, for what meaneth this, to execute by way of iuſtice, or to baniſh in offring great rewardes to the murtherers? all thoſe, as for their maintenance, haue put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the wages of ſtrangers; I omit ſo many murthers, ſo many whordomes, pilferies, and ſackings of Citties, and aboue all religion; which now was handled of one ſorte, and now of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accordingly as the time ſerued. Certes whatſoeuer hath beene done ſince ſome yeares paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hath tended to no other end then to trouble the lawes of the Empire, or conſtraine or allure King</hi> Ferdinand <hi>by faire promiſes, as alſo to terrifie the Princes by feares and dreades, to the end the Prince of Spaine might be choſen Emperour: were it not rather to be wiſhed by men of valour, to dye then to ſee the light of the Sunne in ſuch miſeries and calamities? I doe not think that any man can be found ſo blockiſh or barbarous, that hee doth not feele himſelfe galled with theſe thinges. Therefore no man ought to maruell, if at the laſt ſome Princes haue bene found, and among them the Electour</hi> Maurice <hi>D. of Saxe, which ſtand reſolued to hazard their liues for the recouerie of the liberty of their common Countrie, and which finding themſelues too feeble, and not able alone to ſuſtaine the charge, haue demaunded ſuccour and alliance of the King of Fraunce, who cleane forgetting any miſlikes of the time paſſed, hath not onely employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto all his wealth and treaſure, but alſo hath not ſpared his owne perſon in a matter of ſo great conſequence: contracting an alliance with them, wherein among other thinges there is ſet downe, that they ſhall not make any accorde with the enemy, without the Kings good liking: and albeit that</hi> Maurice <hi>be bound thereunto, yet deſiring the proſperitie of the Countrie, and to accommodate himſelfe to</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>which did ſo earneſtly require it, he very lately beſought the moſt chriſtian King, to ſignifie vnto him, vnder what conditions hee would haue the peace treated of: that, to ſay the truth fell out otherwiſe then he hoped for, conſidering his benefite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them to haue beene ſuch and ſo great, that hee thought it fitter to entreate neerer hand, and not ſo farre off, of matters which ſo neerely concerned him: neuertheleſſe forſomuch as he euer preferred the publick weale before his owne particular, hee would deny nothing to a Prince his allie: wherefore if the ſoares of the common wealth might be healed as they ought, and that good aſſurance may be giuen that in time to come they ſhall not be refreſhed; if the Captiue Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be releaſed vnder the conditions ſet downe in the treatie, further if the ancient allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene Fraunce and the Empire, and the laſt Capitulation with Princes, may be ſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as that for euer they may remaine in force: if theſe thinges I ſaye may bee well brought to paſſe, he is ſo affectionate to the Common wealth, that not onely he will willingly accord to a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace, but alſo yeeld moſt humble thanks to God, that herein he hath aided you with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and ſuccours. As touching priuate matters, as the Emperour hath detained from him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things by force, and made warre vpon him without any iuſt occaſion; the King thinketh it a matter very reaſonable, that he which hath beene the occaſion of the iniury, ſhould firſte ſhewe the way of ſatisfaction. The King in truth no whit diſtruſteth at all of his owne power, nor yet of the equitie of his cauſe, and notwithſtanding hee will giue them to vnderſtand how much hee loueth peace; and how much hee deſireth to agree with them all, and with</hi> Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</q>

            <p>The Princes anſwered hereunto, that his diſcourſe fet from antiquitie,<note place="margin">The confederate Princes anſwere to the French Embaſſadour.</note> as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the coniunction of Germany and Fraunce, was moſt agreeable vnto them, and no leſſe that the King preferred the common wealth before his particular profite, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no refuſall to the confederate Princes accorde with the Emperour, for it is not onely the profite of one nation,, but of all Europe, which hauing beene turmoyled
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21992:52"/>
with ciuill calamities, tended to an euident ruine. As for the conditions which the K. demaunded, they doubted not but that they might be obtained, for the Emperour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bare good will towards the common wealth, both heretofore and in theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent troubles, he neuer vnderſtoode that the libertye of Germany was any waies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. There was likewiſe great hope that in very ſhort ſpace hee would ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie the Captiue Princes. As touching the renewing of their ancient alliances; the King well vnderſtandeth in his owne wiſedome, that a matter of ſo great weight could not be brought to paſſe in this aſſembly: notwithſtanding they greatly deſired that the amitie which euer had beene betweene the two nations might remaine firme and inuiolable: they likewiſe deſire aboue all the reſt, that the differentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the Emperour might be pacified, proteſting that therein they would neither ſpare trauaile not diligence whatſoeuer. But forſomuch as the K. ſaid that the Emperour did poſſeſſe ſundry places which appertained to him, and openly made ſhew of many which he would repeate; it ſeemed vnto them a matter very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that he ſhould declare what they were, for they were determined fullye to infourme the Emperour thereof, and to be a meanes in the cauſe. Further they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the King to take the ſame in good parte.<note place="margin">Familie of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg.</note> That which the Embaſſadour ſpake of the familye of Luxembourg grew vpon this: <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Luxembourg had a ſonne named <hi>Henry,</hi> who afterwards was the ſeuenth Emperour of that name, hee had a Sonne named <hi>Iohn,</hi> who by manage was King of Bohemia, and gaue ſuccours to <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> againſt <hi>Edward</hi> the third King of England, being preſent himſelfe in perſon at the day of battaile; but there remained hee, for that the Engliſhmen had the better. Among other he left <hi>Charles</hi> his eldeſt Sonne, who afterwardes was the fourth Emperour of that name, Father vnto <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> who both came after to be Emperours, and the latter was likewiſe King of Hungarie and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,<note place="margin">Albert of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</note> and ſolicited the councell of <hi>Conſtance Albert</hi> of Auſtria of whom he ſpake, was Emperour ſonne to <hi>Raoul</hi> the Emperour, who alwaies entertained good amitie with <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> King of Fraunce, albeit that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, enflamed him as much as poſsibly he could to make war. But it is now time to look back to the French.</p>
            <p>I haue tolde you how the King of Fraunce being come as farre as Strasbourge, with an armye of thirtie thouſand men, for the ſuccour of the Proteſtant Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, afterwards reſolued of his returne, vnderſtanding of the Peace concluded betweene the Germanes, had deuided the body of his forces into three partes, to make them to march ſundry waies the eaſier, and with leſſe diſcommoditie of victuals;<note place="margin">The Q. of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary cauſeth the K. army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</note> and eſpecially to encounter the ſooner the Q. of Hungaries army, which ſhe had to the borders of Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pagne. This Princeſſe knowing how the affaires of the Emperor her brother, went but euen hardly by reaſon of thoſe occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which I haue made you to vnderſtand: and aboue al that this French armye would proue a croſſe girde to his intents, determined to retarde the ſame by ſuch troupes as ſhe could leuy throughout the lowe countries, which would bee in ſuch ſorte able to preiudice the realme; as the K. ſhould be enforced to returne for ſuccour of the ſame; and ſo hauing ſolicited <hi>Martin Vanroſſe,</hi> the baſtard and Marſhall of Cleues ſhe cauſed him to come downe into the duchie of Luxembourg, with 3000. ſouldiers of Cleues, Valois, and Geldres,<note place="margin">The Imperials army in Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</note> aſsiſted with 600. horſe, all which being ioyned with Count <hi>Mansfielde,</hi> the gouernour of the Duchie, the Bailife of Auanes, the Gouernors of Cimetz, &amp; other chieftanes, made vp the number of 12000. Fantaſsins, &amp; 3000. horſe, with which they determined to enter into Fraunce, and there to doe the worſt they ſhuld be able; they

tooke Satenay vpon the Meuſe, by a Lorraine Captaines voluntarye deliuerye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which the Dowager of Lorraine had left there without other Garriſon; where ſuddenly they employed themſelues to repaire the breaches, and to reſtore it into his former eſtate, building of a bulwark behinde on the ſide of Dun le chaſteau, and a platforme towards La iuſtice. Now vpon the bruite that they ment to aſſaile Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franche, <hi>Bourdillon</hi> went in with ſeauenteene horſe, and the ſame night made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men at armes to enter in, with as many men and prouiſions as hee was able, but being aduertiſed how they changing of their opinion were determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Mouſon, he lefte <hi>Chaſtellus</hi> his Lieutenant at Villefranche, iſſued from one of the antient houſes of Burgundie, with ſuch full authoritye as the Queene, and the Admirall D'Anebaut had giuen vnto him to commaund there; and with the reſt of his company entred at breake of day into Mouſon, where <hi>Roche de Maine</hi> was with his company of men at armes, and the three hundred Fantaſsins of the Barons of Cerny; but if the cheefeſt ſorte did not agree, much more were the inhabitants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed through the feeblenes of the place, commanded by a high mountaine neere vnto it, notwithſtanding any rampire which they were able to make to couer it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the principall of the towne had already truſt vp their baggage; <hi>Bourdillon</hi> notwithſtanding hauing aſſured them of the Kings comming at hand, and hauing cauſed his cobbarde, and other more precious moueables to be brought in, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not to abandon them, they a little aſſured themſelues. The Imperials for all that being ſaluted with the Cannon ſhotte of Villefranche, and councelled not to remain there, crept along the riuer, as farre as the village of Brioles, where they burned the Church and the forte, then to Mont-faucon which they burned, and ſo deſcended into the plaine, to put men into the Caſtle of Boulandre, which they took, by ſtealth getting of victuals and prouiſions, which they carried to Satenay: from thence all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the riuer they ſacked ſundry villages as farre as Grampre, a little Towne vpon Aire, neere Chalons and Atigni, where they reſted: and vnderſtanding how the Admirall hauing put the Legionaires of Champagne in armes, and vnited the Zui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers with the French men of warre, approched neere; they ſet fire on Grampre, Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landre, and other places, to retire themſelues to Satenay, where they had intelligence that the light horſe of the Kings army who aduaunced forward, were already at Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg: an occaſion that to retire themſelues, they all abandoned it, leauing the moſt parte of thoſe of Cleues and Geldres, for the aſſurance of Yuoy, if any ſhould goe about to force it. King <hi>Henry</hi> in the meane time, who heard the complaintes of theſe miſerable Subiectes, the ſooner to haſten the reuenge,<note place="margin">The K. armie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> put out of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye almoſt all the ſicke perſons, and lefte the baggage vnder the conduct of the Earle of Arraine, and Viſdome of Chartres with their companies, and ſome light horſe, and Harquebuſers mounted, for the conueying therof into Metz, or any other place which they ſhould think more aſſured: afterwardes the diſcamping of the imperials being known, &amp; the immoderate diligence vſed at the retiring of his troups, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the duchy of Luxembourg was deliberated of and reſolued to annex it vnto the crown, as a proper ſucceſſion falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the houſe of Vendoſme, by the death of the Conſtable <hi>S.

Treues and Theonuille, ſeated on the ſteepe of a hyll, ſtrong enough for ſcituation and fortification, with a little Towne beneath it, vnder the tytle of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The Caſtle ſummoned made refuſall, for a number of Gentlemen, Ladyes, and other neighbours of reputation, were retired thither, imagining that the King would firſt employe his forces againſt Theonuille, and that at all aſſaies they might euer be receiued at an honourable compoſition after the firſt brunte. But the King contrariwiſe was councelled to attempte that, in reſpect of the victuals and prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the armye ſo much wearyed ſhould there finde, &amp; that the ſacking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might rather bee giuen to the Souldiers, how Theonuille was too ſtrong and well prouided,<note place="margin">What place the army was firſt to attempt.</note> to bee gotten in ſo ſhorte time, which they were not any waies to conſume but with aſſured profite, how thereby they ſhould looſe the occaſions of executing other thinges, how in the meane time they would fortefie the reſt of the places with all commodities: beſides how Theonuille ſtoode betweene Metz and that Caſtle, which they might ſo repaire, as the Garriſon of Theonuille ſhould be blocked in, and their prouiſions cleane ſtopped, which would be a meanes that in the end it ſhould likewiſe be rendred vp to the French, with leſſe charge, leſſe loſſe of time, and leſſe hazarde: ſixe Cannons were planted on the hill for batterye, two Culuerins battered againſt the wall, where there was but one groſſe ſquare tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a flanker, and the Portall which ſerued for another. After betweene the towne and the Caſtle was dreſſed a battery beneath, right againſt a great Towre and a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of the wall, ſo as they within beſieged, feeling the ſhaking of the Towres and walles, were not hard to Parley. But the Souldiers hauing the ſacking promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, fearing leaſt a Parley would cauſe a voluntary rendring, and neuer tarrying other volley of the Cannons, leapt into the ditches, which were deepe, high, and broad,<note place="margin">Roc de Mars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, battred, taken &amp; ſacked, by the French.</note> whereof ſome clambering vp, others mounting with their Pikes to the wall, while the reſt were with wood and fire at the gates, ſo greatly aſtonied the beſieged, that all retired themſelues into Caues, Chambers, Sellers, and other ſecret places, to ſhun death, which was euen before their eyes; eſpecially after that ſome French men hauing found and broken open the gate of a Poſterne which went out of the baſe Courte into the Ditch, had made themſelues to be perceiued and feared on al parts, for that as ſoone as being mounted, they gaue entrye to all the reſt, which had no regarde but to throwe downe, rifle, and take all. At ſuch time as the Earle <hi>Ringraue</hi> Collonell of the Germanes, who did not imagine the taking thereof vpon ſuch a ſoddaine, went to beſeeche the King in conſideration of all his ſeruices, to ſpare vnto him that place, the Lady whereof was his neere Kinſewoman, which the King graunted vnto him, commaunding <hi>Coligny</hi> to cauſe the Souldiers to retire. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mont S.

            <p>Whilſte that the King with promiſe of honourable entertainement receaued the Prince of Salerna, who greatly grew diſcontented with the Emperour, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable hauing vnderſtanding how the Earle <hi>Manfielde</hi> was gotten into Yuoy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Strinchant</hi> was Gouernour, ſent to blocke him in with two thouſand foote,<note place="margin">The Prince of Salerne quitting the Emperour commeth to the King.</note> and a number of horſe, to hinder any goings foorth or entries in: after the reſt encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there, the Earle ſhewing himſelfe a great husband of his prouiſions, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no ſallye to be made foorth, which proued not very hurtfull to the French.

Then hauing by diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues trauerſed all that Countrie; and being turned towards Treues, to fetche there a number of Souldiers which he had left there, he came downe to Pont Camouſon, neuer hauing for al that reſolued any thing with the B. of Bayonne, either of his own appointment, or pay of his people: albeit that the King had againe ſent back <hi>Lonſac</hi> vnto him for the very ſame cauſe; notwithſtanding he could conclude vpon nothing with him, training alwaies the effect in diuerſitie of demaundes, coloured with faire wordes, whereon it was a very vneaſie matter to laye any foundation, and therefore they entred into the greater ſuſpition of him, ſo as the firſt miſtruſt began to encreaſe more then before: wherefore with as much ſpeed as might be the King who hauing knowne the Emperours intents and preparatiues, had alreadye cauſed all his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, bandes and arriere bandes, and other new companies, to repaire vnto Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, made his Campe to aſſemble at S.

The which was found very ſtrange, and greatly augmented the diſtruſt which might be had of him.

And as touching the order of his mens liuing, hee ſhewed that he had alreadie ſetled his affaires, anſwering in the end with an aſſured reſolution, that he was a friend to the king, and an allie to the houſe of Lorrain, but hee meant that his ſouldiers ſhould haue wherewithall to liue, and take it where they could find it, in caſe of refuſall, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued what he had to do, and whether to retire himſelfe: yea, ſo far, as refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſuch monie as the Conſtable had ſent vnto him. Whereby they well perceiued how he was reconciled to the Emperor, by the practiſe of ſome.

Now the Emperor lying ſicke of his gouts, and as well for this cauſe, as for the importunitie of the time, his armie ſoiourning in the countye of Vaulges, with as great dilligence as was poſſible, they placed againe the French army at S.

Of the other parte the Duke of Aumalle was appoynted to accompanie him with two hundred men at armes, and fiue hundred light horſe, to hinder anie of his men from ſpoyling or ruining anie of the kings ſubiects. For during the three weekes that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> made his abode neere de Thoul vppon Mozelle, they vnderſtood of ſo ſtraunge diſorder, and moſt exceſsiue exceſſes, which his people dyd as well to the Nobles, as peſants and church men, that in the ende perceiuing howe the Duke of Aumalle, to whome they addreſſed themſelues, tolde them that hee was not able to haue anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon at his handes, albeit hee had certefied him thereof, they aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to kil and truſſe vp as many as they were able.

Shewing further, how that before he cold wel diſpoſe and appoint the ſiege of this ſo great a towne, and that his artillerie could be planted and prepared for the batterie, winter would ſo hardly bee come on, that it woulde be a cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting all his meanes, as well by reaſon of ſnowes, windes, raines, and extreame froſts, cauſing a great number of his ſouldiers to die, as through the difficultie which they ſhould haue to recouer victualls, beeing detayned and ſtayed backe by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and indiſpoſition of the time, as alſo in hauing them oftentimes bee met with, and taken awaie by the French. Beſides all that, together with the loſſe that myght fortune him to receiue there, ſuch and ſo great a ſhame, as hee would rather wiſh it had coſt him the crowne of his Empire, ſo as hee had not beene at all there. For after hauing combatted, and beene in part defeated by the furie and violence of the time, he ſhould finde beſides another enemie ſtrong and puiſſant, which attended but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an occaſion to ruine him for euer. This aduice though it were the moſt certayne for the Emperours ſecuritie, yet could it not by anie meanes bee receiued of him, for his ſpirite beeing pricked forward and ſolicited by an extreame deſire of beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, forgot all accidents and perils, to bee happily reſolued in the end of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point, whereby hee might knowe but how to bee reuenged of the King. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others it ſeemed beſt vnto him, firſt to addreſſe himſelfe to the towne of Metz, within which hee well knew were many of the principall Princes and great Lords of France: and that beſides, it was perfectly furniſhed and prouided with great ſtore of munition. Wherfore it ſeemed vnto him, that if by the ſurplus of the reſt of that yere, hee could worke ſo wel, as to be able only to recouer it, hee might eaſily by meanes of ſuch priſoners as he ſhould find therein, obtaine and get againe at the kings hands whatſoeuer he had taken from him, perſwading himſelfe that he would help himſelf with the French mens owne roddes and preparatiues to conſtraine them therto, and that being come once to the top, and hauing ſubdued this firſt and principall fortres, wherein was the verie flower of the French ſouldiers, hee eaſily promiſed to himſelfe the compaſsing of his leſſer enterpriſes. So as in the end the Emperour marched with his armie towardes the riuer of Moielle, neuer following for all that the right waie, as if hee had meant to deſcend towards Theonuille, and the Dutchie of Luxembourg.

The King made anſwere that hee liked his deuice very well, prouided that it were wiſely executed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too much hazard, and preſently hee commaunded <hi>Bourdillon</hi> to goe and ioyne with him with a hundred men at armes, and obey him wherein ſoeuer for his ſeruice hee would imploye him: whereupon hee came towardes him within three leagues, neere vnto which place, hee readily aduertiſed him how by the Kings commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all poſsible diligence he had made his repaire towards him, to obey him, beſeeching him to ſignifie his pleaſure, and what he was to doe. The D. of Aumalle anſwered him that he was maruelouſly contented at his ſo great diligence vſed, and that the Marqueſſe hauing already paſſed ouer the riuer of Muze, was ready likewiſe to goe ouer the other of Madon, to retire himſelfe to the Emperours Campe, and he knew not any great means how to follow him any longer: wherfore in breefe he determined to retire himſelfe to Thoul, to make warre againſt the enemie. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was the cauſe that <hi>Bourdillon</hi> ſtirred not from Blanieau attending his returne. Three daies after notwithſtanding the D. of Aumalle ſent his Trumpetter with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Marqueſſe, to ſuck alwaies ſome intelligence from him: but ſo it was as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him at the borough of S.

his diſpatch and returne. He contrariwiſe without making any anſwere at al to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, railed extreamely at the French, and wiſhing vnto them a thouſand curſes, he proteſted with great oaths, that before it were long he would bathe himſelfe in their bloud. So the Trumpetter was enforced to tarrie vntill the Thurſday before the day wherein the defeate ſhould be accompliſhed, as they tolde him and how that the morrowe after he ſhould returne with his anſwere: which came not to paſſe for all that: for that day all things being changed to the worſe, the Trumpeter was more rigorouſly entreated then before, led, bound faſt, wrong hard, and trained, as if how-erlye hee expected nought elſe then to be hanged or dye miſerably. Thus the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe had determined the next morrowe to take his way to the Emperours Camp, and there reſted nothing but to vnite and appeaſe ſome of his Captains &amp; Souldiers, who had no great minde to turne their face to take oath to the Emperor, in reſpect of the euill entertainment which they had found both at his hands and the Spaniards, in the wars paſſed. The 28. of October the D.D'aumalle being enformed of this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſlodged at the break of day, with al his Caualerie from the Port of S.

The D. of Aumalle ſeeing his cauallerie thus broken, and fled on all hands, greatly agreeued, and foreſeeing an vnhappy end to enſue this enterpriſe, willed <hi>Breze</hi> the Lieutenant of his company to retire, and the beſt way that he might be able to ſaue his company.

Vpon this occaſion, without making any greater loſſe, or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more trauaile to his men, he diſpatched that night <hi>Caſtellus</hi> lieutenant of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to carry the ſorrowfull newes to the King: and preſently ſent his Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the Earle of Vaudemont, to pray him to permit the bodies of <hi>Rohan</hi> and the Baron of Couches, to be buried within the Church at Nancy, as they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and others in like ſorte.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe <hi>Albert</hi> hauing now his hart puffed vp, and receaued farre into the Emperours good grace, tooke againe his waye on towardes Nancy; where hee had much ſpeech with the Earle <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> touching this defeate, for amidſt his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and pleaſant tales, hee laughed at the great hardines of the D.

he returned to encamp at Pont Camouſon on the other ſide of the riuer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anon the Emperour ſent vnto him a number of horſe to ſtrengthen &amp; aide him, vntill he might be ioyned to his campe, which was already aſſembled, and encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped about Metz. A little aboue the Pont aux Moras within the vynes, neere vnto an Abbey dedicated to S. <hi>Martin,</hi> was the quarter where the 13. of Nouember the Marqueſſe <hi>Albert</hi> went to entrench himſelfe, from whence hauing cauſed the D. of Aumalle to be dreſſed,<note place="margin">The Caſtle of Clermont in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne ſurpriſed by Chaſtillon.</note> he ſent him priſonner into Germanye to be kept in good ſuretie.

Some were ſlaine, and the reſt carried awaie priſoners. This misfortune fel vpon thoſe as returned from the caſtle of Aſpremont, thinking to haue taken the Earle there in his bed, to whom it happened ſo well, as at that inſtant he was at Saint Michael neere vnto the Duke of Neuers. For in ſtead of thinking to take, they were taken, &amp; carried awaie with ſome bootie. Such roads there and abouts were continued by the Duke of Neuers for the ſpace of three weekes, himſelfe beeing there ſometimes in perſon, which ſo ſore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noied and troubled his enimies, as they were inforced to forget the waie of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yea, by reaſon of theſe continuall alarums, the imperiall armie was oftentimes conſtrayned to remaine halfe a daie in battell, with great trauell, coldes, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities.

Afterwardes he ſent them to Captaine <hi>Andre de May More,</hi> a man of approued hardineſſe, to dreſſe of them companies as well of foote as light cauallerie. By them &amp; other ſpials the French were aduertiſed of the moſt great diligence and wonderful preparatiues which the Duke of Alua had made to addreſſe his batterie, the great plaines, the trenches, ſo ample, large, and deepe, as hath bin ſeene of long time, the great number of artillerie and munitions, the almoſt innumerable quantitie of baskets, which hee cauſed continually without anie reſt to bee made and filled, making no account of the life of thoſe miſerable vaſcadors, no more than of bruite beaſts expoſed to the mercie of the artillerie and counterbatterie of the towne.

Some other in like ſort durſt goe and naile theyr artillerie, and kill their canoniers vpon theyr peeces. The which the enemies notwithſtanding woulde not repute as a fact worthie either of them, nor of a valyant and magnanimious heart.

Now if the French by ſuch feates were deſirous to ſhew themſelues loyall ſubiectes to their king, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of honour, the Duke of Alua repoſed not leſſe of his part, who ſhewed himſelfe ſo deſirous and inflamed to render into the obedience of his maiſter the Emperour, that puiſant Citie, to reioyce him with the taking of ſo many princes, great Lordes, and valyant men as were there within, that not ſparing anie labor, nor the liues of his, he planted his batterie readie the twentith of Nouember, beginning to ſhoote at the defences, to wit, at that of the portall of the port Champenois, and of a bulwarke which is within a great tower, the which is towardes the riuer called La Tour D'En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen, and ſurnamed La Tour de Lanques, &amp; at a little Church being within the town, where there was a platform, in ſumme, they razed and ruined as much as they could, whatſoeuer might ſerue as they iudged to the defence of the towne. The ſix &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith he began to cannon it with ſuch an impetuoſitie, as in the memory of anie liuing man was neuer heard the like, hauing in front fortie great peeces, which carrying bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of an extraordinarie waight, ſhot daie and night without anie intermiſsion, other than to refreſh themſelues. In the mean time the beſieged ſlept not, but with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lordes, and generally euen to the verie leaſt, they carryed earth &amp; pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers to rampire, in ſuch diligence and carefulneſſe, as at any place where they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the breach ſhould be made, in leſſe than twice foure and twentie houres they made vp the rampire the height of a perapect, leauing betweene the old wall and the rampire conuenient flankers, &amp; a trench farced with diuerſe drogs, to feaſt the moſt hotly diſpoſed, if they meant to goe to the aſſalt. Attending which; I will looke back againe into the exploits of the French armie.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as <hi>de Reux</hi> with the Flanders armie, which as yet remained about He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, perceiued the French to approach, without anie countenaunce at all made to be willing to fight for maintenance of them which were redie to be beſieged within, he retyred, leauing his ſonne in the caſtle, to whome hee vowed and ſwore great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if hee yeelded the place with diſhonour and reproch. With the ſame charge he left with him his companion, a Henault Gentleman named <hi>Harenuille.</hi> So the breach beeing made farre ſtronger by them than before, and ſtanding prouided and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with whatſoeuer they could imagine to bee neceſſarie for them, they ſowed a bruite that both the one and the other woulde rather die there within, than yeelde themſelues ſo good cheap as they that firſt went out thence. Shortly after the French armie beeing arriued, the Duke of Vendoſme, Lieutenant for the King in Picardie, cauſed his approaches to bee made, and one of his batteryes to bee planted in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame place where the Bourgonians had addreſſed theirs, and the other vppon the ſlope of a little hill of the ſide of Therouanne. So Hedin began to bee cannoned the ſeuenteenth of December moſt furiouſly, and there were diſcharged foure thouſand three ſcore,<note place="margin">The caſtle of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din yelded vp by de Reux his ſon to the D. of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme for the king.</note> and ſixe ſhot of Cannon, without making anie breach or ouerture, that had not yet a rampire behinde eighteene or twentie foote high. Yet faintneſſe of heart and feare of death ceazed the beſieged, who yeelded themſelues by compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theyr liues and goods ſaued, theyr Enſignes diſplayed, with two meane peeces of artillerie at theyr tayle, wythout taking awaie ought, or tranſporting of anie thing els
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21992:64"/>
of that which they had found within: ſo the caſtle of Hedin was yelded and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the Kings obedience, by the conduct of the Duke of Vendoſme, the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of December. And albeit that the chiefe was acquited of his dutie in keeping it, yet fearing his fathers cholar, he remained a long time not daring to preſent himſelf before him. Sodainly after the Duke of Vendoſme beeing aduertiſed that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies meant to paſſe ouer the riuer, to giue him battel at the houre that he parled with them of Hedin, by the Kings aduiſe hee purpoſed to eaſe them of that paine, and him ſelfe went to ſeeke them out with his forces, with intention to fight with them if they would abide. But not finding themſelues ſtrong inough, they retired towardes the ſtrong townes, and further into the heart of the Countrie, quitting vnto him the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to execute his good pleaſure, and a means to reuenge himſelfe of thoſe cruelties which they had committed vpon his lands.</p>
            <p>At ſuch time as theſe affayres thus paſſed there, the Duke of Neuers hauing cauſed on the ſide of Saint Michael many and ſundry roads to be made, to the great damage of the enemies of the crowne of Fraunce, departed thence by an intelligence which he had, how that on the ſide of <hi>Eſpinaux,</hi> by the Countie of Vaudemont,<note place="margin">The D. of Neuers at Vauco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with thoſe few men of warre which he was able to recouer, beeing two hundred men at armes, two hundred light horſe, and as many harguebuziers on horſeback, he retired towards Vaucouleurs, a little French village, renouned inough vpon the riuer of Meuſe, within fiue leagues of Thoul, included within many of the lands of Lorain, from whence within two daies after he departed to go towardes Thoul, thether cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his forces to approach, which he made to be lodged in a verie faire and great vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage named Blanieau, a temporall lordſhip &amp; roialtie of the Chapitre of S. Stephens of Thoul, and in other little ones adioyning. Shortly after their comming was a role made of the men at arms, and archers, the moſt likely and beſt mounted, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſixe ſcore, conducted by <hi>Mouy,</hi> to breake and cut vp the head of a maruellous great pond in the countie of Vaudemont, thereby to drowne and deſtroy a number of villages which were vnderneath it, whether many victuals had retired themſelues, and where the enemies forages found yet great ſtore of corne and forage: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was alreadie found broken and cut vp, to the great hinderaunce of the Countie. The French men hauing made the hole greater, and returning homewards, met with a great troup of waggons &amp; chariots, laden with all ſortes of victualers and munitions, addreſſed to the imperiall campe. Whereof hauing made the greateſt ſpoile that they were able, with a great deale of wines of Arbois, and marred the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus, and hauing ſlaine ſome of the guides and waggoners, led away as many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as they were able, and retired with great daunger, notwithſtanding that they were conſtrained to paſſe at full daie through ſundrie villages where ſome of the enemyes were lodged, as wel of foot as horſe. The which notwithſtanding fell out without the loſſe of anie one, in reſpect they were not knowen, apparelled like marchants, without anie white croſſes or ſcarfes ſeene, and their harneſſe couered with their cloakes, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe thought to be auantcouriers, to drawe them to an ambuſcade, or fearing leaſt the greater troupes of the enemies were couered and laie hid. Wherefore the D. of Neuers verie much contented herewith, anon after retired to Vaucouleurs.</p>
            <p>Now to looke backe againe to what the Emperour did before Metz,<note place="margin">A guile to paſſe amidſt ones ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without danger.</note> hee trauelled there with ſmall aduantage, all the thunder and ſtrange impetuoſitie of his artillerie not able to make one hole or paſſage fit to giue the aſſault, which the Marques <hi>Albert</hi>

demaunded of him;<note place="margin">The Emperours battery at Metz.</note> thinking thereby further to aduaunce himſelfe into his good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, for that hauing well neere ſhaken all the great tower D'enfer, all the great parte of wall betweene the tower and the porte Champenois, with the bulwarke which couered it, he could not raiſe the vaumure, otherwiſe termed fanſe-braie, which held vp the quarters of the wall that fell, and were ſtayed the one vpon the other, betweene this vaumure and the foote of the wall, no wayes filling of the ditch, which remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as neate, large, and deepe as before: nay, they ſerued them within for a ſtronger rampire.<note place="margin">Mines begun to be made by the imperials before Metz, to make a breach.</note> Wherefore it was thought good the batterie ſhoulde bee chaunged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place a little aboue, and to vndermine that parte, to turne topſie turuie into the ditch that ſame vaumure and fanſe-braie: whereof the Duke of Guiſe beeing aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, hee cauſed countermines to bee made within in ſundrie places, in which hee might haue anie knowledge, and prouide for theyr paſſages, in ſuch ſorte, as they had not long digged and hollowed theyr mines, but the ſentinels and ſcoutes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged might eaſily heare and perceiue them, the which began to diſcourage them, to daunt and quayle greatly in theyr enterpriſe. Ioyne that then, as well by reaſon of the maruellous coles, as thorough the neceſsities and defaultes of ſundrie thinges for the men of warre, the verie Germanes beganne euen to fayle of courage, who cauſed to bee ſignifyed vnto the Emperour, that it woulde pleaſe his maieſtie to command a reaſonable breach to bee made, to enter and take the towne, chooſing rather to die honourable at an aſſault, than miſerably to fall by colde and extreame famine. It was then that the Emperour iudging of the impoſsibilitie of the taking thereof, was pricked with an acknowledgement of his fault, and wyth a great griefe to haue there ſetled ſo euyll a beginning, for ſeeing ſo ſhamefull an end to ſo hotte deſſeines, yet to make them lifte vp theyr heartes, and incourage them to his power, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them that if by the ende of the yeere hee dyd not make a reaſonable breach, hee woulde giue them leaue to departe, which made them to temporize, and take patience. Whereupon to make proofe of this good affection, hee commaunded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the Duke of Alua wyth all diligence to cauſe theſe mines alreadie begunne to bee continued and purſued, the which he did with ſo great and feruent a deſire, that hee abandoned the worke neyther night nor daie. But the time was ſo contrarye vnto him, as all remayned vnperfect, wherefore if then in the enemies campe euerie man fayled of force and courage, the French increaſed from houre to houre, making more and more continuall ſallies and charges vpon them, wherewith they dayly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed their armie, for ſome ſtole awaie, and retired by whole troupes into theyr Countries, others in great number were found ſtiffe, and frozen within the trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, lodgings, tents, and quarters, and many pale, diſeaſed in their liuers, and dead for hunger, partly for that they were ſo euill paide, the Emperours treaſure beeing verie much conſumed. Who ſeeing the tearme promiſed to the Germanes to draw neere, hauing before his eyes a fearefull kinde of ſhame to returne, without hauing done anie honourable action, himſelfe beeing there in perſon, cauſed ſome to practiſe with them, to ſound them whether they wold be content to go with him to beſiege Thoul, an imperiall towne, whereof men could not be able to finiſh the fortification, by reaſon of the plague which had taken awaie ſo great a number of the inhabitants. To which they made anſwere, that they had not deliberated vppon it, and they were commanded by the Princes &amp; electors, not to paſſe anie further vntill Metz were firſt taken or yelded vp. Therefore if it woulde pleaſe his maieſtie to make anie breach hee opened as hee promiſed, they were all readie either to die there, or enter in:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21992:65"/>
from this time about the eighteenth of December hee began to cauſe his beſt and greateſt peeces of artillerie to retire. A lyttle after hauing aſſembled together all his Councell, to conclude of an honourable retreate, it was commaunded to the Earle of Aiguemont, Colonell, and chiefe of two Regimentes of Cauallerie lodged at Pont Camouſon, to go downe with his forces all alongeſt the riuer as farre as Thoul, &amp; as much lower as was poſsible for him, to diſcouer the Countrie, and know what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men of warre might be there all along with the Duke of Neuers, doubting leaſt at his retreate ſome greater anoiances might be done him. Wherupon this Earle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with his Cauallerie from Pont Camouſon, &amp; paſsing along the Mozelle as far as Thoul, cauſed it to bee ſummoned in paſsing thorough the ſuburbes, addreſsing his Trumpetter to <hi>D'eſclauolles,</hi> who was the gouernour. Who hauing vnderſtoode the Chiamade, made a ſigne to him with his hand that hee ſhould retyre, albeit that hee had iuſt occaſion to doubt vpon this ſummons, ſeeing the want of victualles, the towne pregnable, and to bee battered on euerie ſide, euill prouided of artillerie and munitions, whereof hee aduertiſed the Duke of Neuers, who was at Vaucouleurs. But the Gentleman of his houſe who carryed the newes, named <hi>Torte eſper,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the waie by ſome of that Cauallerie, ſcattered to finde ſome wandering bootie as it befell vnto them, for hauing taken from him an hundred crownes which he had vnder his faddle, they ſtript him no further: but hee ſhewed himſelfe ſo accord, as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe halfe at libertie, hee ſaued himſelfe acroſſe the woode, thorough the darkneſſe of the night, and ſo perfourmed his meſſage. And as ſoone as the Duke of Neuers receiued this aduertiſement, hee ſent all night long to fetch his men of warre at the inſtant to come vnto him, which was lodged one or two leagues of. And Albeit that it was at a time of reſt, and that the moſt parte were alreadie aſleepe, his commaundement notwithſtanding was, that euerie man ſhoulde bring his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on his backe, and readily mount on horſebacke. So they parted all the night wyth keeping a good watch, as it was reaſon, becauſe that this Earle approached as neere them as they coulde, and went vppon the brinke of the riuer into a village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dagny vppon Meuſe, thinking to ſurpriſe them. But ſeeing the fire of all ſides, hearing the noyſe and neighing of horſes, and by other tokens knowing howe they had warning and attended him, hee retyred backe his wayes, where returning vp the riuer of Mozell, hee paſſed neere vnto a lyttle towne named Gondreuille, ſeated vppon the banke of that riuer, of the ſide of Nancie. On the other parte a lyttle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was arriued the Baron of Guerres, which returned freſhly from a roade, who not aduertiſed of his enemyes beeing ſo neere him, wanted verie lyttle of paſsing the riuer of Bac, which if hee had done, as much had happened vnto him as did to ſome others that were of his companie, who for hauing croſſed the riuer aleady on the enemyes ſide, were ſurpiſed, ſome hurt, others taken priſoners, and fewe or none killed or ſlayne, the Baron ſaued himſelfe wythin the lyttle towne, and was not rigorouſly purſued, as well for the darkeneſſe of the night, as the feare which they had leaſt they ſhoulde bee charged vpon. That verie ſame night was S. <hi>Simon,</hi> a Gentleman of the houſe of the Duke of Neuers ſent wyth fyue and twentye horſe as farre as Thoul, to vnderſtande of <hi>Eſclauolles</hi> the ſucceſſe of the enterpriſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſayd. Vpon whoſe report <hi>Fouronne,</hi> a Gentleman of his houſe, was forthwith diſpatched and ſent by the Duke of Neuers to aduertiſe the King of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges. Who in ſhort aunſwere ſent vnto him, and prayed him to ſearch out by all meanes poſsible that hee coulde, howe that towne of Thoul myght
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21992:66"/>
bee preſerued, and holde out onely for fifteene dayes, within which time hee woulde not fayle himſelfe to come to ſuccour it wyth all his power. The Duke vppon this aunſwere, woulde not put anie other in truſt with this charge, but reſeruing it vnto himſelfe, the two and twentith of December followed by <hi>Bordillon, De Bigny</hi> maſter of the Q. houſeholde, <hi>d'Eſchenets</hi> and <hi>de Giry</hi> Enſigne of his companie, he went and lodged within the towne thus vnprouided. As ſoone as the Duke was there arriued, hee made the round vpon the walls about the towne, and viſited a beginning of ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and platformes, which <hi>D'Eſcauolles</hi> had begun to frame wythin, the which was found to bee excellently well inuented by the ingeners and maſters of fortifications, whome hee cauſed to come thether, to conſider of, and addreſſe the diſpoſing and finiſhing of this fortification, enterpriſed and imprinted ſo deepely in his affection, that there remayned not one man about his perſon, to whome hee gaue not ſome commiſsion, and hee himſelfe the moſt part of the time ſtirred not, interrupting the ordinarie houres of his meales, ſo greatly was he affectionate to that worke, that there reſted verie ſmall time that hee ſawe not ſome platforme made vp in defence, which carryed his name, <hi>De Bordillon</hi> was as buſie about another, and they ſeemed to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt iealous of the perfection of theyr workes. Beſides, hee made ſearch to be made throughout all the houſes, garners, and ſellers, and to take an oath of all thoſe which inhabited there, to knowe what corne, wines, haie, fourage, and of euerie kinde of victuals might bee wythin the Towne, to the ende that order might bee taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But there was a ſmall deale founde, hauing beene carryed awaye before by the Burgeſſes and thoſe which were retyred to other places for feare of the plague, and that which remayned wythin the towne was conſumed and ſpoiled without reaſon, by the ſouldyers, and ſuch as remayned there during this peryll. Then beeing infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med how that into two little townes, Thoul, and Gondeuille, greate quantitie was carryed as well out of the plaine Countrie, as little townes and French lands, for feare of the enemyes, hee ſent to ſummon them, and gaue commandement that it ſhoulde bee brought and ſtored vp wythin Thoul. To Gondeuille was ſent <hi>Eſchenets,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a farre off by an Enſigne of footemen, wyth a certayn number of horſe. The Prouoſt and the inhabitants, after ſome difficulties, ſawe themſelues ſo ſodaynly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that in the ende they aduiſed themſelues to obey. They of Thoul grew ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, forgetting themſelues in the regarde of <hi>Mouie,</hi> who was ſent vnto them with fiftie, horſe of the Duke of Neuers his companie, and an Enſigne of fanterie, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them to obey the Kings Lieutenant. Notwithſtanding after his honeſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſeeing the Prouoſt conteſtate, and at his diſſembled preſumption the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants rebellious, hee cauſed the towne preſently to bee ſcaled, and taken as ſhee was by aſſault, they ſomewhat felt the payment of theyr refuſall. <hi>Mouie</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed the furie of the French ſouldyers to ceaſe, alreadie heated at the ſlaughter. The Enſigne of Fanterie remained and lodged there, vntill that all the victuals which were within were carryed to Thoul, wythout taking or carrying awaie anie thing, thereby to maintayne them alwayes in theyr Neutralitie: ſo all victuals and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were carryed to Thoul from all partes, by the commandement of the generall, with ſo good order, as euerie man liued ſomewhat better, and wyth more diſcretion than before. And after hauing conſidered howe in caſe the ſiege ſhoulde bee, the towne woulde bee verie ill prouided of footmen, hee cauſed foure other companies to enter in, which made vp the number of eighteene hundred fantaſsins, &amp; ſome light horſe, ouer and aboue the ordinarie garriſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:21992:66"/>The Duke of Neuers beeing heereupon aduertiſed,<note place="margin">The Emperour vpon the point to retire from Metz.</note> how the Emperour euen long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retyre himſelfe, and how his armie euerie daie broke and diminiſhed, ſeldome ſuffered anie daie to paſſe wythout ſending ſome people ouer the Countrie to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en theyr going: ſo as oftentimes in ſtead of aduauncing forwarde, they cauſed them to recoyle backe inough wyth a number of priſoners which they tooke. Notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they founde them in ſo great pouertie, as they were faine to let them paſſe wythout anie harme dooing. In this eſtate remayned they vntyll the laſt daie of the moneth of December, that the Emperour vnderſtanding of the taking of the caſtle of Hedin, ſeeing himſelfe to fall and to diminiſh of euerie thinge, fearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the returne of the Kings armie, and to fall into greater loſſe, was one of the firſt which retyred on new yeeres daie, leauing all the charge to the Duke of Alua, for the departing of his armie, and ordering of the retreate. As ſoone as his departure was knowen throughout the campe, the wayes and villages rounde about were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly full of ſouldyers, which retyred themſelues, the one into theyr quarter, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether they were able, in ſo great miſerie, as verie beaſts, were they neuer ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, woulde haue taken pittie of thoſe miſerable ſouldiers, falling and ſtaggering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the high waies in extreme neceſsitie, and moſt commonly dying neere the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and at the rootes of buſhes, to become a praie to dogges and birdes. And which is yet more to bee lamented by men of courage, to bee inforced to die ſo poorelye, without hauing made anie great proofe at all of theyr valor. The which ought great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to moue the heartes of ſuch men, as God hath rendered ſo happie in this worlde, that they neuer felt nor aſſayed the hardneſſe of warre. And when they ſpeake with a full belly and the cuppe in theyr hande, it ſeemeth vnto them a wedding, to liue in ſuch an eſtate as conſiſteth not in thouſand and thouſand of perills, more than in the daunger both of ſoule and bodie, except it bee wiſely &amp; iuſtly executed. Not to looſe anie time vppon the intelligence which the Duke of Neuers had receiued, hee ſent <hi>Mouie,</hi> and the Captaine <hi>Andre de Maye More,</hi> wyth about fiue hundred horſe, as well of men at armes, as harguebuziers on horſebacke, to put on theyr ſpurres agaynſt the inhabitants of the Countie, retyring themſelues into theyr quarters, where there wanted verie lyttle, that the ſonne of <hi>Granuelle,</hi> the Baron of Carlaon, and others, had not beene there ſtaied, but doubting themſelues of that comming, by ſlacke and long treates, they ſaued themſelues. Hauing failed of this their firſt enterpriſe, they at one treat went at the point of day to lie in ambuſcade neere Ramberuilliers, within which was a Commiſſarie of victualles, which came from the Franche comte to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the maſter of the monie of Beſanſon, with two other marchauntes which brought great quantitie of all kinde of victualles and prouiſions. The commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and marchants were before horſed and guided by a Lorrainer, who ſerued for a ſpie, by whome the Duke of Neuers was certainly aduertiſed what hee was to put in execution for theyr ſurpriſall. Wherefore as they were in ambuſcade neere inough to the towne, <hi>Andre de Maye</hi> ſent certayne Italian ſouldyers, which were to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the ambuſcade, by a ſigne if they entered, and gaine the port vpon the gardes, ſo as faining to come from the imperiall campe, and to indure great colde and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they lamented ſo much, as they were let to goe ſeeke ſome victuals.

vppon the porters halfe aſleepe, and the reſt dronke, of whome ſome were maſſacred, other conſtrained to abandon the gates, which were a little after opened to all the reſt of the ambuſcade, who beeing aduertiſed thereof, couragiouſly entered in. I leaue you to thinke what good husbandrie there was made. The Comiſsarie was founde there hidde in the bedſtrawe, and wyth theſe marchants was carryed priſoner to Thoul, the victuals and prouiſions diſpearſed, and ſpoyled as much as they coulde. They did as much at Eſpinau, a caſtle ſcituate vpon Mozelle and Rimiremont, where great violence was offered to the Abbeſſe and Ladies, eſpecially by the Italians which were newly come from the Emperous campe to the Kings ſeruice. The Duke of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers had ſent <hi>Chaſtellus</hi> Lieutenant of Bordillons companie, towardes Metz with like number of Cauallerie, to learne out and make a certaine report of the truth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait.

The Marques <hi>Albert</hi> remayned the laſt to ſerue for helpe and arreregard, not without great paine and hazard, thorough the continuall alarums which daie and night hee receyued. Beſides that, he prayed the Duke of Neuers to haſten him to go, ſo as the third of Ianuarie he departed from Thoul with his men at armes, and cauallerie, and three Enſignes of fanterie, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Bordillon</hi> and ſundrie other Gentlemen and Captaines. After he went to dine at Pont Camouſon, where the reſt of that daie he tarryed to heare newes of the Marſhall of Saint Andre, who was gone the lower waie: hauing in lyke ſort ſent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie</hi> to the Duke of Guiſe, praying him to aduertiſe him of the resolution of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayre, whoſe aunſwere hee attended.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21992:67"/>
were defeated. Wherewith being the more annoyed, they ought rather to come out as the French deſired, conſidering that they coulde not inforce them but with greate loſſe. Therefore to the end they might the more vexe them, the Duke cauſed foure meane Culuerines to bee placed in a lyttle Ilande aboue Pont au Mores, which ſhot euen within them. In ſumme, they dyd ſo ſore annoye them, as two dayes after the Marques hauing loſt the better parte of his men, departed thence in a farre leſſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than hee came with, taking his waie towards Treuues. Hee was a little followed after, and they made a good market wyth his people, being combatted inough wyth colde, famine, and other miſeries. But the French moued with pittie made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: but in ſtead of tormenting them, they opened vnto them the paſſage, and ſuffered the members to go ſcotfree, wiſhing onely that they might haue gotten the head to haue paid for all.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Guiſe aduertiſed the King by <hi>Randan</hi> of all the ſucceſſe of his ſiege,<note place="margin">Thankeſgiuings to God by the French for the ſiege raiſed at Metz.</note> who after hauing yeelded thankes vnto God for ſo good an iſſue, commaunded that they ſhould make publyke and general proceſsions throughout his Realme, to praiſe and thanke God of ſo great and eſpeciall a grace for all France. The Duke of Guiſe dyd the lyke at Metz wyth a generall proceſsion, where he himſelfe was preſent with all humilitie and deuotion, as alſo dyd the reſt of the Princes and Lordes which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed him, to wit, the Princes of D'anguien, de Conde, Montpenſier, la Roche Suryon, de Nemours, <hi>Horace Farneze, Pierre Stroſsie, le Vidaſme de Chartres, Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, D'anuille, de Gonor,</hi> gouernour of Metz, <hi>De la Broſse,</hi> Lieutenant of the Duke of Lorraines companie, and <hi>De la Rochefoucaut,</hi> the Vizecount of Turaine, and <hi>De Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, D'elangues, Entragues, De Biron, and Saint Remy,</hi> and generally all the Captaines, Gentlemen, and ſouldyers which remayned after the ſiege.

            <p>During the time that the Emperour patiently carryed the misfortune happened vnto him, vnder a hope of a more fauourable to come, and as hee retired to the Low Countries, hee excuſed himſelfe towardes the Princes and Cities of the Empire of ſo pittifull ſucceſſe, laying it vpon the ſlacknes of theyr forces and meanes. For which cauſe, ſayde hee, hee was inforced to ſet vpon that place in the dead of winter: The King of France triumphed ouer his miſeries, and increaſing them by his Letters and Embaſſages to all Chriſtian Princes, the more to diminiſh the authoritie and credite of his enemie, whoſe power hee ſayde was altogether broken by the iſſue of ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a ſiege, paſſed the moſt parte of the times for reuenge of ſo great raines and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as had beene indured by the continuance of the warres paſsed, in eaſe and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings which hee tooke in feaſtings, tiltings, turney, and other royall pleaſures, among which, the marriage made at Paris wyth rare magnificence, betweene <hi>Horace Farneze</hi> Duke of Caſtres, and the Ladie <hi>Diana</hi> his natural daughter, was moſt famous. But the Emperour prompt and actiue in his actions, pricked beſides with an extreame deſire of reuenge, which by all meanes in all places hee practiſed, ſoone troubled this good cheere, for in the beginning of the ſpring, with ſuch a number as hee was able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and firſt vnder the conduct of <hi>du Reux</hi> hee ſent to beſiege Terroanne. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by death, that charge was giuen to <hi>Binecourt,</hi> a knight eſteemed one of the moſt ſweet &amp; gracious among them. That Citie, albeit that it was little of circuit, had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne great inough throughout all Europe, of which the Romanes make honorable
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21992:68"/>
mention in their writings. It was ſcituated vpon the little riuer of Liz, in the confines of Gaul Belgique, a nation of a long time eſteemed warlyke by the hiſtoriographers, called by the Latins <hi>Morini,</hi> now they call it the Cauntie of Ponthieu ſomwhat neer the great Ocean ſea, in ſituation ſomwhat hanging, inuironed with fens &amp; mariſhes, woodes, and great forreſts. Beſides, curiouſly fortified by the Kinges of Fraunce, to whoſe handes it hath a long time ſince beene fallen, to ſerue them as a bulwarke and frontire as well againſt the Engliſh, as Flemings and Hanuiers, among which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, hauing done a thouſand ſpoyles, and an hundred ſundrie enterpriſes, which they woulde attempt vpon Picardie. Wherefore it was once cleane rayſed and made euen to the earth by the Engliſhmen, and there was ſalt ſowen in ſigne of eternall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. But yet is it much more odious to the Flemings, Burgonians, and Hanuiers, who for this occaſion importunately induced the Emperour to this enterpriſe. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as it was eſteemed impregnable, &amp; that as well by intelligence, as other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations not thought, that the Emperour woulde conuert his forces to that place, but rather into Champagne, towardes Mezieres and Yuoy, they had not ſo carefully furniſhed it with victuals &amp; ſure munition, as was requiſite for ſo long a ſiege. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the neighbours being aduertiſed, the enemyes vſed ſo greate diligence, that it was ſodainly beſieged, <hi>De Loſſes</hi> beeing alone, within the principall and chiefe, with his light horſe and ſome people of the Country, in no great number, nor of anie great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Ioyn that thorough the couetouſnes and neglygence of former gouernours, a thing naturall to vs French men, this key remained bare and vnfurniſhed of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions: therefore it was neceſſarie to make a vertue of neceſsitie, &amp; where prudence could not take place, there it was neceſſarie that force ſhould ſecond it. In ſuch ſorte, as euen in the beard of the enemy, and in ſpight of them, being as men iudged for the moſt parte not vſed to the arte of warres, they ſtrengthned it with men, victuals, and whatſoeuer they were able. <hi>D'eſſe,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Panuilliers,</hi> knight of the order, moſt renoumed for his vertue and proweſſe, beeing ſent thether Lieutenant for the King, and with him <hi>Frances</hi> of <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Conſtable, with the moſt part of theyr companies, followed wyth a great number of other Lordes, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and ſouldyers, who entered therein to ſeeke for honour: and the reſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theyr Captaines to defend and keepe the place. But as ſuch a victualling thereof deſpighted the Emperor, and making him obſtinate, reiterated his deſpight, to cauſe it to bee battered and aſſaulted, the King contrarywiſe aſſuring himſelfe of an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie to force it, ſlacked it in ſuch ſort, as without anie other ſuccours or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, hee lefte his enemie to doo whatſoeuer hee liſted. For albeit that they wythin, and the Duke of Vendoſme wyth the men at armes of the garriſons about, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gaue alarums vnto them as much as was poſsible, yet theyr number beeing much greater and ſtronger than the French, they could not ſo hinder them, but that they made their approaches, where they themſelues thought beſt euen to plant their batterie where they pleaſed, and knew might moſt annoy the towne, putting the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mouth of theyr artillerie neereſt, and vpon the brinke of the ditch betweene the caſtle and the towre Du Chapitre, vppon a little hill where the gallowes ſtoode hard by. Hauing brought from many townes and caſtles of Flanders and Artois all ſortes of Artillerie, with innumerable munitions of pouder and bullets. So glad was that nation to ſee it inuironed, that not onely women and litle children ranne the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for ioy ſung ſongs, and vulgar rimes, carrying and bringing into the campe all ſortes of graine, drinkes, beaſts, and other victuals by heapes, which made their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſeeme farre greater in number; than well furniſhed of good ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:21992:68"/>Theyr batterie began about the end of Iune, ſtraunge and furious inough: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the bullets fell as thicke within the towne, as great haileſtones out of the skie, and that there was not vpon the rampires, thorough the ſtreets or within the houſes, any ſure place and without danger, yet they within beſieged were ſmally ſeared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Now making continuall ſallies and recharges vpon their enemyes in the midſt of theſe thickes and ſmoakes, they ſought them out, and by heapes beate them within theyr owne forts and trenches, and ſometimes conſtrayned them to abandon theyr trenches, and had leaſure inough to ſticke vp ſome of theyr peeces with nayles, and ſet theyr pouder on fire, ſo as they dragged into the towne one of theyr culuerines, and after ſhot many ſhootes at them, albeit the great ſtore of artillerie and munition which was continually brought to the campe, hourely repayred anie diſorder or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance, which the French with great labour and daunger could doo them, being a farre greater loſſe to looſe one man beſieged, than ten beſieging. Vppon this the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and thundring batterie of the enemies grew greater dayly, &amp; there remained not within the towne, tower, or turret, to the leaſt battlement that fell not to the ground, there was not anie defence without or within, which they rayſed not. Briefly, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thus battered, &amp; throwen downe, one would eaſily beleeue that they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to laie it all to duſt. They within without anie reſpect at all of theyr owne liues, to the ſame place whether they ſawe the bullets bend, from moment to moment car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vpon their backes earth, faggots, turfes, and dung, which notwithſtanding much weakned them by reaſon of the continuall toyle which they in the daie had to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and in the night to watch, to keepe ſentinell, and ſuſtaine diuerſe alarums with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſt, for a neceſsitie practiſing the office of ſouldiers and labourers both together, by reaſon of the ſmall number of artificers and pioners, and leſſe ſtore of anie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tooles that was in the towne at a pinch, as pickaxes, ſpades, ſhouelles, mattockes, crowes, and ſuch ſort of yron workes, whereof they ſtood in ſo great need, as the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers within were conſtrained to peck the ground with ſpits, daggers, fire ſhouels, and as a man maye ſaie, euen ſcratch it wyth their nailes: for which and ſuch like wantes, many townes in France haue bene gotten by the enemie, albeit that they were well furniſhed beſides for good men: for help whereof, and to giue ſome reioycing to the long trauell of the beſieged, they cauſed the Captain <hi>Grille</hi> to enter in with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred harguebuziers on horſebacke. The which hee brauely enterpriſed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and with ſuch conduct, as hauing forced the watch, with ſmall loſſe of anie of his ſoldiers he entered in, in the ſight of them all, which greatly increaſed their courage. The ſame daie they made a ſallie in like ſorte out vpon them luckily inough; &amp; made their retreate like men of warre, without receiuing the worſe. But that nation ſhewed it ſelfe ſo greate an enemie to this poore miſerable towne, that ſhee forgot nothing whereby ſhee might make her extreame deſire appeare, of ſeeing the totall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof, and how much by day &amp; night they ceaſed not to torment it, by all means which they could poſsiblie imagine, by ſo much more increaſed the courage of the French, to repulſe them backe, for in leſſe than one houre they had made vp the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire without the ladder, where they perceiued the artillery to begin to ſhake the wal, and made ſtronger in an inſtant, what in one daie had beene throwen downe, then it was before. Notwithſtanding the lightning of their artillerie was ſo terrible and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thundering without intermiſsion, as there was neither rampire, banke, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which it turned not ouer without remedie, the which continued ſo furiouſlie for the ſpace of neere hand ten dayes together. Within which time the enemies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they had made a breach reaſonable and great inough, as in deed it was of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21992:69"/>
threeſcore paces long, the wall, rampire, &amp; all the defences as well of the caſtle as the great tower being broken downe and battered, no more remaining but a litle mount which they within had cauſed to bee made, and the parapect and toppe of the ditch, which was yet ſtrong, and hard for them to mount vp vnto, notwithſtanding that as well with the quarters and ruines of the wall, as with faggots and hurdles, they dyd what they could to fill vp the ditch, to make the ſcale more eaſie. That beeing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to thoſe within, they reſolued to abide them, and you may eaſily beleeue that they lefte nothing in theyr lodgings that was not brought out. After many vollies of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, as well from the mountaine, which gaue right on the backe of the beſieged, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to defend the breach, as from that which ſhot in face of them on the riuer ſide, with a great noiſe of Fifes,<note place="margin">A furious aſſault to Terroane by the Fleminges &amp; Hanuiers, helde out by the French.</note> Drums, Trumpets, and diuerſe cries after theyr manner, they went furiouſly to the aſſault of all partes, carrying ladders and all kinde of engins to ſcale and force the towne, and there was that daie a moſt maruellous combat ſeen. For if the enemies were wilfull to enter in, much more had the French a better wil to defend themſelues and repulſe them. There could one haue ſeene nothing but wild fire, and vnquenchable crackling of armour, and al kinde of weapons, pittious cries of thoſe which were burned, maimed, turned ouer, and drawing towardes death: gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all ſortes of moſt terrible and furious executions, for the ſpace of more than ten long houres, the enemies refreſhing themſelues three times. In the end the reſolute conſtancie of the beſieged preuayled, and vanquiſhed the obſtinacy of the imperials, repulſing them with a great butcherie of theyr moſt braue men, not without greate loſſe of them that kept it, among whom the valiant Knight <hi>De Heſſe</hi> loſt his life, whoſe proweſſe was alreadie renowmed beyonde the frontiers of Fraunce in many places, namely in the Ilandes of England and Scotland, as alſo dyd <hi>De Viennes, De Beaudiſne, De la Rochepoſay, De Blandie,</hi> and the Captaine <hi>Ferriers,</hi> all men of marke, and of lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conduct, with other valiant Gentlemen and ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>The King beeing aduertiſed how couragiouſly his men behaued themſelues, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelfe that to ſo victorious a beginning, there coulde not inſue but a moſt happie end,<note place="margin">A ſtratageme of the Captaines, Breuill &amp; Saint Romain.</note> without ordaining anie further ſuccours for this litle towne almoſt torne in peeces of all partes, ſauing onely that hee cauſed <hi>De Hedin,</hi> the Captaine <hi>Breuil,</hi> and <hi>S.

Which they moſt fortunatly performed, not without great daunger and hazard of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the enemies hauing with theyr trenches and mounts compaſſed and inuironed the towne round about, euen ſo far as to place their Corps de gnets within the ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who being neuer a whit the more cooled nor diſcouraged for that, fought daylye hand to hand with the French which kept the breach, and grewe much more earneſt in returning vnto it, aſſaying by all force poſsible to carrie it awaie, and did not onelie giue fire to diuerſe hollow mines in ſundrie places, the moſt part whereof they found falſe and vented, but they beſide practiſed a ſlight neuer before vſed, which was to dig vnder the parapect and backe of the ditch, beeing verie hard and vneaſie to mount vp to the breach, all the flankers and defenſes (as I haue tolde you) being raiſed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe with the artillerie, hauing made certaine Taudis, which they call Mance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, in faſhion of blinders, onely to couer them from hand ſtrokes and ſtones, whileſt that they did approach to the foot of the breach, vnder which they hollowed &amp; trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their mine as themſelues could deſire. Whereat the French maruelling inough, perſwaded themſelues that the enemies were not able to hollowe and dig ſo farre as vnder their feet, which were aboue them vpon the breach, but rather that they wold drawe out the earth from vnder the caſtle, or the great tower Du Chapitre, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe

they ſtill digged vnder the parapect, the length of the verie breach, holding vp the burthen with ſhores and piles, fylling the ditch full of the earth which they drew out. The worke being finiſhed, and fire put thereto, it happened that one parte of this parapect was blowen vp, and fel within the ditch, and the reſt ſunke in a heap, ſwallowing vp many French ſouldyers,<note place="margin">Terroane ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Raiſed now vnto ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſeeing her ſelfe entirelie beloued, ſhe had no greater care than how to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Empire vnto one of her children after the death of the father. But foreſeeing that the ſingular vertues of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> would bee ſo farre contrarie thereunto, that whileſt hee liued ſhee ſhould neuer haue reſt, (becauſe that he had gotten the loue of the men of warre, and how the eyes of all men were vppon him, for the great hope of his magnanimious courage and ſingular dexteritie) ſhe ſtudyed as much as ſhe could to make him become odious to <hi>Soliman,</hi> to which her ſonne in law greatly aided her, for that hee as then gouerned all the affayres. Her reaſons were, how that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> building vppon the loue and fauour which hee had gotten of all men, thorough his great liberalitie, courage, &amp; dexteritie of ſpirit, burned with ſuch a longing to raigne, as euerie man feared leaſt in affecting the Empire, hee would ſhorten the dayes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> as alreadie <hi>Selim</hi> had done to his father. Therefore ſhee vrged <hi>Soliman,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him with many and great teares that hee would take order therein, thereby to prouide for his owne ſafetie. Now albeit in the beginning ſhee ſmally preuailed, and that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had well diſcouered the croſſebarres which ſhee ordinarilye prepared for him, yet ſhee neuer ceaſed to continue, by the helpe of a Iew, a moſt renowmed inchantreſſe, who hauing giuen vnto her certaine drugs, ſhee cauſed the amitie of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> to bee redoubled towards <hi>Roza,</hi> ſo well, as ſhe aſſured her ſelfe of a good euent at the laſt to her enterpriſes, albeit a delaie might bee for a time. Finally, after many practiſes, ſhee found meanes to ſuborne the gouernour of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and cauſed him to write (though falſely) vnto <hi>Soliman,</hi> howe his ſonne meant to take in marriage the daughter of the Kinge of Perſia. This olde man moued by the continuall plaintes of <hi>Roza</hi> and <hi>Roſtan,</hi> eaſily gaue credite to theſe newes and falſe aduertiſements, ſo as in the yeere 1552. hauing cauſed a bruite to runne of the Perſians comming downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Syria, hee ſent <hi>Roſtan</hi> thether with a puiſant armie, for (vnder colour of going to meete with his enimies) to ceaze vpon <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and bring him priſoner to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, with expreſſe commaundement to kill him, if otherwiſe hee coulde not take him. But <hi>Muſtapha</hi> aduertiſed of the whole matter, and howe that the Perſians were not at all in the field, came towardes him with ſeuen thouſand men of the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in the warres, which cauſed <hi>Roſtan</hi> to make a quicke returne without dooing ought. Whereat <hi>Soliman</hi> beeing the more prouoked, the next yeere cauſed the ſame bruite agayne to runne, and how hauing leauied a great armie he meant to go himſelf in perſon agaynſt the Perſians. Beeing arriued in Syria, hee commanded his ſonne to come vnto him to his campe. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> knowing how it was him alone which they ſhot at, albeit hee was prayed and greatly ſolicited to auoide the furie of his Father, and retire himſelf into ſome other part, truſting in his owne innocencie, and thinking it a matter more commendable and worthie of his greatneſſe, to die in obeying of his Father, than liuing, to incurre a note of infamie and treaſon, yea, though thereby hee, might gaine the Empire of the whole world: thinking in like ſorte, that for that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made anie refuſal, by his owne preſence hee might appeaſe the furie of his father went on his waie thether, but being entered within <hi>Solimans</hi> tent, hee was ſodainly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſtrangled in his owne preſence, after at the ſame inſtant, the Baſſa his head of the Prouince of Amaſia, was ſtroke off. This crueltie beeing come to the knowledge of <hi>Giangir,</hi> the crooke backe, one of the reſt of the foure brothers, hee manfully reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gifte and ſpoile which his father had preſented vnto him, ſo that lamenting the death of his brother, he could not command himſelfe, nor refrain from vttering theſe ſpeeches.</p>

There they planted on the one ſide one of their batteries, and the other towards the parke, and the greateſt of all by the Towre Robin, where the French had already made theirs, but notwithſtanding any reſiſtance which they within beſieged were able to make, they were not able to diuerte them. This Caſtle being little, which in al could contain but 2000. men, and that hardly hauing in times paſt beene builded by the Dukes of Burgondie, onely for the pleaſure of hunting, &amp; not to fortifie it in any ſort, ſo not looſing one ſole hower by day or night to batter it ſo furiouſlye as was poſſible, they trauailed not onelye to throwe it downe by their artillerie, but vndermined it ſo diuerſlye and in ſo many places, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible that a Cony berry could haue more holes and hollowes vnder the ground, then were vnder the foundations of this caſtle,<note place="margin">Hedin beſieged, battered, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, taken, and ſacked by the Imperials.</note> all the countermines &amp; ſecrets within being known &amp; practiſed by many of the enemies, the place beſides being very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to this imperfection.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21992:71"/>
all the dangers were declared to the D. of Bouillon, and withall the irrecouerable loſſe of ſo many braue men as were within ſo vile a place, the taking of Teroane ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them for a freſh example, without compariſon farre ſtronger then that Caſtle, wherefore of euerye ſide were propoſed termes of compoſition, the which the Prince of Piemont willingly enough agreede vnto, ſtanding aſſured how the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which defended that place were men of valour, and the ſouldiers full cunning at ſuch an occupation, conſidering likewiſe that the time was very ſhort to make any long temporiſing, curious beſides to get good cheape, whereby afterwards he might the better imploy his army to matter of greater conſequence. But as the Gentlemen and Trumpetters went from the one ſide to the other, to reſolue of the compoſition already in good forwardnes, nothing reſting but the deliuerye of hoſtages on both ſides, and the ſigning with the Princes hand, two misfortunes happened to the French: the one, that a Prieſt not wittingly as ſince it was knowne, but through lack of foreſight or ſome ſecret malediction, ſet on fire ſuch workes and preparations as they had made ready to abide the aſſault: the other, that the Bourgonians greedy of the pray, by the ſweetenes which they found in the ſacke of Teroane, gaue fire to the traines of their mines, fearing to be fruſtrate of ſo great a bootie as they expected: ſo as one parte of the Souldiers being burned and conſumed in theſe fires, another ſwallowed vp and periſhed in this gulfe of ſmoaking mines, the reſt which were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fewe aſtonied as if they had fallen from the cloudes, without daring to make any reſiſtance, in reſpect they were forbidden to ſtirre from their places, or moue theyr weapons, attending the Princes ſigning and confirmation, were ſurpriſed and found themſelues at the mercy of their enemies, before they euer thought them as yet to haue bene entred. The Prince of Piemont knowing this aduenture ſo happely fallen out for him and better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hoped for, would not afterwards ſigne what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed, forgetting all the precedents, through the ioy which he had for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of that place, and the priſonners at ſo eaſie a rate. So as preſently mounting vp the great breach, he entred the Caſtle to goe to the D. of Bouillon, who as ſoone as hee perceiued him, moued with an extreame choller, which made him forget all feare of death, ſaid vnto him: why how now Sir, is this the keeping of your promiſe? will you not ſend ſuch hoſtages vnto me as you promiſed, and perfourme what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greede betweene you and me? to whom the Prince anſwered with a ſmile, ſufficient teſtimony of his ioy, how that he had ſpoken too late, and how it was no more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue hoſtages when all his people were already within. In ſumme, that after many ſpeeches the reſolution was, that they ſhould remaine priſonners, to wit, the D. of Bouillon cheefe and lieutenant for the K. <hi>De Riou</hi> Gouernour, <hi>La Lobe</hi> Enſigne of the Dukes company, the Earle of Vilars, <hi>De Prie</hi> Lieutenant of his company, <hi>De Guenon</hi> guidon, <hi>De Vanze</hi> Marſhall of the lodgings, the Baron of Culan, <hi>De Marets</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>De Riou</hi> his company of foot, with ſundry other, whome ſeeing by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance to be of ſome mark, he would needs haue their names, and afterwards more raunſome then otherwiſe he had: ſo this Caſtle was againe recouered by the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als the 18. of Iuly, after the death of <hi>Horace Farneze</hi> D. of Caſtres, whom a bullet of a great peece carried away, and hard by him <hi>De Magny</hi> a renowned gentleman in the feates of armes, there died alſo the Vicecount of Martigues,<note place="margin">Horace Farneze D. of Caſtres, De Magny, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, Moninuille Cizieux, Dampi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre, Luſignan, and others dead at Hedin.</note> who being deliuered out of priſon at Teroane, preſently repaired to this caſtle, hauing alwaies ſpent his time in many honourable actions: <hi>Moninuille</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Amboiſe, de Cizeux</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioner of the wars, the C. <hi>Luſignan</hi> enſigne to <hi>De Riou, De Dampierre,</hi> who had likewiſe beene priſonner at Teroane, and came againe thither with the Seneſchall of Caſtres, and

The nobles and rierbandes were compleat verie neere three thouſand horſe, whereof <hi>La Iaille</hi> was generall, there were few of the particular companies of harguebuziers on horſebacke, for that the King had a little before made an ordinance therupon, to euery Captaine of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at armes, to leauie fiftie harquebuziers on horſebacke, armed with corſlets, murrions, vanbraces, or ſleeues of maile, with an handgunne or harquebuze, or a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke or cocke, within a caſe of well tanned leather, mounted vppon good curtailes, and vnto euerie one of fiftie,<note place="margin">A new ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> fiue and twentie in like equipage, conducted by a man at arms of the greateſt experience, eſpecially to that end to be choſen out of their own companie: all which made wel vp the number of twelue or fifteen hundred. A thing well inuented and by good counſell, to aſsiſt a man at armes in anie narrow or vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie place, and which gaue great countenance and grace to the armie, in beeing the firſt before the companyes, together with the diuerſitie of theyr apparell. In this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was king Henrie neere vnto him, the Prince of Ferrara, the Duke of Guiſe, the prince of La Roche-Suryon, and the marſhall <hi>Saint Andre,</hi> euerie one of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hauing a regiment of men at armes as the reſt.

Of all ſortes of artillerie there was about one hundred great and ſmall peeces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which <hi>Eſtre</hi> was great maſter and chiefe gouernour, a Gentleman verie watchfull and of great ſpirite, for the firſt daie of this voyage the armie made no great treate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping that night a league of Corbie in two little villages, vpon a current and ſmall riuer, beeing verie commodious for the ſame. The next morrow it followed almoſt the tracke and waie of the imperiall armie, to lodge at Miraumont, it happened that in the waie the Duke of Neuers ſlipped out of the armie with his regiment, taking the left hand towards the woods and forreſts, ouer agaynſt Arras, where ſome ſcoutes were diſcouered, who ſaued themſelues by theyr ſwiftneſſe within the thick of thoſe forreſts, which beeing well looked about, there was not one enimie found that made head, onely a fort within a lyttle village, which a lyttle after was forced by the hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers, and found worſe prouided than they imagined. The which cauſed him to turne to Miraumont, to take his quarter. The ſecond of September the D. of Guiſe with two regiments of men at armes, between a thouſand and twelue hundred horſe as well of the light cauallerie as of the nobles, and ten Enſignes of French fanterie departed from the place, drawing thorough the rout of thoſe woods towards Arras, to diſcouer and cleere the moſt dangerous places, &amp; ſubdue the forces of any which ſhould be retired thither, but he found not ought which was hard vnto him, hauing diſcouered as far as the ſuburbs of Arras. So returning for a teſtimonie of this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, fire was ſet on al the villages round about, with a deſolation and moſt lementable pitie.<note place="margin">Bapaulme repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</note> Now from Miraumont there were but two good leagues to Bapaulme, a ſtrong place, barren more thorough the ſcituation of nature, than anie workemanſhip, but much more odious and hurtful to the French bordering vpon it, than euer Terroane was to the Bourgonians, ſo as ſecretly the better to know the place, and tempt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of thoſe that held it, the thirde of September the Conſtable with the moſt parte of the Princes, accompanied with fiue thouſand horſe, &amp; as many of the French fanterie, went to view this place as neere as he was able, whereof <hi>Huntſimond</hi> a knight
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21992:73"/>
was Gouernour, (much eſteemed of among the Bourgonians) furniſhed with ten or twelue Enſignes of Fantaſsins, and three or foure hundred horſe, who at the firſt fight did not any waies ſhew himſelfe ſparing of powder and bullets, beſides they within ſhewed themſelues very ſlacke and loath to come out to the skirmiſhe, but as farre as the Bullets of their artillerie might play, they kept a loofe of, and perfourmed their dutie brauely enough almoſt foure houres, while the skirmiſh laſted. In theſe light reencounters there were hurt the Captaine <hi>Breul</hi> with a Harquebuze ſhotte in the thigh, and yong <hi>Molimont</hi> Sonne to <hi>Molimont</hi> the Gouernor of Saint Dizier and of Nogent, who afterwards dyed at Peronne: during the skirmiſh the Admiral with a ſmal company went round about the place, and found it pregnable, the rampier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bad ſtuffe, and the faſtening wherewith it was made but a thinne crumpled ſand, which is no good earth. But the greateſt difficultie of all was the remediles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of water, albeit that the Conſtable had cauſed a great number of Pyoners to ſeeke out Conduit heads and ſprings, but no vaines of any laſting could be found out, ſo the determination of the ſiege was broke of and put ouer vntill another time: during this lingering there arriued at the Court the Cardinall of Saint George, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Legate from the Pope to treate of a peace or truce betweene theſe two Princes: At their departure hence, all the Villages, Abbaies and manſion places appertaining to the enemy, not ſo much as ſparing the windmilles neere to the gates of Bapaulme, being partely conſumed, and the reſt as yet of a flame and ſmoking, the ground and waies grew ſo durtie and ſlipperie, by reaſon of a whole day and nights raine, that the Souldiers and footmen could hardly get to their other lodging, named Morlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court within two ſmall leagues of Peronne: and the waggons and baggage ſuſtained no leſſe, whereof as well the garriſon of Bapaulme, as the reſt of the Peſantes about got good booties, ſpoyling the moſt ſcattered and worſt conuoyed ſorte of them: the imperiall armie in the meane time coaſted them within fiue or ſixe leagues, hauing the riuer as a barre and ſeparation betweene them, albeit it was farre leſſe then the French; for firſt euen at the noſe of the imperiall Campe, the French went and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſet fire on the Villages next vnto them, in reſpect of the fewe alarmes which they gaue vnto the French, except it were ſometimes vpon their vallets and foura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the which they rather ſuppoſed grew by the ſpoyled and deſperate Peſants, then by the men of warre: and leſſe hurt was done to the victualers &amp; prouiſions brought into their Campe, all victuals being at a competent rate in the middeſt of an enemies Countrie, where they found nought but Granges voide of Corne and fourage, all ſorte of victuals being already tranſported and withdrawne into the ſtrong holdes. The which being come vnto the Kings knowledge,<note place="margin">The deſſein of Charles 5. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt the French.</note> and ſufficiently foreſeeing that his enemy hoped and attended nought els then to make him temporiſe about ſome towne or other enterpriſe of ſmall conſequence, to drawe him on vntill the ſeaſon of raynes, which beginneth ſoone enough in the colde and occidentall Countryes, to the end to ruine and weaken him, as well in cutting of all his victuals, as by diſeaſes and coldes, afterwards to giue him battaile vpon his aduantages, concluded with his Councell to giue remedy thereto. The reſolution then was to reduce his enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two extremeties, the one of which he perſwaded himſelfe was vnpoſsible for him to ſhunne, and perhaps yeeld to them both: either to hold his forces cloſe together for the meeting of a battaile, or to ſeperate them for the defence of ſo many of his places, vncertaine which of them all ſhould be firſt attempted by the King, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſecret of his deſſein, and the variable turning of his army, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reſolution of the place whether it would turne head, vpon which perſwading

himſelfe of the aduantage of the firſt, and that the Emperour durſt not hazard a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall combate, conſidering he had not ſo many men as himſelfe, and that they were more then halfe tired with the long time that they had remained in the fielde, hee thoroughly reſolued to get by force, ſleight, or any other meane: the firſt place hee ſhould attempt, and to ſacke it, and ruine the whole countrie about in the eye of the Maiſter, and ſo to returne in triumph, as hauing braued and cauſed him to refuſe the day in his owne Countrie, and whereof he had vaunted himſelfe to be the firſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger. <hi>Charles</hi> on the other ſide meaſuring his aduantage rather by the valour then number of his people, ſupplying otherwiſe the long weariſomnes of theſe trauailes of warre, by diſcretion of well chooſing his aduantage, rather then to accept of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, no leſſe aſſured himſelfe to make vaine the attempts of the French in any place which they ſhould goe about to beſiege; alwaies prouided that his would haue the patience to ſuffer the firſt heate of the French, a little to euaporate as into ſmoake, knowing that <hi>Henry</hi> notwithſtanding the better to preuaile therein, made account to ſound Cambray, as well for that the taking thereof would be an example to ſundrye other of renowne, as thinking to prouoke the imperials rather to battaile, then that they would loſe ſuch a place, in which eſpecially he knew his owne credite not to be ſo deepely rooted, but that for a ſmall matter the inhabitants would ſhake of the yoke which not long before he had impoſed of them: ioyne that the towne hauing beene alwaies Neuters, ſuch occurrents might ſo happen, as he might make it partaker with him, or at the leaſt fauourable, if they would aſsiſt to the recouering of their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liberty, conſidering that in terming it ſelfe Neuter, it was not lawfull for him to haue any greater authoritie ouer it then the King, and the rather for that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and popular ſorte began to feele themſelues outraged by the vſurpation which he had made ouer them (hauing proceeded ſo farre to his own aduantage, as to build a citadell to keep them in ſubiection) he feared leaſt they would euen make plaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture to the King, being as then the ſtronger. In ſumme, if the Imperialles ſhewed themſelues of good courage, the French cauſed no other brute to runne, but of the deſire they had to battaile, and how the King ſought no other occaſion then ſuch as the place and time yeelded vnto him: to wit, being there at hand in ſo large and ſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a plaine, to preſent battaile, or to ſummon the Towne according to the accord of neutralitie, to make him onuerture, and giue him victuall, or proclaime it as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and ſo not farre from that place neere to Peronne, the French were encamped a two little leagues from Cambray. And the next morrow by break of day the King cauſed his army to be ſet in order of battaile ready to fight, ſending a herald of armes to ſummon the towne of her duety, ſignifying vnto them that he was not come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oppreſſe them, but rather to reſtore and ſettle them in their auntient libertye, which he well knew had beene already corrupted by the Emperour, of which if they would be reuenged and leaue that bondage, they could not haue better meanes then by his comming, that if the Emperour would quarrell for other aduantages, hee was there in perſon both to declare, and fight with all his forces to the contrary: if they did otherwiſe, they would be an occaſion of much miſcheefe to themſelues; firſt in loſing the title and priuiledge of being called Neuters, which is not affectionate to either the one or the others quarrels, by which meanes they had onely obtained the liberty to be able to traffique in both their Countries. Moreouer they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exempt their Countrie round about from the miſeries of the warre, otherwiſe they ſhould remaine for euer ſubiect to impoſts, loanes, ſubſidies, and all other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exactions, and be beſides that in danger to be partaker of the ſundrye trauayles
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21992:74"/>
whereto a particular Country is abandoned and accuſtomed to ſuffer for his Prince. In ſumme they demaunded twiſe foure and twenty houres of the King to be adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof, and to yeelde their anſwere, ſo the King cauſed his Campe to retyre a great league further backe, being lodged at Creuaecaeur, of the appertenances of the Queene, and it was proclaimed thoroughout the whole armye, that vpon a great paine of corporall puniſhment no man ſhould dare take ought within the territorye of Cambray without paying for the ſame. During this delay the Emperours partye within Cambray certified him of this ſummons, as then lying at Breuxelles, who to comforte and releeue them with hope and courage, ſet downe many thinges vnto them: among the reſt that they helde of the Chamber of the Empire, and that hee was the Emperour to defend and protect them, not a King of Fraunce who ſought nothing but their ruine; ſo as hauing ſet before their eyes the example of Metz, hee promiſed the deputies that in caſe they ſhould be beſieged, hee would ſuccour them by all meanes whatſoeuer. And from thence gaue order to the Prince of Piemont, who was gotten with his army towards Valenciennes, that hee ſhould yeelde vnto them as much ſuccour as they would demaund, or well needfull for them, ordaining thereto for cheefe and principall Gouernours the Earls of Boſſu and Brabanſon. The time of delay being expired, albeit the King knew well all theſe newes,<note place="margin">Their anſwere of Cambray to the King.</note> yet hee ſent againe to ſummon them to knowe their reſolution, but they ſent worde that if it might ſo pleaſe his Maieſtie they were all content to remaine his humble neighbors and freends, no waies refuſing to giue him victuals, but that as yet they were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ouer their owne goods, for that the Emperor ſpight of their teeth had put men and great garriſons into their towne, wherefore it was cleane out of their libertye and power to be able to diſpoſe of any more. Vpon this anſwere and mylde excuſe the towne was adiudged for enemy, and the ſame day being the eight of September, the Conſtable with two regiments of men at armes,<note place="margin">Skirmiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cambray.</note> and <hi>3.</hi> or 400. light horſe and Rire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, followed by the Admirall with ten Enſigns of French fantery, went to prie and view round about, but in ſteede of hearing the crowing of Poultrie before, now nothing was heard but Cannons, harquebuze ſhot, and noyſe of all partes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the cytadell, which made the earth to tremble with the artillerie ſhot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they played vpon the French ſouldiers, entring therewith as thicke out of the Towne as waſpes vſe out of the hole of a tree after him that ſtirreth them: but ſo maintained and the skirmiſhes ſo gallantly handled, that they continued ſixe whole dayes togither, in one of which there was killed <hi>De Breſe</hi> captain of one of the French guardes, and before the Cytadell <hi>Coruet</hi> was ſlaine, Captaine of one of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the French footmen. Of the Bourgonians there was of reputation taken and brought priſonners the Earle of Pondeuaux of the French Countie, <hi>De Trelon</hi> of the Duchie of Luxembourg, and other. In the meanetime <hi>Bourdillon</hi> ſent vnto the King by <hi>Neuuy</hi> Enſigne of his companie, two Cornets of Bourgonians, broken and defeated at La Haiette, neere to Maubert Fontaine, the Gouernour of Cimetz, one of their cheefe remaining there priſonner, the Baſtard of <hi>Auanes</hi> another of their cheefe leaders by his good ſpeede and well flying, ſauing himſelfe.

               </note> diſcouered well eight hundreth or a thouſand paces in breadth, not ſo plaine notwithſtanding but there is a little deſcent ſtill vnto the Towne hauing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſmall bottomes and barricades betweene both, but I call it plaine for that it is not ouerſhadowed with trees, nor thornes, nor other places hindring the proſpect; on the weſt ſide where it is moſt lowe and the ſuburbs lye, there are gardens and groues of willowes, with ſome medowe and marſhe. Southwards there is a little hanging plaine towards the Towne, and a little further there are little hilles and vallyes, on the North ſide is a little Mountaine which taketh parte of the coigns of the citadell mounted ouer the higheſt parte of the whole towne, where there was wont to be an Abbey or Cathedral Church, almoſt ſquare, notwithſtanding one of the coigns ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth more towardes that little mountaine, then any part of the reſt, reſembling a coyne in forme of a ſpurre, ſeruing for a defence to the flankers with a platforme. As touching the ſcituation and foundation of the Citadell, one would iudge it at the firſt apparance white earth, as marſe, if it were ſtone within, I would thinke it tender and eaſie to be hewen, as you ſee aſcler whereof ſome houſes are builded, but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a white chalke then a hard ſtone, ſo as ſome holde that it was rather builded to holde the newter towne in ſubiection, then to make an impregnable fortreſſe for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned to the Towne as it is, it were needfull to fortefie it, the one to ſuccour the other, by reaſon that the towne being taken would endemnifie the Citadell, which alſo being forced would be the cauſe of the loſſe of the Towne: but the Emperour partely in conſideration that this great towne would hardly be fortified, or at the leaſt not of a great and long time, and partely for that he would not oppreſſe the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with ſuddaine ſurcharges, firſt builded this little citadell, to ſet one foot within, and to be meet with the mutynies &amp; rebellions of the citizens, to the end that by little and little he might make himſelfe maiſter of the whole. Therefore they helde out thorough the hope of a great number of men ſent vnto them, furniſhed with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, munitions and all other neceſſaries: beſides the Imperiall armye which fortified it ſelfe neer vnto them, to cut of victuals, and annoy as much as might be the French: and laſtly the raines which euer begin at that ſeaſon in thoſe low Countries, ſo great preſumptions had they to recouer the ſiege, for beſides the diuers alarms which they gaue vnto them, with continuall and hot skirmiſhes, they ſent out of the campe part of the field peeces, and cauſed it to be giuen out, that there were farre greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Amiens, Corbie, S.

The other was not ſo ſtrong as the firſt, for that it was but a skuruie poulier of earth hanging houelwiſe to the halfe of a great towre, with drye ditches, where they within ſtanding very obſtinately to their defence, notwithſtanding any ſummons, made aboade two ſhot of the leſſer ſorte, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which hauing anſwered that they would not yeelde without ſight of the Canon, they made a ſigne to yeelde, but it was too late, for the Souldiers not as yet colde of their firſt furie, neuer ſtayed ſo long as the once diſcharging of a Canon, but ruſhed in as madde men to beate downe the gates, where afterwardes it was great pittie to beholde the ſlaughter which was there made, for there was not ſo much as one man taken to mercye: the battaile lay encamped round about the Caſtle of Cambreſy, without ſuffering any bodye to goe in ſauing one Enſigne, the which was lodged there to repell other, if they ſhould goe about to make any ſtirre: for the inhabitants were in great doubt what ſhould befall them. His Maieſtie and the moſt parte of the Princes and great Lordes was lodged in a ſumptuous houſe of pleaſure neere hand, which appertained to the Biſhop of Cambray, where in ſtead of being reuenged of the burning of his Caſtle of Foulembray, which was done by <hi>Du Reux</hi> a kinſeman of the B. he not onely ſtraitely forbad they ſhould not ſet it on fire, but that nothing ſhould be carried thence or ſpoyled. A little aboue the riuer the Conſtable remained with the Vantgarde. Now all theſe boutes and deuiſes were but to marke the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies countenance, for the French being aduertiſed that they ſtirred in no ſorte of the worlde to followe them, without any alarme, or ſemblance to come vpon them, hauing ſoiourned a whole day in that place, deſcended downe to Queſnoy, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching within two leagues of Valenciennes, where the imperial army was imparqued within a forte which they had there addreſſed.

Their forte was about a Culuerin ſhotte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Valenciennes, vpon the ſame Riuer of Leſcau which paſſeth along by Cambray, compaſſed in forme of a ſquare, enuironed with trenches and diches of a Pikes length, and betweene 10. or 12. foote hollow, ſeated halfe on the hanging of the hill towards Valenciennes, and halfe in the bottome along the Riuer, hauing on the ſide of the French a little hillock which went ſloping euen to the forte: beſides that it was very proper to place there the artillerie, and ſhot leuell into the fort, with great diſcommodities, therefore euen as the armye marched their ordinary pace in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the auante couriers and light horſe ruſhing before to attack the skirmiſh, found a great number of their Cauallerie already in order of battaile vpon the little hillock ready for the Combate. And hard by they tooke one of the Countrie on Horſeback in habite of a Marchant, ſome iudging him to be a ſpie, who certified them that the auantgarde of the Imperialls had paſſed the riuer to come to fight with them, ſo as being brought vnto the Conſtable, and from him ſent vnto the K. hee was the cauſe of the aduancing forward of the army, and with as much ſpeede as might be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the battailes in their places. In the meanetime the skirmiſh grew warme, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the ſallye of a number of the imperiall fantaſſins, which greatly annoyed the loſt children, without any ſtirring of their men at armes at all, who kept themſelues a little aboue them, ſauing ſuch as ſometimes went out of their ranckes to breake a Launce where they ſaw their opportunitie againſt the French, light horſe encamped front to front. During theſe skirmiſhes the Imperiall armye ranged it ſelfe, part into

one onely ſquare battaile within the forte, and the reſt was deuided by the flankers, eſpecially the Harquebuze ſhot, in the ſame manner as they vſe at the aſſaulte of a Town. The artillery was planted one part vpon mounts of earth, which drew aboue the hillock that I ſaide was one the ſide of the French, and the reſt was diſpoſed as well to ſcoure the defences, as all along the trenches.

In the battaile were two other ſquare battaillons, that on the right ſide was of the olde Enſignes, in number 25. In this wing was the King with his whole houſholde and gardes, and the Marſhall of S.

In this wing were the Prince of Ferrara, the D. of Guiſe, the Prince of La Roche ſur-yon with their Regiments of demilances, eche one 600. men at armes, the Captaines <hi>Momus</hi> &amp; <hi>Eurard,</hi> two of the moſt ancient and beſt experimented, had the leading of the loſt children. Now for ſo much as the fielde was very fit, plaine and champion neer hand a great league, the whole was ſo equally handled, that it hung with one ſame weight and meaſure, eſpecially the ſpaces which remained betweene the battailons of the footemen, and the rankes of the men at armes were ſo well compaſſed, that it ſeemed vnpoſsible to the French, (without ſome very great deſaſtere) that any harme at all ſhould happen vnto them: for to begin with the battailons of the footemen. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereof was ſo well eſtabliſhed, as that the author ſeemed to take the inuention thereof from the practiſe of the Romanes, that if the firſt rankes were at any time put backe, they ſhould retire into the ſecond, and the firſt and ſecond into the third, ſo might they three times reſemble and fight vnto the very laſt,<note place="margin">An inuention of the French ſo to order, as all their troupes in one day ſhould fight in battaile, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romanes.</note> each battaillon hauing his flankers of pikes and harquebuſiers which were able to make head in all places, and ſuccour as well the horſemen, as the core of their battailons: The whole was ſo well armed and couered, that when the Sunne had ſhone, you would haue iudged all thoſe troupes to haue bene heapes of Siluer. As for the horſemen each regiment extended farre, ſo as there were alwaies 200. men at armes in a front, and their ſuite of Archers at their backe all along, in ſuch ſorte as if a man at armes had beene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the ſecond had ſtraight ſtept into his place, ſo as they had al meanes to fight euen to the very laſt. The Enſignes of the men at armes were in the midſt, and the Guidons in the midſt of the ranke of the Archers: as touching the light cauallery, it was deuided into foure ſquadrons, that of the vantecourriers which was at the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh was led by <hi>Paul, Baptiſta</hi> and <hi>Sanſac</hi> kept the other in ambuſh within a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, on the hanging of a ſmall mountaine on the left hand, the Prince of Nemours had an other behinde a little hill betweene the army and the forte of the imperialles

And the prince of Conde lay in ambuſh with his in a little bottome al along the high way to the Towne, to ſtoppe the paſſage that way. Touching the artillerie,<note place="margin">How the artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ordered and diſpoſed.</note> that of the vantgarde was vpon the front of the right wing, and that of the battaile vpon the hanging of a little hillock, on the lefte hand of the Zuizers and Griſons, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made an end of their ceremonies, with intention to fight and dye euen to the very laſt man, before they would make one falſe pointe. Now beſides that the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſo many men was able enough to put courage into the moſt faint harted,<note place="margin">The K. preſence giueth great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Souldiers.</note> the preſence of their King ſet them a gog much more, who being accompanied with a great traine of Princes and other great Lords, went notwithſtanding to viſite and encourage ſuch as had any neede, with ſo ſweete and amiable language, ſtirred vp with ſuch vehemency and affection, that eche one ſeemed moſt willing to dye for his ſeruice. Now his whole army being thus ranged in order of battaile, and the skirmiſh growing more and more eager on the one parte and the other, the Imperiall caualery ſtood ſtil, and ſeemed euer ready to al euents vpon the little hillock. And ſo were they attending their comming more then three long houres, a brute of their comming flying vp and downe ſo long among the French, that night at the laſt approched. In the end the Conſtable foreſeeing that they cunninglye delayed vntill the night grew darke, either to ſurpriſe or put them out of order, aduiſed the light Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerye to ioyne together to ſeeke out the height of the Imperiall Cauallerie.<note place="margin">The charge of the French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallerie.</note> The which was readilye executed, but with ſuch a cheerefulneſſe and dexteritye, that they beate them backe, and liuelye droue them in leſſe then nothing, euen to the very boorde of their Trenches, cauſing them almoſt all to fall huddle vpon one anothers tayle into them; where of the French ſide of reputation was ſlaine <hi>Ienlis</hi> a gentleman of the Duchie of Bourgondie, hauing beene brought vp of a Page in the Kings houſe: it was then that their artillerie, as well that of the flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as that which was vpon the mountes of earth, began to play their priſe, the which killed ſome, and hurte more of the French then were found to haue beene hurte by any handſtrokes. Among the reſt there was ſlaine the Captaine <hi>Steph</hi> an Italian Gentleman, Lieutenant of the companyes of light horſe to the Captaine <hi>Senetaire,</hi> and <hi>De Ferriere</hi> Lieutenant of the companies of light horſe to <hi>Giury</hi> of the houſe of Eſtanges. This bickering endured for all that more then a long houre, where on the French parte there was ſlayne of horſe and foote about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, ſo as when the retraite was ſounded the Sunne was alreadye ſet, and the night cloſed in. Now had the Councell long debated, whether they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle them euen within their owne forte or no, conſidering the good happe of their firſte charge. But the better parte were of opinion that they were rather to content themſelues, in that they had already done them ſo great ſhame in their own Countrye, as not onely to haue executed a parte of their Princes will, but to haue preſented vnto them the battaile,<note place="margin">Conſultation whether the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were to be aſſailed within their own forte or no.</note> which they ſtill threatned to doe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and now coldely enough and with a ſlender excuſe had refuſed. Their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not to attempt any further were; firſt that the French Souldiers were growne wearye and faynte, as well with marching as with the weight of their armour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the enemies were freſh and repoſed, not hauing for certayne dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther runne the fielde. That the Countrie was theirs, and their proper enheritance, which would encourage them to fight the more couragiouſly. Ioynt that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſcituation of the place, they could not be aſſailed but to their great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, as the battaile of Poitiers and La Bicoique might well ſerue for example. Likewiſe that the French were not onely to fight at the firſt forte, from which though it were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21992:77"/>
loſt, the Imperials might eaſily retire into the towne, ready to begin a freſh; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they ſhould be able to doe both the one and the other, the French ſhould be ſure to be the firſt which ſhould take all the paine and hazard of the enterpriſe, a good parte of them lefte behinde in gage, if not all, as well for that it is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie or nature of a Zuizer or Lansknet, to aſſaile a towne or fortreſſe, as in that they are not otherwiſe ſo affectionate or enclined as ſubiects are to their Prince, whereby if it ſhould ſo happen that the K. ſhould be in an enemies Countrye, vnfurniſhed of the better parte of his forces,<note place="margin">Retraite of the French.</note> it were to be feared that many miſcheefes would enſue, according to the vncertain occurrence of feates of armes. And therefore it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it was far better to retire with honor, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hazard ought vnder the hope of an vncertain &amp; aduenterous good luck, ſo they placed againe the battailons of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in ſingle ordinance: afterwards they returned to the place where their baggage was loſt, the Conſtable with all the Demilances and Cauallerie of the vantgarde, was the laſt which departed to ſee if they would play the wagges in the end, and ſet vpon them behinde, which they neuer once offred; ſo as by the light of the fires which burned the Farmes and villages for three leagues round about, the French in the end found their firſt lodging, where at night it was propoſed in councell by ſome Lords, that there was very great meanes and occaſion offred to returne againe to ſeek out the enemye, to fight with them, and enforce them within their owne forte, for that by the reporte of ſome priſonners which were newlye come thither, it was not of ſo great defence as it was adiudged: aſſuring that on the South ſide in the bottome by the riuer it was very weake, and that there their trench was not perfited nor fiue foot high, that there would be meanes enough to pitch and order the battailes, and to make it be aſſailed by the loſt children, whilſte that the artillerye planted vpon the hillockes of the flancker ſhould ſhoote leuell in. The which would either make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come out in diſorder and ſo quit the place, or ſuffer themſelues to become a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marke to ſo many Cannon ſhot, as would ſhoure downe vpon them. But albeit that this aduice was at the firſt allowed for ſound, yet after that the olde and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Captaines, had deliuered their minde, and ſpoke as they thought good, they found that the latter opinion was the more ſure: following which, after one dayes abode to refreſh themſelues, the army retired towards the caſtle of Cambreſy, where likewiſe the French remained another daye, without ſetting fire either on that fayre houſe, or the towne, onely all the victuals within were taken out, for that the enemies ſhould not be releeued therewith. Afterwardes they retired as farre as Fonſomme, two ſmall leagues from S. Quentin: and there was the army diſſolued about the 20. of September,<note place="margin">Retrait &amp; depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the French army.</note> for the Zuizers well paid and contented, had leaue to retire into their owne Countrie, and parte of the Garriſons was put all along the frontiers, and the reſt ſent home to the gouernement of their Captaines: as much was done with all the Nobles and rirebands. The other parte of the Demilances and light Caualle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">The Marſhall. S. Andre ſent with part of the army to recouer the County of S.

Thus was the voyage of the French armye, more remarquable for fires, ruynes, ſackings, and all other ſorte of deſolations, by th'example: and in reuenge of the Hannuyers and Bourgonians ouer France, then for any tricke of notable vertue, ſauing a braue skirmiſh which the Vidaſme of Chartres made before Liſſars, with fifteene Enſignes of French Fanterie, and almoſt two thouſand horſe, againſt nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Enſignes of the Spaniſh Fanterie which lay encamped about the little towne, for that the inhabitants had ſhutte the gates vpon them, fearing to be ſacked by them as their neighbours had beene. The skirmiſh laſted almoſt a whole day, eche partye being obſtinate to the gaining of the victory, which after a long hazard &amp; vncertaine combate, remained to the French, very few of them being either dead or hurte, but many more of the Spaniards, whereof in like ſort diuers were brought away priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. After all this coyle the French returned to Anchy, and about Hedin,<note place="margin">Count Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue.</note> where the Almanes were put in garriſon, the bayliwick whereof was giuen by the King to the Count <hi>Reingraue.</hi> In ſumme towards the end of the moneth of October, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies as well of the French Fanterie, as light cauallerie being caſt, the reſt were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and put into garriſons, to paſſe ouer the winter which drew on.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperour proceeded on to purſue a marriage betweene his ſon the K. of Spaine, and the infant <hi>Mary</hi> new Q. of England, with ſuch earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as he forgot nothing which might ſerue to the conſummation thereof;<note place="margin">A marriage trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the K. of Spaine, and the infant Mary new Q. of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> ſeing him ſelfe almoſt out of all hope to haue ſuccour elſewhere, or recouering of any monie at neerer hand: which many of that Realme ſought to hinder foreſeeing an immortal warre with the French, which was prepared for them by this meanes; remembring well the loſſes and damage which they had alreadye ſuſtained, in hauing vpholden the warre againſt this nation, from whence the Countrie of England reaped great commodities.

Vnder the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon, might be nine or ten thouſand footmen, the moſt parte Picardes, and the reſt of the olde Enſignes, with three hundred men at armes, and fiue or ſixe hundred horſe, and Harquebuziers on horſeback. Vnder the Conſtable were fiue and twentye En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of French fanterie new and olde, two Regiments of Germanes of the Count <hi>Reingraue</hi> and <hi>Reifberg,</hi> and fiue and twenty Enſignes of Zuizers, with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at armes, and neere eighteene hundred or two thouſand as wel light horſe as Harquebuziers on horſeback, whereof the Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> was Generall, a little before come out of priſon, and almoſt as many nobles in the Rireband, vnder <hi>La Iaille</hi> their General, there were alſo ſome companies of Engliſh and Scottiſh Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerye.

The Conſtable hauing taken his waye towardes Mauber Fontaine, the 23. of Iune, fained as though hee would addreſſe himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Auanes; the common brute being that hee went to beſiege it: but as ſoone as the Enſignes of France were diſcouered by thoſe of the plaine Countrie, they abandoned Villages, boroughs, Caſtles, and other places, conſtrained for their ſurety to retire within the Ardennes, with the better parte of their moueables and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, eſteeming themſelues (conſidering the places vnacceſſible, thorough the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of being able to bring artillerye) exempt and out of all perilles, amidſt the thickeſt of thoſe woods, by reaſon whereof they were able the more eaſilye to ruyne the Village and Caſtle of Cimetz, the Caſtles of Trelon, Glaion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, and other little fortes neere hand.

Abandoning thus this forte, hee ſet fire of all the houſes and ſurplus of the reſt of the village, whereby the Vaſtadors ordained thereunto by the D. were eaſed of much paines, A Church likewiſe which the Ardennois had cauſed to bee fortified called Fort de Iadines, was found open and abandoned, which in like ſorte was all razed, and beaten downe ſauing a great ſquare tower, whoſe coynes and faſtnings in the building were

In ſomme al the villages, faire enough co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the barrenes of the Countrie, were burned and deſtroyed.

Reporte being made vnto him, how the ſouldiours had brought great booties out of the woods, with a number of women and young may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, knowing that in this furie of warre, they could hardly helpe and protect them ſelues, he made them all to be ſhut vp, with commandement vpon paine of life not to do them any force or violence: but to bring them all into a certaine lodging, wher hauing vſed great liberalitie towards the ſouldiers, he made them be ſafely kept vntill the next morrow that the Campe was departed. And then vpon the reporte of the Harrowlde of Angonleſme, how they of Beaurin ment not to yeeld except they ſaw the Cannon, they marched thitherwards. Hereupon ſuch as were appointed to take the view were receiued by them with the bullets of many harquebuſes a croc,<note place="margin">The Caſtle of Beaurin ſummo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned.</note> and muskets, willing to ſhew that they were prouided as well of courrage as other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſo attending vntill fower Cannons were preſented vnto them, readie to giue fire. But finding what danger they were in, and being aduertiſed that if they did not yeeld they ſhould all paſſe at the ſwords point, and ſuch as eſcaped by the hangmans hand, after hauing a while parlied and demaunded to eſcape life and goods ſaued, they were in the end reduced to this extreamitie, that they ſhould yeeld themſelues to the good mercie and pleaſure of the Prince: who cauſed the chiefe of them to bee kept priſoners, and ſent away the reſt of the pettie companions, euery man a white ſticke in his hand. <hi>Iohn Colichart</hi> borne at Bains in Heinault Captaine of this Caſtle, was led away priſonner with 40. of his beſt ſouldiers.<note place="margin">Beaurin Caſtle yeelded.</note> Among which was the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the forte of Iadines, named <hi>Le Grand Gerard</hi> and <hi>La Loſſe,</hi> of whome I ſpoke before Captaine of Vilargy, who was not put at all to any ranſome, but ſent backe ſhortly after to Meſieres, there to be puniſhed as a traytor. The D. of Neuers lodged within the Caſtle a companie of foote of the olde enſignes, and 50. harquebuſieres on horſebacke. At their departure from this ſiege, each man began to reioyce, that he ſhould out of this grieuous and painefull deſert, and enter into Liege a countrie ſo pleaſant and delectable: taking their diſcent by the ports of Giuets the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon, the ryuer of Meuſe.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21992:80"/>
farre as that the light cauallerie had more then once skirmiſhed before it as though they ment to view it, albeit it was well ſtrengthened with a Garriſon &amp; other muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being notwithſtanding aduertiſed how Mariembourge had but a bare ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Garriſon, and that ſmall, the moſt couertly that was poſsible, cauſed the Marſhall S. <hi>Andre</hi> to depart with the Suiſers, and ſome companies of French foote, aſsiſted with two or three thouſand horſe, and the moſt part of the artillerie, who made ſo good ſpeede, hauing all that night cleared the waies and Lanes, which the enemies had ſtopped, and hedged in. As the 23. of Iune, at ten of the clocke in the morning, he was come with all his troupes before Mariembourg. Whereat they within being altogether aſtoniſhed, and much more the night after when they vnderſtoode that the ſuccours which they attended were driuen backe, and no poſsibilitie for them to enter, yet to ſhew themſelues as men not diſmaied, they played infinitly with the Cannon, which for all that would not ſerue the turne, any whit at all to ſtaie theſe new come gueſts from beginning their approches and trenches. So as the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Conſtable being ariued with the reſt of the armie, and ſeeing the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this ſiege, to bring it to a better end, he cauſed the approches to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with ſuch diligence, as the third day of the ſiege, hauing made fiue or ſixe Voleys of artillerie onely to breake the defences, a parley was requeſted by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiedged. In ſomme many of their Articles being refuſed, they condeſcended in the end to yeelde vp the place to the K. liues and goods ſaued, all ſauing armor, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and artillerie, and <hi>De Rinſart</hi> remained priſoner with the Captaines and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals of the Cittie. Which being well ſtored with al munition of an ineſtimable price, was thus yeelded vp the 28. of Iune, 1554. Whereat the K. much reioyſing, ſhortly after departed towards Laon,<note place="margin">Mariembourg taken by the French.</note> ther to find againe his armie the laſt day of the month. The which in ſigne of ioye at his ariuall was pitched in order of battell, and the whole artillerie diſcharged, yeelding a maruellous report and eccho betweene the woodes and the rockes of the Ardennes, giuing notice to the reſt of the imperiall townes of the yeelding vp of this. Which in reſpect it was the rampart of the whole countrie was wel enough fortified. It had beene in former times a litle village where all aſſemblies for any great hunting ſtill met, in which Q. <hi>Marie</hi> tooke ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But for that ſhee found the ſeate thereof very proper and delectable, ſhee fell a building there ſparing nothing which was any waies requiſite to the beautie or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification thereof, which ſhee would in farre better ſorte haue perfited, had not the K. taken it who not onely was ſtudious to finiſh what as yet was vnperfit, but better to fortifie and rampire it, then euer it was before: commaunding them of Mariem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, to name it from thence forwardes Henriembourg.</p>

Shortly after <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> was ſent thither from Diſnan: hauing already beene gouernour of Metz, who receiued the King, order to remaine Leiutennant generall at Mariembourg, at the hands of the D. of Neuers. Who at his departure from Ardennes, a little after the taking of the Caſtle of Beaurin, had ſent the Harrowlde of Angouleſme, with his trompetor, to ſummon the Caſtle, and towne of Diſnan, and to know whether the inhabitants determined to continue in newtralitie ſuch as was accorded in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Leige, or if they would hold out, for and in the name of whome, of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

The D. of Neuers being come downe with his armie, as farre as the ports of Giuets the firſt day of Iuly, found that the Caſtle of Agimont not yet yeelded, ſtanding on this ſide the Meuſe a quarter of a league from the other Giuets, albeit it had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſummoned. Notwithſtanding the ſame day hee made a number of his light Cauallerie to paſſe the water, with certaine companies of foote, to enuiron the Caſtle, attending the K. army which marched from Mariembourg of purpoſe to ioyne with them. Now as the vantgarde of the K. armie ariued, the footemen made ſemblance as though they would ſcale it, and giue the aſſault,<note place="margin">The K. armie.</note> which in the end turned to good earneſt, for the ſouldiers entred ſo farre and furiouſly in ſporte that they within could no longer ſuſtaine their aſſault. In ſuch ſort as they were compelled to acquite and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the defences, and to giue them entrance: ſo as being entred with furie, they put all to the ſword, that offred to make any reſiſtance, which was for al that no great number, nor men of any marke. And there was taken priſonner the Captaine of the Caſtle called <hi>Eurard de la Marche,</hi> owne ſonne to the Earle of Rochefort, Father to him who then liued, Lord of the place, and the moſt part of the reſt of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were ſent away the morrow after. The whole armie remained on this ſide at Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uets, encamped for the moſt part betweene the borough and the Caſtle, in a long &amp; ſpacious plane: and notwithſtanding that this great riuer made a ſeperation between the two armies, yet did not their kinsfolkes, friendes, neighbours, and companions faile continually to croſſe ouer to viſit and feaſt one another. The King himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with the good report which he had heard of the D. armie paſſed ouer in perſon to ſee it in battell on Wenſday the ſixt of that month, and found it in ſo good order, and equipage, that hee grew thereat much contented. Now there remained but a little forte called Caſteau Thierry which appertained to the Baylife of Namur, or elſe all round about was ſubiected to the K. obedience. Therefore there was ſent thither the ſame day a regiment of the French footemen, with artillerie, and ſome companies of horſe: but thoſe which kept it vnderſtanding what entertainment they had had at Agimont, neuer tarrying their comming quitte the place in good time; So was the Caſtle found emptie, and abandonned, but furniſhed with moſt faire moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables as was poſsible, and great quantitie of all ſorts of graine.

The next morrow the two armies encamped aboute the Towne and Caſtle of Diſnan and Bouines. The artillerie being planted vpon the height of an hollow thorough which the high way paſſed which went to the plane aboue, battered Bouines ſo furiouſly vntill three of the clocke at afternone,<note place="margin">Bouines furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly battered and taken by aſſault.</note> that a breach being made at a portail, and within a Tower, the aſſault was therewith all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and carried away with ſmall reſiſtance, being onely defended by them of the Towne it ſelfe, with whome it fared full ill for their labour: For vpon the firſt furie there was made a ſore ſlaughter, ſome thinking to ſaue themſelues leaped into the water: and yet for all that they coulde not eſcape death, the moſt part of them being
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21992:81"/>
ſlaine with Harquebuze ſhot, whilſt that they dipped to the bottome of the water like Duckes. The reſt albeit that they had croſſed the riuer, and ſo taken priſonners by the French, were afterwards hanged, and ſtrangled: for hauing ſo raſhly reſiſted and held out againſt the K. power. True it is that in the recompence of the faire warres which the Spaniards made vnto the French, at the taking of Teroenne, the K. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſaued a number of their liues,<note place="margin">Forts puniſhed for holding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the K. power.</note> which were retired into the great Tower which ſtoode aboue the Towne. Afterwards of his great &amp; accuſtomed humanitie, he cauſed the women maidens, and young children to bee all ſaued, and gaue vnto them for their better ſafe conduct, a Harrowlde and a trumpetor. Now the verie ſame morning as the D. of Neuers hard by the Caſtle of Diſnan, would needes him ſelfe with <hi>Iamets</hi> goe neere to take the view, <hi>Iamets</hi> horſe next adioyning to his owne perſon was ſlaine with a Harquebuze a croc: himſelfe being warned there by, how ſuch cheefes of an armie ought not ſo venterouſly to expoſe themſelues to ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: for that day notwithſtanding the batterie was not begun, for that the artillerie came not time enough; but onely all the reſt of the day, many Cannons playde, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to breake downe the defences,<note place="margin">A chiefe of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ought not to be to ventrous.</note> and certaine Gabions, as well vpon the portaile, as at a little round Tower aboue the Towne, which greatly annoyed them: ſo as all that night was employed in making with al diligence the aproches and trenches, but not without great danger for the numerable ſhot, of artillerie &amp; Harquebuſes a croc which played from the Caſtle, without any murther for all that, or loſſe of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon other then miſerable pyoners. The next morning this Caſtle was ſaluted with thertie great peeces of artillerie, fiftene on the D. ſide, and as many on the Kinges on the other ſide of the riuer which gaue all along the hollow, and euen within the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Caſtle: ſo as a wall of Bricke which was the higheſt was perced thorough by day, they battered likewiſe in flancke, a great round Tower, at the corner of a core of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging which looked towardes the North. On the Dukes ſide was battered a great round Tower, ſeated at the end of the ſame lodging, cleauing to the bulwarke of the portall: and this thundering continued without ceaſing day and night vntill Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, about three of the clocke in the afternone, that theſe two Towers were rayſed and battered downe, and a breach made at the ende aboue this lodging about tenne pace long, notwithſtanding it was verie vneaſie to clyme, for that the Cannon could not faſten vpon the foote of the wall, being amaine Rocke. Ioynte, that they muſt be faine to creepe a Pikes length, and the aſcent was very ſlipperie, and vnſure vnder the ſouldiers feete, by reaſon of the earth and cement which continually fell vpon it. But for all this it was reſolued at the inſtant to giue the aſſault. And the Admirall led ſuch companies of French as were ordained thereto vnto the foote of the breach, praying and exhorting them with many faire, and gracious remonſtrances, to remember the immortall renowne, which the French had achieued for feates of armes thorough out the whole world: and of their dutie where with they ſtoode bounde for the faith and aſſurance which the K. repoſed in them, this ſpeech being ended, ſome Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes followed with their valiantteſt ſouldiers, marched on, and with an aſſured gate aduanced forward to clime vp: the Capitane <hi>Maugeron</hi> being one of the firſt, ſo as they within eſteeming him to be followed hard, and that the French would of them ſelues ſtoupe, and creepe in, ſet fire of a trayne which they had prepared, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quenched if the ſouldiers purſuing their enterpriſe had but aſſaied to enter the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies could neuer haue held out longer, the walls hauing beene alreadie ſo ſhaken &amp; broken with the artillerie, that it was vnpoſsible for them anie longer to endure. But if ſome of the French performed their part well, there were other which bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21992:81"/>
themſelues ſo coldly, that they haue left a very bad opinion of them. The Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane <hi>Saragoſe</hi> being enſigne colonel went to it verie brauelie and was ſore hurt, ſo did the Capitanes <hi>Gourdes, La Mole</hi> and <hi>Le Forte,</hi> whoſe enſigne bearer called <hi>Le Baſque</hi> was there ſlaine, and flong downe from top to the bottome, and his enſigne thrice taken vp, they ſtill being caſt downe which tooke it vp, ſo as at laſt it remained in the hands of a Gaſcon ſouldier named <hi>Fougaſſet.</hi> The Admirall Colonel of al the French fanterie, ſeeing his ſouldiers thus to waxe coole, excuſing themſelues by the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and euill acceſſe to the breach, to giue them hart began a little more ſeuerely to exhort them, ſhewing vnto them, that if in the K. preſence they would make no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe of their hardines the good reputation which they had heretofore gotten, would turne them to a farre greater reproch, and a perpetuall infamie. The which he had no ſooner finiſhed, but the further to ſet them in a heate hee began firſt himſelfe, and after him the more to encourage them, <hi>Monpeſat</hi> (albeit he had no charge at all in their bands) ſeaſed vpon one of their enſignes, and brauely before them all carried it vp to the top, where he couered himſelfe behinde certaine quarters and ruines of the wall which was fallen downe; calling them and making ſigne with the enſigne that they ſhould follow him. It was impoſſible for all that, to make them take any further courage vnto them: whereby ſome Captaines before well eſteemed of were very ill thought of euer after, of whome ſome were diſgraded, caſt from their charge, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red villanes and vnable to beare armes in the face of the whole armie, which witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their fault. As the night came on, ſo was the retreate ſounded. That day they of the Towne of Diſnan, yeelded themſelues at the mercy of the K. into the handes of the D. of Neuers: who forgetting their fooliſh and raſh wordes receiued them, and aſſured them of their liues, and that their Towne ſhould not be burned: to that ende the Capitaines <hi>Duras,</hi> and <hi>Boiſſe,</hi> were ſent with their companies of French fanterie: but albeit that theſe companies were lodged there for their aſſurance and ſafetie, yet could they not warrant them from the ſacke: for the Almanes of the new leauie, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that theſe companies had bene gotten in only to haue the ſacke among them, ranne thither vpon a huddle, and broke open the gates with hatches, crowes, and great beames: the reſt which had not the patience to tarrie, crept vp, and ſcalled the walles, leaping in, in a number of places, where they made a maruellous peece of worke: and not content with this, vnderſtanding how they had cauſed all the woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and young children to retire with certaine Cittizens into the great Church, they gathered together in troupes before it. And after that they had by violence beaten downe the gates, and porches of the temple: notwithſtanding any reſiſtance made to them by the French which were within, they rauiſhed and trayned out the men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, maidens, and young children: ſo as for that cauſe was rayſed a crueell medly betweene them and the French which would haue put them out. The which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that night and vntill the next morrow in the morning vntill the King ſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely to appeaſe this mutinie. And afterwards it was proclaimed thoroughout the whole armie, that euery man vpon paine of death ſhould deliuer vp the women of Diſnan: which he cauſed to be nouriſhed vntill their departure with his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, albeit that the ſouldiers themſelues were in great neceſſitie. After that the French were retired from the aſſault, the artillerie began on freſh to batter the Caſtle, to make the breach greater &amp; more eaſie, continuing the batterie all that night: while that they ſought other meanes to haue it by the fallings of the wall right againſt the breach making it more eaſie to clime. Notwithſtanding the 13. of Iuly about ſeuen of the clocke in the morning, they offred to parlie, and being admitted thereunto, there
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21992:82"/>
came out firſt <hi>de Floyon</hi> gouernour of the Caſtle, and <hi>Hamon</hi> Captaine of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who were conducted to the D. of Neuers tent: to whome hauing propoſed Articles, and it being reſolutely denied vnto them to carrie thence any weapon, artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, or enſigne, they agreed that they ſhould depart with ſworde and dagger, and ſome other trifling baggage. But <hi>Iulian</hi> the Capitane of the Spanniards, to keepe a kind of authoritie which that nation maketh it ſelfe much to be marked for in feates of armes, inſiſted with great perſwaſions that hee and his people might depart with their weapons: the which for all that the Conſtable would by no meanes graunt. Now while that they were reaſoning about this and ſundry other things, <hi>Bourdillon,</hi> and <hi>de Rabaudanges</hi> were ſecretly ſent to know, and conclude with the Spanniards whether they were willing to come foorth with like condition as the reſt: to which they moſt willingly conſented demaunding nothing but libertie. Wherefore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation being brought backe to the Conſtable, ſigned, and accorded, was ſhewed to <hi>Iulian,</hi> who after the Spaniſh faſhion making great exclamation ſaid that he one of the chiefe and principall of all did not conſent nor approoue it: and required with great importunacie that he might be conueied backe againe to the Caſtle, which he vndertooke to keepe onely with his Spaniſh companies: the which of fauour was graunted vnto him, with proteſtation, that if he were taken by force, he ſhould hope for nothing but to be the firſt hanged at the gate. Whereupon by leaſure his choller was moderated: hauing occaſion to thinke rather of the danger wherein he ſtoode, then to ſhut himſelfe vp with his ſouldiers, which deſired nothing but comming forth one after an other: the K. being ſtill preſent, who tooke great pittie of them, the moſt part of them being ſo worne and tyred, as they looked like frighted bodies, and true Anatomies, thorough the paines and neceſsities which they had endured: the whole amounting to aboue 800. of all ſortes, and there dyed one another about eight ſcore, or two hundred. <hi>Tauannes</hi> his companie was appointed to conduct the reſt in ſafetie the way of Namur, and this Capitane <hi>Iulian</hi> was kept priſoner, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the aunſwere which he had made, but for an other more eſpeciall occaſion. This Caſtle was reputed amongſt one of the ſtrongeſt and faireſt houſes of the B. of Liege, with B. <hi>Eurarde,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>La Marche,</hi> vncle to <hi>Iamets</hi> then liuing, had cauſed to bee reedified, vpon the olde ruines, but farre more excellent and ſtrong then euer it was before: likewiſe ſundrie other as Hue, Franchemont, Stoquehan, Bouillon, and Floranges. It is ſcituate vpon an huge Rocke, which may be about &amp; of circumference neere fower hundred paces, iſſuing from the ſide of a mountaine of great ſcope, vpon the riuer of Meuſe in forme ouall: vnacceſsible two waies, on the Towne ſide and on the riuers: verie vneaſie likewiſe on the ſide wher the breach was made, vpon the two fronts are two bulwarks, in halfe circles, or as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay in forme of horſe-ſhooes, the one vieweth and defendeth al the plaine of the mountaine, ſeruing for a platforme, the other aboue the Towne and riuer is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame ſorte, ſauing that it was not ſo high, and the vpper parte made of Bricke, no whit at all rampired. Within the Caſtle is a ſquare court of about fortie pace in Diamiter and widthe, inuironed with three great core of houſes, of a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous faire building and workemanſhip: propped vp vnderneath with great colomes, the moſt part guilt, ſpecled all with white and graye ſpots, of which was likewiſe all the foundations made, and the vpper part of Bricke. The vnder ſtorie was all inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with faire and long galeries and walkes: and aboue were many great romes proper and well fitted with Chambers and a Chappell taking light towards the Towne: without towardes the North ſtoode theſe two round Towers, which the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21992:82"/>
Cannon ruined euen to the verie foundations: and below a courtaine or falſe braye flankered with Torions which was almoſt broken downe &amp; battered. At the roote of this great Rocke all along the riuer ſtoode the towne, well builded &amp; adorned with houſes, ſcituated moſt properly for the bringing of al kind of marchandiſe, eſpecially copper, braſſe, and all ſorte of ruſſet colours: on the other ſide of the riuer about 200. pace off ſtandeth the towne of Bouines which is not much leſſe then Diſnan, of the Countie of Namur, and it is found that in auncient time the two townes made warlike wars together. Diſnan holding the party of <hi>La Marche</hi> which was for France, and Bouines of Burgondie. Diſnan being a neuter town loſt her neutrality, for at the apetite of their B. vncle to the Emperor to ſubiect themſelues to one particular, who by violence (ſaid ſome) did vſurp the Biſhoppricke of Liege, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Abbot of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu to whom his ſaid vncle had reſigned it. Whereupon the humanity and ſweetnes of this Prince was much to be marked, who by no meanes would haue the towne of Diſnan burned as Bouines was, but had regard vnto the ſubiection which the Caſtle ſo much commanding ouer, alwaies had the towne in: &amp; therefore in the moſt faire and ſtrongeſt part thereof, it was by his owne fault beaten downe and battered, for euer after to be an example, that neuter lands, &amp; eſpecially of the Church ought not to be partiall or cleaue to any one more then another.</p>
            <p>Whilſt that theſe two armies ſtaied about Bouines &amp; Diſna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other of the Prince <hi>de La Rocheſurion</hi> burning al the country of Artois was ſundry daies skirmiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by a number of Flemmings which ſided &amp; followed him continually to interrupt his purpoſe: whereof the Prince being aduertiſed, &amp; of their courſes which they ſtill kept betweene Arras and Bapaume, came ſo fitly vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hauing wrapt them in vpon the way, he charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch ſort that there lay aboue 200. &amp; of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall chefetaines ther were brought away priſoners, <hi>De Fama</hi> gouernor of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Cambray and his Leiutenant, <hi>Varluſet</hi> Capitane of the light horſe: ſo as if it had not bene for a good horſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>De Hauſimont</hi> gouernor of Bapaume was mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he was in as great danger to haue borne them company. Two Cornets of their cauallery were there defeated &amp; taken which the Prince ſent vnto the K. wherby he might be the more aſſured of the aduantage which he had ouer his enemies. The 15. day of the moneth many French marchants which by riuer had brought victuals to the campe, hauing ſold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and going back againe to Meſieres with their botes laden with booties, &amp; certaine ſouldiers, and the Capitanes <hi>Garragoſſe, Gourdes,</hi> and <hi>La Mole</hi> hurt in the former aſſaults, were reencountred by the Bourguignons not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uets, &amp; conſtraining them to come abord, killed part and part, they carried away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, among whom were theſe three captaines, to whom they made very faire war, &amp; gracious entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their faith.<note place="margin">Engliſh &amp; Scotts take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the ports of Giuets by the Bourguignons.</note> At their departure thence vnderſtanding how at Giuets were certain Engliſh &amp; Scottiſh companies pertaining to the French, they ſuddenly went to ſurpriſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and conſtrained them to retire into a houſe tenable enough, but brought away fowerſcore and ſixe of their horſes.</p>
            <p>The Emperor who as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lay at Bruxelles neer enough, being aduertiſed of al this, and how the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bruit of the camp went, that at their departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Diſnan they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to beſiege Namur, cauſed as many ſouldiers to be lodged ther as he eſtemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, knowing it otherwiſe but meanely fortefied for any artificial fortification, and that as a great number of men were needful for the aſſailing of ſo great townes, ſo as great &amp; careful diligence for their defence to be requiſite.

As ſone as the Prince was fortefied in this place, he ſcattered his Cauallerie vpon the way where he thought the victuals would paſſe for the French, as wel to weaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and giue them occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retire, as to learne &amp; know their determination cauſing a bruit to be ſowne, reported by ſpies and priſonners, that if they aduentured to march further, or to paſſe the riuer of Sambre to enter into Henault, he would preſent himſelfe a hed to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battel.<note place="margin">The Emperours armie vnder the prince of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</note> But the K. as not being ſo far entred into his enemies countrie to returne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing further, hauing likewiſe left the way of Namur, ſtaied to paſſe ouer the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Sambre, &amp; to burne the countrie of Henault, whereby he might make proofe of the imperiall forces: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence ſuch being returned as went to view the places &amp; way which the army muſt paſſe thorough, hauing ſent backe <hi>Bourdillon</hi> with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie to Meſieres to cauſe certain Bourgingnons to retire, which burned certaine vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages about, the K. raiſed his army from this place the 16. of Iuly to continue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: knowing notwithſtanding the difficulty to recouer victuals, &amp; how the enemie had gotten al within their ſtrong townes, &amp; broken down al mils, he thought good to aduertiſe the whole companies, to make prouiſion of as much victuals as was poſſible, euen ſo farre as to lade their horſes with prouiſion: the D. of Neuers remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the Meuſe ſide, as wel to make the ſurplus of prouiſions to be diſtributed, as to tarrie the rayſure of the Caſtle of Diſnan, and of all the reſt of the ſmall fortes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, whence he departed the 18. day of that month, and went to finde the King at Storne a ſmall village, where the Lord of the place, as he was ready to goe to dinner, was ſurpriſed by the light horſe. The next morning, at their diſlodging, that was ſet on fire, and all the villages round about. Now as the armie lying betweene theſe two riuers there was no meanes honorably to retire, but by the iſſue of an happie combat, ſo already and reſolute for the ſhow, marched in battell ſtraight to this riuer. Their couriers notwithſtanding hauing giuen as farre as the brinkes of La Sambre, founde not ſo much as one ſole man to make them reſiſtance, and paſſed forwards freely ſo as the whole cauallerie followed after, then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nterie and men at armes without the loſſe of any one vallet, were it not by ſome other accident. Likewiſe the imperials not finding themſelues ſtrong enough as then, contained themſelues cloſe within their fort, and inſteede of going out to ſeeke them, they were ſhut in and fortefied with good trenches the beſt that was poſsible. Notwithſtanding that night there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine troupes of their cauallerie diſcouered, which preſently drew backe into the woodes, hauing perceiued a number of French companies, which were ready to accoſt them. So the poore popular people abuſed with the hope, which they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the imperiall armie, were ſurpriſed within their houſes, with a mightie num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cattell, &amp; other moueables, not without great pittie: all the plaine countrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire and extreamely ruined, eſpecially one little Towne called Forces, within the countie of Aſſebais. This night they encamped on this ſide the riuer in a Copice, where the whole armie kept cloſe and well vnited, perceiuing the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to be but one league and a halfe of. The twentie day of the moneth the French armie beganne to make her entrie ſo furiouſly within the countries of Hanault, that there was nothing but fire, cries, flightes, and all thinges pittifull to heare, but much more to ſee, without ſo much as one burrow daring to make reſiſtance. All the people flying away from the reencounter of this horrible furie, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vntill euentide, that they encamped in the village of Iumets, very famous for

the two new forts which were there: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of which a number of imperials hauing bene aduanced thither to cut off the victuals from the army, had already giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſlip at the bruit of the vauntcouriers. Theſe Caſtles were in the ſtrongeſt places ruined &amp; raiſed. In this place the K. did an act worthie of a moſt Chriſtian Prince: for hauing beene told him by a guidon of the D. of Neuers company how a poore woman his hoſteſſe was deliuered of a faire ſonne, himſelfe would needs be godfather, carried it vnto the Font, &amp; their cauſed the Cardinall of Lorraine to Baptiſe it by the name of <hi>Henrie,</hi> beſtowing certaine preſents of him: beſides that he made it be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the houſe dore, to the end it might not be deſtroied nor ruined with the reſt. Thus is the houſe where the K. Chriſtned the child. This night the comte <hi>Roquendolphe</hi> with his piſtoliers, his regiment of Almanes, the D. of Bouillons companie,<note place="margin">An act of a moſt chriſtian K.</note> &amp; two ſmall field peeces, vndertooke to goe ſurpriſe the little Towne of Niuelle, the firſt town of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant: notwithſtanding finding it better furniſhed with men of war then he ſuppoſed he returned without doing ought elſe then burning the ſuburbs and villages abouts: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he broght away great booties. At their diſlodging thence the army drew ſtraight to Bains one of the principal townes of Hennault, leauing for all the waies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it nothing but flames of fire, ſmoke and all kind of calamitie: whome the D. of Sauoy ſtill followed with the imperiall army from lodging to lodging: giuen at their tayle as many alarums as he was able, to annoy and weaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being of himſelf grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued enough to heare and ſee the plaints of the miſerable common people ſo deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; ruined: to whom he could giue no other comfort, but ſay that they ſtill fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, &amp; he followed ſtil after to be reuenged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The 22. of Iuly the Towne of Bains being ſummoned, and no waies willing to yeeld, was moſt furiouſly preſented with the Cannon, and in another manner of ſorte then when <hi>D'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Alegre</hi> loſt his life there. Which hauing endured out ſixe volleyes of the Cannon, yeelded themſelues to the Kinges mercie, who for all that commaunded it to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and burned, not forgetting his Caſtle of Foulembray and other Townes of Picardie, which Q. <hi>Marie</hi> had before cauſed to be burned &amp; entirely ruined, at ſuch time as he was in Germanie. They did as much to a ſumtuous Caſtle which ſhe had newly cauſed to be built, repleniſhed with all exquiſite things as of ſundrie varieties of Marble, Tables, plate pictures, and emboſt ſtatues, colours of all ſortes, whereof notwithſtanding in ſmal ſpace was made great waſt &amp; deſtruction. <hi>De Bloſſe</hi> who was gouernour thereof was brought away priſonner, with the chiefeſt of marke which were found both there and within the towne: the K. ſtill vſing all meekenes towards the women, young maidens &amp; litle children, which he made be conducted &amp; put in ſafty, by a Harrowld, &amp; a trumpetor. Afterwards the ſame morning <hi>de Giry</hi> Leiutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the D. of Neuers company, was ſent with 4. other companies of men at armes, to keepe ſcoute to thoſe, which ſet fire on the Caſtle of Reux, which the late maiſter therof had cauſed to be reedified, and better maſonned then euer it was, when it was firſt builded, beeing vowted from the bottome to the toppe: from thence they were at Bais ſur Bais a village: afterwards at a litle towne of Bauets, very anucient firſt builded by the Troians, (as they of the country tell) which paſſed beyond the foreſt

The imperial armie ſtil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very neere, being better ſtrengthned as well by the ſuccours of Almanes which the D. of Brunſwich brought, of 2000. Reiſtres, which they cal in France Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toliers, as for that all the Emperors Garriſons, which hee had diſtributed among the towns which he had left behind were retired thither. The which cauſed the French to march in better order, &amp; cloſer then before: as alwaies ready to fight, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to another, for doubt of the enemy, being very vigilant, ſubtil &amp; couragious, wher he could ſpie any aduantage to aſſaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereat the Conſtable well aduiſing, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charges, &amp; enterpriſes, which the enemie might giue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their skirts, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily remained there with the vauward, and diſlodged euer laſt. Thus the alarums re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled at their departure thence, hauing as it were couped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in betwene ſix great Towns of their enemies to wit Mons in Haynault, Auanes, Landrecy, Lequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, Valenciennes, &amp; Cambray, and the imperiall armie which was at their heeles, &amp; had aſſailed them as by a diſpaire had not been the good conduct of their chefes the imperials hauing aduentred ſo far as in clere day to force their whatch, after they had ſurpriſed one of the ſentinels of <hi>Tauannes</hi> his company: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding not daring to aduenture further, as ſone as they were perceiued, they were driuen in as farre as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſnoy. Now this night their light cauallery skirmiſhed long, &amp; with lucke enough, which was a cauſe to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forbeare, &amp; take ſom reſt the ſurplus of that night. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Villie encamped at Souleine, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence at the burrowes &amp; Caſtle of Gommigny which they burned, they marched forward the 24. of the month, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their enemies as it were deſperate, in ſeing their country burned, deſtroied &amp; ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without any doubt of being followed, or feare of being famiſhed, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a charge, taking vantage of the raynie &amp; miſty weather: knowing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they had two reaſonable bad riuers, to paſſe which were ſwelled that night where they hoped to delay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch dioder, as they would haue them at deuotion hauing all their own garriſons ioyned together. Therefore they deuided into two troupes about 4000. of the beſt horſe they had, laying part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ambuſh within the woods vpon the way, &amp; part of them within certaine villages at hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they might moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly ſuſtaine one another, the D. of Sauoy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining behind with other 4000 horſe &amp; ſome footmen, hauing belaid the field with 4. or 5. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred couriers to entiſe forth their light horſe: wherby they being firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the D. <hi>D' Aumale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The imperials enterpriſes vpon the French armie</note> it was thought fit to ſend to the Marſhall S.

The regiment of the Duke of Neuers was ſent another way, where certaine of their ſcoutes were defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which brought great quantitie of baggage, but parte thereof was againe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewed. Afterwardes they encamped that night in a village, which the yeere before had beene burned called Viellie. The ſame day a trumpetour which the Duke of Neuers had ſent to the campe, called <hi>La Capelle,</hi> to vnderſtand what was become of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21992:84"/>
a man at armes of his company, returned almoſt al naked, &amp; ſtript by ſome ſouldiers of the enemies, ſmally experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in feates of war. But at the inſtant he was ſent backe againe in the ſame eſtate, with a trumpetor, who was charged by the K. to tel the D. of Sauoy, the Emperors Leiutenant general, that if hereafter they vſed any more the like faſhions, &amp; al the priueledges &amp; liberties of war ſhold be thus aboliſhed, he wold do the like at his next ſiege. Which being vnderſtood by this gentle Prince, to ſhew how ſore he was diſpleaſed therat, he cauſed diligent ſearch to be made thoroughout his whole campe, for thoſe as had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſo baſe and lewd an act, to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in example: ſo as hauing recouered the trumpetors clothes &amp; horſe with reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſuch other things as had beene taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he cauſed him to be ſafely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied backe by one of his owne. Now for that ſome of the imperials had cauſed the bruite to run, how that the French did flie before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that if they woulde but ſtay 24. howers, the Prince ſhold giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battel, they anſwered, that they ſaw no cauſe to be ſo brag, nor ſo lightly to vſurp ſuch glory, occaſion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat hauing already beene often enough preſented vnto them if they themſelues had liſted. Notwithſtanding if the Prince had ſo great deſire thereto as he made ſhew for, he aſſured them on the K. behalfe, that he would ſtay full 24. howers &amp; no more, or if he would come find him out neer Cambray, he did aſſure him that would tarry for him 8. daies together, wher nothing ſhould be refuſed him. But whilſt they ſought out the moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to lodge their battellons &amp; men at armes, the imperials in the end retired to their firſt lodgings neere to Bauets. An occaſion that at their departure thence the French with one march got as far as Craeuecaeur neere Cambray, where the enemies had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to fortefie and repaire the Caſtle, hauing already begun to make certaine trenches &amp; conduits to taſt the water, purpoſing there to lay their foundations which the ſame day being the 26. of Iuly, their pioners began to raiſe: where the firſt wound of the miſerable Cambreſius was renued, who had already ſet vp &amp; builded ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cottages, only to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues dry: imagining that a long time there would not ſo great misfortune befal them, hauing according to their habilitie againe ſowed part of their fields, to haue wherwith all to nouriſh, and keepe themſelues from famine: ſo as the richer ſort, &amp; glad to that they were with their beſt moueables retired within the ſtrong townes, were not exempt out of al theſe loſſes &amp; aduerſities: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tennant is poore &amp; afflicted, the Lord fareth neuer a whit of ought the better. Now whilſt that in the plain countrie they made waſt of Corne alredy ripe, &amp; ready to be reaped, many braue ſalies and skirmiſhes dayly fel out between them of Cambray &amp; the French: the Citadel ſtil troubling &amp; darkning the aire with ſhot of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non, which lighted only among the worſt ſort, without ſlaying of any perſon of renowne: which they did only by al meanes poſſible, ſeeking to hinder the loſſe &amp; ruine of their fruits, being notwithſtanding often enough repelled and driuen into their owne gates, ſo as theſe bickerings continued for the ſpace of <hi>8.</hi> daies, whilſt that the French lay ther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped. The imperiall armie in the meane time was pitched and fortefied in a place called Arçon betweene Cambray, Le Queſnoy, &amp; Valeciennes vpon the little riuer of Montet, which commeth towards the Caſtle of Cambreſy, &amp; a little lower falleth into Leaſcau, ſtill continuing their courſes to cut off the waies: which the Prince <hi>De La Roche Sur-yon</hi> well perceiuing came thither, incorporating his armie with the K. which hee ſuccoured with great quantitie of victuals, whereof they ſtoode in great want and neceſsitie.</p>
            <p>In this time was the marriage concluded betweene <hi>Philip</hi> of Auſtria, and <hi>Mary</hi> of England, though with much more honor to the Engliſh, then to the Spanniards: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

This marriage notwithſtanding, though very honorable to their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſtucke ſore in the minds of many Lords and other of the countrie as well for the diſpleaſure which they tooke in that they were to be commaunded by a ſtranger, as for the change of Religion and pollicie, already as it were growne olde and ſetled in the harts of many: ſo as with a full reſolution to hinder the ſame, and to ſet vp <hi>Iane</hi> of Suffolke as Queene, they roſe in armes vnder <hi>Henrie</hi> of Suffolke, <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> and ſundrie other as well in Cornewale as the North countrie. <hi>Wyat</hi> vndertooke to bring his men ſtraight to London chiefe Citie of the Realme, hoping to draw the Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vnto him vnder a pretext of the countries libertie, &amp; hinderance of the alliance with a ſtranger. The Q. on the other ſide hauing leuied a great number of men cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Duke to flie to Warwicke, from whence ſeeking to eſcape into Fraunce, hee was apprehended and brought to London by the Earle of Huntington, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt <hi>Wyat,</hi> gathering men out of the Dutchie of Norfolke, the Duke whereof being taken priſonner by <hi>Wyat,</hi> in no caſe would be perſwaded to combat with this partie, but afterwards being releaſed, hee reuealed vnto the Q. all the enterpriſe of <hi>Wyat</hi> and his partners: with whome ſtoode likewiſe ſuſpected and kept as priſonner, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Anne Boulen.

But the Queene though with ſmall force, hauing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to all men rendred the cauſe, which moued her to take the Spanniard to her husband, and how that the countrie ſhould there by receiue much more good, then by her alone, or any other Engliſh Prince: beſides; how ſhe would looſe nothing of her owne, nor any waies diminiſh the libertie of her ſubiectes, encouraged them ſo farre as <hi>Wyat</hi> cleane out of hope of entring the Cittie, and ſeeking to retire into Kent, being purſued was defeated by the Earle of Penbrooke: afterwards brought to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,<note place="margin">Iane of Suffolke and her husband with ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beheadded at London.</note> within ſhort ſpace, both the D. of Suffolke and himſelfe, had their heads cut off, being not long after followed by <hi>Iane</hi> of Suffolke and her husband, for not hauing refuſed, the vnfortunate Crowne which was offred vnto them.

cariadges had gained the aduantage, and paſſed the Riuer, for ſome companies of light horſe being ſent forth for watch and ſcoutes, returned word back how that they had diſcouered neere hand to a foure or fiue hundred horſe, and a great number of foote, making ſhew as though the Emperours Campe marched, keeping their way as though they went directlye to Cambray, whereof they were no ſooner aduertiſed, then likewiſe ready, with reſolution rather to fight it out in the fielde, then to permit or giue them leaue to fortifie ſo neere vnto them, eſpecially with the helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of ſo great a Towne, whereby as much miſcheefe might happen vnto them as did vnto the Proteſtants of Germanie before Ingolſtat, whereupon the D. <hi>D' Aumale</hi> remounted ſuddenly on horſeback with the light Cauallerie, the better to be aſſured of the truth, and found how the imperial army was indeed remoued with full deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to come and encampe neer Cambray, but that the Emperor knowing how they were not departed thence, fearing to be enforced to fight to his great diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, lodged in another place neere vnto the firſt, called Neuuille, which hee cauſed ſoddenly to be renforced with trenches on that ſide, which was not flancked to the riuer.</p>
            <p>This night at ſundry times were fent out ſome companies of French Cauallerye, and of the Admirals men at armes to keepe them in continuall alarmes within their forte, vntill the break of day next morning, that the Conſtable with the moſt parte of the men at armes of his vantguarde, and two Regimentes of French Fanterie went neere to view and ſee if there were any meanes to force them within their forte, or to entice and giue them occaſion to come forth. But he found that very hard, for that this place was two waies encloſed with the riuer, and on the other ſides wel fortified and trenched in, aſſuring himſelfe by the diſcourſe of naturall reaſon, and examples paſt, that for the ſmalnes of reſolution which would be had therin, he could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away more honor and profite, then hee had done at other times, and in his yong yeeres at La Bicoque a ſimple Country houſe, of leſſe ſtrength then the place where the Marqueſſe of Gnaſt defeated all the fury of the French, Zuizers, and other parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Flower de luce. True it is that in his returne hee eſpyed ſome olde Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers where ſundrye of the enemyes were lodged on this ſide their Campe, as well to keepe ſcoute, as to endamage the fouragers: whereupon it was concluded that the Cannon ſhould be brought thither the ſame day to the battrie; by this meanes the rather to prouoke the Emperour to come forth to guarde and defende them. But the imperialls cleane acquited them retiring within their fort. Notwithſtanding to giue all occaſions which might bee, as alſo doubting the deſcent of the Engliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the countrie of Boulonnois, the marriage hauing beene alreadie ſolemnized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the K. of Spaine, and their Queene, Henry determined to make his armie vnto thoſe partes. where accordyng as the commoditie preſented it ſelfe, he might beſiege on of his enemies holdes, to the end that if hee would put himſelfe into the fielde and ſtriue to reſcue it, the Emperour might bee thereby conſtrained to fight. Hauing then ſoiourned certaine daies at Creueceur neare to Cambray, the ſecond of Auguſt hee departed, and the ſame day went to encampe at Ondrecourt nere the Caſtelet, whereof the Emperour being aduertiſed, raiſed his armie from Neuuille, and taking his way towards Arras, pitched at Marteau, The day after the French were at Mornencourt, two leagues from Peronne, and the next morrow paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bapalme ſaluted with infinite ſhot of Cannon. Notwithſtanding the armie made no long aboade there through the diſcommodity which they founde in not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recouer water: but onlie the light horſe ſkirmiſhed ſomtime before that place
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21992:86"/>
whileſt that the whole army deſcended to encampe that night all along the little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderneath Mirammont; whence they departed the next daye, keeping theyr way all along the borders of the Countie of Artois, where they ſawe a wonderfull waſte which the Prince of Roche Sur-yon his army had made ſundrye faire Caſtles and Villages as yet ſmoaking, the Corne and fruites of the earth clean deſtroyed and abandoned, which are the miſeries and calamities that the warres and diſſentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes bring to poore people. That night being the 5. of Auguſt, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped Paz in Artois; where ſome cauallerie of the Garriſon of Arras keeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt the woods and couered cuntry, vndertook to free about vpon the hinder part, but being encountered with their Engliſh and Scottiſh Cauallery, were defeated, and the moſt parte of their Souldiers diſmounted, and other brought away priſonners, whereby the loſſe of Giuettes was now recompenced. There they made great waſte, and continued it as farre as the abbey of Cercamp, where the County of S. Poul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth; there they ſoiourned two dayes for many reaſons, eſpeciallye for that they had reſolued to beſiege the Caſtle of Renty.<note place="margin">The K. army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rentry and his deſſeines.</note> The D. of Vendoſme departed thence with a good number of Cauallerie and foote, training ſome artillerie to goe before to ſummon it; alſo to knowe whether any bodye were lefte within Fauguemberg, which he purpoſed to raze, with all other ſmall fortes adioyning; to the end like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he might be able to bring greater ſtore of artillerie, that which he had there being partly homecomed, partly cracked and diſmounted, much powder and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition hauing beene ſpent before the Townes and Caſtles which they had taken; the eight of Auguſt they trauerſed all the Countye of S. Poul, leauing Dorlan and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din on the left hand, and Terroanne on the right, to encampe the night following at Fruges; whence that night the Caſtle of Renty was againe ſummoned, and anſwere made by the Captaine,<note place="margin">The Emperour before Renty &amp; his diſſeines.</note> that he would neuer yeelde it vp, aſſuring himſelf of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which the Emperour would bring vnto him; who being informed of the K. comming thither, as well in reſpect that forte was very preiudiciall to the County of Boulonnois, as to aſſay if they would hazard to fight with him and driue him out of the Countrie, was departed from Arras, where hee had muſtered all his forces, with which he approched as neere vnto the King as Terroanne on the Friday at night. But the French knowing his intent to be to keepe on the other ſide of the Riuerh, a place ſtrong by reaſon of the length &amp; bredth of the wods which ſtretched very far into the country, wherby ſuccors might come vnto him as well of victuals as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and all other ſorts of munitions, and being there fortified, his preſence would eaſily ſuccour and reskew the Caſtle with whatſoeuer ſhould be needfull, yea of all ſides readye to cutte of and annoye the beſiegers, aduiſed for the more ſure, that the Conſtable with the Vantgarde ſhould paſſe into that part, and fortefie himſelfe with trenches, to bemeete with and preuent all occaſions of ſurpriſe; and to cut of the way to any ſuccours which might be ſent vnto the Caſtle, bridges and boates were made vpon the little Riuer, whereby the two Campes might the more eaſily ſuccour one another. Afterwards all the light cauallerie being encamped at Fauquemberge, this caſtle remained ſo penned in, as there was not one man able to enter in without being diſcouered; notwithſtanding the better to aſcertaine the Emperour of this ſiege, they cauſed to be planted on the toppe of a mountain on Montereul ſide foure Culuerins, to begin to batter theſe defences, whileſt they aduanced forward ſuch great peeces as were taken and brought from the Townes aboue the Riuer of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which came thither ſomewhat late, and only the Satterday at night, but to make amends to this ſloath, they made the approches with ſuch ſpeede, as all was ſeene in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21992:86"/>
batterie by the next morrowe, notwithſtanding any ſhower of Harquebuze ſhotte, which they were able to ſend out of the Caſtle, whence there was hurte the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Vauquedemars,</hi> one of the moſt ancienteſt and experimented Captaines of the olde Enſignes, the which redoubled vnto the Emperour his doubt and feare of the place, ſeeing himſelfe without all meanes or hope to be able ſo much as to cauſe one man to enter in: but in the end the greefe and ſhame which hee conceaued, to ſuffer his Country ſo to be deſtroyed, and before his eyes, and that this place ſhould be taken and enforced, ſo mingled themſelues together, that making himſelfe an enemy to his feare, he reſolued to trye fortune, and to doe his beſt whatſoeuer ſhould enſue thereon to ſuccour it. Thereupon the ſame day he came to encampe hard by the French, but for all that the artillery neuer ceaſed moſt furiouſlye to batter the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and that in two places, to wit, on the Conſtables ſide and on the Kinges, the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie being aduanced, and planted on the very brinke of the ditch, which battered a bulwarke on the left hand, and a round tower within the dungeon on the right; they ſhot likewiſe from the mountaine a little below the Zuizers Campe, with foure cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerins to break the defences, and you may not doubt but in ſhort time this caſtle was as violently battered and cannoned, as any other place, ſo as the Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as the beſt way to raiſe them as yet to approche neerer, and ſo lodged on the top, on the plaine of a mountaine, betweene a little Village called Marque and Fauquemberg, where there was but one little Valley of an hundred and fiftye pace large, and at the leaſt as ſteepe, which deuided the two armies, and the valley on the other ſide, wher the riuer runneth which maketh a mariſh, and ouerfloweth al round about the Caſtle on the right hand. Beſides a wood on the left betweene the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and the French, aboue Fauquemberg, called the wood William,<note place="margin">The Emperours and K. Henries deſſeines before Reinty.</note> which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror thought good to ſeaſe vpon to hinder their giuing of the aſſaulte, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them by ſhot of Cannon into their campe, to diſlodge and quit the place. Now had the D. of Guiſe which commaunded in the battaile watched all that night, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Prince of Ferrara, the D. of Neuers, the Admirall, the Marſhall <hi>de S. Andre,</hi> and other, aſſuring themſelues that the enemye would not faile to ſpye out the wood to lodge in, and therefore was there ſet about 300. Harquebuſiers in ambuſh, within certaine little caues, and ſome corſelets which ſtoode plaine to be diſcouered, to the end the enemies firſt addreſſing themſelues to fight with them, might be encloſed in, the eaſier to be defeated by the Harquebuziers: and ſo a little after at the point of day, the ſcouts reported how they had heard a great noiſe, and deſcried certain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Harquebuziers, the which himſelfe afterwardes perceiuing, forbad them to diſcouer themſelues, but to tarrie vntill they might be ſure, and vpon that went back into the corps de gnet, which was retyred in the plaine towardes the Campe. The Imperials ſtill marched forward within the wood, according to the reporte of ſome couriers, which they ſtill ſent before, and perceiuing nothing, went ſo far in that they found themſelues encloſed within this ambuſh, not as yet diſcouered: wherefore the French ſuddenly all at one inſtant diſcharged ſo hottely on them, that they remained in the end ſo aſtonied and beaten, as in ſeeing a number hurt, they began to flye and turne their backes, glad that the day was no further forwardes, and that the weather was miſtye. Now from the beginning of the daye the batterye was continued more furious then before, ſo as in a ſhorte ſpace the breaches in euery place grewe reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ready to giue the aſſaulte: whereof the Emperour being aduertiſed, hee was ſo angry, as the very ſame day being the 13. of Auguſt, about noone he made a volley of artillerie to be diſcharged, to giue them warning within that they ſhould be of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21992:87"/>
and that their ſuccours were at hand. Afterwardes hauing concluded to giue battaile, (againſt the aduice of the principall of his councell) he cauſed all his campe to be ſet in order, but he reſolued firſt to gaine the wood, knowing the importance thereof, and at all hazards to chafe away the French. Therefore hauing choſen out of all his companies of foote about three or foure thouſand Harquebuziers of the beſt experienced,<note place="margin">The Imperial ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to the French.</note> ſome corſelettes, and Pikemen to ſupporte them, and about foure thouſand horſe, with foure fielde peeces, carried vpon foure wheeles, ready to turne them vpon any hand, (whereby they were afterward called the Emperours Piſtols) he cauſed them all to march right into the wood, the light Cauallerie vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Duke of Sauoy, and the Harquebuziers vnder <hi>Dom-Ferrant de Gonzague.</hi> All along the Glade of the wood in deſcending towardes Fauquemberg marched a battaile of Almanes, ledde by the Count <hi>Iohn</hi> of Naiſſau, and the Marſhal of Cleues, on whoſe flancke marched a troupe of Reiſtres of about eighteene hundred or two thouſand horſe, vnder the conduct of the Count <hi>Vulfenfort,</hi> who promiſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to march that day vpon the bellye of all the Kinges men at armes; followed not farre of with a number of light cauallerie, of about one thouſand or twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, with foure fielde peeces more. The Harquebuziers then being entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wood, encountred with the three hundred French, as freſh and with as good a will to recharge them as they had done at the firſt. And therevpon grew faire and hot skirmiſhes. Now albeit that the Imperials arriued there in farre greater number, yet they behaued themſelues ſo valiantly that they kept them a long time back, ſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remained on eche ſide as well dead as hurt, and taken priſonners: among other of the French, the Captaine <hi>Fort,</hi> and his Lieutenant <hi>Courcelles.</hi> Hereupon the Duke of Guiſe, who from the beginning had vndertaken the defence of this wood, and by his preſence animated and ſeemed to grace theſe martiall actions, hauing carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the whole deſſein of the Imperialles, aduiſed the King that by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and fury wherewith they went to the combate, hee verily thought that that day ſhould not paſſe without a battaile. The King then which was in the plaine on this ſide the wood, about 5000. pace in length, and 2000. in breadth, cauſed his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of foote to be put in order, to ſcituate them in a place commoudious and eaſie to combate with the men at armes, becauſe that place was vnproper for them both to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether,<note place="margin">The French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my repreſented before Renty to giue battaile.</note> as by the aduice of the Conſtable and ſundry other Princes and Captaynes, he had the day before perceaued. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for the better countenance and to make head to the enemy, there was lodged both the one and the other as commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlye as could be; the firſt battell of foote were French, the ſecond Almanes, the third Zuizers, which followed one another with Regiments of men at armes ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their flancke on their right hand. And for as much as on the lefte there was a little Valley, which as well from the quarter of the Zuizers towards Fauquemberg, as towards the wood, widening made a glade eaſie and commodious enough, as wel to lodge foote as horſe, in the opening of that plaine they ſet the moſt parte of the reſt of the Regimentes of men at armes for the other flancke. And right before to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Fauquemberg was the D. <hi>D'aumale</hi> with all the light Cauallerie, and certaine Harquebuziers on foote to fight, without keeping any order, to the end they might giue notice if the enemy ſhould come that way. And in the mean ſpace the Duke of Guiſe not being able readily to haue the K. anſwere vpon ſuch occurrents, being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no leſſe curious to draw the enemie into the place moſt aduantagious for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then fearefull of the loſſe of the three hundred Harquebuziers in the wood, in the end reſolued to make them retire from place to place, through the trauerſes of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21992:87"/>
the wood, euer refreſhing them with ſome companies of Cauallery, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo encreaſed the imperials courage, as aſſuring themſelues of victorye, they cauſed their battailes of Alamanes to march with al diligence which alwaies flankred them on the rightſide, as they ſawe their harquebuſiers haue aduauntage ouer the French. And euen then <hi>Dom-Ferrant</hi> ſent word vnto the Emperour that he ſhould haſten the reſt of his army, for the Vantgarde of the French ſaid he was already ſore ſhakened, ready to ſet themſelues in diſorder: the which the Emperour did, and his army paſſed all along the Valley aboue, and at one of the corners of the wood him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe tarried, to be partaker of the pleaſure or annoy of the good or bad which ſhould fall out: it was then as the K. anſwere came to the D. of Guiſe, that if occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred it ſelfe to receaue battaile, he ſhould not refuſe it; that he would come himſelfe thither in perſon with as good a will to fight, as the moſt valiant of his whole army. Then the Duke of Guiſe went back to his Regiment in the ſight and face of all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the plaine towards Fauque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berg; where of a famous warrier,<note place="margin">The D. of Guiſes ſpeech to the gentlemen of his company.</note> gratious notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and with a ſmiling countenance, hee vſed ſome words, as well to aduertiſe the Gentlemen, of the faire occaſion which that day was offred to attaine honour, as to encourage thoſe which might haue any neede; and ſhewed them all in generall, how the day was come wherein God preſented vnto them (in doing ſeruice to their Princes and encreaſing their honor and particular reputation) the matter and true ſubiect, to make themſelues for euer to be redoubted and feared of all the nations of the worlde, whereof the K. aſſured himſelfe ſo farre, as he would honour this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victory with his owne preſence, which indeed encouraged them in ſuch ſorte, as hauing called vpon the name of God, and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended their ſoules into his hands,<note place="margin">The K. anſwere to the Zuizers</note> euery man prepared himſelfe well and faithfully to perfourme his dutie. In the mean time the Conſtable paſſed ouer the riuer towards the Duke with a Regiment of the Captaine <hi>Glamay</hi> his footmen, who cauſed the firſt order a little to be altered; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired the battaile of Zuizers towards Renty, who according to their ancient cuſtome, ſent vnto the King to demaund ſome men at armes to ſupporte them, but the K. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, how himſelfe would liue and dye with them, and that he ſo farre aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe of their promiſe and good will, that he determined no whit to abandon them, reſolute to ſhew vnto them, how as well in life, as point of death, if it were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred he would honour them as his colleagues and faithfull freends both to himſelfe and his kingdome: whereat they were ſo ſtirred vp, as there was no other intention among them, but to fight valiantlye for his ſeruice. Likewiſe as a teſtimonye of the pleaſure which the King receiued therein, he did that which I will ſhew you in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. As all this was thus a handling, the Imperials were in ſuch ſort already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced vpon the French, as they had recoyled them, and driuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the wood ſo farre, as their harquebuziers began to come forth, and ſhew themſelues in front of the firſt battail of the French, ready to ioyne with them, pelting at them with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and maruellous noyſe of Harquebuze ſhot all along the glade. The Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al battaile ſupported with Piſtoliers and cauallerie, was aproched with one hundred pace of the French, and there remained nothing but to charge, at ſuch time as the D. of Guiſe gaue a ſigne to the D. of Nemours, to charge with his regiment of light Cauallerie vpon one of the corners of the Piſtoliers, and vpon the other hee ſet the Guidon of his owne company, and <hi>Tauannes</hi> to ſcoure on their ſlancke, whereupon there began a moſt ſore and furious combat; but the French were in the end valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put backe, and there was ſlaine the yong Baron of Curton, <hi>Randan</hi> ſore hurte, and his Lieutenant <hi>D'Amanzay</hi> dead, the Cornet of <hi>Auannes</hi> ſore hurt, and his horſe

ſlaine vnder him, <hi>Forges</hi> Guidon of the company of <hi>Tauannes</hi> ſlaine, the Vicecount <hi>D'Auchy</hi> Guidon of the Duke of Guiſes ſore hurt, and ſundry valiant men out of all the companies,<note place="margin">The ſecond combate in which the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> as the Sonne of <hi>Pied-pape,</hi> yong <hi>Iouy, Bourdilly,</hi> yong <hi>Branches,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; whoſe death, hurtes, and retreates gaue ſuch hart to the Imperialles ſo well to hope, as they already encouraged one another, as hauing gained an entire victory: whereupon the Duke of Guiſe and <hi>Tauannes,</hi> hauing aſſembled their troupes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, the which the D. <hi>D' Aumalle</hi> with all the light Cauallerie went to ioyne, began with one fronte ſo furiouſly to charge vpon the Imperials, as they opened, and threw downe the Piſtoliers of Vuluenfort ſo rudelye, as they themſelues brake the battaile of their Almanes to retire, who might beſt, whileſt that the Duke of Neuers who had his Regiment placed along the glade towards Ranty, paſſed betweene the battaile of the Almanes and the French, to charge in a heape vpon all the Spaniſh Harquebuzerie, which by fauour of their cauallerie was alreadye come out of the wood, which they perfourmed ſo couragiouſly, and with ſuch violence, as they were all ouerthrowne and put to flight; yea in ſuch diſorder as they ſuddenly turned their back, to eſcape and get into the wood, where there were taken and razed ſeuenteene Enſignes of footmen, fiue Cornets of horſe, and foure fielde peeces which they found cleane abandoned all along the glade. The Admirall then who was the firſt which alighted before the battaile of the French, cauſed a number of Souldiers to leaue their ranckes ſtill to follow the victory, who entring within the wood at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning made a great ſlaughter of their enemies, ridding all ſuch as they met of their miſerable liues, by the cruell edge of their ſworde. There were the Emperours Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols found and brought vnto the King, whileſt that the companies of men at armes purſued the victorie all along the glade and borders of the wood, eſpecially the light Cauallerie and <hi>Tauannes</hi> his company, which deſcended downe into the bottome of the valley, where was likewiſe defeated a great number of thoſe which were come downe out of the wood, hoping to gaine their Campe. The reſt of the troupes tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the top of the valley, vpon which they ſtraightwaies made the Emperours artillerie to playe, which remained on the other borde his ſide, whereby his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſomewhat the more fauourablye retreate. But to anſwere him, the French was as ſoon leuelled againſt the corner of the wood, which made his quickly recoyle backe, the battailes of the footmen which were already come together vpon this top in the plaine, ſtill attending what might further enſue. During this time the Emperor cauſed his Campe with all diligence to be razed, trenched and fortified: doubting of a more hotte purſute. But the night comming on, was an occaſion to the French to paſſe the reſt of the time in peace, and to content themſelues with the happy iſſue of this reencounter. Now for that the companies of the men at armes of the D. of Guiſe, Neuers, Bourdillon, and <hi>Tauannes,</hi> were the firſt which fought, and moſt hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued their enemies, the King was ſo highly contented therwith, as he Knighted the cheefe Captaines and principall members thereof.

After the encounter the French Captaines viewed ouer their bandes, to know thoſe which had beene ſlaine or hurt, where there were found of dead about two hundred or twelue ſcore: but the Emperour loſt there thriſe as manye men: for the charge and onſet of the French was at the firſt ſo furious, as without reſpect of any, nor tarrying about priſonners, all ſuch as preſented themſelues before them,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21992:88"/>
were hewen in peeces, ſo as the D. of Sauoy and <hi>Dom-Ferrant</hi> to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues were faine to runne into the thick of the wood, where they remained ſo long, as it was a great time before any newes could be heard of <hi>Dom-Ferrant,</hi> ſo as hee was eſteemed either to be dead or taken priſonner. And there was alſo taken a Colonel of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, which a Harquebuſier found within the wood ſore hurt, who being kept by the Baron of Fontenay, dyed a few daies after in his handes. A Spaniſh Captaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>de Caſtres,</hi> who ſaide hee had beene page to the Admirall, being abandoned for dead, was taken by an other Harquebuſier, to whome they gaue ſo good entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as within few daies after his wounds being broght into good plight, for a ſmall ranſome he was ſent away, and conueied vnto the Caſtle of Renty. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken priſonner, a gentleman of great vertue and knowledge of the Emperours chamber, named <hi>De Silly,</hi> who afterward was employed to mediate a peace betweene theſe two Princes.</p>
            <p>After that the K. was retired with his battaile into his firſt ſtand, the Conſtable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped the ſame night within the wood, with al the Vantgard, in the very place of victorie, but with ſmall reſt notwithſtanding; for that all the night the Imperials kept themſelues in battaile, the two armies remaining in great doubt one of the other, for the French preſumed how that the Emperour being a couragious &amp; magnanimous Prince, would neuer endure ſuch a loſſe, without doing of his beſt for reuenge: but he ſeeing himſelfe weak, and ſo vnfauoured of fortune, knowing the puiſſance of the K. feared leaſt he would turn all his forces to defeat him for altogether. So as hauing with all diligence poſſible, cauſed his Campe to be encloſed about round with great trenches, by peep of day we might ſee them in ſo great forwardnes, as they reſted as impregnable. The ſame day notwithſtanding to make an end of his part, the K. ſent the Conſtable to view whether there could be any acceſſe or means to go ſearch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out within their owne fort, who gaue aduiſe of an impoſsibilitie, without danger of looſing thereby a great number of valiant men: ſo this day paſſed peaceably ouer on each ſide, ſtill continuing for all that the battery againſt the caſtle, vntill night that the Emperour cauſed all his artillery to be diſcharged in ſigne of great ioy, and reioycing for the good newes which he had receaued of the defeate of <hi>Peter Stroſsy,</hi> and a great number of the French partie in Italy. I will tell you elſe where how the matter was: vpon this the fifteenth day of the moneth, the retreat of the army into France was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of in full councell, as well for want of prouiſions for horſes, as to change the ayre, which was already infected and corrupted with the ſtinche of carrins and dead horſes, whereof the plague is quickly engendred, and other diſeaſes very contagious in an army; alleadging in like ſorte that the K. would not loſe ſo many braue men as followed him, before ſo little a place, and of no worth; but for all that the K. meant firſt to aduertiſe the Emperor therof, and ſent him word that it was not for any doubt of him, and that if hee would aſſure him that he would meet him, he would tarry for him foure long houres on the way, as he did: for hauing cauſed the Cartes and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be ſent away, the armye wholy remained in battaile more then three howres in the ſame place, where the Monday before they had fought. But none preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues, and knowing how that the Imperialles were cloſe ſhutte vp in their Campe, hauing in their ſight ſet fire on all the Villages about, they began with a ſofte march to retire, looking back ſometimes to ſee if they were followed. And ſo late enough arriued at Montcaure, a league from Montereul, where they ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 5. daies together, ſtil to learn out &amp; vnderſtand the enterpriſes of th'emperor, the which as long as the French forces were ſtill aſſembled, the King might more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21992:89"/>
preuent, and meete with them if they ſhould put into the fielde. But hauing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intelligence how the armie was not as yet departed from their firſt lodging in the plaines of Marque, and that the Emperour expreſſely tarried to ſee the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and amendements of Rente, the K. purpoſed in like ſort to giue ſome reſt and refreſhing to his owne; Notwithſtanding that before the fiue dayes were out, want of fourage and euill ayre of the marſhes cauſed them to diſlodge and come neerer to Montereul, where they ſoiourned fiue other dayes entire; the K. being lodged in the Charter houſe, and the Campe pitched all along the little riuer of Cauche, where the Engliſh and Scottiſh companies receiued an euill bobbe, in being ſcattered and lodged two leagues farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Vantgarde, in a village called Marenlo, where the imperials hauing receaued aduertiſement thereof, and being guided by one of the ſame village, were to ſurpriſe them at midnight, ſo as their lodgings being ſet on fire, ſome of the maſters, ſeruants, and horſes tyed were burned, ſome ſlaine, and ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away priſonners: wherupon the Emperour being retired to S. Omer, without hauing any meanes to be able to vndertake any matter of great importance or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the French; as alſo that the Winter and euill weather threatned him, the K. departed thence with the D. of Guiſe, and certaine gentlemen of his houſe to goe to Compeugne, after he had well munitioned and fortefied the gariſons of the townes of Ardres, and Bolongne, to make head &amp; keep ſtrong againſt his enemy, if he would beſiege him: the Conſtable remaining cheefe of the ouerplus of the army, as well to keepe it vnited, as the better and more readily to be able to prouide for whatſoeuer the Emperour could vndertake: whoſe guiles the French haue alwaies feared, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon the end of a warre; wherupon they took occaſion to charge now &amp; then vpon his campe, as well thereby to know and learne ſome thing, as to keep ſcoute for the fouragers, who were faine to goe very far to recouer victuals and fourage for their horſes, who hauing no more left to nouriſh them withall, they were enforced againe to diſlodge and paſſe ouer the riuer on the other ſide, where the army was pitched &amp; encamped in the villages of Brameu, Eſpimeu, Beaurin, &amp; al alongſt the riuer ſhoare. They taried there certain daies,<note place="margin">The K. army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued.</note> fearing leaſt the Emperour ſhould beſiege Montreul, Ardres, or Dourlan: notwithſtanding being aduertiſed how his Souldiers for want of pay, victuals, and other commodities, diſſolued themſelues: the conſtable not to conſume the reſt of the victuals of the frontire (which were alreadye greatly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and growne deare) ſent home the rirebands to their houſes, and diſmiſſed the Zuizers well contented &amp; ſatisfied, as wel with their pay, as with the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood beſtowed by the K. vpon <hi>Mandoſſe</hi> their Generall, and vpon the Captains <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore Inderhalden</hi> Colonel of the Cantons, and <hi>Petroman Clery</hi> Colonel of the townes, and <hi>Aonis</hi> who was afterwardes the K.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the reſt of the army to the D. of Vendoſme: wherupon the emperor who had alwaies delaied and diſſembled his determination, ſeeing his forces diminiſhed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, called backe certaine companies which before hee had cauſed to departe the campe, to drawe towards Hedin. The which the D. of Vendoſme foreſeeing, &amp; that he meant to be reuenged in burning the flat country, as the French had done his, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his camp to diſlodge, ſtil to accoſt him and hold him in ſuch awe, as he ſhuld not ſcatter his army, ſo as hauing paſſed the riuer of Authie, hee encamped that night at Dampierre, vntill the next morrow about noone, when as hee was aduertiſed how the moſt part of the Imperial army and cauallery was come down to Auchy, a Caſtle appertaining to the Count of Aiguemont, and had fired the ſame, broken &amp; defeated
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21992:89"/>
certaine companies of light cauallery, which the Duke doubting of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to hinder the paſſage of the riuer had ſent thither. The which cauſed him ſodenlye to raiſe his Campe from Dampierre, and imagining by the courſe which his enemye tooke, that he meant to beſiege Abbeuille or Dorlan, hee approched neerer to theſe two places, the which he furniſhed and fortefied with what euer was neceſſarye. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards on the morrow being the firſt of September, he paſſed the riuer of Somme, and pitched his Campe at Pondormy, a place very commodious both to keepe the Country and paſſage of the riuer: the ſame day the Imperials began to make waſte, and to burne the flat Country which the French had abandoned, for two or three leagues compaſſe, encamping at Saint Requier, two leagues from the French, whom they thought ſhould not diſlodge thence without battaile offred, or ſome charges or other braueries perfourmed: an occaſion that the next morning early the D. of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme ſent his light cauallerie with three hundred men at armes to ſupporte them, vnder the conduct of the Prince of Anguian, who approched as neere their Campe as he was able, and kept them ſo as they ſhould not ſcatter to burne and deſtroye the villages, holding them in ſuch awe and ſubiection, that they alwaies marched in troupes cloſe together: at night the French ouerthrew at their taile certain waggons laden with victualles, which were nothing but apples, bonillons, and very naughtye bread: the which cauſed them to think that in ſo great want and neceſsitie of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als they would not long keepe themſelues encamped: notwithſtanding they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched afterwards all along the riuer of Authie, and ſet fire on the Caſtles and Villages alongſt as they paſſed. As at Dampierre, Daurye, Marchy, Marchye, Mainthenay, and diuers other places: an occaſion that the Duke of Vendoſme ſent ſixe ſcore men at armes as well of his company as of the Marſhall <hi>S.

Then on the twelfth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember they began to reare and build vp a forte, hauing for the more ſpeedy diſpatch of the defence, leauied a great number of Pionners and labourers out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes about, which they did without any let, for beſides that they were within their landes, the French army was maruelouſly diminiſhed and leſſened euery day, both by reaſon of ſickneſſe among the Souldiers, as of the companies which were ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the townes, which were threatned with a ſiege at hand.

            <p>See how God which hath the harts of Kings in his hands, making each partie to iudge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers demaunds to vnreaſonable, would not permit Chriſtendome ſo ſoone to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a benefit ſo much deſired. In ſort that each one keeping himſelfe vpon feare of a ſurpriſal, eaſily made his neighbor thinke, how the cariadges of the Garriſons round about tended to more high enterpriſes. So as theſe two Princes tickled with the like feare, and quickly taking one anothers actions for a ſufficient defiance of warre, as <hi>Henrie</hi> deuided his men where he ſaw it moſt needfull, the Emperour firſt put his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into the field of twentie thouſand fighting men vnder <hi>Martin Rouſſan</hi> baſtard of Cleues, who after many roades, burnings, and vncredible waſts all along the Meuſe, encamped at Deux Giuets, minding to build a fort vpon that mountaine, at the foot whereof this riuer runneth, there by to bridle all the quarters round about, &amp; make a ſure retreate there for al ſuch as were able to endomage the French. The D. of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in the meane ſpace hauing taken good order for <hi>Maizieres,</hi> and other places of importance, reſolued by the K. commaundement to victuall well Mariemburg. And to that end hauing ſpeedily and ſecretly made ready all preparations as well of men as victuals, munitions, and companies vnder the Comte of Retheloix, he ſent three hundred harquebuſiers as well French as Engliſh and Scots, mounted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and bring backe word to the cheefe of the eight hundred light horſe, which followed them, what they ſhould diſcry: who with the leader of the vantgard of two hundred men at armes, and eight enſignes of fantaſſins which marched after, and a number of harquebuſiers cloſe to the winges of the wagons, prouided therto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was needfull according to the generals commaundment, who led the battell of three hundred men at armes, and eight enſignes of fantaſsins, hauing on his backe the arrieregard of two hundred men at armes, then one hundred Archers to haſten them, and to aduertiſe the chefe of euery occurrence. In ſuch ſort as this order being thus followed, ioyned thereto the ſpeedines of the march, and well diſciplined obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſouldiers, was the cauſe that fiue hundred wagons as well of the K. mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as voluntarie Marchants entred in without any diſturbance, which either the enemie or badnes of the way could yeeld vnto them, fully perſwading themſelues throughout all the marche, which was eight long leagues, that they were able en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to make hed to the enemie, when, where, and with what troupes ſoeuer hee would aduance, though he were dubble as ſtrong as the French. Afterwards the D. hauing placed there, and encouraged <hi>Du Fumel</hi> gouernour, &amp; left fiftie men at armes, two hundred light horſe, and nine olde companies of the beſt ſouldiers on foote, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence, and making his vantgard of the hindermoſt, kept on another way to viſit Rocroy, where the Capitane <hi>La Lande</hi> was. So the Garriſons of Gampaigne,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21992:92"/>
frontires of Haynaut, and countries about being well prouided, the imperiall armie was as ſoone diſlodged thorough the infection and diſcommoditie of victuals which they there endured. So as <hi>Martin Rouſſan</hi> being dead and many other, the better ſorte were ſent to Giuets. Whether the D. of Neuers marched with his troupes: againſt whome the imperials skirmiſhing, and ſetting on them with many ſalies, maintained and doubled by their reciprocall ſuccours, had ſoone enough recorded a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reencounter, conſidering the aduantage and euident fauour ſtill turning on the French partie, had not <hi>Henrie</hi> expreſly forbidden his Leiutenant to fight, but in great, and in the field without aſſailing them in their fort. So as being retired and diſperſed into Garriſons, the reſt of the time paſſed ouer mildly vntill the midſt of Auguſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour hauing ſent the Prince of Orange with new forces to reaſſemble his troupes, ſet forth an armie vnder the generall of the houſe of <hi>Challons:</hi> the effectes whereof notwithſtanding was but to keepe in the French, and rayſe vp the forte <hi>A Couins</hi> neere Mariembourg, which was after called <hi>Philippe Ville.</hi> Beſides the Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Gaſpard</hi> of Coligny gouernour of Picardie, tooke ſuch order within his frontires as he left nothing at randome. <hi>Anthoine</hi> of Vendoſme, had ſurrendred that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the K. hands, at ſuch time as being married to <hi>Ioane</hi> of Albert, ſoale heire to <hi>Henrie</hi> of Albert, he went to take poſſeſsion of the kingdome of Nauarre, Dutchy of Albert, Earledome of Foix, Armignac, Bigorre, and Soueraintie of Bearn, after the deceaſe of his Father in law. Since notwithſtanding as ſome of the Garriſons of Picardie mingled with 15. hundred horſe of the Rerebandes, whome they tearme the companies of the nobles, and fower hundred pioners had ſo happily ouerrunne the countrie round about vnder <hi>La Iaille</hi> their generall, as they all returned laden with a rich nauy ineſtimable bootie, <hi>Hauſimont</hi> gouernour of Bapaume, finding them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a woode a village and a riuer, (the paſſages whereof he cauſed to bee broken downe and kept) without skouts, without order, without any feare of the enemie, and without hart, charged them ſo roundly with a few men, as in leſſe then nought, he made them leaue together with their courage al their rich pickkerie, yea and their verie liues at his deuotion. The wood and the riuer notwithſtanding ſaued a great number, <hi>La Iaille</hi> hurt, and more then a third part priſoners the reſt died in the place. The which the imperials tooke ſo greatly to their aduantage, as they could not ſpeak of any other more notable exploite, ſo farre as it grew to a ſcoffe among them, how they had taken the nobles of France without weighing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Albeit that theſe troupes were not indeede furniſhed for the moſt part but of Ronturiers, vnnoble euery kind of way, or of ſome ſeruants which the olde or ſicke Lordes, widowes and orphelins had ſent thither: the gentlemen hauing beene all retyred to the ordinances of the K. who ought in reſpect of his owne honour, and profit of his ſubiects to reforme ſuch and like lewd abuſes, as are committed in the companies of bands and rerebands.

Whereby giuing himſelfe to carrie the ſword, and to make profeſsion of armes, hee coulde not long endure to liue in France without ſeeing of Piemont: where the exerciſe of armes pleaſed him in ſuch ſort, as being firſt enroled in the muſter Booke, then thorough his owne merite honoured with the degree of Corporall, which got him the halbard, afterwards an enſigne of a companie of fante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in the end was as well thought of by his Maſter of the campe, as mounting by all the degrees of warre he grew maruelous well knowne and recommended of euerye man.

               <p>In Aprill 1555. there grew a notable change in Italy about the free eſtate of Syene, touching the principalitie thereof. To the which <hi>Coſme</hi> of Medices newly created Archduke of Tuſcane had aſpired of a long time: as well for that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth being of ſo great force and ſcope was encloſed within his lands of Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, as to render the effects of his power conformable to the title which had beene giuen vnto him. In reſpect that the accidents therein grew verie diuers and were ſtrangely handled, me thinketh it very reaſonable that the courſ therof be reſearched euen from the firſt originall. The Emperour being ſeaſed of Siene in Tuſcane, had placed there for gouernour <hi>Don Diego de Mondoze</hi> with a Spanniſh garriſon: againſt whome, hauing begun a Citadell vnder colour of doing it for the townes defence, but carrying himſelfe to ſeuere towards the inhabitants they al conſpired to ſet them ſelues at libertie: foreſeeing that the Emperour would bring in the forces of the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine their enemie againſt them, and that the Citadell was builded on the way to Florence. <hi>Mendoze</hi> in the meane time vnder colour of defending the people againſt the inſolencies of the Nobles, cauſed them to lay a ſide their armies, but exerciſing his rigor afterwardes on both parties: who being accorded and forgetting their olde quarels, let the French to vnderſtand how rudely they were handled, aduertiſing them of the ſtrange deſſeins of the Spanniards throughout all Italy. Againſt whome they beſought ſuccour, beſeeching to be receiued vnder their protection, eſpecially conſidering that this Principalitie would bee a verie fit thing for the K. the better to bridle the Imperials in Italy. Concluding that Kings being eſtabliſhed to ſuccour the afflicted, and that Siene hauing beene at al times affectionate vnto the French, deſerued not to be refuſed in ſo iuſt a requeſt which brought vnto him nothing but honour and profit, with a maruelous comfort to all Italy. In the ende the ſuccours which they demaunded were promiſed. And albeit that <hi>Coſme</hi> had aduertiſed <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doze,</hi> of all the proceeding hereof: yet he nothing fearing the Sienois being bridled in and vnarmed, ſet verie light by the aduertiſment.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21992:94"/>
Spanniards began to arme themſelues, fortefie places, and to demaund ſuccour of the Duke, who ſent eight hundred ſoldiers of proofe to <hi>Mendoze,</hi> ſeaſing themſelues of the places and paſſage of Siene, whereat the inhabitants were ſo ſtirred vp, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few daies after, they cauſed the Earle of Petiglian ſecretly to enter in, with fortie thouſand men, who droue the Spanniards out of Siene, with a great ſlaughter not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding both of the one part &amp; the other. The reſt of the Spanniards got them into the Citadell, and into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent of preaching Friers, which they had fortefied. But afterwards with the eight peeces of artillerie, which was taken from them, they droue them out of the fortes, the Earle of Saint Flour ariuing there, with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouldiers which reſted of the leauie. In ſuch ſort as they tooke the conuent, and afterwards the Citadell, the moſt part of the chefetaines with the Florentine Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes retyring themſelues, and ſo all together by an accord made with the Cittizens, they departed out of Siene, and ſeaſed of Orbitelle a place ſeated in a Marſh, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way fit to annoy the Sienois. Hereupon the Emperour beeing conſtrained to quitte Metz, and retired into Germanie, where he vnderſtoode of the ſucceſſe of his affaires in Italy, commanded the viceroy of Naples <hi>Dom Garzie de Toledo,</hi> that aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together all the forces which he poſſibly could, he ſhould blocke in the Sienois as much as in him lay. Which he accordingly did in Ianuary 1548. with twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand footmen and fifteene hundred horſe, as well Almanes as Neapolitanes. In the meane time the K. had ſent the Cardinall of Ferrare to Siene, and <hi>De Termes</hi> with two thouſand pioners, aſsiſted with the D. of Some, Earle of Saint Flour and other of the Vrſins, fortefying the places as they ſhould ſee neede. <hi>Corneille Bentinuogle</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Roſie with fifteene hundred ſouldiers. <hi>Iohn de Thurin</hi> with three hundred men had the charge of Mont-alcin; Malian was giuen to Chiarmont, and <hi>La Turrite</hi> was gouernour thorough Galeas de Saint Seuerin with three hundred men. <hi>Ciuſi</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iordan Vrſins</hi> with two thouſand men vnder <hi>Aſinolonga.</hi> At Monticelle were <hi>Cipierre, Guy de Bentiuogle,</hi> and the Earle of Petiglian with fiue hundred light horſe, at Port Telamon was the Earle of Mirendolle, and a Satean, <hi>Ioachin</hi> a Gaſcoine Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine accompanied with two hundred men. So as all <hi>de Termes</hi> his forces deuided thoroughout all the garriſons amounted to twelue thouſand footemen beſides the Cittizens in great number all enemies to the Spanniards and Florentines. But there was not aboue fiue hundred horſe: euerie man trauailing to fortefie and prouide for their places, <hi>De Termes</hi> and other euen to the verie women tooke maruelous paines to aſſure <hi>La Capitalle,</hi> whilſt that the viceroye ouerranne the countrie, and attempted the townes, which hee thought to carrie by open force, ſurpriſe, or intelligence. Conducting the armie with <hi>Aſcanio de La Corne,</hi> hee tooke ſome, and was forced to diſcampe before other, as at Moultacin, which was ſuccoured with the men which <hi>Bellegard</hi> nephew to <hi>De Termes</hi> cauſed to enter in. The intelligence which he had in Siene was diſcouered, and albeit the Cardinall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted him vnto priſon which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the newes, yet he ſet him againe at libertie, wherupon this Prelate was euer ſince ſuſpected of treaſon.</p>
               <p>In this time did <hi>Charles</hi> D. of Sauoye, driuen out of his countrie by the Kinge of France, leauing for heire of all his rights his onely Sonne <hi>Philibert Emmanuel:</hi>

Ioynte that the Kinge to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſtronger in Italy, ſent ouer and aboue the ſupplye of fiue thouſand ſouldiers Zuizers and Gaſcons, with ſome light Cauallerie promiſing beſides to ſend vnto him ſuccours by Sea, which entred into Siene without the enemies being witting thereof at all. The which emboldned <hi>Stroſsi</hi> to come foorth with ſixe thouſand footmen, and fiue hundred choſen horſe, manie Sienois follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, whoſe going foorth was no leſſe concealed from the Imperials then their entrance in. Afterwardes hauing giuen <hi>Moriane,</hi> (a place appertaining to the Luguois) for rendeuons vnto his armie which was to come out of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie, he ouerranne diuers places of the Flourentines.

Then the Marqueſſe finding him ſelfe not to bee ſtrong enough, put himſelfe within Peſcia, there to attende the ſuccours which <hi>Camille Colone,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Lunes</hi> were to bring vnto him. <hi>Stroſsi</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to charge him vppon the ſuddaine, but hee retyred to Seraual and Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toye with ſuch diſorder, as it gaue occaſion to manie to wiſh that there had beene a better iudgement in <hi>Stroſsi</hi> then hee had, ſo faire meanes of hot purſuite bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered vnto him, whereby hee might cleane haue taken awaie ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie out of Tuſcane, but <hi>Stroſsi</hi> ſaide hee did it to gratifie the ſouldiers which were wearie, and tyred with the long march which they had made. In the ende, the Imperial armie growing ſtronger, and the ſuccours out of France not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come vnto him, hee was faine to quitte the fielde, and retyre himſelfe into Siene. In the meane time <hi>Leon</hi> the Brother of <hi>Pierre Stroſsi,</hi> tooke certayne ſhippes of Genoway, laden with Corne, into which hauing put a number of ſouldiers hee ouerranne the coaſt of Tuſcane, and ſcouring the portes alongſt the Fourentine Seas, after manie harmes which hee had made them to endure, he came and Ankered before Scarlin, a ſmall Towne, and without renowne: which while hee was viewing for the skaling of it, hee dyed of an Harquebuſe ſhot which perced his heade. Whereuppon his Brother beeing greatlie paſsioned, cauſed the ſiege to bee continued whether the ſuccours of Fraunce came vnto him beeing conducted by <hi>Monluc.</hi> Then hauing vnited together his forces, hee made vp his armye of ſixe thouſand Italians, two thouſand Gaſcons, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye Zuizers, two thouſand fiue hundred Almanes, and one thouſande horſe, as well light, as of the Ordinance,<note place="margin">Ciuitelle beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the French.</note> with which leauing <hi>Monluc</hi> in Siene hee beeſieged and battered Ciuitelle, a little Towne of the Flowrentines, which the Marqueſſe went to defende eſteeming it a place of conſequence in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſoyle, and ſeruing as a porte and Bulwarke to the Dukes Countries. Hee was there ſo ſecretelye, and with ſuch ſpeede, as hee defeated and aſtonyed manye of the Kinges parte: but <hi>Stroſsi</hi> repulſed him in ſuch a ſorte, as beſides a great number of them were taken, and the reſt of them were ſlaine, the garde pryor of Lomberdie and <hi>Marie de Saint Flour,</hi> and ſundry other of the Marqueſſe ſide remained there captiues. <hi>Stroſsi</hi> in the meane time beeing enforced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe ſeeing that there was no poſsibilitye of carrying awaye the place, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Marqueſſe his neighbourhoode, addreſſed himſelfe to Foyanbelle,

But the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte was ſuch vppon the verye firſt daye, as <hi>Carlot</hi> and all his ſouldiours were put to the edge of the ſworde, and the place to fire and bloode. Heereupon the Marquiſſe beeing approched, the two armies paſſed certaine dayes in continualle skirmiſhes, fauourable ſometime to the one, and ſometimes to the other partie. And for that the French Artillerie greatlie annoyed the Imperials, who daye by day yeelded themſelues vnto <hi>Stroſsi,</hi> the reſt were retained by offer of a larger pay, eſpecially the King partie if they woulde retire: which ſome did, and had beene followed by ſundry other, had not <hi>Stroſsi</hi> playde a Counter knacke in preſenting more pay and fauour then the Marquiſſe. But drawing towardes Montpulcian, a number of Italians abandoned him, which greatly encouraged the Marquiſſe to charge him in this aduantage, which the better to auoide, <hi>Stroſsi</hi> purpoſing to retire himſelfe by the mountaines, ſent his Artillerie before for feare of looſing of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorough the fauour of the mountaines and ryuers bordering about, to retarde the purſuite of the Marquiſſe.

And albeit that the Gaſcons and Zuizers ſtoode well vnto it, yet their raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in going out of their forte to ſet vpon the Spanniards, and Flourentines, was no leſſe damageable, then the cowardlineſſe of thoſe which ranne awaie: for the Cauallerie turning head againſt them, they were all cut in peeces.

The reporte whereof was brought vnto the Kinge before Renti, to abate the ioye of his ſo fauourable a reencounter againſt the Emperour beeing himſelfe in perſon, thorough the ſorrowfull newes of ſo pittiefull a defeate. Manye which were hurt, and ſundrye other, retyred themſelues to Sienne, there to attend ſuch euent as the Imperialles ſhoulde bring thether, <hi>Stroſsi</hi> and <hi>Aurele Fregoſe</hi> abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Foyan</hi> gayned <hi>Montalcin,</hi>

The Marquiſſe in the meane time hauing taken almoſt all the little places about Siene, encamped beefore the cheefe Cittie, reſolued, as hee aſſured the Emperour by his letters, not to depart thence, before it ſhoulde bee yeelded, during which ſiege, the Turkes came into Corſe, to the ſuccour of the French:<note place="margin">Turkes come to the aide of the French ſacke all the coaſt of Italy</note> eſpeciallye at the ſiege of Caluy, and Boniface.

An occaſion to mooue the Emperour (the treatie of peace beeing broken of which I tolde you) to ſende the Duke of Alua into Piemont and Italy, as his Lieutenant generall, there to reaſſemble his forces, and hauing ioyned vnto them the troupes of the Duke of Florence and of the Marquiſſe of Marignan, (who diſapointed of his charge was retyred as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto you) to take afreſhe new aduantages vppon the French, and driue them cleane out if it were poſsible.

The gnerall whereof, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his courrage in the verye eye of the French, who vnited altogether put them ſelues into the fielde to giue him battell, quitted Saint Iaco, leauing the great maſter of the artillerie, and well fifteene hundred men dead there at the ſiege, to drawe to Verſel, taking notwithſtanding certaine Caſtles, which hee ruined, except Gabiano,<note place="margin">The D. of Alua retireth.</note> and Bourg Saint Martine, fower miles from Cazal. This departure beeing knowne by the Duke <hi>D' Aumalle,</hi> reiecting their aduiſe which councelled him to follow the enemie, fering the inconueniences which had at other times fallen out to ſuch as too violently purſued their fortune, ioynte that the whole action was left to his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he reſolued to beſiege Vulpian, to deliuer the countrie of the feare of this noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome garriſon. So vppon the ende of Auguſt, two and twentie thouſand, as well French, as Almanes, Zuizers, and Italians, eight hundred men at armes, and twelue hundred light horſe, were encamped about it, cloſing it ſo ſtraightly in, as <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de La Lune,</hi> ſent thither by the Duke of Alua, to make fiue hundred harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers on horſe backe, Spaniſh and Italians, to enter in, had no ſooner paſſed the Pau,<note place="margin">vulpian beſieged battered and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted yeeldeth to compoſition.</note> but hee was ſurpriſed and defeated by <hi>La Roche-Pozay</hi> of Poiton, who tarried cloſe for him, ſuffering verye fewe of them to enter into the ſuccour of the beſieged. But the place beeing battered without ceaſing very furiouſly, for the ſpace of fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and twentye dayes, towardes the Mille, with fower greate Cannons, vnder the aſſuraunce of the Suizers, and with fiue other betweene the Towne and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21992:98"/>
the Caſtle by the French campe, and then on the ſide of the great bulwarke towards the Caſtle with fower other, it was in ſuch ſorte ſhaken, as the mines trayned vnder the great bulwarke, which flanquered the towne and the Caſtle, being ready, and opening at the very inſtant of the aſſault, cauſed the innermoſt part of the bulwarke to flie vp, where there was ſo large an ouerture made, as the Spanniards and the French, hauing long time in throng bickered together, ſhaddowed with ſuch a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomnes but in the end cleared, as perceiuing the beſieged to be at the mercie of the aſſailants, they quitted all the bulwarke except ſuch as yeelded themſelues. But the reſt not able to enter into the Caſtle, fearing leaſt to ſaue ſome the place and reſt of the garriſon might be loſt, were for the moſt part cut in peeces. Among which was a Nephew of the Duke of Aluaes. But <hi>Sigeſmond Gonzague,</hi> and the Capitane <hi>Lazare</hi> Lieutenant of the garde to the Duke of Alua, and ſundrie other remained priſoners. The other breach was better defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for that hauing paſſed the vp diche in water to the gerdle, they were faine to clyme and grapple vp with ladders, and armors to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to carrie. Albeit that the Prince of Anguyen, and of Conde, were there preſent for example to the reſt of the youth. So as many French men remained there dead, and the Earle of Creance ſo ſore hurt, as hee could not eſcape. But as ſoone as the generall had cauſed fower Cannons to bee placed vpon the reſt of the bulwarke to batter the hinderpart of the breach, and play alongſt the ſtreetes of the towne, the required parlie was accorded and afterwardes concluded, that they ſhould depart in men of warre, Enſignes diſplayed, drummes ſtroken vp, goods ſaued, and ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted as far as the riuer of Drie neere vnto Train, al the munition remaining in the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fower &amp; twenty howers after the Capitane of the Caſtle yeelded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame conditions, ſauing that it was reſerued vnto him for his more honour and iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his generall, that they ſhoulde ſhoote fiftie Cannon ſhot againſt the Caſtle. At this accord, and yeelding of the place, the Marſhall was preſent, about the ende of September, who for many occaſions refuſed to bee at the beginning of the ſiege. Afterwardes the place being as ſoone diſmembred, and vnfurniſhed of all her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, of a faire towne of warre there was made a countrie borrough. This done, the armie coaſting all alongſt the ſtrong places which the Imperials held vppon the waie of Pont d'eſture (which they thought beſt to take before the duke ſhould haue finiſhed his fortifications, being determined therby to make head to thoſe of Cazal, and ſtop the way to the French from Cazal to Turin) skirmiſhed with ſuch as ſailed forth of Trin and Creſcentin. Afterwards the encamped at Velleneuſne neere Cazal, where knowing that the garriſon of Pont d'eſture was lodged euen to the skirts of it, to wearie the French, and in the meane time prouide for the reſt of the places, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomne being already farre entred, and the diſcommoditie of winter, they turned to Montcaluo, which lying cloſe by Pont d'Eſture, ſuſpected nought. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, brideled Pont d'Eſture, and the reſt of the places vpon the Pan, as farre as the plaine of the Marquiſſat of Montferrat: ſpreading ouer beſides all the bounds of Cazal. Therefore the Cauallerie entertaining a hot repriſall of skirmiſh vpon ſuch as ſalied out of Pont d'Eſture, to couer the diſmarch of the fanterie and artillerie, which they carried for the batterie of Montcaluo, as ſoone ſurpriſed as ſcaled thorough ſo ſodaine arriuall, it cauſed the Imperials to thinke, that they had great intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein. And immediately the approches beeing made with the furie of the Cannon aboue twentie dayes together vppon the great portall of the Caſtle which defended one of the flankers, to breake the defences and diſarme it, it was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21992:98"/>
no ſooner endammaged, the mine hauing opened the bulwarke which made the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flancke, but they tooke it to compoſition, goods ſaued; the Enſigne diſplaied,<note place="margin">Montcaluo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> with one peece of artillery, three bullets, and three ſhot of powder; but all the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery which was found there diſmounted, remained, The 17. of October the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palleſt of them being retired to Pont d'eſture, were hanged for yeelding vp ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any aſſault, the army ſtill remaining about vntill the place was fully repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Afterwards the winter approching, the two armies were diſperſed into garriſons,<note place="margin">Certain captains hanged for ſo ſlightly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> who did no great matter worthy to be marked afterwards, except it were a running at the tilte with ſharp lances, between foure French men, to wit, the D. of Nemours, <hi>De Claſse</hi> eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Vaſse,</hi> the Captaine <hi>Manes Rochepozay</hi> his Lieutenant, and the Captaine <hi>Moucha</hi> Enſigne to <hi>Pinars</hi> againſt the Marqueſſe of Peſcaire, the Marqueſſe of Maleſpine, <hi>Dom Albe</hi> a Spaniſh Captaine,<note place="margin">Combat at the ſharpe betweene 4.

Moreouer, as the Marſhall <hi>Briſsac</hi> ſeeing the Winter to come on, cauſed his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to retyre into the Townes, hauing prouided for the victualling and Garriſon of Montcaluo, vpon the retreate of their companies to their lodginges: it happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the twentith of Nouember, that <hi>Clermontes</hi> company retyring towards Cazal, where he was appointed to Garriſon, was ſurpriſed by the Marqueſſe of Peſcaire, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with three hundred Harquebuſiers, and eight hundred light horſe, which ſtraight put them to flight, all their baggage remaining behinde, with fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty priſonners, the reſt ſaued themſelues within Caſal. In reuenge whereof, the eight day of December the Captaine <hi>Saluoiſin</hi> being aduertiſed, how not farre from him there were two companies of Italian light horſe, departed ſpeedily with a good troupe, marching all the night, and in the morning entred into the village, euen as the Italians were at breakfaſt, whome he diſcomfited and vtterly defeated,<note place="margin">Surpriſes of cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain companies in Piemont.</note> by the death of two of their cheefe Lieutenants, and well three ſcore other, the reſt remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning priſonners in the French mens handes, who carryed with them more then three ſcore horſe, and a great quantity of armour. Thus they diſturbed one anothers reſt in Piemont, where we will leaue them, to handle againe the renewed trauailes of the French and Imperials in Picardie.</p>
               <p>The Imperial army remaining onely but for the fauour and defence of the forces of Giuets, and <hi>Philippe Ville</hi> againſt thoſe of Mariembourg, Rocroy, and Mauber fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, paſſed away the time of warre without other fruit, auauncing the worke, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moſt that the Ligeois and Nauarrois was able better acquainted with the nouriture and tedious aboade of the troupes then all the other, the reſt of the Imperials remaining to weary the Garriſons,<note place="margin">Deſſeins of the Imperial army.</note> and to put the King to charge in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of them, and conſume the victuall of the Country, making account that Winter being come, it would be very hard for him to recouer, and more hard to put in any more, hoping thereby to cloſe them in and famiſhe them, or at the leaſt they promiſed themſelues what aduantage they would deſire, ouer thoſe that would vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall them anew: an occaſion that the D. of Neuers reſolued, while time ſerued to make a generall victualling, eſpecially at Mariembourg: but the time being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Sanſac</hi> his taking of Emery Caſtle, who was gouernour of Metz in the abſence of the Marſhall <hi>Vieilleuille,</hi> (which had beene ſurpriſed by the Captaine <hi>Beauieu</hi> of the Imperiall Garriſon at Theonuille:) Ioynt that the Admiral was not able to bring his men vntill the end of October, and likewiſe the great difficultie to get waggons and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21992:99"/>
cariages, which the labourers of Champagne and Retelet wearied with their paines already paſſed, refuſed whileſt that their tillage was to doe, was an occaſion that they marched not vntill the 30. of October, that the Admirall went to lodge at Rocroye, with the Vantgarde of fiue hundred men at armes, and ſome companies of French, hauing <hi>Sanſac</hi> and <hi>Bourdillon</hi> for auant couriers with the light cauallerie, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Harquebuſiers on foote, and one Regiment of men at armes to ſupporte them, marching all the night, to viewe the woods and giue their aduice, notwithſtanding the great raines and extreame cold, which ſo benummed the men, and eſpecially the draught horſes, that it was impoſsible, for many waggons turned topſie turuie, and broken, to reach but from Maubert fontaine to Rocroy, things not hauing bin made ready in their time and ſeaſon. Afterwardes there arriued the Duke of Neuers with twenty Enſignes of Almanes, conducted by the <hi>Reingraue:</hi> and for that reporte was brought, how the Prince of Orange taried them in places very auantagious to ſtop their paſſage with his Fantery, aſsiſted with his horſe men and Reiſters, they cauſed not the whole company to aduance forward, for feare of being encloſed in, albeit that <hi>Sanſac</hi> did ſince aſſure, how the enemy had no ſuch matter in hand: an occaſion that there entred but twenty waggons with Wine and Meale. So the laſt day of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober the army was deuided into quarters, in the ſight of the Garriſon, but ſo pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled with colde, haile, and froſtes, that many of the Sentinels were frozen to death, one league and a halfe from the Imperials, being encamped on the ſide of a Mountaine, betweene Sautour and Philippeville. But the firſt of Nouember they ſent out certaine companies to ſeaze the paſſage, and ſtreaſſe the victualers, in whoſe fauour they ſent thither a number of companies to reskew them, and conduct them to the Campe: and there were ſeene two notable chances, the one, how a Spaniſh double reall or twelue pennie peece ſaued a Souldiers life, who had a Harquebuze ſhot but ſixe paces of,<note place="margin">A notable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> without any harme, being notwithſtanding priſonner, he was ſent back againe with mony in his purſſe, by the Duke of Neuers, to carrye newes to the campe, how he alone was eſcaped of all the company: the other, a French Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſeeing his brother to be taken by the Imperials, laid about him ſo luſtely againſt thirtie which helde him,<note place="margin">The part of a Brother.</note> that he brought him away ſound and ſafe. In ſuch and like reencounters and skirmiſhes there paſſed 8. daies in great neceſsitie of victuals, and maruelous diſcommodities of the ayre, before Mariembourg: vntill that almoſt all the waggons and carriages were entred in. Then they retired themſelues to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons neere at hand, as alſo the Prince of Orenge to Bruxels to the Emperor, hauing ſufficiently prouided for Philippeuille and Charlemont.</p>
               <p>To enter againe into the eſtate of Almane, <hi>Ferdinande</hi> K. of Bohemia, aſsigned in that time in the name of the Emperour, a diet at Ausbourg of the eſtates of Almane, to accorde about the point of Religion, and prouide as well for the neceſsities of the Empire, as the particular of each one the yeare 1555. The Proteſtant Princes ſent thither their Embaſſadors, ſhewing that they held with the confeſsion of Ausbourg, according to which if they would giue them ſuretie, they would contribute to all reaſonable charges. Hereupon <hi>Auguſt</hi> Duke of Saxe, and elector by the deceaſe of his Brother the D. <hi>Maurice</hi> (whom the Piſtoll ſhot which hee receaued the daye of the battaile againſt the Marqueſſe <hi>Albert,</hi> cauſed to dye, as elſewhere I haue tolde you) and <hi>Touachin</hi> Marqueſſe of Brandebourg electors, the Sonnes of <hi>Iean Frederic,</hi> the <hi>Lantgraue,</hi> and ſome other Princes neighbours about, aſſembled at Numbourg, vpon the Riuer Solo, and there renewed the alliance which is hereditaire betweene the houſes of Saxe and Heſse. And vpon that they concluded, conſtantly to ſtick to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21992:99"/>
the confeſsion of Ausbourg. But fearing leaſt ſome ſuſpition might growe of any new and ſecret enterpriſe, the fift day of their aſſemblie, they wrote the cauſe therof vnto the Emperor, inſiſting vpon the article of the treatie of Paſſau, where the peace was concluded as I haue ſhewed vnto you: and proteſting that in all thinges they ſought the repoſe of Almanie, they propoſed the confeſsion of Ausbourg, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euery one to a generall quiet, and beſeeching that hee would not beleeue any which perhaps ſought to trouble the tranquility of the Empire. The K. <hi>Ferdinande</hi> had propoſed vpon the fifth day of February, ſuch matters as were to be entreated of; but for that many came ſo ſlackely thither, they began not vntill the 7. of March. Then the Deputies of the Princes Electors conſulted of the byls, and againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of many, they all conſented in the end, to begin with the point of religion. The like was concluded in the councel of the Princes and townes. After a long debate it was agreede that they ſhould leaue religion in peace; but they differed, in that the aſſociates of the confeſsion of Ausbourg, would haue it to be indifferently permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all kinde of men to follow their doctrine, and that they might likewiſe be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the benefit of the peace. The other ſide ſtronglye withſtoode that, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that that ought not to be permitted to any Townes, which ſince ſeauen yeares had receaued the decree made at Ausbourg touching religion, nor to any eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſon. And in caſe that a Biſhop or Abbot ſhould change his religion, they would haue him depriued of his place, and another put into his roome. They of the confeſsion of Ausbourg alleadged, that the diuine promiſes as wel of the olde as new Teſtament, in which our ſaluation is contained, appertained to all men in generall; by meanes whereof it was not lawfull for them to curtall or ſtraighten them, for feare of ſhutting both themſelues and others out of the kingdome of heauen. There was neither Iewe nor Turk, were he neuer ſo little affectionate to his religion, but would wiſh to drawe the whole worlde vnto it: how much more ought we to be thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, ſeeing we haue an expreſſe commandement from God for the fame: it muſt needs be then that all remaine in their libertie. Notwithſtanding, to gain peace, they permitted vnto them that they ſhould keepe their faſhions and ceremonies, vſe and enioy all their goods, poſſeſſions, cuſtomes, rightes and priuiledges, vntil the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent of religion ſhould be determined. But they would not allow the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be preſcribed vnto Biſhops, for thereby it might growe that they ſhould be bound to make warre againſt their allies of the ſame religion, and with great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour condemne their own cauſe, for it were as much as to confeſſe, ſaid they, that our doctrine and religion were not worthy of eccleſiaſticall goods, and that vntill this day ſuch goods had bene vniuſtly beſtowed vpon our Churches &amp; Miniſters. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we ſhould confeſſe the Papiſts doctrine to be holy, and their miniſterye groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the word of God, and that their goods were iuſtly deuoted to their order, life, ſtatutes, and ceremonies: and what a ſcandall would it growe, if we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their cauſe and goods, which ſerue to no end in the Church, and contrariwiſe we ſhould betray them whome we ought to holde in ſingular recommendation, by reaſon of the ſame religion. The Catholiques alleadged other reaſons, that if it ſhuld be lawfull for eccleſiaſticall perſons to change religion, within a while Biſhops, and like chapitres would be prophaned, and being cut of from the Churches, would fall into the Princes hands, and ſo remaine vnto them as an heritage: to which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that there was neuer any ſuch matter meant, but that their entent was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce things to their firſt inſtitution, and appropriate them to their true vſages, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goods for euer vnto the Churches; and to take away all doubt, they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21992:100"/>
to giue caution that no goods of Biſhops or chaptres ſhould be aliened, in caſe their religion ſhould be changed; prouided that after the deceaſe or reſignation of the Biſhop or ſuperiour, the election and adminiſtration ſhould be left free to them of the Colledge. Now after many differents of the one part, and other as well by wrighting as by ſpeeche, there was in the end agreede and enacted, the fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith of September, and read in publicque audience, according to the cuſtome, ſuch decree as followeth: the which being well obſerued, hath maintained the Empire and the Almanes in good peace, vntill this preſent.</p>

Theſe things are proper to bound in and encloſe ſuch proceſſe within certaine limits. Moreouer for that it appeareth that by the puniſhments of Heretiques, how neceſsarie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be, they haue not amended them vntill this preſent, but onely it hath beene ſhewed thereby how deteſtable the thing is, and further for that it is farre better to preuent a ſickeneſſe, then to giue it leaſure to grow, and afterwardes apply a remedie, you muſt herein (moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince) follow the cuſtomes and pathes of the primitiue and auncient Church: for ſhee was not eſtabliſhed either by ſword or fire, but the diligence of Biſhoppes hath alwaies reſiſted againſt Heretiques; becauſe that they alwaies inſiſted to preach the word of God, &amp; ſhew good example in their life. Conſidering then how the Church was by this meanes confirmed, there is no doubt but ſhee would still be able to maintaine and countergarde her ſelfe, if you woulde therein vſe your power, cauſing Biſhops and Pastors in their owne perſons to gouerne their Churches, and likewiſe all inferiour miniſters. That they liue holily, and teach the word of God or cauſe it to be taught by perſons ſit. And that hereafter the charge of Churches be not giuen but to men able of themſelues to teach, without ſubſtituting Vicars in their roomes. This is the roote, whereunto the hand muſt be put, this is the foundation vpon which the building muſt be framed: for by this meanes there is hope that hereſies will by little and little vaniſh away.

Theſe letters being brought to London at the ſelfe ſame time as <hi>Iane</hi> of Suffolke againſt her will, was proclaimed Queene within the Tower of London, cauſed a great chaunge of diſpoſitions among the Lordes there preſent and a ſtrange alienating of their mindes touching the caſe of <hi>Iane,</hi> whome ſundrie from thence foorth left to take <hi>Maries</hi> parte. The which cauſed the Duke of Northumberland to ſend certaine troupes of men at armes, into the Countrie of Norfolke, thinking thereby to hinder her deſſeins. But in the meane time ſhee was proclaimed Queene in Suffolke by the principall perſonages of the land. So as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing recouered ſome ſuccours from the Emperour on the coaſt of Flaunders, (albeit that the Duke had ſtrongly armed vppon the Seas to hinder their comming) ſhee practiſed with a number of the cheefe of the Duke his armie, which in the ende in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated themſelues to hers.

Thus ceaſed the trouble on that ſide within the Realme of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marie</hi> being thus receiued for Queene in England, they propounded vnto her certaine points to effectuate: as to reeſtabliſh the auncient Chatholique Religion, &amp; the goods of the Church into their former eſtate, then that it would pleaſe her to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with ſome Prince worthie of her and her Realme, thereby to draw a ſuccour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Crowne. Whereupon to the end that better and more ready order might bee giuen vnto the firſt, ſhee was counceled to ſend for her couſſen <hi>Raynolde Pole</hi> then a Fugitiue at Rome for Religion, who comming as Legate, and with full power from the Pope, might better aduance ſuch a matter then any other within the Realme, <hi>Pole</hi> being ſent for, and forward on his way with ſuch authoritie as was required, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift to viſit him as he paſſed by at Bruxelles: wher he ſo cunningly handled any Engliſhman, as he promiſed him that he would further the marriage betweene his Coſsin the Queene of England, and his ſonne <hi>Philippe</hi> Prince of Spaine, which tooke ſuch effect as you haue ſeene touching the ſeconde point which could not be ſo ſoone brought to paſſe. The Legate being receiued with great deuotion and magnificence into his Country, was in full aſſembly of the three eſtates of the Realme, begon the 12. of Nouember 1554. reſtored vnto all his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, goods and honours, whereof he had beene depriued by K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards vpon Wenſday the twentie eight of that moneth, the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land being aſſembled, and in the preſence of the King and Queene, hee expoſed his Legation, and exhorted them to returne to the holy Sea of the Pope, deliuering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, how greatly bound they were vnto almightie God, who now had enlarged towards them his diuine grace, hauing beſtowed vppon them two ſuch Princes as they had, further he ſhewed vnto them how the holy Father ment to vſe his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and accuſtomed clemencye, by him his Legate: greatly thanking them for that they had receiued him into his Countrie, and reſtored him in bloud, where in hee had beene ſo long attaint: and how in reſpect thereof hee helde himſelfe the more bound to procure that they might be reſtored into the heauenly Court, as his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall deſire was. That done he retyred, to giue the better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie vnto the Lordes of the Parliament to reſolue themſelues. And ſtraight waies the Chancellour repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the words of the Cardinall, ſhewed vnto them how much they were to thanke God, who had rayſed vp ſuch a Prophet of their owne ſeede to procure their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In ſuch wiſe as al with a common accorde concluded to conſent to the vnion and obedience of the Church of Rome. So as on the next morrow it was ordayned, that the Cardinals motion ſhoulde be accorded, and to preſent with a common conſent, a petition to beſeech their Maieſties, as the head of the realme to entreate the Legate to procure an abſolute remiſsion of all their errors paſſed: Promiſing to repeale all the lawes, which had beene in former times eſtabliſhed againſt the authoritie of the Sea of Rome. The King ſent the petition to the Legate, and the daye after the Parliament reaſſembled in the place where the Kinge and Queene with the Cardinall were ſet. There the Chauncellour roſe vpp, and with ſuch greate
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21992:103"/>
reuerence deliuered alowde the reſolution which had beene made by the Lordes of the Parliament, beſeeching in the name of them all, that their petition might bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which was written in Latine, formed and ſealed by the Chancelour. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition being opened by the Legate, was deliuered vnto the Chancelour to publiſh, who read it with a lowde voice, and that done, put it to the queſtion, which they all paſſed, and vpon that the King and Queene aroſe, and preſented the petition vnto the Legate who read the ſame. Afterwards hee gaue vnto them the Buls of his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reade, where by might appeare the authoritie which hee had from the holy Father to be able to abſolue them: that done, he made vnto the man Oration in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſhewing how much repentance was agreeable vnto God, and how the Angels in Paradiſe make more ioye of a ſinner which returneth to repentance, then of nintie and nine iuſt. And thereupon applied certaine examples out of the word to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Then hauing ended his ſpeech he aroſe vp, and the King and Queene kneeled downe on both knees before him, inuoking God and the Saints, that it would pleaſe him, to pardon the penitent people, in the authoritie of him whoſe perſon he there repreſented, all the faults which they had committed in times paſſed; that done the Legate pronounced a generall abſolution. Afterwardes they all followed the King, Queene and Legate to the Chappell, where was ſong <hi>Te Deum.</hi> And after that the Cardinall had made his triumphant entries, he reſtored on the firſt Sunday in <hi>Aduent</hi> to the Biſhoppes, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, all the power, authoritie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, which had beene taken from them. On which day, the Biſhoppe of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter hauing beene before times of the Proteſtant Religion, made a Sermon, after a ſolemne Maſſe, taking for his theame, <hi>Nunc tempus eſt de ſomno ſurgere,</hi> that is to ſay, it is now time to awake out of ſleepe, as if he woulde ſaie that vnder the Raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> King of England he had alwaies beene aſleepe. The Queene had in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſent Embaſſadours to Rome, with commiſsion to kiſſe the feete of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to preſent vnto him the dutie of a Chatholike Queene, and an obedient daughter of the holy and Apoſtolique Church of Rome, which ſhee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the head, Matrice and Soueraigne of all the Churches of Chriſtendome, and mother of all the Princes making profeſsion of the Goſpell. Which was ſo agreeable vnto the Pope, and the whole Courte and people of Rome, that for a publike teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thereof they made Bonfiers, and ſolemne proceſsions praiſing God for this conuerſion. Afterwards, and in the yeare 1555. an other Parliament was ſummoned in England, in which among other thinges Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> wrought by all the meanes ſhee was able, that the Abbie lands might bee reſtored, for ſo much as the Pope did vrge it very hard. But by reaſon that the Nobilitie and Gentlemen ſtoode ſeaſed thereof, and that manie had guifts thereof from the King, nothing coulde bee brought to paſſe as ſhee deſired. Notwithſtanding the Queene preuailed ſo much, as the tenthes were graunted to the Clergie: during this aſſemblie they ſcattered and ſowed about London little pamphlets very biting, among which ſome were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enough able to moue the people to ſedition againſt the Spanniardes,<note place="margin">Libels againſt the Spanniardes in England.</note> (with whome the Engliſhmen playde a thouſand ſhrewd turnes) and to turne the Queene from the loue of <hi>Phillip:</hi> Great ſearch was made, but it neuer could be poſsibly known whence they proceeded.

Whereof the Pope being aduertiſed, &amp; as ſoone animated againſt them, he leauied men: and by a generall muſter tooke away armes from thoſe whome hee thought had too much: he munitioned the places within Rome, and well furniſhed the Caſtle of Saint Angelo with all neceſſaries.

To whome hauing anſwered that he would take counſell vpon it, he put him notwithſtanding in a good hope, aſſuring him that hee would faile no whit in the vertuous deportments of his aunceſtors, and would ſuccour the holy Father with al his might, in any reaſonable ſort. Afterwards notwithſtanding hauing giuen aduice to the Emperour and his ſonne, endeuouring to meditate the whole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perſwaſions, then to come to action, contrarie to the couenants, ſo ſolemnly ſworne of each parte, for the repoſe of all the Chriſtian Churches. According to which at a feaſt which the King made at Fontaine-bleau, he cauſed before ſupper all the Embaſſadours to retire into the Chappell, in the preſence of whome he told the Emperours to this effect. That his maſter was not able to excuſe himſelfe, but that the warre which the Seigneur <hi>Marc Anthoine</hi> Colone made againſt the Pope, was maintained, and conducted at his expences and prouiſions. Moreouer this Cardinal had beene not long before ſeene in Fraunce a man of war at the Kings ſeruice, and was ſo fauourably entertained, that he was ſoone laden with preſents. Now for that there was no Biſhoppricke voide at that time, <hi>Bertrande</hi> the Lord-keeper of the great Seale, being requeſted by the King lent vnto him his Biſhoppricke of Cominges, which he beſtowed vpon the Cardinall <hi>Caraffe:</hi> and afterwards <hi>Bertrande</hi> was made Cardinall of Sens. <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinall of Lorraine,<note place="margin">Charles Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Lorraine and his vyage in into Italy,</note> being returned a little before from Rome, (hauing beene ſent thether to congratulate the election of the Pope, confirme the amitie of the French, and if it were poſsible to draw him in League againſt the Emperour, and who with great capitulations had made <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſecond Duke of Ferrare, the Kinges Lieutenant generally in Italy) ſeemed to fauour the deſſeine of the Pope.</p>
            <p>In ſuch an occurrence the King wanted no aduiſe, &amp; that very diuers: they which councelled him to breake the truce, laide before him the immortall honour which he ſhould obtaine to defend, yea and to free out of ſuch a ſeruitude the great Pontife the holy Father, and the vniuerſall head of all the Chriſtians in the world; which he was tyed the rather to doe, for that he ſeemed pricked forwardes thereunto, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall emulation of ſo many Kings his aunceſtors, who to retire him out of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, and to carrie themſelues as the true piller of the Chriſtian building, haue attained and preſerued as it were from hand to hand, that faire and ſo honourable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Moſt Chriſtian, and eldeſt ſonne of the Catholique Church. They likewiſe ſet before him the incredible profit, which he ſhould make in the conqueſt of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Realme of Naples, which being withdrawne from the Crowne of Fraunce, by the ingenious malice of the Caſtilians, and Aragonois, ſtoode ſo ſmally aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their hands, that with the great authoritie which the Pope had thoroughout all Italy, and the particular meanes of his owne houſe within that Realme, together with the fauours of ſo many Princes, who deſired nothing more, then to ſee againe the Flower de Luce better founded there then heretofore, there was no doubt but that the armie which he might ſend thether, would carrie it away euen at their firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde, conſidering the diſcontentment which the Italians carried againſt the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who maſtred them with all kinde of Rigor: and conſidering the ſmall forces which were there, and the retreate of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift: who not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21992:106"/>
himſelfe in the vanities of this world, had quitted all his goods, and eſtates thereby to liue priuate,<note place="margin">Perſwaſions to periurie.</note> and out of all managing of humaine affaires. And to remoue from him any opinion of diſhonour, which they would imprint vnto him, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waded him from breaking of his faith, giuen to the obſeruing of this truce, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto him that the accident ſince happened vnto his holines, cauſed ſo much more all occaſions to vaniſh, which might moue him to keepe his word, as the Pope is aboue all the perſons of the world. And as the Sonne could not be thought to doe his dutie, if he did not ruſh vpon his kinſman or allie, what friendſhip ſoeuer were ſworne betweene them, which went about to endamage his Father. So the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ambition of <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of Auſtria, who holde the Pope priſonner, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to doe their will, to the ſeruitude of all Italy, whence they determined to chaſe out the credit of the French, was ſufficient cauſe enough for him, to declare himſelfe protectour of the holy Sea againſt all violence. All good conuentions are lawful and to be kept, but the Pope <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Vicar is aboue all, is alwaies &amp; in al things excepted, as euery Soueraigne is in a reciprocall oth made among his ſubiectes: for they cannot preiudice the rights of their Prince, much leſſe then Chriſtians the right of the Pope, eſpecially in a caſe of ſuch importance. Iointe that Truces doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid war, but in Countries of obedience, not in other places where they haue nought to doe. Moreouer they do not hinder one from taking vpon him the defence of ſome friend or allie, by a much more ſtrong reaſon then of him, to whome all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are redewable for what ſoeuer they haue in this worlde, as to Gods Lieutennant on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne de Montmorency,</hi> and his nephewes <hi>Odet</hi> and <hi>Gaſpart</hi> of Coligny, called Chaſtillon with many others, repreſented vnto him for the contrarie, the eternall and generall diſhonour in all countries, which he ſhould get by breaking his faith, ſo ſolemly ſworne for the repoſe of his ſubiects, &amp; vniuerſall good of all Chriſtendome ſo miſerably torne in peeces, thorough the continuance of ſo vilanous warresl: yea and that there was a time, in which ther was demaunded of Princes only their word for all aſſurances: by reaſon that they ſaw them ſo wiſe and vertuous, as they woulde not change their promiſes for all the aduantages of the worlde. But as the malice of men encreaſed, whereto the Princes by little and little participated, ſo ſubiectes and ſtrangers haue required at Princes handes their faith, and oath, which all men, yea the very Turkes, and other of contrary Religion, hold inuiolable, ſauing at this daye Chriſtians, which firſt made ſhew of being willing to diſpence with ſo Religious a bond, as an oath is: which cannot but turne to the great diſhonour and generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquic of all Chriſtendome: the which no longer acknowledging any aſſurance vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among men, will fall into ſuch a confuſion, that the ſtrongeſt, and moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will make ſubiect the good, right, honour and all vertue at his pleaſure. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence then there is no apparance of honour to be gotten in ſuccouring the Pope, who of himſelfe, in reſpect of the dutie of his charge, ought to be aſhamed to aske it, and to giue occaſion to ſuch periurie and diſloyaltie. Yea if he were asked, how hee would truely iudge, or practiſe in his owne act if he were a King, he would make no difficultie to diſſwade ſo pernitious a deliberation: much leſſe the hope of a conqueſt of a Realme ought to ſtur him vp thereunto, conſidering the impoſsibilitie of gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, or at the leaſt keeping it, by men ſo farre off, ſo euill husbands, and bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiders againſt a nation ſo neere and wel aduiſed as the Spanniard: and eſpecially that this hope is founded vpon the amitie of Italians, whome we haue found for the moſt part vnconſtant, and variable in their duties, as ſo many examples paſſed may verye

well make vs wiſe enough, to counſaile well therein our ſuruiuours. And it is ſo farre off, that the farre diſtance of the Emperour ought to encourage vs to doe euill, as the good aduices wherewith he hath inſtructed his ſonne: the aduiſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident perſonages, which he hath lefte vnto him for counſell: the alliaunce of the Engliſh which will furniſh him both with men and money: together with the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which he hath not to degenerate in ought from the vertues of his father, nay rather to encreaſe them higher, if occaſion did preſent it ſelfe, ought to make vs the more to feare the vndertaking thereof, and to aſſure vs that we ſhall find ynough, nay more forces and meanes to ſtay vs euen in the beſt of the enterpriſe, then if the father himſelfe had taken the conducte thereof. All this notwithſtanding, and many other reaſons which were alleadged, coulde not hinder the breach of the truce and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition which was made into Italie, chiefely in the ende by the diligence of the Coneſtable. For albeit that he helde a hard ſtring to the contrarie, yet hee ſlacked for two occaſions. Firſt, that he perceyued, through the abſence of theſe vndertakers, he mought haue faire and eaſie meanes to make great and aſſure his houſe: ſo as hee was not in the ende ouer ſorrie, to ſee them of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> bearing armes to quitte the Courte, and goe the voyage, whereof hee hoped for no happie euente. Iointe, that he ſought to marrie his eldeſt ſonne, (whom 50000. crownes had a few dayes before redeemed out of priſon) with the widdow of the D. of Caſtre,<note place="margin">Marriage of Mareſchall Montmorency eldeſt ſonne to the Coneſtable.</note> the kings aduowed daughter. Whereupon the marriage being accorded, euen as it ſtood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poynte to be accompliſhed, his ſonne let him to vnderſtande in October, by <hi>Odet</hi> and <hi>Gaſpart</hi> of Coligny his couſin germanes, howe he had made a promiſe vnto the Ladie of Pienes, &amp; that he coulde haue no other. Whereat the father grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed, endeuoured notwithſtanding by all meanes to accompliſhe this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. So as hauing cauſed Pienes to be put in ſure guarde within the houſe of <hi>Filles Dieu,</hi> he conſidered with himſelfe, that herein he ſhoulde ſtande in neede of the Popes aſſiſtance, vpon that he ſent his ſonne to Rome,<note place="margin">The Pope the laſt ſuccour to flie vnto for breach of truce and oathes.</note> where he found <hi>Pierre Siroſſy</hi> mareſchall of Fraunce, and they beganne together ſo well to beſturre themſelues for the Pope, as they recouered agayne the porte of Oſtye, and other places occupied by the Spaniardes about Rome, which ſerued him but as a priſon. And yet all the meanes which mought be, was wrought with the Pope, that he ſhould not diſpenſe with him to marrie any other then Pienes: fearing leaſt that being once obtained the Coneſtable would breake the deſſeins of the warre. Whereof he being aduertiſed, and ſeeing howe the Pope vſed him but with delayes, &amp; diſſimulations, he beſought him to contente himſelfe with the ſeruice which he had done vnto him: So as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken his leaue, he retourned to Paris, a few dayes before Eaſter, <hi>1557.</hi> declaring vnto his Father, that that which he let him to vnderſtande of the promiſſe which he had made vnto Pienes, was only to induce him vnto the marriage, but that in trueth there was no other matter, in ſuch ſorte as preſently after the marriage was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with the Lady of Caſtres. The denyall thereof notwithſtanding proceeding from the promiſſe, which he mainteined he made vnto Pienes, was the cauſe of an Edicte which was then publiſhed, for the reciprocall duetie of parents and children, vpon the occurrance of their marriage.</p>

In the meane time the Pope haſtened forwardes the Kinges ſuccours, and ſollicited him harde, not to ſuffer the Duke of Alua thus to ſpoyle the holy Sea: as he likewiſe did vnto the Venetians, hoping to drawe ſome ſuccour from them,<note place="margin">The Venetians ſuccour not the Pope.</note> but that Seigneurie comforting him with woordes, condoled his grieuous miſhappes, without vſing any other duetie, or office of amitie, ſauing that they tooke paynes to ſeeke to appeaſe the differents, and mediate a peace betweene him and the Spanyardes. While theſe thinges were a doing, and the Spaniard battering the Forte of Oſtia, the Mareſchall <hi>Strozzie</hi> came to the ſuccour of it with ſuch Troupes of Fraunce as he had, rearing vp certayne ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, and retrenches, that the enemie ſhoulde not carrie away the cattell, and other goodes of the Romanes, encloſed within that Iſle. About the ende of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the King, as I tolde you aboue, diſpatched the Duke of Guiſe for to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the armie, which his Maieſtie ſente to the ſuccour of the Pope, and with him Duke <hi>Aumalle,</hi> and Duke <hi>Elbauſe</hi> his brethren, the Duke of Nemours,<note place="margin">The D. of Guiſe matcheth to Rome with the French armie.</note> the Earle of Eu, the Vidaſme of Chartres, and other Chiefetaines, all which mette together in Ianuarie 1557.

So as by the meanes of the Cardinalles of <hi>S. Iaques,</hi> and of <hi>S. Flour,</hi> they came to make a Truce for tenne dayes.

And in the meane time hee aſſayed to drawe the Venetians to the partie, who in the ende refuſed to declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the K. of Spayne. But the D. of Ferrara followed the Popes partie, as well for that he was a vaſſall and feodarie, as in fauour of the K. of Fraunce, following the aſſociation alreadie concluded and agreed betweene them. So had he alreadie aſſurance, as I ſayde before, of the title of Defendour of the Church,<note place="margin">D. of Ferrara named the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Church.</note> which the Kings of England were wont to carrie.

The K. ſhould put the like nomber of fanterie into the fielde, and 2000. horſe, &amp; the Ferrarois 6000. ſouldiars, 200. men at armes, and 400. light horſe with 20. peeces of battery.<note place="margin">League between the Pope, the K. of Fraunce and D. of Ferrara.</note> Thus the D. of Guiſe being entred into Italie, with an aſſured hope to ioyne ſuch ſuccours to the forces which I haue ſhewed you, and a great nomber of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie which followed him for their owne pleaſure, (&amp; ſuch as he mought well vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he had neere hand the two tierce of the flower of the nobility of Fraunce) could not imprint into the heads of the Italians, but a feare of great miſchiefe to enſue vnto all Italie, which he put into armes, in diuers hopes and dangerous partialities, through a ſuddaine entrie of ſo many people.

That his Sonne ſhoulde followe him therein, hauing lefte it as an expreſſe, nay te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentarie commaundement vnto him.

Hereupon, the Embaſſadour, who was a Biſhoppe, woulde haue diſſwaded his departure, and ſhewed him, howe his moſt affectionate friendes were much aſtonied, conſidering eſpecially that all reaſons, and good diſcourſe, were cleane contrary to ſuch a reſolution. And that in ſtead of goyng into Spayne, he were better drawe vp into Italie, or at the leaſt not abandon his Sonne, whome he mought aſſiſt with his good counſayle. To whom aunſwearing, that he could not imagine an olde Prince, euill diſpoſed, and afflicted in all partes as he was, was able to doe as a young Prince, whome he lefte ſo well inſtructed, and in ſo good a will to ſhewe himſelfe great, and a man of warre if hee were vrged thereto: and that it ſhoulde be well knowne, howe his abſence ſhoulde no whitte at all preiudice his friendes. The Biſhoppe woulde haue replyed vpon the affaires and greatneſſe of this worlde, but he interrupted him, praying him to thinke, that his thoughtes were no longer enter commoners with the worlde, to which he badde farewell, and to him likewiſe, and ſo they departed.

Not ſeeing for all that, the effecte of the prouiſion of the ſayde money to followe, which was promiſed vnto him for the men of warre, pioners, horſe to drawe the artillerie, building of bridges vpon boates, munitions of victualles, and other things neceſſary to the following of an armie, he made many diſpatches and inſtances vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the Coneſtable, who as then had the Superintendance of all the affayres of the Realme,<note place="margin">The breach of Truce begun by the aſſayling of Valence in the Dutchie of Milan</note> but hee coulde onely obtayne a ſlowe and no compleate prouiſion: and leſſe to perfourme any aduauncement of honour to any Captaynes of marke as their ſeruices deſerued. Notwithſtanding about the ende of December, 1556. the Mareſchall made an other recharge to the ſame ende, and likewiſe gaue his Maieſtie to vnderſtande of the reſolution taken betweene the Duke of Guiſe and him, vpon the breach of the Truce, and paſſage of the armie into Italye: which breach began vpon the enterpriſe, as they fantaſied vnto themſelues, of the towne of Valence within the Dutchie of Milan, hauing after many deliberations found this enterpriſe moſt fitte and commodious for the more eaſie paſſage of the Dukes armie. The armie beyng readie in the moneth of Ianuarie, albeit it was not ſuccoured with the aſſignations promiſed, yet not to ſuffer it for default thereof to lye ſtill, the Mareſchal borrowed vpon his owne credite, many groſſe ſummes, and eſpecially of the Duke of Guiſe. Yet all was ſo little to the price of that which was due, as they had much adoe to drawe the olde Italian bandes out of their garriſons, or any of the new french Companyes. Which made the armie more weake then it would haue bene. As the Secretarie <hi>Bounin</hi> declared, who as well for the effecte, as the reaſons aboueſayde, was expreſly diſpatched: chiefely likewiſe to giue his Maieſtie to vnderſtande, how to the ende the platte countrie of Piemont, mought not be lefte in praye to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of Aſte, Valſerniere, Foſſan, and Coni, whiles the forces of the Countrie were ſo farre eſloigned off, it was thought fitte to make a Leuie of 3000. foote, and 200. light horſe, which ſhoulde lye diſperſed about the Imperiall garriſons, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for their payment leuyed vpon the Countrie. Whereto thoſe which were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen made great difficultie to conſente, yet all was well executed in the ende. And the 14. of Februarie, <hi>S Foy</hi> had the charge giuen vnto him of 5. Companies of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and 100. light horſe, and the reſt of the ſaid Leuies, were from hand to hand diſtributed rounde about theſe Garriſons. The which cauſed great ſuertie, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie and ſuccour to his Maieſties affayres. Then according to the reſolution taken vpon the breache of Truce,<note place="margin">The order which the Mareſchal Briſſac gaue in Piemont.</note> the two armies marched towardes Valence, which they aſſayled the 12. day of Ianuarie.

This done, they helde a Counſell to aduiſe, vpon what ſhoulde be neceſſarye as well for the paſſage of the D. of Guiſe, as the reſt of the affayres concerning the K. ſeruice. To whome among other particulars it was propoſed by the Mareſchall, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties intente being to ſuccour the Pope, it was beſt to bethinke of the propieſt and moſt eaſieſt meanes to execute his Commaundemente, and increaſe his authoritie

Which as then was verie eaſie, the enemies and eſpecially the Inhabitantes of Milan being in ſuch fright and feare, as ſtanding very tickle within the Towne,<note place="margin">Enterpriſe of Milan.</note> which was abandoned by a great nomber of men, ſeeing the greater parte without any Fortreſſe, it was very eaſie for the Duke taking that way, to enter in: Iointe that there were no forces to hinder him, or which durſt oppoſe themſelues againſt him. That being Maiſter of the Towne, he ſhoulde be conſequently of the whole Eſtate, hauing power to commaunde there with ſuch authoritie, as in fewe dayes he ſhoulde haue meanes to finiſhe what remained therein to be fortified with earth and faggots, to cutte off and couer the ſaide Towne from the Caſtle. To fauour which enterpriſe, and occaſion more buſineſſe vnto the enemies, the Mareſchal offered to goe beſiege ſome little towne there, if he founde any facilitie at all to eſſay with, the Artillerie to carrie it away, and that in the meane time <hi>Saluoiſin</hi> Gouernour of Caſal, ſhoulde goe at a day agreed vpon betweene the Generals attempte, with the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Garriſon, the execution of the enterpriſe which he had vpon the Towne of Alexandria, of the places of moſt importaunce of the ſtate of Milan. Whereof there coulde no other then a good yſſue bee expected, as well by the intelligence which one gaue from thence vnto the Counſell, &amp; whom the Captaine <hi>Saluoiſins</hi> Secretarie expreſly went to fetch for that purpoſe, as that <hi>Saluoiſin</hi> had him ſelfe taken a view of the place. And to the ende that <hi>Saluoiſin</hi> mought the better keepe it being taken, the Mareſchall promiſed to come thither on the morrowe after the execution thereof with his whole armie: as well to asſiſt <hi>Saluoiſin,</hi> as to prouide for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhoulde be necesſarie for the asſuraunce, and conſeruation of the place, and that ſhortelie after he woulde marche to Milan, to giue order with the Duke of Guiſe for the getting of the Caſtle, and for ſuch affayres as concerned the Kinges ſeruice: and ſo to make the State aſſured vnto his Maieſtie. Thorough the conſideration whereof it was not to be doubted, but the Duke of Alua with the forces which hee had in Romagne, woulde leaue the Countrie to come ſuccour the reſt of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: as a matter of greater importaunce vnto his Maiſter, then the quarrell of the Pope. Who notwithſtanding ſhoulde by this meanes haue the ſuccoures which he deſired, without hazzarding an armie in ſuch daungers as mought fall out in ſo long voyages, and to which all ſuch as haue heretofore paſſed thorowe Italie in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Popes, haue for the moſt parte beene ſubiecte. Thus ſhoulde the will of his Maieſtie be perfourmed, with the Conqueſt of an whole Eſtate, for which,<note place="margin">What ſucceſſe the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue had in Italie, eſpecially in the conqueſt of the Realme of Naples.</note> Warre had beene ſo long time made in the Houſe of Fraunce. Furthermore the hope and apparaunce which was there to gayne the whole, or at the leaſt a great parte of the Seigneurie of Genes, yea by the inhabitauntes owne good will, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the necesſitie of Victualles, into which they were brought. Prouided that his Maieſtie, to whome a diſpatche for that ende ſhoulde be ſente, woulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the Galleyes of Marſeilles to ſcowre the Seas, and to keepe the Coaſt of Sicilie in ſubiection, to keepe the Genowaies from beeing that wayes any more ſuccoured with Corne, then they ſhoulde bee out of Piemont. And indeede the dearthe was there ſo great, for the ſmall time which they were in the Duchie of Milan, and thourough the taking of Valence, as that a ſacke of Corne was worth tenne Crownes. The propoſitions being at large debated of, were in the ende founde ſo good, and accompanyed with ſo apparaunt reaſons, as the moſt parte of them which were of the Counſell, ſeeing the importaunce of ſuch Eſtates, as thoſe of Milan and of Genes, which made a way vnto his Maieſtie to encreaſe his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie in Italie, Iointe the vncertaine and ſo variable occurrents, as

mought befall an Armie, in ſo long a voyage, and by ſuch an enemie ſo readie and reſolute, were of opinion, that they were to bee hearkened vnto, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhoulde with all dilligence be aduertiſed thereof. But the Duke of Guiſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an other intent of greater importaunce, tolde them that hee had receyued Commaundement from the King to proceede onwardes and not to ſtay: An oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that many haue ſince depraued this his aduiſe, eſpecially after the ende of his enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lautrec</hi> in the like accidente, conducting the Frenche armie, for the taking of Naples, after the deliuerie of <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt, allied with the Potentates of Italie, 1527. hauing taken the Towne of Boſco, Alexandria, Vigeneue, Pauia, and other places, as it was deliberated in Counſell, whether they ſhoulde ſtaye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Conqueſt of Milan, (to which they which helde the Frenche partie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to employe his men, conſidering the reſolution of them, and the fright of their enemies,) or paſſe forwardes, aunſwered that hee had commaundement to ſeeke further, and that he was principally ſent into Italie, for the deliuerie of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, that ſome thought <hi>Lautrec</hi> tooke this reſolution, fearing leaſt if they ſhoulde conquerre the Dutchie of Milan, the Venetians being confederate with the Frenche, woulde bee careleſſe to ſuccour the King in the Conqueſte of Naples. And it is poſſible likewiſe that the King thought, it woulde be better for him that <hi>Frauncis Sforze</hi> mought not entirely recouer this Eſtate, to the ende that no power remayning vnto him to bee able to vndertake ought, hee mought the more eaſilye obtayne the deliueraunce of his children, as yet the Emperours priſoners, by waye of accorde, which continually was treated of, about the Emperour, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Fraunce, Englande, and Veniſe.</p>
            <p>Thus then the D. of Guiſe reſolued vpon his firſt aduiſe, cauſed a bridge of boates to be made at Baſignaue ouer the riuer Tauaro, where his armie ſeconded with the Mareſchal <hi>Briſſacs,</hi> paſſed ouer to perfourme the voyage of Italie. And to the ende that it mought bee done with more ſuretie, and that hee mought auoyde the meeting of the forces which the Marqueſſe of Peſcarie cauſed in all dilligence to bee aſſembled, thereby to cutte him off from his paſſage, the Mareſchal entered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Laumeline, with a countenaunce as though he would marche towardes Milan: An occaſion that the Marqueſſe turned bridle ſuddainely towardes Milan, with the fewe forces which hee had, ſuffering the Duke of Guiſe freely to paſſe, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whither it liked him beſt.</p>
            <p>Vpon whoſe Ariuall, the Duke of Alua, for wante of money, and to ſuffer the firſt furie of the Frenche to coole, leuyed his ſiege from Rome, and retired vpon the borders of the Kingdome of Naples, there to defende the Frontiers from the diſſeins of the Frenche.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of Florence, he to keepe his dependances from waſte, and ſpoile of the enemie, and likewiſe to get leyſure to goe on with his Fortreſſes, lent his eare to ſome alliaunce with the King. But fortified as he was, hee retyred within his Towne. In ſuch ſorte, as <hi>Pierre Stroſſi</hi> Mareſchal of Fraunce, being departed one of the firſt, and encloſed himſelfe within Rome, with a nomber of French and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, had alreadie vnder the fauour of the Dukes comming, combated, and taken certayne Fortes and Blockehouſes, builded by the Imperialles rounde about the Towne, and vpon the Tiber: ſo as the Pope was before the ariuall of the Frenche, as it were, reſtored into full libertie, and Rome aſſured of her enemies.</p>

            <p>Nowe, albeit there was no talke of any warre in Fraunce, but onely by murmurs, and particular preſages, more then any publique declarations,<note place="margin">Warre begunne in Fraunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truce.</note> many preſumed that the warre of Italie woulde giue a beginning to that of Fraunce, yet the bruite being giuen out, howe the Arthois and Henaute Garriſons were reenforced to make a checke vpon ſome of the Frontiers, the Admirall Gouernour of Picardie, thinking to playe with the cunningeſt, meant to preuent them, and firſt of all, himſelfe to breake the Truce in Picardie. In ſuch ſorte, as about the beginning of Ianuarie. 1557. hauing ambuſhte himſelfe neare Douay, hee had entred in, in the night, while the moſt parte of the Garriſon was droncke, with drinking and crying the king drinkes, had not an olde woman by her long and lowde cryinges out, of Arme, Arme, the Frenche, giuen in the ende the Alarme thorough out, hauing ſoone ynough diſcouered ſome indiſcreete perſons among the formoſt of the French. But being retourned to Lans in Arthois, and entered within,<note place="margin">The Admirall breaketh the Truce in Fraunce.</note> he ſuffered it to be ſo pilled, as the Imperialles for a long time reproached thoſe cruelties to the Frenche: beſides that they alleadged the taking thereof, among the firſt occaſions of the breache of Truce.</p>
            <p>You ſee then on this and that ſide, the Spanyarde and Frenche diſpoſed to warre, ſeeking all meanes to ruyne them ſelues more furiouſly then euer. Nowe for that the broyles in Piemont, as the firſt ſeeme to mee more remarkeable, Iointe that certaine monethes paſſed ouer in Fraunce, and the Countries bordering about, in the preparations of a future warre, without any other more notable effectes then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue rehearſed, I will remember againe the Mareſchall <hi>Briſſac,</hi> to ſhewe you, howe hauing taken the Imperialles at vnawares, he purſued the poynte of his aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>After the departure of the Duke of Guiſe and his armie, the Mareſchall gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to fortifie and munition Valence with all that was neceſſarie: abiding notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a certaine time in Lomline, to holde the Generall of the Imperialles in ſuſpence of his diſſeins. And had vndertaken matters of greater importaunce, had money beene in his handes to contente his people, and furniſhe out ſuch thinges as were needefull for him. But for want thereof, reſolued to retire himſelfe, and keepe his aduantages, hee furniſhed Caſal, Montcalue, Valence, and Santia, each of them with ten Enſeignes of Fanterie, and ſome Cauallerie, againſt the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Marqueſſe, whoſe Forces grewe greater to the diminution of the French, for the occaſions aboueſayde. And albeit that the want of money, and the cutting off alreadie made by the King of certaine Companies of Piemont, as well in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as in paye, were ſufficient occaſions to hinder the Eſtate of his affayres in that Countrey, he ſente vnto the Mareſchall notwithſtanding about the ende of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, that in any ſorte ſoeuer, hee ſhoulde not meddle with the dead payes. And that euery moneth he ſhoulde ſend him an accounte, to the ende he mought aſſigne warrant for money to the Treaſourer of the extraordinarie: without any whitte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding howe nothing hauing bene ſente for the artillerie carriages, Pioners, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, commiſſaries, and matters vnlooked for, the Mareſchall ſaide hee was fayne to helpe himſelfe with thoſe dead paies. So as founding vpon ſuch defaults the ſmal aduancement which he made in Piemont, &amp; ſeeing how he preached to a deafe eare, hee beſought but in vaine his Maieſtie, about the moneth of May, to ſende ſome
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21992:113"/>
Gentleman vnto him, to controle his actions, to the ende that no euill mought bee preſumed of him. This notwithſtanding, albeit that hee durſte not muſter his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for feare of mutinies, thorough wante of paye, and that he was reſolued not to remayne ydle, hee employed his credite to recouer a ſumme of money, to make a loane vnto the companyes of Fanterie, attending the Kinges money. And hauing thus made them to goe into the fielde, hee ledde them, for the execution of the Counſell, to batter, and take in parley, the 22. of Aprill, Valeſerniere, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great and continuall raynes, all the while that the ſiege endured. A Towne which waſted all Piemont, and ſcowred the way from Aſt, to Cony, Queras, and Emeraſt: and Queras being with the ſelfe ſame furie, beſieged, battered, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely aſſayled, was taken by force the 29. of Aprill, the fourth day of the ſiege. Whereupon to encreaſe this fire of good will, and make the poore ſouldier to liue, more vpon the expence of the enemie, then of the allie, the ſiege of Cony was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued vpon and begonne in the ſame moneth. Whether the K. ſent money, which very little exceeded the only pay of the Zwizers. The Mareſchall notwithſtanding appointed muſtars to be taken, of the French and Italian Fanterie. But as ſoone as the ſouldiers knewe, that they woulde giue but a crowne a piece to a man, and that by the handes of the Treaſourer, the ſouldiers were not ſlacke to mutinie, and goe away in great Troupes, conſidering their long ſeruices, which had neuer beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and the newe faſhion of paying them, by other mens hands then their Captaines: who ſhewing themſelues no leſſe grieued, and reſting the beholders of ſuch inſolencies, without ſtirring to puniſh any, they made the Mareſchal goe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to procure them to returne backe, and aſſure them that the money ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto their Captaines, to diſtribute as they were accuſtomed. And albeit that ſo little money did not much content them, yet the ſiege was continued. In which the Mareſchall ſeeing that the batterie wrought no great effecte, and yet they which were beſieged, ſhewed a countenaunce as if they woulde yeelde if they were luſtily purſued, it was agreed that a myne ſhoulde bee made, right againſt the Batterie. Wherein they wrought long with daunger and difficultie notwithſtanding. But in in the ende being finiſhed, well cloſed, and ſealed vp, the fire put, and the aſſaulte giuen by the ruyne which it had lefte, the order eſtabliſhed for the aſſaulte was ſo euill kepte, and beſides the Souldiars wente ſo ſlackely to worke, as the Maiſter of the Campe being ſlayne, and a nomber of Gentlemen and Souldiers, who were the firſt which aduaunced formoſt, being dead on the earth, and the reſt beaten backe with the hurte of many gallaunt men, the euente ſhewed howe of an armie euill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, full of Captaynes and Souldiers diſcontented and diſobedient, no other ſucceſſe ought to be hoped for then vnfortunate.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Mareſchall ſente to declare vnto the King, together with the neceſſities of his armie, and the feare leaſt all woulde turne to ruyne for him, the inſtance which the Duke of Ferrara made, to cauſe the French armie to approache to the Dutchie of Milan, to the ende to helpe it with his forces and diſſeins: and likewiſe the impoſſibilitie of beeing able to ſatiſfie it, without paying at leaſt the Fanterie.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the Mareſchall hauing receyued newes, howe the Marqueſſe of Peſcare was ariued at Foſſan, with ſome forces in intention to approch neare Cony, to fauour them within, or aſſaye to compell the ſiege to be rayſed, a Counſell was helde, and reſolued to abandon Cony, to martch right towardes the Marqueſſe. But as ſoone as hee perceyued the Mareſchall to approache, he retired into Foſſan,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21992:113"/>
to the which the Frenche ſtill approached. By meanes whereof the Marqueſſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bee encloſed there, conſequently himſelfe to reduce this place to extreame neceſſitie, he wrought ſo well, as with the whole Infanterie he gayned Cony: But from thence not knowing howe to returne, he was conſtrayned to leade his men a trauerſe the mountaines to gayne the Sea ſhoare, and ſaue his people as well as hee mought. The difficultie of the wayes notwithſtanding was founde ſuch, as he loſt many of his people, and they which ſaued themſelues, ſo wearie, and defeated, as it was not posſible to bee more. As for his men at armes, and his Cauallerie, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned ſtill within Foſſan. Therefore it was agreed, that waſte ſhoulde bee made there round about. And further that Forces ſhould be layed all a longeſt the paſſages and wayes, that none of the Cauallerie mought eſcape.</p>
            <p>During the time that it was thus encloſed, many fayre feates, and notable ſkirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes were vndertaken, and diuerſly executed: Namely by the Vidaſme of Chartres, Colonell of the Fanterie of Piemont, <hi>D'Anuille de Terrides,</hi> and others, with ſo good watche kept all alongeſt the pasſages, as many Troupes of this Cauallerie, which was no leſſe then betweene one thouſande and twelue hundred horſe, were entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and defeated. The Frenche in the meane ſpace, entertayned the ſiege before Cony, and many Gentlemen and Captaynes trauayled, who ſhoulde be marked to worke moſt to the damage of the beſieged. Among the reſt, woorde was ſente vnto the King of the feates done by the Vidaſme, ſince the rayſing of the ſiege. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the breaking vp of milles, which had bene repayred by them of the Towne, blocked with a nomber of Fortes, which marueilouſly annoyed him. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the happie enterpriſes atchieued about Foſſan, by <hi>De Termes, Gonor, D'Anuille,</hi> and other, who gaue ſo ſmall reſte to their Troupes of Cauallerie, eſpecially their light horſe, whoſe courſings out were more ordinarie, &amp; remarkeable, as all thought they had yeilded occaſions enough vnto his Maieſtie, to be well and ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, for ſo well perfourming of their duetie.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee howe, and wherefore the meanes wanted vnto their Prince rather then the will, through the accidents, which leſſe fortunate in other places of Fraunce then in Piemont, happened at the ſame time, to counterpeaſe the Mareſchals good fortune by the diſgrace of his Coneſtable, as I will make you to perceyue, if you well and dilligently marke all the notable particularities, which I will deduce vpon ſuch and ſo important an occurrence. For it is leſſe then nothing to knowe the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the iourney of Saint Quentins: That is knowne as well to fooles as wiſe men, younge, and olde, men and women, homebirdes and ſtraungers, friendes &amp; enemies. But to applie it to ones profite, to the ſuretie, and aduauncement of the State, one muſt vnderſtande the beginning and true motiue: dilligently, and with affection marke the meanes as well forced as voluntarie, by which this disfauour happened: then note the effectes of them, and in the ende conſider the good and the badde, which hath enſewed vnto Fraunce, and the Countreyes aboute, vnder the obedience of theſe two Princes. This is called to reaſon of, and to reade Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as it appertayneth. The which I will doe, hauing repreſented vnto you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portement of the Duke of Guiſe, and his Armie in Italie.</p>
            <p>From Plaiſantin the Duke of Guiſe went to Regge, a Towne which appertained to the D. of Ferrara his father in law, who mette him at Pont de Leuz, &amp; all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with the Cardinall <hi>Caraffe,</hi> ſente thither by the Pope entered within Regge, where they conſulted of the diſſein, meanes, &amp; conduct of this warre. Some would
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21992:114"/>
haue gone into Lombardie to attempt the getting of Cremone and Pauia, whileſt that <hi>Briſſac</hi> dyd his dutie vpon that ſide of Nouarre and Valence. Other who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that in ſo dooing they ſhould giue leaſure to the Duke of Alua to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make a leauie of men, as well within the kingdome of Naples as Tuſcane, without forcing for all that, any one of thoſe Townes furniſhed with all thinges neceſſarie, were of opinion that they ſhould ruſh vpon Tuſcane to deliuer Siene out of the Florentines and Spaniardes handes. The Cardinall <hi>Caraffe</hi> founde it moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious to aſſayle the kingdome of Naples, by the March of Ancone (the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the ancient Picentines) ſaying that on that ſide of Terre de Labour, hee might conquere as much of the Countrie as ſeemed good vnto him. But the Duke of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara maintained, that the Duke of Guiſe being come for the cauſe of his holyneſſe, he ought likewiſe to go ſtraight on to Rome, and imploy himſelfe to the defence of the Pope. And that afterwardes the reſt ſhould bee thought of. That in the meane time hee would keepe himſelfe with his forces in his owne Countries, foraſmuch as he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not the Duke of Parma his neighbour,<note place="margin">D. of Ferrara at Veniſe and why</note> hauing entered into league with king <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip:</hi> and that he feared beſides leaſt the Florentine would make roades into his lands, if hee eſloigned himſelfe.<note place="margin">Corregge taken by the Spaniards vpon the D. of Ferrara.</note> So as according to this aduiſe the Duke of Guiſe marched with <hi>Caraffe</hi> towardes Bologne, and the Duke of Ferrara leauing the Prince <hi>Alphonce</hi> his ſonne for his lieutenant, went to Veniſe to aunſwere the Embaſſadour of Spaine, who made there grieuous complaintes againſt him, blaming the Pope, and King <hi>Henrye</hi> to make warre vniuſtly againſt his Maiſter, and to breake the truce ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Chriſtendome: beſeeching the Seigneurie to make warre againſt the Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois, and to enter into league with the Catholique King. Now as the Duke of Ferrara ſoiorned at Veniſe, the Marqueſſe of Peſcare ſeaſed vppon the Towne of Corregge,<note place="margin">The French army in Italie.</note> whence ſprange the firſt beginning of the war in the Countrie of Ferrara. An occaſion, that the Duke leauing Veniſe returned into his owne lands, to fortifie Modene, Carpi, and other places of his Seigneuries: whileſt that the Duke of Guiſe at Bologne, complayned to the Popes miniſters, howe he ſawe no ſuch preparation of warre, as had bene promiſed vnto the King. But they contented him, when they tolde him that there were tenne thouſand men in the March d'Ancone. And hauing paſſed by Imole, Rauenne, Faenze, &amp; Ceſene, he came to Rimini, where he viewed, and muſtered his Troupes, which he found to amount vnto fiue thouſande Swizers, ouer which the Marqueſſe d'Albauf his brother commaunded: foure thouſand Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeauen thouſand French, and Gaſcoignes, ſome Italians, fiue hundred and fiftie men at armes, and fifteene hundred light horſe. Ouer the Fanterie commaunded the Duke of Neuers. <hi>Cipierre</hi> was Maiſter of the Campe. <hi>Tauannes,</hi> and <hi>La Motte Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> were Mareſchalles of the Campe. On the other ſide the Mareſchall <hi>Briſſac</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out with his Forces into the fielde, cauſed Valle-Feniere to bee beſieged, a ſtrong place ſcituate betweene Aſt, and Carmignolle, which he enforced to yeild by compoſition, for the want of victuals which the Spanyardes had that helde it: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes it was ruyned topſie toruie. This done, hee made Chiauaſſe to be aſſailed, a Caſtle ſcituate in a high place, and bordering vpon Vlpian, which hee carryed away, albeit it was furniſhed with all thinges neceſſarie, and there he put in a ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to keepe it. While theſe thinges were a doing, the Duke of Alua cauſed his Armie to turne head,<note place="margin">D. of Alua in the Kingdome of Naples.</note> as though hee meante to goe to the Kingdome of Naples to defende it, imagining that the Duke of Guiſe woulde martche thither. Then hee furniſhed, &amp; fortified the townes of Arbuzze, a countrie neighbouring to the march
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21992:114"/>
of Acone, and in the meane ſpace the Duke of Guiſe tooke Campilio, and beſieged Ciuitelle, ſcituate vpon the Tiber on Tuſcane ſide, mounted vppon a high hillocke, hauing a rocke for the foundation of the wals, and of a moſt harde acceſſe vnto it. So as nature ſeruing it for a rampire, it ſeemed almoſt impregnable, thorough the greate ſteepes of her moſt deepe valleyes, all alongeſt which runneth the riuer Viperate. An occaſion that it laie not in the power of the French to inforce it, but they were fayne to leauie the ſiege after they had loſt many good ſouldyers and valyant men. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe little dyd the Marſhall of Briſſac gayne at the ſame time by the ſiege of Conie: For albeit that he had battered day and night this place appertayning to the Duke of Sauoy, yet hee was faine to leaue it in the end, for the ſuccour which the Marqueſſe of Peſcare had brought thether. Now albeit the Duke of Guiſe aduaunced lyttle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ciuitelle, the Duke of Alua notwythſtanding came to leauie the ſiege.<note place="margin">Ciuitelle reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the French.</note> So as hauing ſent certaine troupes vnder the charge of <hi>Garſie de Toledo,</hi> and Countie de Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly, to ſee what countenance the French made, they were ſo roughly reencounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as <hi>Garſie</hi> beeing defeated, and his troupes put in rout, <hi>Pierre Henriques</hi> maſter of the Duke of Alua his campe, was there taken, and almoſt all the Spaniardes cut in peeces, by the Vidaſme of Chartres, <hi>Tauannes, Cipierre,</hi> and others. Afterwardes the French beeing conſtrayned to leaue the place for the reaſons aboueſayde, were dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to Mont-fort by the inhabitants, who ſaying they were not able to ſupporte the inſolencie of the Spaniardes, woulde not bee reduced vnder the obedience of the Pope. But they coulde not yeelde the towne, which was the cauſe that the Duke de Palliane hauing battered it and ſcaled it, carryed it awaye by aſſault. The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes beeing retyred by another place of the Towne, and ſo the Citizens bare theyr pennance, beeing well pilled, theyr towne burned, and halfe ruined. Afterwardes the Duke of Palliane, and the Marſhall <hi>Strozzie</hi> ioyned both theyr forces with the Duke of Guiſes. Who ſeeing that what the Popes Legates and Nounces promiſed vnto the King, was but winde without effect, and that there was no meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his forces in Italie, as the Duke of Alua dyd his ordinarily: hee wrote vnto the King, giuing him to vnderſtand, that wythout newe ſuccours it was vnpoſsible for him to aduance his deſſeine, conſidering his enemyes forces, and the ſmall fauour which hee founde in thoſe quarters. Some haue left in writing, that that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Duke of Guiſe to write in that manner vnto the King, was for that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, how <hi>Codognac</hi> the kings Embaſſador at Conſtantinople, was diſmiſſed of his charge, and <hi>La Vigne</hi> put into his place. And as hee attended one hundred Turkiſh Gallyes which were promiſed by <hi>Soliman</hi> to <hi>Codognac</hi> for his ſuccours, hee receyued intelligence how the Turke had chaunged his mind, through ſome too high words vttered by <hi>La Vigne.</hi> Others ſaie that it was thorough the practiſe of ſome French men, enemies to <hi>La Vigne.</hi> In ſuch ſorte as the Kinges ſeruice was thus retarded in Italie, for occaſions ſlight inough. <hi>Natalis</hi> Countie of Nuouolare, confeſſed that the Turke woulde not ſtirre one whit in this buſineſſe for the king in Italy, for that hee ſawe no profite redound to himſelfe. Ioynt that hee doubted leaſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans agreeing together woulde ſeeke to diminiſhe his forces, and afterwardes make ſome attempt agaynſt him. And in deede thoſe which were in Corſe at ſuch time as <hi>Dragut-Rais</hi> brought thether the Turkes ſuccours, knowe that when the French beſieged Calui, as the Turkes had demaunded the firſt point of the aſſaulte, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues cruelly and bloudily cut in peeces, they beganne to ſuſpect and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſte the Chriſtians, to ſee howe the Spaniardes and the Frenchmen made
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21992:115"/>
warre the more gently one vpon another. And <hi>Iorden Vrſin</hi> had inough to do to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, and to pul out that hard impreſsion which they had conceiued againſt the French.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Guiſe in ſumme, ſeeing howe on all partes the effectes fayled of ſo rich promiſes as had beene made vnto his maſter, and confirmed vnto him ſince his comming into Italy. Ioyne that the forces of the Spaniſh Duke beganne to growe greater, and increaſe in courage, by the aduertiſement which they had of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the French, before that his owne were too much diminiſhed, and the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage too euidently turned elſewhere, reſolued to put it to the hazarde of one daie. Therefore ſeeing himſelfe neere enough vnto the Duke of Alua his campe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented battell vnto him betweene Fermie and Aſcolye. To which the Spaniarde woulde not hearken: Were it that hee found himſelfe too weake, or that he thought by delaie hee might better ſerue his turne. In the meane time King <hi>Phillip</hi> had no ſooner made the aduauntage of his armie to appeare in Picardie, but the King ſent to the Duke of Guiſe,<note place="margin">The Pope retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the d. of Guiſe</note> that hee ſhoulde retire home. Who ſeeing that all the burthen of the warre lighted on the Kings armes, and that it was ſo farre of from the Popes furniſhing of twentie thouſand men, as hee had promiſed, that hee was not able to paie ſixe thouſand, nor disburſe the fourth parte of the charge of the armie. Ioynte that the Ferrarois were ſo farre from ſuccouring the Pope or the King, as the Duke of Guiſe was faine to ayde him with ſome of his men, fearing beſides leaſt the Pope woulde make a peace wythout comprehending the King therein, concluded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into France. But the Pope fearing to bee lefte alone, and leaſt hee ſhould be afterwardes compelled to accord at the will and diſcretion of the Spaniard, ſware vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hee woulde neuer agree wythout the Kinges aduiſe and conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and how for the better aſſurance thereof hee woulde ſende his ſonne the Duke of Palliane, as hoſtage into Fraunce. So as this ſo large an offer retayned the French longer, during whoſe vaine aboade there happened the defeate of Saint Quentin in Permandois. Which beeing knowen at Rome, ſo greatly aſtonied the Pope, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe out of all hope to haue anie further ſuccour out of Fraunce, hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to followe the counſell of ſundrie Cardinalles, which verie earneſtly ſolicited him to make a peace with the Spaniarde. Who in the meane time determined to plant agayne the ſiege before Rome: not that hee was in anie hope to take it, but onely to inforce the Pope to a peace, which hee knew was greatly deſired by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike king. But the Duke of Guiſe vnderſtanding this deſſeine, and the effects thereof, fayled not to approach vnto Tiuoli, a place ſcituated vppon the Teueron, to front the enemie, and to inforce him to leauie his ſiege. The which was the cauſe that by all the meanes they poſsiblie coulde, they haſtned the treatie of the peace ſought by the Venetians, and the Duke of Florence. The Pope ſending on the eight of September in his name, the Cardinalles <hi>Carlo Caraffe, Saint Fior,</hi> and <hi>Vitolloce,</hi> with ſome Romane Lordes towardes the Duke of Alua, who as then laie at Canie, a place ſcituate in the Romane Countrie, neere to Pilaſtrine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre of the whole.</p>

In ſumme, the peace was concluded betweene the Pope and the Spaniard, and ſuch were the Articles:<note place="margin">Articles of peace between the Pope and the Spaniard.</note> That the Duke of Alua dooing all kinde of obeyſances due, and ſubmiſsions in the name of the king of Spaine his maſter, ſhould beſeech pardon of the Popes holyneſſe: That hee ſhoulde receiue him as his good and obedient ſonne, participating vnto him ſuch graces as were common to other: That king <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhoulde doo the lyke, by an Embaſsadour expreſly ſent from him to Rome: That the Pope as a mercifull and debonarie Father, ſhoulde receiue the Catholique king as his ſonne, and giue vnto him all ſuch graces as hee was wont to doo, and accorde to other Chriſtian kings: That his holyneſſe ſhoulde renounce the league with the French king, and declare himſelfe a father to the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both the kinges, wythout anie one more than the other: That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King ſhoulde render vp all the townes, places, caſtles, and fortreſſes, beeing of the domaine of the Church, which had bene taken ſince the ouerture of this warre. Hee ſhoulde make bee builded agayne and repayred, all ſuch as had beene ruined and diſmembred by the Spaniardes: That all the artillerie taken on the one ſide or the other, in what ſorte ſo euer, ſhoulde bee reſtored againe into the handes of his auncient poſſeſſour: That they ſhoulde forget all ſuch executions as had ben done by iuſtice during this warre, were it by death or banniſhment: and all confiſcations of what perſons whatſoeuer, wythout anie mannes reſearching after into them. As alſo all ſuch as thorough this diſſention were driuen out of theyr landes, goods, and dignities, ſhoulde bee reſtored into theyr good renowme, goods, honours, ſtates, and dignities, right actions, and Seignouries. Prouided that they had loſt theſe thinges by meanes of this warre, to the ende this peace might not bee auaileable to <hi>Marke Anthonie Colone,</hi> nor to <hi>Aſcaigne de la Corne,</hi> but that they ſhoulde remayne outlawed, at the will and diſcretion of the holy Father. That the Dutchie of Palliane ſhould bee put in ſuch eſtate as it was then, by the conſent and good liking of both partyes, into the hands of <hi>Iean Barnardin Carbon,</hi> which was the ſequeſtrer, who ſhould ſweare to the Pope and the Catholique King, to keepe faith to both parties, and obſerue the articles and agreements made and accorded betweene the Duke of Alua and the Cardinall <hi>Caraffe.</hi> Which <hi>Carbon</hi> was to haue the keeping of the Towne of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane, hauing vnder him eight hundred ſouldyers, payed by the Pope and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique king.</p>
            <p>Theſe Articles were ſworne to in the name of the ſayde Princes, the Pope, and king <hi>Phillip,</hi> by the Cardinall <hi>Caraffe</hi> and the Duke of Alua, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion and faculties giuen vnto them, ſwearing by the ſoules of theyr Princes, to obſerue all the whole without fraude, cauelling, or anie exception whatſoeuer: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a truce for a certayne time, contayning paſport and ſafeconduct to the Duke of Guiſe, and to all the Captaines and ſouldyers of the king of France, to departe out of Italie, and the Countries appertayning vnto king <hi>Phillip,</hi> as well by ſea as by land. Afterwardes they ſigned and ſealed the whole in the preſence of the Cardinals of S. <hi>Flour,</hi> and <hi>Vitelle,</hi> who lykewiſe ſigned the preſent Treatiſe. And forſomuch as it was not ſet downe therein to whome <hi>Palian</hi> ſhoulde appertaine, ſince that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrer kept it in the name of both the princes contracting, there were ſecrete arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles agreed vpon between the Cardinal <hi>Caraffe</hi> and the Duke of Alua. In which it was contained, how that it ſhould remaine at the will and diſcretion of the catholike king, either to ruine or leaue that place in her entire, without being lawful for him to repair
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21992:116"/>
or fortifie it, vntill the ſayd Lord King had giuen ſome place of like value and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to the Popes ſonne for recompence. And anie difference falling out vppon that exchange, the Senate of Venice ſhoulde giue iudgement thereof, wythout either the one or the other parties refuſing to obey what ſhuld be ordayned by that Seignorie. And the recompence beeing once made by king <hi>Phillip,</hi> hee might then beſtowe the place of Palian vppon whom it liked him beſt, ſauing anie ſuch as were an enemie to the Church of Rome. And that he which ſhould haue Palian in ſequeſtration, ſhould bee bound to depart ſo ſoone as the place were diſmembred. Such was the iſſue of the affayres of Italie, and of the armie which the King ſent for the Popes ſuccour, the which was followed with a ſtrange ouerflowing inundation of Tiber, as I will cauſe you to ſee elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Now that each partie had of a long time turned his deſſeignes to the warre, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red notwithſtanding by the concluſion of this truce, yet had the Spaniſh Councell much better and from longer hande prouided for the preparatiues and inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof. For <hi>Phillip</hi> put as ſoone an armie agaynſt that of Italie (by which he drew out of the realme, the flower of the nobilitie, and the moſt renowmed Captaines and ſouldiers which were there) the moſt accompliſhed and beſt furniſhed with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of anie that had beene ſeene of long time.<note place="margin">The deſseines &amp; old preparations of king Phillip.</note> To the end hee would not faile to ſet forward his firſt fortune, which he meant to proue in the view of all the potentates of Europe, eſpecially of the French, in whome hee meant to ingraue by the beginning of his enterpriſes ſuch a dread of his forces &amp; means, as that for euer after they ſhould bee more ſtayed, and leſſe ſtirring againſt him, than they had beene againſt anie of his anceſtors. <hi>Henrie</hi> on the contrarie (as the French is neuer aduiſed but vpon the blow) prouiding onelye for his armie which marched to affranchiſe the Pope from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">Deſsignes and preparations of king Henrie.</note> (to whom ſuccours was almoſt as ſoone promiſed as demanded) hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but too late, through want of intelligence the galliard preparatiues of <hi>Phillip,</hi> found himſelfe no leſſe aſtonied to ſee he was taken at a lifte, than perplexed through the difficultie, whereof reporte was made vnto him, of finding finances to leuie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, furniſh, and imploy ſo groſſe an armie withall. Which to hinder the enterie and ſacke of his realme to ſo puiſſant a neighbour and ancient enemie, was a matter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for the richeſt and pooreſt Prince of Chriſtendome, (thorough the abundance, and yet euill husbanding of his meanes) in making readie the preparatiues, whereof hee knew a great deale better the difficulties which preſented themſelues to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of his haughtie deſseignes, by the complaintes which all the eſtates of his Realme made to bee reſounded on all partes, as ſoone as the bruite of another warre refreſhed theyr memorie wyth remembrance of ſo many ſorrowes paſſed.</p>
            <p>Two houſes at this time poſſeſſed king <hi>Henrie</hi> more than anie other of his realme, that of Guiſe and Monmorencie, both of them recommended for the antiquitie, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and renowme of their races, vertuouſly imployed to the profite and honour of the crowne of France. But that being the greater, better allied, richer, and of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme throughout all Chriſtendome, woulde not acknowledge the Monmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian equall to itſelfe, ſauing in the fauor of the Prince, whoſe grace towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable mounted ſo farre, as that hee would conceale nothing from him, doo all things by his aduiſe, and vouchſafe him ſometimes to bee his bedfellow, the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect beeing kept ſtill ſuch as hee ought. So as beeing ſet in authoritie, thorough the credite and exceeding vertue, as well of his foure ſonnes, as of his three nephewes of Chaſtillon, and other his kinſmen, who bare honorable offices, all of them within the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21992:116"/>
realme, hee ſeemed to haue no need of deſiring the increaſe of ought, but only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his greatneſſe, prouided that no diſaſter did croſſe the courſe of ſo happie a purſuit. Thoſe of Guiſe no leſſe ſupported by the merite of their owne valour, and put in authoritie thorough the ancient renowme of ſo many princes, iſſued out of the houſe of Lorraine, ſought to make themſelues greateſt in the kings fauour, by a farre greater number of ſignall ſeruices with <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Frances</hi> of Guiſe, might doo to the flower de Luce. So as, as well to continue their owne dutie, as their aunceſtours and fathers, they had vndertaken the voyage of Italie, to the end to deliuer Pope <hi>Iulie</hi> out of the Spaniardes handes: and if promiſe ſhould bee kept with them, to imploy them ſelues to the conqueſt of the kingdome of Naples, hoping by that means much more to extoll the kings power &amp; credit among forrain nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>De Guiſe</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals remaining onely behinde in Court to entertaine the king to the conduct of ſuch a deſſein. Which lykewiſe was greatly fauoured by <hi>Diane de Poitiers,</hi> ſole heire to S. <hi>Valier,</hi> Duke of Valentinois, who to imploie thereto that part of hir credit, which her beautie, comely carriage, and quickneſſe of ſpirite (graces hatefull inough to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Katherine de Medices</hi> Queene of France) had gained vnto her of the king, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen one of her daughters in marriage to <hi>De Guiſe</hi> Earle of <hi>Aumaule,</hi> who accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke his brother into Italie. Now as all greatneſſe ſtandeth accompanied with the paſsions of the Court, vpon the preparatiues which king <hi>Phillip</hi> made dayly, to be reuenged of the loſses aboueſayd, men began to ſhew vnto the king the damage and diſhonour, which thorough the abſence of his forces, the breach of truce ſo ſolemnly ſworne would bring vnto him: how the Duke of Guiſe had ſpent one hundred and three ſcore thouſand crownes a moneth, without hauing done ought elſe than ſeene <hi>Ciuitelle,</hi> a frontire towne of Naples the ſmall, or rather no aduantage at all, which hee had receiued by the breach thereof. How that the king of Spaine beeing well ſetled in his quarters within Italie, had aſſembled together ſuch forces, as it was an eaſie matter for him to aduance the ruine of France, if hee ſhould enter in againſt ſo few people as were to preſent themſelues vnto him, in the ranke of whome, notwithſtanding the Conſtable humblie beſought his maieſtie to place him, that hee might imploie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, together with his owne meanes, the lyfe of himſelfe, his kinſmen, friends, and ſuch other as would follow him in ſuch an enterpriſe, as much perforced and vncommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as it was. The king greatly bewailed ſuch an accident: but as hee was one of the beſt princes and moſt eaſie to bee managed, as France euer ſawe, hee dyd not greatly torment himſelfe, thorough the hope which the Cardinall of Lorraine and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Valentinois had giuen vnto him. How the whole matter could not but receue an happie iſſue, and how that the Conſtable, chiefe of armes, might aſſemble men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make head to the Spaniard, if it would pleaſe his maieſtie but to ſende him towardes the frontires, there to make readie the campe. The which hee was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doo. So as hee departed from Compeigne, (where the king as then laie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by thoſe of Guiſe) with ſpeed inough to go to Noſtre dame de Lieſſe, there to receiue his troupes together, which ſhould bee ſent vnto him out of all partes. In the meane time they ſtudyed vpon all meanes (the kings treaſure beeing alreadie dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen drie) how to procure monie for the entertaining of ſuch an armie, in which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared great difficulties, accompanyed with grieuous complaintes in many places. In ſumme, beſides the great and ordinary impoſtes which were leuied vpon the people, new taxes and particular loanes were put vpon them, with ſurcharges ſo exceſsiue, as they grew intollerable vpon the third eſtate, which the continuance of the warres had alreadie eaten almoſt to the bare bones. The miniſters and beneficed men of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21992:117"/>
Church; albeit they alleadged how that they were exempt, &amp; priuiledged from ſuch charges, were neuer a whit ſpared, but ſeazed according to their tenths, to the vtmoſt value of the reuenue of theyr Benefices. The Nobilitie but euen freſhly returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warres paſſed, with a hope of a good repoſe, to helpe vp themſelues againe, ſettle order in their houſes, and eſtabliſh theyr reuenues to come, was agayne called, as wel to appeare in the Rirebandes, as to inroll themſelues in the kinges ordinances, who diſpatched commiſsions to leauie new companies, and to fyll vp the olde. The <hi>Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> bringing vnto him one thouſand Piſtolliers, and eight hundred Lansknets, came to ioyne with his forces. In the meane ſpace to preuent the firſt deſseines of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, to fauour the aduancement of the fortifications vpon the frontiers, and whileſt that the armie was making readie, at the end of Ianuarie, 1557. the reſt of the men at armes of France, were ſent as the moſt ready force which the king had, to be diuided among the moſt dangerous frontires, eſpecially in Campagne. For that the imperials ordinaryly made theyr deſcent moſt that waies, and to fauor the fortification of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croy, which ſerued as a counterfort and ſupport to Mariembourg and Maubert Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Fortifying in lyke ſorte, and munitioning the reſt of the places vppon the frontire, they repayred vp agayne the platforme and pan of the wall behinde the caſtle of Mezieres, which was much fallen downe. The ſpring notwithſtanding and moſt part of the Summer paſſed ouer, without anie matter worthie of memorie, ſauing the attempt of certaine of the garriſons vpon Roc Roy, which I wil ſhew vnto you. After hauing repreſented the place to the naturall.<note place="margin">Roc Roy and his repreſentation.</note> It is a barren ſoile more than two leagues round about it, where you can ſee nothing but high woods, ſtanding water, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, eſpecially in the waſt &amp; vnmanured places groweth nothing but briers, thorns, broome, and heath, for that the molde thereof is clay: the plains &amp; bottomes all moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh where the fort ſtandeth. The reſt of the places are hard and ſharpe rocks, without anie moiſture or bearing of fruit, ſauing catmint and moſſe, which maketh it farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the incamping of an armie, by meanes of the ſeate and barrennes of the place. The fort hath fiue frontes, which they tearme in forme of <hi>Pantagone,</hi> couered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with four great bulwarkes, garniſhed with their flankers, Cazamates, &amp; plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes: then the old fort which ſerueth for the fift, each carrying his particular name, ſo great and ſpacious, that euerie one may lodge two thouſand ſouldiers, and a greate deale of artillery. A matter verie commodious for the retrenches and rampires againſt the enemie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the defences there are ſo ſurely couered, and without anie daunger of batterie, that it is verie vneaſie to take them awaie: ioynt that the heeles and ſhoulders thereof are ſo large and thicke, that they couer a great part of the Courtines. And for the better enduring of the rampire, the turfe and the earth is ſo claie and ſlammie, as if it ſoake in neuer ſo little water, it ſtiffneth and hardneth inough of it ſelfe. Therefore the fourth of Aprill the imperiall garriſons beeing aſſembled together, marched ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to breake downe the banke, which as yet was reared but two foot high, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the moſt part of the ſouldiers would ſallie out vpon their curriors, with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cut off theyr waie, and ſo hew them in peeces. Then (together with ſuch as fled to enter peſle meſle within the forte) they ſawe the ſouldiers euen and anone ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying out file a file to the skirmiſh, againſt the firſt, as the indiſcreet heat of the French doth alwayes carrie. But the whole companie comming vpon them to cut off their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, the reſt which were within the forte in armes, to make the view and deale the laſt, iſſued forth ſo readily, and with ſuch reſolute charges, as the other were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to drawe backe and retyre themſelues in the end, to defend themſelues from the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21992:117"/>
number of Cannon ſhot which played vpon them with out ceaſing.</p>
            <p>Paſsing ouer thus ſome time in theſe light attempts, the ſeuenth of Iune the Queen of England ſent an Heralde of armes to proclaime warre vnto the king, who, the king hauing made it bee declared vnto him by the Conſtable, how graciouſlye hee vſed him, in reſpect of the puniſhment which hee deſerued, in that he had paſſed thorough his realme without ſafe conduct, was curteouſly ſent backe with preſents, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: which was, how hee accepted of the defiance, in hope to make her know, that wythout anie occaſion at all ſhee had offered this vnto him, conſidering the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which had paſſed as well from himſelfe as his aunceſtours towardes her and her nation.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it was ſufficiently inough apparant, how that ſhee had beene as it were importuned heereunto by her husband, in reſpect of the diuiſions and partialities of that Realme, as well betweene the Engliſh and the Spaniardes, as among the Engliſh themſelues. The moſt parte imagining howe that theyr new king, diminiſhing theyr forces and meanes by ſuch warres, would ſeeke the more eaſily to make himſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of theyr fortreſſes, and vſurpe the ſuperintendance, which he ſo much longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to manage all things at his owne will and pleaſure. You ſhall elſe-where ſee what inſued heereupon. In Iuly the Prince of Piemont, <hi>Almora</hi> Earle of Eguemond, the Duke of Aſcot, and others, prepared an armie at Giuets, curious to performe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter better than they dyd at the firſt attempt. Which they had aſſembled together for to haue ſurpriſed Rocroy, at the verie firſt puſh. But their vant curriers were ſo luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet vpon by thoſe which iſſued out to the skirmiſh, as the groſſe comming to aſsiſt and ſupport them after a long meley of hot buckling together, and infinite Cannon ſhot which rained among them, was conſtrayned in the end to leaue a great number of theyr dead behinde in the field, whileſt they turned vppon the frontire of Picardie,<note place="margin">K. Phillips armie.</note> as if they had meant to haue attempted vpon Guiſe, before which the whole imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all armie laie of thirtie fiue thouſand men, and twelue thouſande horſe, tarrying for eight thouſand Engliſhmen: who landing at Calis and in the Countie Doye,<note place="margin">K. Henries armie.</note> was to ioyne wyth them at Saint Quentines. King <hi>Henrie</hi> his armie aſſembled it ſelfe at the ſame time at Atygnie. But as theyr foreſight was not ſo great as the Spaniſh, no more was theyr number, nor theyr meanes found to be alike. There might be about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thouſand fantaſsins of Almanes and French, fiue or ſixe thouſand horſe, of light men at armes, as well French as Almaine, coaſting alwaies notwithſtanding the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials within foure or fiue leagues following, the Countrie of Tieraſche, reſolued to cloſe themſelues within Pierre Ponte, a place very commodious to ouerrun the whol frontire, and there to diſtribute ſuccours among the garriſons, with ſuretie of thoſe troupes which ſhould keepe the field.</p>
            <p>The aduantage which grew vnto the imperials thorough their long foreſight,<note place="margin">The aduauntages which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards &amp; Flemings had ouer the French.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brought foorth vnto them ſo ſtrong an armie, and the variable and diligent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march of theyr troupes, cauſed that the French beeing inſolent, and contemning the enemyes forces, (againſt whome ordinarily they eſteemed it inough to prepare them ſelues vpon the blow and intelligence which preſented it ſelfe) did in no ſorte prouide to withſtand the enterpriſe of <hi>Phillip,</hi> and beeing at the verie pinch vncertayne of his intent, they were not able to iudge by the deportments of his armie to what place he meant, whereby they might furniſh it as were neceſſarie. So as firſt the Kinges coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and afterwardes the Conſtables, beeing diuided into two partes, ſome thought that the Prince of Piemont would vndertake nought elſe, and turned to no other end than to make an honorable retreate. For that not hauing bene able to aſſemble his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21992:118"/>
together ſo ſoone as he imagined, through the diſtance of ſo many diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as he was to drawe his men out of, and other diſcommodities, the opportunitie was eſcaped him, far attempting any matter of great importaunce. Eſpecially for that he was repulſed from the Frontier of Champaigne, whither they ſayde his principall entente was. And albeit that other were of a contrarie opinion, aſſuring howe there was a certaine complotte, an aſſured Rende-vous, and a full foreſight determined, whither he meant to turne his Forces, as vnto a matter which he helde alreadie halfe conquered, beeing well aduertiſed of ſuch wante, as there mought be, ſo farre, as the Admirall did aſſure, (by intelligence receyued) the Coneſtable his Vnckle, how that the Prince meant to haue a blow at Picardie, as a place very euill prouided. Ioint that the Spaniſhe bandes which were within newe Hedin, (the beſt Troupes which they had) were not as yet diſlodged: the Frenche, (as mens ſenſes being diſperſed doe leſſe apprehende one of thoſe things which they doe beholde, then if they were all fixed vpon that alone) being curious to furniſhe the whole, prouided not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently either for the armie, or any other of thoſe places, whereby they mought ſtay the enemie, who ſtill entertayned them with his long delayes, and irreſolutions, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the vncertainetie of his diſſein, vntill that the Prince, hauing made a ſhowe, as though he woulde firſt encampe before Guiſe, then at Mariembourg, had encloſed rounde S. Quentins with his light Cauallerie.<note place="margin">S. Quentin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed rounde before that the Frenche once thought thereof and leſſe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it.</note> And at the ſame inſtant cauſing his whole armie to martche with extreame dilligence, hee founde himſelfe encamped rounde about it, before that euer he coulde be thought to haue bene halfe way. The ſuddaineſſe whereof made the whole Campe to doubte leaſt the place woulde be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſurpriſe, as well for wante of men, as other prouiſions and fortifications with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Towne, which had but the Captaine <hi>Brueil</hi> for gouernour, and <hi>Telligny,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt to the Daulphin, of a Companie of one hundred men at armes: the better parte of whome were therein Garriſon, at which the Inhabitauntes grewe ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcontented, conſidering as they alleadged, that their priuiledges did exempte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them, as whatſoeuer enſued thereupon, was rather attributed to their owne faulte then to any others. The Admirall, being commaunded by the Coneſtable, to get into the Towne with as many men as hee ſhoulde be able, vnder a hope of being ſuccoured by him:<note place="margin">Gaſpard Colig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Admirall and Gouernour of Piccardie get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into S. Quentin.</note> albeit that <hi>Iarnac</hi> and <hi>Luſarche</hi> offered themſelues to goe thither, and keepe him from aduenturing ſo great a danger, perſwading him to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſomewhere elſe, where he ſhoulde be able to doe the King more ſignall ſeruice, then to caſt away himſelfe there within, did ſo much notwithſtanding, as with foure hundred &amp; fiftie men, as well horſe as foote, he entred in. Afterwardes hauing made the Rounde about the walles, encouraged the Inhabitauntes: whome he aſſembled together in the common Hall, viſited the whole Towne thorough, ouerlooked the prouiſions and munitions of warre, and giuen the quarters vnto Companies, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for all the reſt the beſt which he was able. Now for that <hi>Iulian Romero,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondelet</hi> ſpaniſh Captaines had alreadie gayned the bulwarke of Fauxbourg d'Iſle, where they had ſettled their Enſeignes, notwithſtanding any reſiſtaunce which could be made. Iointe that it was without parapette, and the earth without as high as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Admirall yſſued out to regayne it, and to burne the houſes about. But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged were ſo euill receyued, and hottely purſued, as many returned hurte, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Admirall to abandon that Fauxbourg, conſidering the ſmall number of men which he had, and the two paſſages to the Flankers thereof, by which the enemie mought cutte betweene the Fauxbourg and the Towne, and ſo hinder the retreat of ſuch as ſhoulde defende it. But he would needes ſtill holde it vntill a greater occaſion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21992:118"/>
were offred, to ſet a good countenance vpon it. Hereupon beeing willing to viewe the encamping of his enemies, he commanded <hi>Teligny,</hi> to cauſe 50. horſe of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This done, perceyuing the preparratiues of the enemie to batter the Fauxbourg d'Iſle, hauing carryed away whatſoeuer was por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and prouided for the burning of the houſes vpon the watch worde giuen, hee quitted it, and cauſed the whole to be burned. Nowe as the Inhabitantes had hidde their prouiſions, notwithſtanding any commaundement or dilligence vſed to forbid them, (among whome the Maior aloane and the <hi>Sire de Gibercourte,</hi> were noted to doe their duetie) ſo their faulte in concealing the powder, which had lyen a long time hidde in the Towres of the gate of the Fauxbourg d'Iſle, was a cauſe of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience. For to the ende they mought carrie it away, as ſoone as it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the cakes being all rotten and mouldering into pieces, they were fayne to put it into blankettes, where the fire tooke ſo at vnawares, with ſuch violence, of this diueliſhe mixtion, as it made a breache of more then fiue and thirtie paces,<note place="margin">Gunpowder.</note> beſides the loſſe of ſixe and thirtie ſeruiceable men, which wente all into ſmoake. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the enemie had a fayre occaſion preſented to vndertake ſome thing to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, if the fire of the houſes of the Fauxbourg which burned, had not taken away the ſight of this breache from the Spanyardes, who mought eaſily haue entered in at the beginning, for that euery man was retired to feede, and other neceſſaries. And albeit that the Coneſtable greatly payned himſelfe, to get ſuccour into the Towne, according to the aduiſe, which he had receyued from the Admirall, who to this ende had ſente foorth <hi>Vaupergue,</hi> and from the toppe of a ſteeple had ſhewed him by what wayes they were to take their courſe, yet <hi>Dandelot</hi> his brother was not able to bring any in, for that certayne Engliſhemen priſoners among the Spanyardes, had aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of this enterpriſe. An occaſion that hauing entrenched and furniſhed the high way to Han, by which they were to paſſe with harquebuſiers, (for ſo much as that quarter being allotted to ſuch Engliſhmen as were ioyned vnto King <hi>Philips</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, was leſſe peopled with men of warre) the thirde parte was there ſlayne,<note place="margin">Meanes to ſende ſuccours to the beſieged, and howe to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſured.</note> and the reſt enforced to ſaue themſelues, albeit they had a nomber of men at armes and light horſe to aſſiſte them with hotte alarmes, whileſt that they ſhoulde enter in: In the meane ſpace to viewe the Countrie, and to hinder the enemie from enlarging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, attempting vpon him as occaſions were proffered. But <hi>Vaupergue,</hi> had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently marked the places which were ſhewed vnto him for his entraunce in, but gaue ſtraight vpon a Corps de guarde of Fantaſſins, in ſteade of paſſing betweene it, and one other of Cauallerie. Where he ſhould haue founde nothing but Sentinels, and haue bene able to gayne a little hill, all alongeſt the Vines, by which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>S.

An occaſion that the Admirall had nowe ynough to doe, to encourage the beſieged, aſſuring them that the Coneſtable woulde not ſuffer them to be loſt within, and that together with himſelfe, ſo many Gentlemen would not tarrie there if they ſuppoſed they ſhould be but loſte. It was about this time, that nine thouſande Engliſhmen, &amp; 1500. horſe,<note place="margin">Engliſhmen ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to K.

told you. In the meane time the Admirall cauſed 700. idle monthes to be put cut, to eaſe the towne ſo much in fauour of the voluntary men. The Prince euen as ſoone made his trenches, and aproches againſt the porte of <hi>Romicourt,</hi> vnder the fauour of the hedges and trees, which had not beene before cutte vp by the beſeeged. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Admirall aduertiſed the Conſtable, and of the mariſh, by which way onely they were then able to ſuccour them: promiſing to rampire and fill vp certaine little deepe channels, which hindered their paſſage. The which he did by the Captaine <hi>S. Romain:</hi> and to croſſe the Riuer which runneth through and ouerfloweth this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: they cauſed fowre boates to be brought, vpon which, being chained together, and reaching from the one ſhoare to the other, they might well haue paſſed, if they had beene able to lande on the banke, whileſt that a hotte alarum were giuen to the whole campe. Vpon which the Conſtable being reſolued, hee departed the 8. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> from <hi>La Fere,</hi> with two thouſand horſe, fower thouſande Fantaſſins, as well Almaines as French, trayning fower field peeces alongeſt. Being ariued ouer againſt the village called <hi>Le grand Eſsigny:</hi> he made a ſtand, and taking the D. of <hi>Neuers,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and ſome others, he aproched as neere as he was able to <hi>S. Quentin,</hi> as farre as the deſcent of the mariſh without diſcouering any enemy. Afterwardes hee ſent <hi>Du Fumett</hi> to viewe neerer, and make report of the diſtance of the enemy from the towne, and of the mariſh from them, together with the largenes of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The which he did, with two other more, who agreed ſomewhat with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: whereupon on <hi>S. Laurence</hi> day in the morning the tenth of the moneth, there were ſet in battaile, at the place of execution neere <hi>La Fere</hi> ſixteene French enſignes, and two and twentie Almaine with fifteene peeces of artillarie, whither the whole cauallerie came to ioyne with them. Then they aduanced as farre as <hi>S. Quentines</hi> by nine of the clock right to the fauxbourge <hi>de Liſle</hi> on the ſide of fourteene Spaniſh Enſignes, where the whole was ſet in order of battaile. On the ſide beyond the water, and the mariſh, was the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> &amp; his army, far ſtretched forth, hauing for ſentinell, within a mile on this ſide, two Spaniſh Enſignes, which were ſodenly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe and conſtrained to retire themſelues beyonde the cauſey. At the ſame inſtant the french artillery thundered ſo furiouſly vpon the Campe, &amp; eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Princes Tent, as he had no leaſure to put on his armour, to retyre himſelfe into the next quarter of the Count of <hi>Aiguemont:</hi> to whom euery man retired in a ſtrange diſorder. Now for that they doubted a certaine dangerous paſſage, diſtant about one league from <hi>Fauxbourg d'iſle,</hi> (where the french Cauallery lay) they ſent thither a cornet of <hi>the Renigraues</hi> piſtoliers, to the end to haue newes ſooner by them, then footmen, which were rather like to be loſt then ſuccoured, as alſo that they were the more eaſily able to retire. And for a greater ſtrength the D. of <hi>Neuers</hi> went thither with three companies of men at armes. Vpon this the Conſtable vſed all meanes to make his men to enter in: but the boates not being able to come to the other ſhore, through the aboundance of the ſouldiers, which entred in by ſuch heapes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlie, were ſo ouerladen, as by reaſon of the durte and ouſe in which they ſtooke, it was vnpoſſible for any great number of men to paſſe ouer: beſides at the going out of the boates, the preſſe of the ſouldiers was ſuch as they were not able to follow the waies and pathes ſhewed vnto them. An occaſion that they ſcattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deepe ditches of the mariſh, whence they were not able to get out, but remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there all mirie, and the moſt part drowned miſerablie.</p>

But their aduice preuailed, who rather counſelled a retreate, then to aduaunce further with ſo fewe men, conſidering the furious diſmartche of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Ioynte that hee was not come thither to hazzarde the Forces of Fraunce, excepte that hee were greatly conſtrayned thereunto. And further howe hee had ſuccoured and furniſhed Saint Quintin with all neceſſaries, as hee thought in ſpight of the enemie.

With whome being ioyned, and keeping the lefte winge, they came ſafe and ſounde vnto the Coneſtable, who alwayes gayned grounde of the retreate, whileſt that his enemies encreaſing, aduaunced forwardes, and had alreadie gotten aduauntage of him, in eighte great battailions of Cauallerie and Reiſtres.

The which the enemie attributing in the beginning to an aſſured reſolution of Combatte, ſhewed himſelfe vncertayne of the charge, vntill that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing the Financiers, marchauntes and other,<note place="margin">The occaſion of the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> (following the Warres for their pleaſure, or profite) to retyre apace, to ſaue themſelues, with their money and marchandiſes, from an enemie ſo neere vnto them, and afterwardes the ſeruauntes, whome they cauſed to bate to retyre, all which chaunging their pace to a galloppe, aſtonyed at the retreat of theſe marchauntes, retyred themſelues with great cryes, witneſſes of the feare which had alreadie poſſeſſed them, it made the Compte of Aiguemont to thinke, who ſuddaynely cauſed the Prince to be aduertiſed thereof, that the Frenche Armie quaked, and that it was nowe time to trye their fortune, and to charge vpon ſuch an aduauntage.

That the Swizers ſhoulde make themſelues readye to martch, albeit that they were ſo tyred, and neare driuen of all handes, by being euill payde, as that they woulde hardly be able to bee ariued within Fraunce, before that the occaſion for which his M. ſought

them were paſſed ouer. And that by this meanes Piemont without cauſe woulde remayne vnarmed, and in great daunger: beſides the loſſe of time and expence, which had bene employed and beſtowed vpon the bringing of the ſayde Foſſan and Cony into that extreame neceſſities in which they then ſtoode. But at the ſeconde ſummons of his Maieſtie, the Swizers muſt of neceſſitie be ſent away,<note place="margin">The Swizers goe out of Piemont</note> who as it was foretolde grewe altogether vnprofitable, thorough the long aboade which they made at Lions, being very ſicke, weake, and euill payde.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Mareſchall hauing vnderſtood that vpon this defeate his Maieſtie had cauſed newe Companies of men at armes to be addreſſed, hee greatly beſought for <hi>La Mothe Gondrin, Franciſque Bernardrin de Pauan,</hi> and Vicompt <hi>Gourdon,</hi> but they mought not be gratified. He offered for all that to come in perſon himſelfe vnto his Maieſtie, in this his great neceſſitie to doe him ſeruice, but it woulde not bee accepted.</p>
            <p>Certayne dayes after his Maieſtie perceyuing howe few Forces were remayning in Piemont, the Swizers being departed thence, and foreſeeing the daunger of ſome inconuenience like to enſue, ſente worde vnto the Mareſchall, that in ſteade of thoſe Swizers, he ſhoulde with all ſpeede leuie newe Companies of foote, and that hee ſhoulde wante no money to that ende. Notwithſtanding there was onely ſente to paye the olde bandes, which were in extreame neceſſitie, many monethes hauing bene due vnto them: Yea, and in ſteade of remedying the neceſſities of Piemont, his Maieſties pleaſure was, to accept the offer, which vnwitting to the Mareſchall was made vnto him by the Vidaſme of Chartres, Colonell of the Infanterie,<note place="margin">The Vidaſme of Chartres carieth 2000. Fantaſſins into Fraunce.</note> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into Fraunce from thence two thouſand Frenche harquebuſiers, and as many Italians. Which being accordingly put in execution, it was altogether apparaunt, that thereby his Maieſties affayres were put into extreame perill and ruyne, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being ſtrong, and the Frenche feeble, ill payde, and comming ſo lately from receyuing the deſaſtre of the defeate of the Armie, and loſſe of Saint Quentins.</p>
            <p>As the time thus paſſed away, with verie ſmall aduauntage to the Kings affayres, the Preſident <hi>Baillif,</hi> made offer vnto the King of himſelfe, and vnwitting to the Mareſchall, that hee mought leuie in Piemont, two or three hundred thouſande crownes, leuying three crownes vpon euery houſholder, which offer was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted without any aduiſe at all demaunded of the Mareſchall, but there was likewiſe preſte money deliuered vnto him vpon the aſſignations of Piemont. And whileſt that his Maieſtie made difficultie to heare ſuch reaſons as mought bee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged touching the impoſſibilitie of ſuch a leuie, there was no prouiſion made for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of men, nor money, in ſo much as many loſſes and inconueniences were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to enſue: Eſpecially for that the Vidaſme ſtill purſued the execution of his Leuie of two thouſande harquebuſiers.</p>
            <p>For if any man woulde haue conſtrayned the bandes of Piemont, to muſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paye, it was to be feared that it would haue happened worſe then it did at Cony.

Who mought very well haue called to minde howe diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye times woorde was ſente vnto him, that the prolonging of the Muſters, was onely wrought and occaſioned, by the delaye of the money, the wante whereof rendred the ſouldiers poore, and made them diſobedient, and an euidente loſſe to the finances of his Maieſtie, which notwithſtanding they colde by no meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, without hauing meanes to make a rigorous muſter.

But notwithſtanding he made light account thereof, ſo as euerie man began to ſeeke an other ſupporte then his, and to perke vp the noſe againſt him. Now as his Maieſty ſtoode aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed how that the enemies had leuied great companies of reſolute men in readines after the comming of the D. of <hi>Alua,</hi>

And for ſo much as his maieſtie had made ſemblance to miſlike the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie which the Marſhal made vpon the leuy of two thouſande Harquebuſiers, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Vidaſme</hi> offred to bring into Fraunce, diſpatching the eighteene the Secretarie <hi>Bounin,</hi> for inſtance of ſupplie and prouiſion of money, he gaue him in charge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto his ſaide Maieſtie that whatſoeuer he had done was not with any intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to contrary his will, but for ſo much as his Maieſtie had not as then countermand (as he had done ſince the thirteenth) the Enſignes of the <hi>Zuizers,</hi> who not returning backe, and the ſaide two thouſande Harquebuſiers going away, there was ſmal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.

Vpon which leuie, what fayre wordes ſoeuer or amiableneſſe he could vſe, many inconueniences were readie to enſewe. Shortly after, the King in like ſorte commaunded him, that hee ſhoulde ſende vnto him, by <hi>Lodun,</hi> the Commiſſions for the Captaynes, which ought to be prouided of vacant Companies, which hee muſt needes doe, albeit he had neuer meddled with thoſe Companies ſince the comming of the Vidaſme: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that all his predeceſſours had bene accuſtomed, to nominate the ſame compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as had bene practiſed as well by himſelfe in his owne right being Colonell of the footemen, as by them which had bene before him. This diſgrace was likewiſe offered vnto him, that notwithſtanding any requeſt which had bene made by him in the fauour of <hi>Oſſun,</hi> and <hi>Fraunciſque Bernardin,</hi> to be a meanes they mought receyue the order, hee coulde neuer yeilde them any aſſurance thereof, but it was <hi>D'Anuille</hi> which carried it away, ſo as euer after they depended on the Coneſtable. In ſumme, the Mareſchall ſtill continuing, to make inſtaunce of ſupplie, wherewith he mought be able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt his enemies forces, who might vndertake eyther the forcing of ſome holde or fortifiyng themſelues in ſome new, and by that meanes mought abate their nomber, it was aunſwered him, that they were matters eaſier talked of then done, and that he muſt needes confeſſe, that winter was alwayes win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, during which ſeaſon, men were accuſtomed to ſurceaſe armes. An aunſwere in deede coyned by his enemies, who woulde not ſo much as call to minde the taking of Lans, Valence, Iuree, and ſundry other places in the monethes of December and Ianuarie, in the very hearte of Winter. Thus did the complayntes of the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall moue the Kinges Counſell bente to turne their eyes an other waye, no more, then the newes of their enemies comming into Piemont, no not ſo much as the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente of the Duke of Alua, at Gennes with 7000. men:<note place="margin">The D. of Alua his armie at Gennes.</note> and that attending their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall in Piemont, the enemies had put themſelues within Galliany, (which the Mareſchall willing to haue fortified, onely for a time to haue founde the enemie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed, was conſtrayned for want of money, to leaue and rayſe it) which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to fortifie. And leſſe the going away of many Captaines and ſouldiers day by day, eſpecially the Captaine <hi>Benes</hi> who demaunded leaue to departe home to his owne houſe; and replie being made vnto him, that hee did but come thence, hee perſiſted to ſay that hee woulde goe, come what woulde, and whereas he was adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take time to conſider thereof, and afterwardes deliuer his minde vnto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchall, he refuſed it, and the nexte morning wente home without once bidding farewell. For this cauſe he beſought his Maieſtie, that ſuch diſobedience mought not goe vnpuniſhed, and that his Companie mought be beſtowed on the Captaine <hi>Liſle:</hi> which the King liked well of,<note place="margin">Captaine Liſle.</note> and yet was it afterwardes rendred agayne vnto him. Of which the Mareſchall afterwardes complayning, and ſtanding vpon, it had bene deliuered and beſtowed on the Captaine <hi>Liſle,</hi> Serieant of the Battayle, who had long and faithfully ſerued, they woulde yeelde no credite at all vnto him, but the companie was beſtowed vpon <hi>La Roche</hi> a gentleman of <hi>D'Anuilles,</hi> who had beene nothing ſo long a Seruitour.

the inſtances and importunities which he continued as well by letters, as expreſſe meſſengers to haue the affaires of <hi>Piemont</hi> better prouided for, brought forth no fruit at all, as ſmall credit being yeelded thereunto, he beſought leaue of his Maieſty that he might come home, and kiſſe his hande, eſpecially to declare vnto him the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of his affaires and to deliuer vp an account of the gouernement which hee had receyued,<note place="margin">The Mareſchall Briſſac going out of Piemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, leueth Gonner his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liuetenant generall.</note> the which his Maieſtie graunted for this cauſe, hauing ſetled all thinges as conuenientlie as he was able hee departed out of <hi>Piemont,</hi> leauing <hi>Gonner</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kinges Liuetenant Generall in his abſence. Being arriued at the Court, &amp; vnderſtanding how ſome bad impreſſions had beene put into the Kinges heade, as well againſt him as ſundry other Gouernours and Captaines in <hi>Piemont,</hi> he beſought his Maieſttie, hat he would ſende thither to ſift out the matters to the ende, that hee and they might be puniſhed, in caſe they were founde true: and if they were found contrary, that the accuſers might beare the puniſhment, which the accuſed ſhould haue deſerued: to the ende that by this example all falſe accuſers might bee taught. Notwithſtanding his Maieſtie woulde doe nothing, ſaying that hee beleeued no whit at all the accuſers, that he ſhould ſpeake no more thereof, but perſeuer wel &amp; diligentlie to doe him ſeruice. Let vs leaue the Mareſchall at the Courte, to looke backe into the olde purſuites which they began to renew againſt the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> for expiation of the deſaſtre and miſfortune of <hi>S.

But the miſcheefe was indeede, for that none of them, which had the publicke gouernemente, and to whome it appertained to prouide thereto, did regard with any good iudgement founded vpon the holy Scriptures, who were the Heretickes, and what the true and falſe is, thence to drawe out a true rule &amp; concorde, and that the true office of a King was to giue himſelfe to the knowledge of ſuch differentes, as had done to the good Kinges</hi> Ezechias, Ioſias <hi>and other.</hi> And afterwardes hauing laide downe which were the markes and differences of the true and falſe Religion, it was written in theſe termes. <hi>Conſider I beſeech now (Sir) and you ſhall finde, that all afflictions happened vnto you, at ſuch time as you vndertooke to runne ouer thoſe whome you call Lutheranes.

Contrariwiſe what is happened vnto you ſince that you are ioyned with the Pope, hauing receiued from him a ſworde, which hee ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you for his protection, and who was the cauſe to make you breake the truce. God hath turned in one inſtant your proſperities, into ſuch afflictions, that they are no leſſe to bee feared vpon your ſelfe then vpon your realme. To what ende is</hi> Monſieur de Guiſe <hi>his enterpriſe in</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie <hi>turned, going to the ſeruice of the enemie of God, with full deliberation to ruine at his returne the valleies of</hi> Piemont, <hi>to ſacrifice them vnto God as a fruite of his victories. The iſſue hath well ſhewed how that God is able to reuerſe our deliberations, as of late hee did that of</hi> Monſieur le Coneſtable <hi>at S.</hi> Quentins, <hi>on S.

The which God hath not permitted, for that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the peace, was vpon the perſecution which you determined to make of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of God. As alſo the Cardinals haue not beene able by their crueltie, to hinder the courſe of the Goſpell; which hath already taken ſo deepe a roote within your Realme, as if God ſhoulde ſlacke you the bridle to roote them out, you ſhoulde bee as it were a Kinge without ſubiectes</hi>

Tertullian <hi>very well ſaide that the blood of Martirs was the ſeede of the Goſpell. To take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then al theſe miſcheefes, proceeding from the riches of the Papiſtes, which cauſeth ſo great whoredoms, Sodomies &amp; inceſts, wallowing &amp; nouriſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues like ſwine, with idle bellies, the beſt way were to put them again into their former eſtate, as the ancient ſacrificers the Leuites were, to wit without lands &amp; poſeſsions, as an expreſſe commandement therof was giuen to</hi> Ioſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a. <hi>For as long as the ordinaunce of God tooke place and that they were exempt from ambition, the puritie of religion remained in her entier. But when as they beganne to aſpire to principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, riches, and worldly honoures, then did thoſe abhominations ſwell out which Ieſus Chriſt there founde. Thus was it in the Primitiue Church: for ſhee flowriſhed &amp; remained in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as longe as her miniſters were ſimple, and ſought not their owne greatnes and particular profit, but onely the glory of God. For when as the Popes beganne to tende to a Superintendency, and vſurped the true Domaine of the Empire, vnder a ſhadow of a falſe Donation, they wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the ſcriptures, and attributed vnto themſelues that ſeruice which we owe vnto God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Maieſtie may with good right ceaſe vpon all their temporalties in a ſound conſcience to imploy them to their true &amp; proper vſe. Firſt to the maintainance of the faithfull miniſters of Gods word, which ſhould be diſtributed amonge them for their nouriture and entertainement as the caſe ſhould require. Secondly to the maintenance of the officers of your Iuſtice. Thirdely to the nouriture &amp; entertainement of Colledges, and to bring vp the youth of the poore to what they ſhould bee moſt apt to be applyed. And for the reſt which is infinite, it ſhould remaine for the maintenaunce of your owne eſtate, conducting of your owne affaires, and comfort of your poore people which onely carieth the burthen, and poſſeſſeth as it were nothing. And in doing this an infinite number of men, and eſpecially of your nobilitie, which now liue of the Crucifix, will imploy themſelues to your ſeruice, and the Commonwealthes, ſo much the more diligently, as they ſhall ſee that you will recompence none but ſuch as ſhall haue deſerued it. For there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captayne, nor Lorde, which will not thinke himſelfe better recompenſed with a benefite of 500. liuers, then to ſee 1000. to bee giuen vnto his brother, to haue them ſpent in Dogges, and whoares. And there is an infinite number of men within your Realme, which occupie the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt eſtates and offices, and neuer deſerued ought of the common wealth. By this meanes it ſhold be an eaſie matter for your Maieſtie to be ſerued onely by your owne french nation in the warres, according to the aduiſe and councell of the Sieur</hi> de Langey. <hi>For you ſhall finde but too many men, in whome there ſhalbe more fidelitie, then in ſtrangers, which exerciſe themſelues in warre with your expence, and cary the money cleane out of your Realme. As alſo the ſommes which yow giue yearely for penſions to forrainers, &amp; ſuch as go to Rome euery day for Collations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, which lend that againe to your enemies, to make warre againſt your ſelfe. And in thus doing, all ſhall remaine ſtill in your owne Realme, which thereby will grow rich, opulent, and inuincible. When the Papiſtes doe ſee that they haue no reaſon at all to gaineſay, then doe they aſſay to render ſuch as they call</hi> Lutheranes, <hi>odious vnto your Maieſty, and tell you (if their ſaying were true) that you ſhould bee made a priuate perſon, and that there neuer happened any change of Religion, but the like enſued of the Gouernment. A matter as falſe, as their accuſing of vs to bee Sacramentaries, and that wee deny the authoritie of Magiſtrates, vnder colour of of ſome furious Anabaptiſtes, which Satan hath ſtirred vp in our time to obſcure the light of the Goſpell. For the hiſtories of the Emperours which firſt began to receiue the Chriſtian religion, &amp; that which is happened in our owne time declare the contrary.

And in our time the late Kinges of England &amp; Princes of Germany, were they at any tyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, in purging away of ſuch ſuperſtitions as the malice of time had brought in, to abandon their kingdomes &amp; principalities? Euery one may cleerly ſee the contrary. And how great honour, obedience, and fidelitie, doe thoſe people beare vnto their Princes, and ſuperiours, which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the reformation of the Goſpell in our time? Nay</hi> I <hi>might ſay how that Princes before knew not what it was to bee obeyed, when as the rude and groſſe people woulde eaſily receiue the Popes diſpenſation, to driue out their Princes and naturall Lordes. Did you euer perceiue any of thoſe, whome they call Lutheranes, to tende to any trouble or ſedition, notwithſtandinge the cruell puniſhmentes which they haue endured? I call for this to witnes</hi> Monſieur le Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall de Briſſac, <hi>if he haue founde within</hi> Piemont, <hi>any people more obedient, then thoſe of the valles of</hi> Angrongne, <hi>and the reſt, and when at any time hee laide any charge vpon them, were it neuer ſo hard, if they did not beare it without murmuring. Whereas if they had not held for certaine that Kinges, Princes and Magiſtrates, are ordained of God, they woulde not ſo willingly haue obeyed: but being conſtrayned by force would more ſlackely haue behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The true and onely remedy (Syr) is, that you cauſe a holy and free councell to be held, wherein your ſelfe ſhall proceede, and not the Pope, nor any of his, which ought onely to defend their cauſes by the holie Scriptures. This done according to the example of the good Kinges</hi> Iehoſaphat, Ezechias, <hi>&amp;</hi> Ioſias, <hi>you muſt aboliſh out of the Church all kindes of Idolatrie, ſuperſtitions, and abuſes, which ſhall bee founde directly againſt the holie Scriptures, and new Teſtamente: you muſt range your ſelfe together with your people to the true and pure ſeruice of God, without harkenninge any whitte to the Papiſtes ſayinges, that ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue beene decyded in the ſayde Councelles. For wee knowe well enough, that no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell hath beene lawfull, ſince that the Popes hauinge vſurped principalitie, and tyranny ouer the ſoules, made them but to ſerue to their owne couetouſnes, ambition and crueltie. And the contrarietie which is founde in them, maketh them to bee ſufficiently diſprooued, with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand other abſurdities againſt the word of God, which are to bee ſeene therein. The true diſproouing of theſe deſciſions is to bee founde in the true and ſacred Scriptures, to which neyther tyme nor age coulde giue any preſcription. For by them wee receyue the Councels foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the worde of God: and by them wee reiect whatſoeuer contrarieth the ſame. And if you doe thus (Sir) God will bleſſe your enterpryſe, hee will encreaſe and confirme your raygne and Empire, and likewiſe your poſteritie: If otherwiſe, the ruine is at your dore, and accurſed is the people which ſhall remaine vnder your obedience. There is no doubt but God will harden your hart, as he did to</hi> Pharaoh: <hi>take your Crowne from of your heade as he did to</hi> Ieroboam, Nadad, Baaſa, Achab, <hi>and as many of the reſt of the Kinges as followed mens traditions, contrary to Gods commaundement: and giue you ouer to your enemies, to triumph ouer your ſelfe and your chileren. And if the Emperour</hi> Anthonie <hi>the gracious albeit hee was a Pagan and idolater, ſeeing himſelfe oppreſſed with ſo many warres, was willinge to cauſe the perſecutions to ceaſe, which in his tyme were made againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians differinge vntill the ende thereof, to prouide thereunto, and to heare their reaſons howe much more ought you which beare the name of Moſt Chriſtian, to bee carefull and diligent to make theſe perſecutions to ceaſe, againſt the poore Chriſtians, eſpecially conſideringe that they neuer did nor doe trouble, in any kinde of ſorte the eſtate of your Realme, or of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, nor tende to any ſedition or trouble?

            <p>The Prince of Piemont being reſolued in the meane ſpace to continue the Siege of Saint Quenrins, woulde in no eaſe hearken to their aduiſe, which counſelled him, to paſſe forwardes to the purſuite of ſo fayre a Treate: conſidering that Fraunce was altogether daunted, at the loſſe of ſo many of her nobilitie, and good Souldiers: beſides the abſence of the Duke of Guiſe, which had carried into Italie the reſt of the flower of Fraunce: that the Parisſians alreadie trembled, who halfe reſolued to quitte their Towne, woulde cleane abandon it, onely vpon the apparaunce of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Baſtonnadade: that in ſumme there wanted no more for him nowe, but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to preſenre himſelfe in the viewe of ſo riche a Citie, to heape vpon himſelfe the tryumph of an immortall glory.</p>

            <p>The Fleminges and Spanyardes ariued before Saint Quentins the ſeconde day of Auguſt, and from that day, vntill the one and twentieth, they went about no other worke, then digging and hollowing the Trenches, as well for the ſuretie of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, as the better to approache and gayne the Ditches.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 22. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes beganne their great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie at S.

            <p>That daye, as ſoone as euer it beganne to breake, they ſaluted the Towne, with a full Batterie. For all the ſhotte that had beene before, came from the platfourme of the Fauxbourg D'Iſle, whence they ſawe them worke and countermine, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the playe of the Cannon, all the whole day long, and not at one onely place, not much of the night paſſing ouer, but that they ſtill remooued their Pieces from one place to another, to make a newe batterie. For from the ſeconde day, they beganne to digge and carrie forth the earth of the Ditche on their ſide, and ſhortly after they propped vp coueringes with great Timber, vnder which they mought trauerſe to and fro, and enter within the Ditches, without any man beeing able to doe them harme. Becauſe there were not any Flanckers at all to commaunde the Ditch, where they mought eyther viewe, or laye batterie vnto them. And all the ſtones which they were able to fling at them, coulde not endammage them, by reaſon of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueringes, vnder which they creapte.</p>
            <p>They began their Batterie at the Windemyll, which was neare vnto Saint Iohns gate, and afterwardes ſcowred this place, as farre as the Tower on the water, with ſuch a furie, that there was not lefte one ſole Tower, which was not rent and razed, with the better parte of the Courtayne, laying the Batterie in diuerſe places with fiue and fourtie Peeces.</p>
            <p>All thoſe which were within were greatly couſined, and deceyued in one thing, that they thought the Maſons worke and Cyment of the towres and courtines much more ſtronger and better then it was, the ſteares and thickneſſe of the walles being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large. But the ſtuffe was ſo naught, that as ſoone as the toppe was but a little ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and looſed, all the reſt fell downe of it ſelfe in great lumpes, whereby many were ſlayne and hurte with the creſtes and battlementes of the Parapettes.</p>
            <p>On the 4 day of their Batterie, they carried twelue peces alongeſt the ſide of Bourg D'Iſle, and mounted them within the Abbey, from whence they battered the gate where the fire was put into powder, vntill they had made themſelues Maiſters of the Ditches. <hi>S. Remy</hi> ſtill well hoped to haue perfourmed ſome matter of worthe, but when he ſawe them once lodged within, he tolde the Admirall, that he was not able to doe them any more harme, for that they had gotten the vpper grounde of him: Reiterating many times, that he neuer ſet his foote in ſo badde a place, and that long before that, hee had aduertiſed the late King thereof. Not for that he was the more
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21992:126"/>
diſmayed thereat, or ſpoke of any puſillanimitie, but angrie, for that hee founde no remedie at all, nor ſuch meanes as he coulde haue wiſhed, being for the reſt a man very reſolute and wiſe. From the very firſt day of the Batterie, vntill the ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Admirall, <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> and <hi>S. Remy,</hi> went euery night to viewe the damages, and onvertures which the Artillerie had made, and on the day reſolued with thoſe Captaynes of the Quarters whome it concerned, of that which they had to execute.</p>
            <p>After that the Batterie had continued foure dayes, there was a great feare engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred among thoſe of the Towne, yea and the men of Warre themſelues, which the Admirall getting knowledge of, walking by night to remedie the ſame, hee helde one language common and generall to them all, in a place, where almoſt all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and many ſouldiers were aſſembled together, which was, that hee had firmely agreed, and reſolued in his minde, to keepe that place with thoſe men which he had, and if any man did at any time ſee him varie, or offer any ſpeache of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, hee gaue him leaue to throwe him downe as a cowarde into the Ditches: and in like caſe, if he founde any of them to parley to the contrary, he woulde doe no leſſe by them. And by this occaſion there neuer paſſed ouer daye, but two or three times hee woulde walke himſelfe about the quarters, and in paſſing by, would demaunde the Captaines opinions, conferring and communicating with them, what was done in the reſt of the places: according vnto that which hee had prayed them, the firſt day that he entred within the Towne, that euery man woulde aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him, of that which he eſteemed beſt for the conſeruation of the place. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie continued vntill the ſixte daye, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, that they likewiſe preſented themſelues in ſundry places within the ditches, as farre as the Parapettes at a pikes leangth.</p>
            <p>At this preſente, the Sentinell from the ſteeple of the great Churche, aduertiſed the Admirall, howe that of all handes the Armie raunged themſelues into battaile, and that many footemen martched towards the Trenches. The which he cauſed to be made knowne, in all places and quarters of the Towne, to the ende that euery man might ſtande vpon his guarde, imagining that they meant that day to giue the aſſaulte, and he himſelfe wente to three of the nexte breaches vnto him, to ſee what order was there kept. Where hee founde euerie man in all apparaunce willing to perfourme his duetie, the like whereof he alſo vnderſtoode from all the reſt of the places, whither he had ſente Gentlemen to viewe. Which was the cauſe that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe returned backe agayne verie well content to the Breache. Which he kept, being that which he ſuppoſed the enemies meante to turne their principalleſt ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: for that they euer moſt ſought to batter this place, &amp; to leaue nothing which might ſerue for Flanckes, eſpecially for that it laye iuſt ouer againſt the entrie, which they had made into the Ditche.</p>
            <p>As they were all thus attending the aſſaulte, the enemies put fire to three mines, all which were right vnder the Rampire, the principalleſt were in the quarter of <hi>D' Auphin.</hi> But the dammage was nothing ſo great as they looked for, being the cauſe that they gaue no aſſaulte that day. So afterwardes they did not ouermuch heate them ſelues, but were contented to goe and viewe the breaches on the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals ſide, and deſcende into the Ditche which <hi>D' Andelot</hi> kept.</p>
            <p>After that the Spanyardes were retyred, the Admirall wente to viewe what hurte thoſe Mines had made, and founde, that by that onuerture, they were not very
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21992:127"/>
like to receyue or incurre any great danger, but that for all that, it was fitte to worke vpon it, which hee deferred vntill night, for that they durſte not touche there, or ſhewe themſelues by day, by reaſon of the full viewe, which their enemies Artillerie had of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages of the Spaniardes and ſmall means which the Frenche had to endure the ſiege.</note>Nowe were there eleauen breaches, many mines, the ditche gayned, and the Souldiers therein well couered, the Armie great to gayne the breaches, againſt eight hundred ſouldiers, and men at armes of all ſorts, diſtributed as the Admirall thought good, the countermines little auaileable, becauſe that the Spanyarde being in the Ditche, had alreadie gayned the toppe, moſt of the ſouldiers wauering, as well for that day by day they ſawe the Cannon ſhotte redouble, to the loſſe of many of them, as thorough the ſmall number of people, which were lefte, and the badde handling of the matter by the Inhabitantes, which diſcouraged them as much as was poſſible. Hereupon the Prince of Piemont iudging the breaches reaſonable, gaue order for the aſſaultes. The firſt was giuen to Captaine <hi>Cazeres,</hi> Maiſter of the Campe of the olde Spaniſhe bandes, and to <hi>Lazare</hi> Colonell of fiueteene hundred Almaines, who were there much endamaged.

The thirde to Captaine <hi>Iulian Romero</hi> with three Enſeignes of Spaniardes, &amp; two thouſande Engliſhe, who falling downe from the toppe of a breache, brake his legge. The fourth to Captayne <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondellette</hi> with three Enſeignes of <hi>Bourguignons,</hi> who there loſte a hande.

At the laſt he diſcouered three Enſeignes at the foote of the Parapet, being gotten vp thither, without making any noyſe or ſounde of Dromme, at which time he made euery man preſente himſelfe to fight. But they coulde not repreſſe them in that place, but that they beganne to creepe and mounte vp by one and one to an high Tower, which had bene battered with Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, at a corner of the Captayne <hi>La Garde</hi> his quarter. When the Admirall ſawe that they tooke that waye, hee was very glad, for there they grapeled and mounted verie vneaſily, and from the place where himſelfe ſtoode he mought a little diſcerne them thorough a Flancker, whereby he annoyed them as much as he was able with three harquebuſiers, which remayned with him, thinking verily, that it was vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to force in that way. In the ende he ſawe thoſe Enſeignes which went vp to the top of the towre, put themſelues downe, but he preſumed that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome Trenche within the Parapet, to be more at couerte, vntill they tolde him, that the enemies had forced the Breache. Then turning himſelfe towardes thoſe which ſtoode about him, he tolde them, that they muſt goe helpe to ſuccour it.</p>
            <p>Vpon that <hi>Saragoſſe</hi> comming vnto him, asked him, whether he woulde goe, and what he would doe: to whom he aunſwered, that he meant to goe helpe to ſuſtaine the force of the Breache, which ſhoulde be offered, where eyther they muſt all dye, or put backe the enemie. And thereupon hee beganne to goe downe from off the Rampire.</p>
            <p>Nowe you muſt vnderſtande, that he was not as then farre from the Towre, by which the Spanyardes entred, but there was a long trauerſe and a high, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them from ſeeing what was done there.</p>
            <p>The Admirall being come downe from off the Rampire, hee ſawe all that quarter cleane abandoned, without ſo much as one man to make head, by reaſon, ſayde they, that kept that guarde, that they were not able to hinder the comming of the aſſailante, it being not poſſible to deſcrie or perceyue them, vntill they were come
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21992:127"/>
to the breache, in ſuch ſorte as the Spanyardes aryuing there in aboundance, and calling vp one an other, it was an eaſie matter to make them ſelues Maiſters, finding no perſon to make reſiſtaunce.</p>
            <p>The Admirall onely accompanyed with foure, whereof one was a Page, and going to gather together his Troupes and make head, as ſoone as he was there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſawe himſelfe enwrapped of all partes. Knowing then howe that it reſted no more in his power to remedie this diſorder, the Towne being alreadie full of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Almaines entring in by great Troupes, hee fought as much as hee was able to fall into the handes of ſome Spanyarde, as it rightly chaunced vnto him, choſing rather in that place, to abide the brunte of a common generall fortune, and all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, eyther good or badde, then by flying away to attayne an immortall ſhame. He which tooke him priſoner, made him a while to repoſe himſelfe at the foote of the Rampire, where he was all aloane, hauing loſte all his Forces: from thence hee ledde him, and made him to enter into one of the Mines, which hee had made to gayne the Ditche, where hee founde at the entrie thereof, the Captaine <hi>Alonce de Cazieres,</hi> Mayſter of the Campe, of the olde Spaniſhe bandes, to which place the Prince of Piemont ariued incontinently, and commaunded <hi>Cazieres</hi> to carrie him into his Tente.</p>
            <p>Thus was that fayre and riche Towne of S. Quentins conquered on the ſeauen and twentie daye of Auguſt, 1557. in which they founde great booties,<note place="margin">The Towne of S Quentins very riche and full of great booties.</note> and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie riches, in that it was the Staple of ſundrye Marchaundiſes, which were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the Lowe Countries, and likewiſe brought from thoſe places thither, thorough the entercourſe of trade and traficque. Without comprehending beſides many good Priſoners, which they founde there, as well of thoſe of the Towne, as of ſuch other chiefe Perſons and Captaynes, as were come in for the defence thereof. <hi>D' Andelot</hi> was likewiſe there taken: but well remembring the badde entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had receyued at their handes during his impriſonment in Italy, hee choſe rather to aduenture his life, in ſeeking to eſcape, then to fall agayne an other time into that calamitie and miſerie. In ſuch ſorte, as he crept vnder the faſteninges of a Tente, and by night hauing ſounded diuers paſſages within the Marſhes, hee founde meanes to eſcape their watches, and Corps de guardes, and ſaued himſelfe at Han.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Iarnac</hi> was there taken Priſoner, ſo were <hi>S. Remy, De Humes, De la Guarde, De Cuzieux, De Moulins,</hi> the Captaines <hi>Brueile</hi> and <hi>Bretaigne, De Rambouillet, Saint Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, Saint Andre, Lignieres,</hi> and <hi>Soleil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were ſlayne there, the ſonne of <hi>La Fayette,</hi> the Captaine <hi>Salleuert,</hi> Enſeigne to <hi>La Fayette</hi> his Companie, the Captaynes <hi>Oger, Vignes, La Barre, L'Eſtang, Gourdes,</hi> with ſundrie other.</p>
            <p>After the Sacke of Saint Quentin,<note place="margin">Meanes of well employing an Armie.</note> King <hi>Philip</hi> making no outwarde apparaunce of his intention, cauſed the King and the Duke of Neuers his Lieutenaunt generall to prepare for all occurrentes the beſt that they were able: and eſpecially to prouide for ſuch places as were neareſt to that which was taken. But as he was earneſtly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to this effecte, by euery Gouernour, to ſende ſuch prouiſions as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, they were all aſtoniſhed at the yeelding vp of Caſtelet, which a fewe dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the taking of Saint Quentins, the Compte of Aremberge otherwiſe called <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banſon,</hi> encloſed about in one inſtaunte with a thouſande horſe, all alongeſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe, and towardes Saint Martins Abbey: a little aboue which were encamped three Regimentes of Lanſquenettes of fourteene Enſeignes, with twentie peeces of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21992:128"/>
Batterie planted in two places.</p>
            <p>And albeit that the aſſurance, which the Baron of Solignac who commaunded there, had yeelded to the King and his Lieutenaunte, cauſed them to repoſe on that ſide, whileſt that they haſted forwardes the Swizers and Almaines, the Frenche Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie and Cauallerie, to furniſhe out the Rende-vous, ſo as within fiueteene dayes they mought make vp the fourme of an Armie, yet euen in the very beginning of September it yeelded vp. The which was founde very ſtraunge, conſidering that the place was ſtrong, and well prouided of all that was neceſſarie to a Frontire: at the leaſt it was looked for, that they ſhoulde haue tarryed the Aſſaulte. An occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the King cauſed him to be clapped vp Priſoner as ſoone as hee was come to Paris.</p>
            <p>But hee was ſet at libertie, declaring howe hee had beene diſappoynted of ſuch neceſſarie Succoures as hee required, of two thouſand men, in ſuch ſorte as <hi>D'Eſtre</hi> the Gouernour in former time had vpon any Siege. Beſides that, the enemies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing founde the Caſtle without any ditche, on that ſide where they beganne their principall Batterie, and a Baſtion fallen downe not yet repayred vp, in ſuch ſorte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themſelues, as that the ordinarie ſouldiers of the Guarde of that Baſtion, were ſoone conſtrained to abandon it, thorough the great quantitie of Bricke and mould which endamaged them, and ordinarily fell vpon them: the Batterie beeing ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and furious, as in a ſmall ſpace it made a waye for a horſe to be able to get vp vpon the Baſtion, the waye lying all open to come from thence to the breache, which albeit it was not altogether ſufficient, waxed wyder within two volleyes of the Cannon, and enlarged it ſelfe ſixe ſcore pace, or more, the Wall alreadye bowyng and yeelding of the ſame length, and the earth opening a pace in breadth, and in deapth the length of a pike.</p>
            <p>Which the Souldiers once perceyuing, who were not in the whole nomber three hundred, nor halfe of them in health and ſtrength, they were ſo aſtoniſhed, and deſpayred, that notwithſtanding any perſwaſions which the Captaynes coulde vſe, many ſtucke not to ſaye, they woulde not fight at all, not knowing howe they were able to doe the King any Seruice therein, and therefore they thought it better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue themſelues for ſome matter of greater importaunce.</p>
            <p>Howeſoeuer it was, whether grounded or no vpon the feare which they concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Frenche were in, leaſt that the Imperialles woulde purſue further their good fortune, and duetie againſt ſuch an inconuenience, King <hi>Philip,</hi> to whome the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers of the Caſtelet, came to vnite themſelues at Fon-Some, attended their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of his aduertiſement from the Emperour his Father, to congratulate with him his proſperitie, beſeeching him further to commaunde and ordayne what next hee was to enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>But as a blade ruſteth if it be let lie continually within the ſheathe, ſo the ſouldier which is not employed, doeth lightly abuſe his reſt. For the Almaines and Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes quickely mutined among themſelues for the bootie of Saint Quentins, and raunſome of the priſoners which were taken the day of the Battaile: ſome alleadging among other occaſions, howe that King <hi>Philip</hi> and the Duke of Sanoye ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyane all the great priſoners which exceeded a certayne ſumme, of purpoſe to pulle them out of the handes of the Almaine Lordes, who without all doubte atchieued the greateſt honour of the Battayle, ſo farre forth, as they were all readie to departe, the rather for that the time of their oath was now expired. An occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the french did
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21992:128"/>
turne the matter to their owne aduantage, withdrawing out of that nation as many malcontents as they could finde vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer. Hereupon the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarde addreſſed himſelfe to Han, to erect a ſtronge place vpon the frontiere, which might ſerue for a ſuccour and ſupport to S. Quentins, the which hee determined to make impregnable, according vnto ſuch models as the enioyners had preſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, thereby to eſtabliſh from his lowe countries eaſie daies iourneyes of retreat, when he would either goe in or come out of Fraunce, as it ſhoulde ſeeme beſt vnto him. Now as vpon new occurrents alwaies proceed new determinations, the D. of Neuers being conſtrained to chaunge the eſtate and imagination of his defenſiue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his men of warre from ſundry garriſons, which he had into ſuch places as were neereſt vnto Han, to the ende that the imperials ſhoulde not inlarge themſelues into any greater a compaſſe, likewiſe to the ende they might alwaies waſt the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and famiſh them by cutting of their victuailes on all ſides, the french had deuiſed to make a remouing Campe, which for this effect they might encloſe and aſſure with trenches, Paliſſades and other Romane inuentions: but the longe delay of their prouiſions and ſoddanes and their enemies cleane broke of this determination. The <hi>Cheualier Hely,</hi> with a number of horſe entred within the place to ſuccour it, running ouer as many enemies as durſt ſtoppe the paſſages of Han, which hee found open without any thinge to commaande it beinge flankerde on the one ſide with the Riuer of Some, and on the other with a Mariſh, being in diuers places aboue one hundred thouſande paces broade, hauing very little firme or drie grounde to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet foote vpon. There is a village and a Caſtle, the village in the ſtate which it was then in was not able to holde out in any kinde of ſorte: and albeit that there were certaine foundations and faſhions of bulwarkes, yet they were ſo open and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to bee defended, as that there was no account at all to bee made thereof. The Caſtle was of a goodly ſhewe, and repreſented it ſelfe furious enough,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the ſituation of Han.</note> according to the olde fortifications, beeing in forme ſquare, flankerde with fower rounde bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, with a groſſe ſquare towre, and maſſiue, of a large thicknes, ſeruing for a platforme to the Courtines, which were ioyned vnto it, and commaundinge in all and through all the Caſtle. But the whole was of drye ſtones and Maſons worke, without any rampiers of earth, or other fortifications, according to the moderne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions to ſuſtaine &amp; defend a place long time, againſt the bluſterouſnes and furie of our Cannons. Notwithſtanding that the way might not bee altogether open and free to the Spaniarde, to enter further in if he found not a ſtoppe, <hi>Sepois</hi> which was Gouernour, had giuen the Kinge aduiſe to burne the towne, in caſe ſeege were laide vnto it, whereby the enemie might haue no place to lodge in. But as for the Caſtle, men might holde and keepe it for a fewe dayes whileſt that they ſhoulde bee the better able to fortefie themſelues: for it was eaſie to iudge that hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Han, hee woulde neuer ende there, but paſſe on further, where he might caſt himſelfe nowe on the right hande, and nowe on the lefte, and ſo daylie addreſſe himſelfe to ſuch places as were weake and likely in a ſhorte time to be caried, to the ende he might not loſe and euill employ the ſeaſon; which ſerued ſo fitte and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him.</p>
            <p>I haue let you to vnderſtande, how that to bee meete with the inconueniences of the battell of Saynte Quentins, among other preparatiues the Kinge had ſent vnto the Duke of Guiſe, that after that hee had to his beſt aduauntage accorded with the Pope, and the Spaniardes, hee ſhoulde bringe awaye the Armye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fraunce with as much ſpeede as were poſſible. This Prince ſodenlie let the

Pope to vnderſtand thereof, and made him priuie of the neceſſity which called him backe into Fraunce, and how his Princes affayres went. Beinge the cauſe which made him to beſeech his holines to licenſe him, and permit him to retyre, after ſuch time notwithſtanding as he had compounded to his owne profit the eſtate of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. The Pope then being alredy deſirous to ende this warre, from which hee knewe that on the other ſide to bee proceeded as hee ſawe it euidently, and doubted leaſt it woulde take ende with the ruine of one of theſe Princes, and finally with his owne, together with a confuſion of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, and infinitnes of other miſcheefes, purpoſed more then before, to bee agreed with Kinge <hi>Philip,</hi> which wrought that ende, whereof I before made mention. So as the peace beinge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and publiſhed with all magnificence on Sonday being the 19. of that moneth the Duke of Alua entred into Rome, about one of the clocke in the after noone, with great apparances of ioy, aſwell by the ſalutations of the artillarie, as an infinite number of ſquibs, and other merimentes, which they are accuſtomed to make eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe parts, at the welcome and amiable entertainement of any great Prince. The Monday following they helde Conſiſtorie, where there were choſen &amp; depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two Legates, to intreate of an vniuerſall peace. The one which was the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Tiuoli, towardes the moſt Chriſtian Kinge of France, and the other which was the Cardinall <hi>Carlo Caraffe,</hi> towardes the Catholique King <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of Guiſe in the meane ſpace departed out of Italie, to take his way into Fraunce,<note place="margin">The Duke of Guiſes departure</note> and to imbarke himſelfe at Oſtia in the gallies &amp; french veſſels which attended him with a ſorte of Lordes, Captaines, and two thouſande harquebuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the other parte of the Armye vnder the conducte of the Duke <hi>D' Aumalle,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned through the Popes lands towardes Bologne and Ferrara, and ſo from thence they paſſed all for the moſt parte through the Griſons and Zuizers into Fraunce, where the Duke of Guiſe beinge arriued was ſodenly ſent for to addreſſe an armie at Compienne. At which place the Kinge being anone after arriued, declared (all ſuch as were then in Courte beeing preſent,) howe that the Duke of Guiſe was come iumpe for the preſeruation of his Realme, and it was propoſed to treate him Viceroy of Fraunce. But this title beinge thought ſtrange, it was commaunded that letters ſhoulde bee diſpatched to make him Lieuetenante Generall ouer all the Countries within his obedience.<note place="margin">The Duke of Guiſe made Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall by the K. ouer all his countries.</note> The which were diſpatched by <hi>Du Thier</hi> ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of the Commaundementes, and afterwardes receyued and verified by the Parlamente of Paris, and other ſoueraigne Courtes of the Realme: whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhortely after the Kinge excuſed himſelfe towardes his Goſhip, (ſo he named the Conſtable) ſendinge him worde by ſecreate Letters that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to doe as hee did,<note place="margin">K.

Whereof Kinge <hi>Philip</hi> being aduertyſed, knew well enough how to make his profit as you ſhall ſee elſe where.</p>
            <p>In this ſame tyme there happened in like ſorte, ſtraunge floudes, and inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Riuers at Rome, and likewiſe at Florence. That at Rome fell out the ſame day of the peace, beeing the fourteenth of September, Tiber, one of the moſt renowned Riuers of Europe, which ſome notwithſtandinge number amonge the ſwift ſnowie ſtreames being greatly ſwelled, as though it woulde threaten Rome

with great ruines, encreaſinge howrely for the night followinge it began to inlarge it ſelfe ouer all the lowe groundes, of the medowes and vineyardes rounde about. The next day it being encreaſed and broken in throughout the towne, all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and gutters of the ſtreetes and houſes ſtanding full, the depth thereof was found in ſome places of the towne of the height of a man, and more in the place <hi>D'Agone, A la Roconde</hi> and <hi>A la Doan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Nowe this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the water endured all that day and vntill foure of the clocke at night, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to ebbe and decreaſe, ſo as by the next morning at breake of day,<note place="margin">Signes ſerue for admonitions from God</note> it was ebbed more then a ſhaftemente, and then by little and little decreaſing, euery man in the afternoone might eaſily goe about this buſines. The depth of the water, as ſome haue ſaide, in many places exceeded the marke which was left at the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation in the yeare 1530. Others were of opinion that it wanted an handbredth. Whereupon they alleadged many reaſons, among other that the Caues which were made and coured within Rome (for it is augmented in buildinges a third parte) had receiued and ſwallowed vp a great parte of the water, Some iudged that the great number of newe ſtreetes was a cauſe of the depth, and other affirmed howe that the earth which was rayſed vp ſince that time, cauſed it ſeeme higher then it was. But they which iudged it to bee the greateſt, ſay that it fell out ſo, for that in the towne of Horta and Narin, and all other places where it paſſed alongeſt, it left behinde it a great abatement and ruine of houſes: hauing caried away halfe the bridge of Saint <hi>Marie,</hi> together with the excellent chappell which Pope <hi>Iulie</hi> the thirde cauſed to bee builded there: it vndermined and remoued certaine great peeces of marble,<note place="margin">Ruines cauſed at Rome by the floode.</note> &amp; great quarters of ſtone which defended the bridge of Saint Ange. It rayſed and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed a great parte of the bulwarkes and baſtions which they had cauſed to bee builded a yeare ſince ioyning to the Caſtle. Beſides that it threwe downe halfe the Temple, and moſt parte of the buildinges of Saint Barthlemewes monaſterie ſeated in the Ilande of Tiber. Briefely, there was not within all Rome, either pallace or building, alongeſt which this furious rage of waters had paſſed, which carried not ſome marke and teſtimonye of the wrath and violence of this angrie Element. As touching that of Florence by the breaking forth of the Riuer Arno, men iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it farre greater then that at Rome,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the floude at Florence.</note> and to haue occaſioned farre more incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and important loſſes as well in ouerthrowing of houſes, as in the deſtruction and periſhing of golde, ſiluer, marchandiſes and other ſortes of moueables, beſides which is more to bee lamented, the death and ſuffocation of many perſons. It firſt ruined and ouerturned for the greatteſt parte the Conuents and monaſteries of the pore maidens of Sainte Verdiane, of the Kecluſes, and of Saint Mary Nouelle. It caried cleane away the bridges of Rubaconde, and La Trinite. It threw downe almoſt the whole borough of Oquo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moreouer to ſpeake of the depth of the water vpon the place of Saint Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ix, it exceeded foure good fingers in depth the inundation which happened at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the yeare one thouſande fiue hundred forty and ſeuen: which made men iudge the latter to bee very great conſideringe that the former was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vncredible.

And albeit that it laſted not long, but about ſome twelue or fifteene houres, yet notwithſtandinge it did greatly endemnifie and hurte the towne which was in very many romes and places diſformed thereby, and the territoryes thereaboutes greatly waſted and empoueriſhed: for that the fieldes and places of tillage were maruelouſly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with ſtones and other ruines, ſuch as the rage of waters driueth alongeſt, and leaueth at ſuch time as the force and violence thereof diminiſheth, and the Oliue trees (wherewith this Prouince much aboundeth with great care of trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them for the great profite, which is drawne thereby through the oyle) were all bruſed and broken, and the Vines clungd together and full of ſande, with an infinite number of other dammages and calamities.

Sundrie other places of Europe were likewiſe touched with the ſame miſchiefe and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, as numbers of celeſtiall ſignes, ſuch as the Comet of the yeare before, pillars of fire, and in ſome places hunting of dogges, crying in the ayre, and ſome men fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and two ſunnes, red and inflamed, ſuch as were ſeene in Almaine: beſides many other prodigious and monſtrous workes, which nature brought foorth in that time, vpon the earth, all which ſignes coulde not bee adiudged to bee any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then threatninges and meſſengers of the celeſtiall wrath, which ſhoulde warne vs eyther to a voluntarie acknowledginge of our ſinnes, and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of our liues, or aſſure vs of a vengeance at hande, and puniſhmente of our iniquities.</p>
            <p>To returne to the ſiege of Han,<note place="margin">Han battered &amp; taken by King Philip.</note> it had no ſooner endured twelue hundred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhotte together, which made a reaſonable breach; as well at the great To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as the Courtyne, the walles being there drye without rampiers and baſtions, but it was yeelded and giuen ouer into the handes of Kinge Phillip, the twelft daye of the moneth of September. Afterwardes hee remayned there a while, to aduaunce and ſet forwarde the fortifications which were alreadie begunne, addinge thereto as much as was ſuppoſed to haue beene forgot. And whileſt that the Baron of Poleuille, hauing beene ſente by Kinge <hi>Phillip</hi> at his departure from Sauerne, aduaunced forwarde to ioyne himſelfe in Champaygne, with twenty Enſignes of Almaines, and twelue hundred horſe, occupyinge himſelfe in the places borderinge about hee ſent to ſeaſe all the ſtronge places remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the handes of the Frenche, which were any wayes able to annoye the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Then cauſing a number of horſemen furniſhed after the French faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter in, hee ſurpriſed Noyon,<note place="margin">Noyon ſurpriſed by diſguiſing of rayments</note> and the companies of light horſe of the Baron of Clere, and one of the Scottiſhe, vpon whome they entred at fayre day, the gates being open, from thence they ſeaſed vpon Chauny, where they placed a ſtronge garriſon, not for to fortifie it, conſidering the imperfection of the place, and howe it was to bee commaunded two ſeuerall wayes, but onely that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might the more eaſilie gather the Vines: the vineyardes thereaboutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very good and of great compaſſe.</p>

Thus fortifying theſe two places, they paſſed ouer the moneth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and beginning of October, in roades, pilfryes, and burninges, as well on the one ſide as the other, ſtill weakening notwithſtandinge <hi>Philips</hi> Armie, as well through the Engliſhe mens returne home malcontentes, for want of their booties, and euill entertainemente, as in reſpect of the Almanes, who their oath being nowe expired retyred day by daye to the Duke of Neuers, who furniſhed with them his bandes, that were not compleate, and erected newe ones of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage.</p>

to Fraunce firſt cauſing two large fortes to bee myſed, with high and fayre platformes, the one to commande ouer all the plaine, which lieth betweene the forreſt and the towne, and the other ouer all the lowe grounde, and courſe of the riuer, and alongſt the medowe, employing beſides all diligence to repaire the towne, flankerde with baſtions, cazemates, tarreſſes, caualliers, and trauerſes, in ſuch ſorte as in caſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies artillarie had arriued there, they ſhoulde haue founde play for alonge ſeaſon: moreouer, he cauſed the encloſure of a campe to bee appointed out, and rayſed vp with trenches, ſo large and ſpacious, as that an armie of a hundred thouſand men, was able to lodge there, with all furnitures and prouiſions, as ſafely as within a towne, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all eaſances as well of the Riuer as of the country. As hee thus prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the aduancement of theſe fortifications, ſo ſpared he his purſe no more then his ſpirit, to the entertainement of ſpies, ſent out into all partes.

But the Spaniſhe Captayne getting into a houſe, which hee perced through, held good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the French harquebuſiers had wrapped him in on euery ſide. The which made him in a deſperatneſſe ſteppe forth, his courtelaxe in one hande and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the other, to die honourablie with the reſt of his fellowes, but as hee was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his faith to the Captayne <hi>Launay,</hi> hee killed him, harde by the Prince of Conde who had done as much to the French man, if the ſwearing vnto him, howe that this Captayne had killed the moſt valiant of his ſouldiers, and had euer made fowle warre vpon the French, eſpecially at the defeate of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> hee had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to pardon this his iuſt chollar, which had ſo farre caried him for the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his countrimen.</p>
            <p>The Baron of Poleuille, paſſing in this time ouer the mountaines of Vaulges, and the Countie of Ferrette, and coaſting <hi>Le Baſſigni</hi> entred within the French Countie, betweene the Countie of <hi>Mont-Belliarde,</hi> and <hi>Langres:</hi> where thoſe of the Countie vnder colour that they were conſtrayned thereunto, contrary to their promiſes, and pactions of neutralitie, gaue him paſſage, victualles, and all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions for his campe.

            <p>On the other ſide you might perceiue aboue, how <hi>D'Eſchenets</hi> with his company followed him continually neer hand, as alſo did <hi>De Iours</hi> with his 8. enſignes of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who kept him continually ſo neer a neighbourhood, as they were as ſoone at <hi>Bourg</hi> as himſelfe, into which they entred, doing therin a great peace of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

and ſeruice to the King, and ſo was he founde fruſtrated of his firſt opinion.

Where leauing many ſicke perſons, victuals, and moueables, hauing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the waye to the French Countie, from which they were come, ſhortly after the Troupes brake of themſelues, and abandoned the Baron their Chiefe, for that he perfourmed no iotte of what he had promiſed vnto them.</p>

               <note place="margin">The K. declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the eſtates of his Realme.</note>Vpon this the King began to deliuer how ſince his comming to the Crowne he had had continuall war with the Engliſhmen &amp; Bourguignons auncient enemies of Fraunce. Into which warre hee was conſtrained to enter, for the recouerie of ſuch Frontire places, as his enemies had vſurped, as Boulonnois and the reſt, and howe that to furniſh the defraying of the ſame, hee had beene conſtrayned to ſell his owne Domaine, and afterwardes impoſe manie Subſidies vppon his people, wherewith to his great greefe they ſtoode ſore oppreſſed: That for the regarde and conſideration of them, hee had offered to obtaine place, albeit it was at verie preiudiciall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for himſelfe, but onely hee was mooued thereunto for the ſingular deſire which hee had to keepe his people in a peaceable eſtate, whome hee had alwaies founde moſt faithfull and enclineable to his obedience and ſeruice. And for ſo much as hee ſtoode aduertiſed that his ſaid enemies, were in a farre greater deliberation then euer, to enterpriſe and aſſaile the Realme of Fraunce, hee repoſed all his whole truſt after God, in the fidelitie and ſuccours of his ſaide Subiectes, and therefore hee purpoſed to make a ſtrong, great and extreame warre, thereby to recouer a good peace, as of meere neceſsitie being compelled thereunto. But for ſo much as money is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſinew of warre, he earneſtly beſought euerie one of the ſtates, that they would now ſuccour him to reſiſt the enemie, and that afterwards hee would employ all his endeuour, to attaine, and preſerue his Subiectes in tranquillitie: Promiſing in the fayth of a good Kinge and Prince, that hee woulde from thence forwarde ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vſe them and ſettle all thinges in ſuch an order, as euerie man ſhoulde haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to contente himſelfe, and that for pledge of his good will and affection, hee chooſe to make this promiſe in publicque, and in his Sonnes preſence, to the ende that both of them might thereby bee comprehended, and bound to the performance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Kinge hauing finiſhed his ſpeech, the Cardinall of Lorraine, holding the firſt place, and ſpeaking for the eſtate of the Church, beganne a moſt learned ſpeeche and Oration, and grauelye pronounced, which laſted the ſpade of an hower, as well in the prayſe of the Kinge, as yeelding vnto him thankes for his good will and promiſe: Concluding that they woulde all ſubmit theyr bodies and goodes to his will and good pleaſure. The Duke of Neuers ſpeaking for the Nobilitie in fewe wordes ſayde, that they were ſo affectionated, to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and the Realmes defence, as that they preſented vnto the Kinge not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theyr bodies and goodes, but alſo their liues.

Preſident of Paris, anſwering vpon his knees, in the behalfe of the law, and all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of the reſt of the Parliaments of Fraunce, firſt thanked the King for the good and honour which it had pleaſed his Maieſtie to do them, in erecting a fourth eſtate of the Lawe: and alſo to manifeſt vnto his Subiectes; his good will and affection, with ſundrie other ſpeeches and thankes giuings, tending to the prayſe of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of his promiſe, in that hee woulde ſo couragiouſly maintaine warre, by repelling of the enemie, to attayne a long and perpetuall peace for his Subiectes, and afterwardes to redreſſe all thinges into theyr order, to the repoſe and contentment of euerye one offering on the behalfe of that eſtate, not onelye the goodes but the verie bodyes of the officers of Courtes: for the laſt eſtate of the commons, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of Townes, <hi>Du Mortier</hi> ſtepped vpp, and hauing made three great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, hee moſt humbly thanked the Kinge for the good will which hee beare vnto his Subiectes, in ſeeking to preſerue them in peace, after reſiſtaunce of the enemie, eſpeciallye hee approoued and greatlie prayſed, the good deſire which hee had to ſettle Fraunce agayne in good order, which had ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie diſorders thorough the neceſsitie of warres, which notwithſtanding albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that the poore people were alreadye weakened and waxen feeble in theyr power, yet woulde it rather let it ſelfe bloude, that after hauing expoſed vnto him their bodies and goodes, they might likewiſe ſacrifice theyr liues for the defence of the Realme.</p>
            <p>After that all the Deputies had finiſhed their propoſitions, before that the Kinge roſe, the Cardinall of Sens, keeper of the greate Seale, kneeled downe before the Kinge bowing downe his head verie lowe. Afterwardes ryſing vp hee returned towardes the aſsiſtantes, and ſaide, that the Kinge had commaunded him to vſe this ſpeeche vnto all the people. That to beginne to reſtore all thinges into a good diſpoſition for the comforte and repoſe of Fraunce, euerie one of the Deputies of the Townes ſhoulde ſet downe in writing all theyr griefes, and put thoſe pointes into Articles which had moſt neede of reformation, and then deliuer them into the ſaide <hi>Du Mortier</hi> his handes. Vppon which the Kinge with the Lordes of his Councell, would particularly order euerie one, as hee ſhoulde ſee needefull, and in ſuch time, as they ſhoulde bee made priuie vnto. And that the Deputies ſhoulde not departe out of the Towne, vntill they had more amplie vnderſtoode the Kinges pleaſure. This being ſaide, the Kinge aroſe, and after himſelfe being retyred, euerie man tooke the waie of his retreate. Certaine daies after the Deputies of the Townes, were ſent for to the Cardinall of Sens his lodging, where they found the Cardinall of Lorraine, with other of the priuie Councell. There the Cardinall of Lorraine, deliuered vnto the Deputies of the Townes, the ende and ſcope of his aſſemblie, to witte that the Kinge woulde borrow three Millions of Golde, and that hee woulde haue found out three thouſand perſons within his Realme, which might lend him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man a thouſand Crownes, declaring how that the Cleargie had alreadie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred a thouſand men, which ſhould lend euerie man a thouſand. That the Townes of Fraunce ſhould find two thouſand men, and that the K. would diminiſh his taxes, for the eaſe of his common people which was greatly oppreſſed therewith. And that there ſhould bee no more cuſtome put vpon marchandiſe for the entertayning of traficque, charging the ſaide Deputies to doe one of the two thinges, euerie man to giue a parte by him ſelfe the Roles of ſuch as were able to furniſhe money,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21992:133"/>
and the other to giue in writing to <hi>Du Mortier,</hi> all ſuch Articles as ſeemed good vnto them for the reformation of cauſes. At their departure the deputies conſulted together, and concluded it touching the charge which was giuen vnto them; they were not able to giue anie roles of names, for that it was vnpoſsible for them to bee able to know the eſtate of the perticular perſons: for ſuch a one is oftentimes repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue money which hath leaſt. And for to diſcharge themſelues from giuing anie ſuch Roles, they went the ſame daie to the Cardinall of Lorraine, to whome they declared that it was vnpoſſible to giue vp any ſuch Roles with any certaintie, by reaſon that they were not poſsibly able to knowe and vnderſtande the abilitie and meanes of the inhabitants: for as much as ſome man hath ſtore of goods in apparance which hath no money at all. And for the regard of Marchants which worke vppon their credit, many a one maketh great ſhow, and traficques outwardly, which is neere enough at hand to be come bankroute. Afterwards they of the priuie Counſell deliberated of the matter.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon conſidering how that the Deputies of Townes, were not able to make vp anie true Rowles, thorough the vncertaintie of perſons habilities, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they would charge and taske in euerie Towne ſo many men as ſhoulde lend money: and if they were not able to lend a thouſand Crownes, then to lende fiue hundred, augmenting the number of perſons. The fourth eſtate afterwardes gaue vp Articles for the reformation of cauſes, according as the preſent time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Briefely in the ende the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate garunted vnto the King in a pure guift, a Million of Golde beſides the tenthes. And the fouth eſtate two Millions of Golde, declaring further vnto him, that if that woulde not ſuffice to maintaine the warre, and compell the enemie to harken to ſome good peace, they would expoſe al that remayned of their goods and perſons at his ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King perceiuing all his forces to be ioyned together in one, ouer which, and his whole Realme throughout, hee had already declared the Duke of Guiſe his Lieutenant generall, determined that the conqueſt of Calais, &amp; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie there abouts ſhould be the firſt exploite thereof; and ſo the aduiſe of thoſe which councelled him to aſſaie to recouer ſuch places as were loſt, was differred vntill a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon: conſidering that they were wel enough prouided to hold out a long time, that winter approached on; his troupes being come from ſo farre off, eſpecially his men at armes, being altogether wearie with their great paines taking the Sommer before. And the whole Countrie cleane waſted, and eſpecially vnprouided of all victuall, and fourage, thorough the continuance of the warres paſſed. Now as the gentle harte awakeneth, and groweth affected according to the good or euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an other, and chiefely in ſeeking to doe beſt, when any hatred or iealouſie is intermingled, ſo this Generall, being curious to make it appeare, that to blot out the Conſtables diſgrace, he had no ſmaller meanes vnder the winges of his Prince, then the D. of Sauoie ſupported by the K. of Spaine, endeuored by his long ſecrete and continuall diligence, to take his aduantages, as happily as the Prince of Piemont had done in his former exploits of Picardie. Therefore vndertaking vpon his honour, the conduct and finall execution of <hi>Senarpont</hi> Gouernour of Boulonnois his olde and ſo often differred ſecret enterpriſes (to the purſuite wherof the Conſtable marched, had not the deſaſtre of S. Quintins croſſed the courſe of his good happe,) and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing how all thinges had of a long time beene made ready, aduiſed, that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take away anye ſuſpition from the Spanniardes of his intente and meaning,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21992:133"/>
the Duke of Neuers ſhould carrie halfe the armie into Campagne, giuing out that he went to batter Luxembourge, Arlon, and other places which Frontered vpon his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, and that the other part ſhould remaine with the D. of Guiſe only to hinder any entire victualling which ſhould bee brought to ſuch places as had beene newly conquered. But the Duke of Neuers ſeeing that nothing preſented it ſelfe of ſuddaine taking, that the Spaniard had diſperſed his armie, in fortefying the places about Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg, which were euill enough prouided, ſent backe his troupes with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Duke of Guiſe; who in the meane ſpace bending towards Amiens, as it were to victuall D'ourlen, and after to ſtrengthen Ardres, &amp; Bolongne, found meanes to vnderſtand and learne the paſſages, forces, eſtate and deſſeins of them of Calais. Wher vnderſtanding how that al things remained in the ſame ſtate, as they left them, with a great promptnes he preſented the choyſeſt of his men before the fort of Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ullay on the firſt day of Ianuarie. Where finding at their ariuall a little fort paliſſaded &amp; rayſed vp with earth: which the Engliſh men had builded at S. Agathe, a ſmal vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage neere hand, and at the beginning of the cawſie which leadeth to <hi>Pont de Nieullay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The port of Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ullay taken from the Engliſhmen and how.</note> he cauſed it to be aſſaulted by two thouſand Harquebuſiers choſen men, ſeconded with thirtie horſe, with ſo great a furie, as hauing put backe an Enſigne of thoſe which kept it, comming out to the skirmiſh, by fauour of the Cannon, and of the Mariſh which was couered ouer with a three-ſcore horſe, hee cauſed them all in the end to abandon it, and retire themſelues to the great forte of Nieullay.</p>
            <p>The which at the firſt bound greatly aſtonied the Engliſh men, for they expected nothing leſſe then ſuch an encounter, and no waies the French forts to bee either ſo great or ſo neere at hand. And contrariwiſe this victorie at the firſt augmented the others courage, and put them in a great hope of attaining their principall end, when as they perceiued their enemies at the firſt entrie not to be able to withſtand them. At the ſame inſtant albeit it grew alreadie verie late, the generall and <hi>de Termes</hi> went to view the port of Nieuillay, and preſently were the approches and trenches begon, into which as ſoone as the Artillerie was brought, it was planted with all poſsible diligence, to begin the batterie as ſoone as day would appeare. And for that all the fruite which they hoped of this effect, did require a great promptneſſe, to the ende the beſieged might grow aſtoniſhed without any leaſure to looke into themſelues, and to put them cleane out of hope of looking for any ſuccour, at the ſame time, this Prince cauſed a parte of his armie and Artillerie to march on the left hand all along the Downes to occupie them and gaine an other forte which lyeth at the pointe of the Downes called Ricebanke, the which commaunded and helde all the hauen ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte, ſo as no veſſell of the enemie coulde enter in. Likewiſe it was verie neceſſarie for the obtaining of the Towne of Calais after, to ſeaſe at one blow vpon the fortes which kept the two paſſages, whereof that Nieullay, kept and defended all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and paſſages by land, part of them being Mareſhie, to the end the Flemings might be cut off from ſuccoring them. And the other which is called Ricebank being taken, woulde keepe anie ſuccours from landing which might be ſent out of England, this hauen of Calais, which <hi>Caſar</hi> called Iccius Portus, being diſtant from the firſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of England which is called Douer, but fiue leagues off the Seas, able to bee paſſed ouer with a leading gale in two howers. Therefore the Duke of Guiſe hauing all the night, together with the D. <hi>D'aumalle</hi> his brother, the Marſhall <hi>Stroſsy, De Termes, D'Eſtre,</hi> great maſter of the Artillerie, <hi>De Sanſac, De Tauannes, De Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi> and <hi>De Senarpont</hi> reuiſited, and well viewed the Downes, approched yet neerer to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21992:134"/>
the forte of Ricebanke; and all at one inſtant, the Sea being verie low ebbed, hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the young <hi>Alegre,</hi> and an other Gentleman, to bee conducted by <hi>Rendan</hi> vnto a certaine place of the porte, where hee knew there was a paſſage, for to ſound it. As it was done and ſpeedily diſpatched, it was reſolued among all the Captaines, to batter and aſſaile theſe two forts together at one time. In which <hi>Deſtree</hi> trauailed ſo diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cauſed the Vaſtadours and Cannoniers to take ſo extreame paines, as on the next morrow, being the fourth of the month, his Artillerie was readie planted three howers before day againſt theſe two places, and as ſoone as day peeped: beganne to turne againſt the Engliſhmen. The which amaſed in ſuch ſorte thoſe which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged within the fort of Nieullay, as at the ſecond vollie they quitted the place, and in all haſt retired themſelues within the Towne. The Duke of Guiſe, hauing in this ſorte, made the firſt paſſage open, cauſed the French incontinentlie to enter, and be lodged within, where he found a great deale of Artillerie, poulder and munition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſtop all other ſuccour, which might by land be brought vnto the towne, he cauſed twentie Enſignes of the French Fanterie, &amp; the Almanes of the Reingraue, with eight hundred Reiſters, and two hundred men at armes, vnder the conduct of the Prince <hi>de la Roche-sur-yon</hi> to bee lodged betweene the Towne and the Mariſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the cauſees. Leauing beſides <hi>De Termes,</hi> with other companies of Cauallerie, Gendarmerie, and Zuizers, vpon the paſſage from Guines to the Downes, whether this Prince with the reſt of the armie went to encampe. An hower after the taking of the fort of Nieullay, they which were within the forte of Ricebanke, yeelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the diſcretion of the Generall, of whome they were verie courteouſlie entreated.<note place="margin">The forte of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebank rendred vp to the Duke of Guiſe.</note> And thus this Prince remained ſeaſed, and poſſeſſed in one day, of two principall places, which were of ſo great importance vnto him, and moſt neceſſarie for to enioy his ful victorie with all. Wherfore purſuing at hand, the occaſion, which ſo fauourably with open armes preſented it ſelfe vnto him, the fourth of that moneth he cauſed ſix Cannons and three long Culuerines to bee mounted before the water Gate, and to breake the flankers and defences, he cauſed the earth to bee remooued and filled vp baskets, and Gabiannades therewith, as if hee had intended to addreſſe his principall batterie in that place, hauing with ſundrie volleyes of the Cannon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed that port, broken, and rent a ſunder certaine towers which might hinder him from going to the breach, which he determined to goe in hand withall Holding thus them which were beſieged in doubt, which part they were beſt to defend, &amp; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for, without doubting any whit at all of the Caſtle, which was ſteepe, drie, and without any Rampires; where all at a blow, he planted fifteene Cannons in batterie, charging and diſcharging all the day long a tempeſt of Artillerie, with ſo great a furie, as towards the night the breach grew verie large, and apparant. So as at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant before it grew night, the D. of Guiſe cauſed <hi>D' Andelot</hi> Colonel of the Fanterie, to paſſe, (with two hundred Harquebuſiers and Corcelets, followed with a number of Gentlemen,) and goe ioyne and fortefie himſelfe all along the Kaye, and breadth of the porte, which was betweene the Downes and the Towne, whether for to come he muſt neceſſarily paſſe ouer a little water: ordaining further that as ſoone as euer he ſhould become maſter therof, euery man ſhould be made worke, to digge vp a trench and trauerſe,<note place="margin">The port o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Beſides the courage, which greatly conducted the worke of the French, the commoditie to haue euerie thing readie, and at hand helped them verie much: for they had ſo long before artificiouſly prouided all matters neceſſarie for this ſiege, as eſpecially to cauſe the men and other munitions to paſſe ouer the Ice, and mareſhes, they cauſed a great quantitie of Hurdels with Peaſe ſtrawe to bee brought by Sea, to the end that the water might not eate, perce, nor corrupt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the better to couer the Harquebuſiers by reaſon that the ſand, and grauel was alreadie diſcouered and in view, they had cauſed a great number of ſtakes: and Pale-bordes of drie woode to be brought, of the ſtrongeſt and lighteſt they could chooſe, of a mans hight, and halfe a foote in thicknes, couered all without, three or fower fingers in thicknes, with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed paper one ouer an other, ſo as the Harquebuſe coulde not eaſily enter, hauing a reſt beneath, at the foote whereof was an yron Pike, of a foote and an halfe long to faſten it into the ground how hard ſoeuer it were; behinde theſe blinders the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers might ſhoot eaſily thorough a litle hole which was in the middeſt therof. The D. of Guiſe ſeeing how greatly the breach opened, and that three volleyes of Cannon might make it reaſonable, determined as ſoone as he could to giue the aſſaulte.

And at the ſame inſtant the Marſhall <hi>Stroſsy,</hi> with other three hundred Harquebuſiers, conducted by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Sarlabos</hi> and a hundred Pioners, went to gaine the other end of the port to lodge himſelfe in the little houſes, which were there: and ſo fortefiyng himſelfe with a good trench to remaine there, and commaunde all the porte. Notwithſtanding the bullets flew ſo hot about their eares, as after fiue or ſix ſouldiers and Pioners were ſlaine, they were faine to retire, and come backe to the Generall, who was not farre off, hauing already aduaunced neer vnto the port with <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> and the Marquiſſe <hi>D' Elbuf</hi> his brethren, <hi>De Montmorency,</hi> and <hi>De Bouillon,</hi> followed with many Gentlemen. In the meane time this Prince hauing cauſed the breach to be thrice viewed, as well by <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe</hi> as by others, and being aduertiſed that it was time, and that it was readie for the aſſaulte without any longer delay, gaue the token, and cauſed <hi>Gramont</hi> to aduance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt, with his Harquebuſiers, aſsiſted with as many Corcelets, conducted by the Marſhall <hi>Stroſſy,</hi> followed beſides with two hundred other ſouldiers: and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the other ſide hauing waded as deepe as his girdle, went foremoſt before the reſt of the troupes as farre as the foote of the breach. At which the French gaue an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte, with ſuch an hardineſſe and Impetuoſitie, as after hauing cut a peeces ſuch as they encountred at the firſt, they conſtrained the ouerplus in a ſhort time to quite the Caſtle, which they cleane abandoned to retire themſelues into the Towne. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduantaged of this paſſage and firſt entrie within Calais, the D. of Guiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to fortefie themſelues, and looke that they might not bee thruſt out, leauing <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> and the Marquiſſe <hi>D' Elbaeuf,</hi> his brethren, their Captaines for the reſt of the night, and himſelfe, for that it began to flow, paſſed ouer to the armie on the other ſide, to the end he might ſend them ſuccours by day breake, and to be meete with any diſorder which might chaunce to happen. When the Engliſh men come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to themſelues, and had gotten their wits together, they greatly repenting the fault which they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, in hauing ſo ſodenly abandoned the Caſtle, whereby they ſaw a ful ouerture made for the French into their towne, they returned with a

farre greater hardineſſe than before to recouer the peace againe, iudging that thoſe which were within could not long abide it, and that they could not be ſuccoured, by reaſon that it was floud, and the ſea of a great depth. Thereupon they came violently vpon the French, which attended them with the lyke courage, but with more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In ſumme, they found ſo great a reſiſtance made, as they were beaten back with a farre greater loſſe than before. But remaining full of opinion that they might regain theyr caſtle, they brought three peeces of artillerie vpon the other end of the bridge towardes the towne, to blowe vp the gate and ſcoure thoſe which ſhould defend it, and from a platforme which was vpon one of the corners of the great place, they ſhot in an infinite number of Cannon ſhot, ſo as it would haue bene thought that no man in the world durſt haue ſhewed himſelfe there, and afterwardes they redoubled ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſault, more furious than the firſt. Now if it were well aſſaulted, it was better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, for hauing liuely put them backe, and more than three hundred of their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt men lying on the ground dead or hurt, the French in the end ſhut the gates, and ſodainly rampired them behinde, vpon which all courage and hope afterwardes fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe which were beſieged, So as from thence forwardes they thought it good rather to parlie, and treate of ſome fauourable compoſition, than to make anie longer reſiſtance. Wherefore on the morrowe morning <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who was gouernor ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſent two of the principalleſt men of the towne to the Duke of Guiſe, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded verie great conditions for their aduantage.

As for golde, ſiluer, monie, or not monie, goods, moueables, marchandiſe, and horſe, all ſhould remaine in the diſcretion of the Duke of Guiſe to diſpoſe of, as it ſhoulde ſeeme beſt vnto himſelfe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>All which things beeing accorded on the eight of Ianuarie, this Prince began to put out a great parte of the people out of the towne, and the reſt followed according as it was promiſed, without hauing anie wrong or diſturbance done them, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one Engliſhmans remayning there. But well an incredible quantity of pouder, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, munition, wolles, and of all ſortes of victuals, which were ſtaide, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſage giuen in praie to the ſoldiers. After this manner, and in leſſe than ſeuen daies ſpace, was Calais &amp; her fortreſſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered, which as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was eſteemed impregnable, before which (as the Chronicles of France doo witneſſe, during the raigne of <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſixt, named <hi>De Valois,</hi> and in England, of <hi>Edward</hi> the third) the Engliſh armie layd ſiege during the ſpace of one whole yeere. In the end they which were beſieged with in the towne, were driuen to ſo great a neceſsitie and famine, as they were faine to eate rats and hides of leather, <hi>Iohn de Vienne</hi> commaunding there, it was yeelded the third daie of Auguſt 1347. wherby the Engliſh inioyed it two hundred &amp; ten yeres, during which ſpace they bragged how they carryed the keyes of France at their gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, beeing able by this meanes to enter and depart the realme at theyr pleaſure. But as one <hi>Phillip</hi> king of France loſt it, ſo dyd the French againe conquere it from another <hi>Phillip</hi> king of England. It was onely incloſed with ſtone walls, full of round towers,

ioyning neere one another, firſt builded for ſpeare and ſhielde, arrowes, or anie other inſtruments of warre without fire, after the old faſhion, and without anie rampires,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the Towne of Calais.</note> or other deuiſes or ſubtilties, ſuch as are now a dayes inuented agaynſt the force of our artillerie. At this houre it is iudged to bee one of the fayreſt and ſtrongeſt townes of warre in all Europe. For as much as beſides the naturall ſituation therof, in a place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſable, for that it is inuironed three partes with riuers, brookes, and mariſhes, and the fourth ſide defended with the ſea, with a great and ſpacious porte, not beeing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or to bee commanded by anie thing. The arte and inuention of man hath giuen vnto it a forme more ſquare than otherwiſe, new clothed without wyth great, large, &amp; maſsiue rampires, hauing at the three corners towards the mariſh three gret bulwarks, in point triangle-wiſe, wel flanked and armed to couer and defend the curtines. And on the other ſquare towards the downes ſtandeth the caſtle, by which, for that it was not knowen, or the imperfection not remedied, grew this laſt taking of the towne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this towne is wholy inuironed with large ditches, and maruellous deepe, with ſprings at the verie bottome, alwayes full of water, by reaſon of a little riuer which commeth from Hames, which paſsing thorough the towne, watereth them, &amp; filleth them full, as well as all the reſt of the little brookes which breake out of the mariſhes, fall downe, and few thether for the moſt part. But which is more praiſe-worthie in a towne of war, there is one of the faireſt ſquare publike places as is poſsible to behold, in which at the leaſt may bee put in battell betweene foure or fiue thouſand men, and the reuenue and profite of the port muſt needes be better, for that it is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalleſt &amp; moſt renowmed townes of the Ocean ſea, whether there is brought from all partes of the world an infinite and ineſtimable riches, and of all ſortes of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, and from thence lykewiſe they are diſtributed into ſundrie other Countries. Now whileſt that they battred the towne, the thunder and bruite of the artillerie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard within England, the Queene to remedy the ſame, cauſed a number of ſhips to bee prepared, which ſhe furniſhed with ſouldiers, and all kind of munitions fit for anie ſuccour to bee ſent thether. But when they approached, and alreadie perceiued the colours and white croſſes to waue vpon the tower of Ricebanke and wals of the towne, without comming anie neerer, they returned backe to carrie report thereof home into their countrie.</p>
            <p>The towne of Calais beeing ſurpriſed in ſo ſhort a time,<note place="margin">Guines &amp; Gr. line as it were two ſouldier ſupport Cala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> there grew afterwardes ſome diſputation to which of the two they ſhould addreſſe themſelues, either Graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or Guines, for ſo much as theſe two fortreſſes ſeemed to bee lyke two ſhoulders to ſupport the towne, and as two ſtrong bulwarkes to cloſe vp the two principall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages thereto, to wit, Graueline for Flanders, and the lowe Countries, and Guines for France.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe propoſitions being amplie debated of and diſcuſſed, the more ſound opinion reſolued, that Guines imported much more for the conſeruation of Calais than Graueline, although it were far ſtronger and of more difficile acceſſe. According to which aduice, the Generall of Guiſe, without giuing anie great leaſure to the enemie to bethinke himſelfe of anie remedie, purſuing neere his victorie, the thirteenth of this moneth beſieged Guines, where <hi>Grey</hi> commaunded, wyth a good number of men of warre, and all other kinds of munitions requiſite. At theyr arriuall the French finding the towne abandoned, lodged there for their better help, towards the battering and aſſault of the fortreſſe which was ioyning thereunto. But the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen ſurpriſing them as they were growen into a great diſorder about theyr lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſallyed out at a poſterne gate of the caſtle, and thruſt them out vpon the firſt fury,

ſetting in ſpight of them the better part of the houſes on fire, and afterwards retired: but the D. of Guiſe cauſed them to begin the breaches, albeit the Artillerie gaue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment enough thereunto. So as with an obſtinate aſſurance, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion he cauſed the worke to bee purſued. Where hee himſelfe, to augment theyr courage and to ſerue for an example to euerie one, was ready with the firſt, and had his Mattocke as ſoone ready in his hand to make way for the Cannon as the meaneſt Pioner in the troupe. And in ſuch ſort continued in preparing the ground and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of Gabionades, as within three daies after, hee approched and put the mouth of his Artillerie to the number of thirtie fiue peeces of batterie, iuſt vpon the border and counterſcarpe of the diches, to batter as well pointe blanke, as trauerſing in three places principally, one of the greateſt and principalleſt bulwarks, which flancked on the one ſide the Courtine of the Gate, and on the other their great bulwarke which they called, the keape, vndertaking at the firſt one of the ſtrongeſt of the bulwarkes, in hope after to obtaine better cheape ſome of the leſſe and ſmaller ſorte. Thus verie ſudainely began the batterie. The which endured without ceaſe two daies &amp; a halfe, in ſuch a furie, as within ſo ſhort a ſpace there was diſcharged betweene eight and nine thouſand ſhot of Cannon. In ſuch ſort, as this great bulwarke being opened and diſarmed, the breach by the 20. of this Moneth appeared reaſonable for the aſſaulte. But the D. of Guiſe for all that, knowing by how many waies and deuiſes a breache might be repared, and the meanes and ſubtilties which the enemie might inuent, to entrappe them which ſhould make the aſſaulte, and to fortefie himſelfe within, before that he would hazard his Souldiers, thought it good to make the breach more then once to be veiwed,<note place="margin">Guines beſieged the 13. of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> and what kind of acceſſe was made, for to goe vp at. And therfore at the firſt blow he ſent fower of his moſt diſpoſte Souldiers which hee could chuſe out, followed with twentie other reſolute men, who were incontinently retired by his owne commandement. The next morrowe he ſent againe fiue Souldiers no leſſe aduenterous then the firſt. The which gaue verie good hope for the comming to the breach: yet not truſting to al theſe reports, for that he would not vpon too light a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, make a ſuddaine frycaſsie, of ſo many valiant mens liues, as lightly are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in ſuch an exploite, he ſent againe ſixe ſcore French ſouldiers, to gaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupy with the firſt the top and higheſt part of the Parapet, which was on the aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants ſide, that thereby they might couer, and helpe vp a certaine number of Pioners, which he cauſed to mount vp with the ſame tracke, for to plane, and make the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp to the breach more eaſie, which was as yet verie high and rough, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe aduenterers notwithſtanding, that they ſhoulde not vndertake further then they had charge, which they obeyed, gayning with a great number of blowes, and hazard of their life, the toppe of the breach. In the end ſtanding aſſured, that the way was prepared, hee commanded <hi>D'Andelot</hi> generall of all the French Fanterie to be ready with his ſouldiers, that as ſoone as the token ſhould be giuen, he might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely preſent himſelfe to the aſſaulte. And he for to view with his eye the beginning, and ſuch iſſue as ſhould enſue, and if it were poſsible to diſcerne within the breach, &amp; behold the faſhion of the men within, mounted vp a little Hillocke high enough to diſcouer, that for to ſuſtaine and defend that breach, there needed not ſo many men as the firſt thought for. Wherefore all at the inſtant hee cauſed a regiment of choſen Almanes to marche ſtraight to the breach, to open the firſt paſſage thereof, who with great aſſurance, and without any feare of harme were there ouerthrowne. By the like meanes he made ſigne to <hi>D'Andelot</hi> that he ſhold follow him with his troupes which he did, for altogether made a maruelous ſtirre to enter; the moſt part of the Souldiers

plonging and entring within the water, and diches of ſeuentie foote in depthe, with ſuch an heate and deſperate hardines, that they forgotte all danger, albeit that the Duke of Guiſe had cauſed bridges to be builded ouerthwarte the diches, with pipes, and caske linked one to an other, vppon which they had caſt plankes and iuyce, and bound them faſt together. All this notwithſtandinge ſuch a vehemente furye puſhed them forwarde, as they had no regarde neyther to bridge nor paſſages, through the verie deſire which they had to enter. And yeat their impetuoſitie was not ſo greate &amp; furious, but that at the firſt bounde they were repulſed, the enemies greately help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues through their artificial fires, &amp; fighting for their life with a ſtrange &amp; incredible obſtinacie. The which the Duke of Guiſe perceauing, came downe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hyll, and thruſting hymſelfe into the middeſt of them, reprehended ſome, ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other, and preuailed ſo farre with the reſt, as he reſtored in ſuch a ſorte their heart into theyr bellye, that turning their face, and beginning a freſhe, they redubled with ſuch a corage, and fell to it with ſo greate a force, as the beſeaged fainted vnder the burthen, being no longer able to ſuſtaine this laſt charge: ſo as being ouerthrowne, they abandoned the entrie and lefte the breache to the Frenche and Almanes, with the loſſe of more then three or fowre hundered men, amonge whome there were founde neare hand fowre ſcore Spaniardes of the braueſt men, and of beſt reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As the reſt turned their backes, and were either ſlaine in the furie or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ſame daye the Almanes of <hi>Colonell Reicord</hi> conducted by his neuew, did on the other ſide force two litle bulwarkes, which had likewiſe beene battered, where the breach was made, &amp; ſo was the baſe courte of the caſtle wholie gained vpon the ſame day. The gouernour <hi>Grey,</hi> before this loſſe, foreſeeing the danger which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ariue, had retyred himſelf with a ſonne of his into the olde Caſtle, &amp; their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall forte, which they called the Bulwarke or keepe, as were in like ſorte the principall Captaines, and beſt ſoldiars. And had tranſported in with themſelues all their rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moueables. All they hauing a while bethought themſelues of their worke, and finding themſelues vnable to reſiſt againſt the fury of the French, determined to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. And the gouernor Grey ſent the ſame daye two gentlemen to the Duke of Guiſe, to declare vnto him that in defending of that place, being of ſo great marke &amp; importance, the keeping whereof had bene committed to him, he ought not to finde it ſtrange nor in euil part, if as an honeſt man and according to his dutie, he had well defended it, ſo far as to haue endured the aſſault: If he ſhould haue don otherwiſe it had bene againſt his honor and faith, requiring him in the ende to deliuer vnto him, an honeſt compoſition. This Prince hauing vnderſtoode his propoſitions, differred anſwere vntill the next morrowe, albeit that ſome counſelled him to take him at his worde, conſidering that he ſtood as yet vppon his feete and almoſte as ſtrong, as at the firſt, hauing beſides this olde Caſtle whole and entire of a moſt ſtrong and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter, enuironed with moſt deepe dyches, and full of water where they muſt needes make a newe batterye, and where it was posſible to retrenche it, the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſpacious enoughe: Beſides that there reſted the greate and large Bulwarke of the keepe, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded al the reſt, the whole being garniſhed with artillery &amp; mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and defended by the beſt aduiſed, and valianteſt men that were. Then on the morrowe being the one &amp; twenteth of this moneth, the Duke of Guiſe accorded this compoſition. <hi>That the Soldiors ſhould departe with their armes, but that their enſeignes ſhould remaine in the place, with all artillerye, powder, bulletts, and all other kinde of muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well of warre as victuals. As for my Lord Grey, and all the Captanes of qualitie which he had with him, they ſhould remaine priſoners of warre, in the power of the King and of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21992:137"/>
Duke of Guiſe.</hi> This capitulation being receiued &amp; approued by the beſieged, the day following there departed thence betweene 900. and 1000. men of warre, part Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, part Borguignons, and a number of Spaniards, beſides the common ſort, which tooke euery man ſuch courſe as himſelfe liſted, franke and free without any harme or diſpleaſure done vnto them, three or fower hundred dead and hurt remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.<note place="margin">Mondragon a Spanniarde.</note> 
               <hi>Grey</hi> was retayned priſoner, ſo was <hi>Mondragon</hi> a Spaniſh Captaine, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene before priſoner in the Baſtile of Paris, ſaued himſelfe, and was againe committed to ward thither. That done the Duke of Guiſe, for that this place ſeemed verie dangerous if it ſhould bee taken againe, and greatly noyſome to the high waye from Calais into France, eſpecially in being ſo neere vnto Ardres, and that it woulde be a double expence to keepe it, hauing cauſed all the Artillerie munition and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to be taken out, cauſed it to be ruined and razed: in the yeare 1351. The towne and Caſtle of Guines, were taken by the Engliſhmen, notwithſtanding the truce which then was, by the conſpiracie &amp; treaſon of one named <hi>Gilliaume de Beau Couroy,</hi> Lieutennant to the Captaine of that place, who for this cauſe, was beheaded, and afterwards hanged. Now there reſted no more of the whole countie of Doye, but a little Caſtle called Hames, which was not reſtored into the Kings obedience. And for that this Caſtle, albeit that it was little, and not rampired nor fortefied by any art, was notwithſtanding naturally ſeated in ſo ſtrong, &amp; as it were vnacceſsible a ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being enuironed with Fleetes, Motes, and Mareſches, hauing but a verie nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cawſie to paſſe ouer into it, and that in manie places croſſed with wooden Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges broken and taken awaie, it was almoſt impregnable to bee gotten from men well furniſhed and reſolute, they were in a great doubt after what manner they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it. In the meane time <hi>Sipierre,</hi> to whome the keeping of this cawſie was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, hauing the Duke of Lorranes companie whereof hee was Lieutennant, and ſome other,<note place="margin">Hamas Caſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.</note> aduertiſed the D. of Guiſe, that they which were within Hames, being frighted, and diſmaied at the taking of Guines, had abandoned it, and were fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by night, thorough certaine by-pathes which they onely were acquainted with all in the Mareſches. And ſo it fel out verie eaſie to be ſeaſed, where they found much Artillerie and prouiſions. Afterwards the French remained in all, and thorough all maſters, and there was neither forte nor Caſtle, which was not yeelded vnto them, or abandoned: ſo that beſides the Countrie which the Duke of Guiſe conquered ouer the Engliſhmen, and the rich booties which were found therin and taken, there were gained neere hand three hundred peeces of Braſſe artillerie, all mounted vpon caria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and as many of yron.</p>

There was the charge of the light horſe beſtowed vppon the Duke de Nemours, at the inſtance of the Duke of Guiſe, whome he cauſed to bee preferred, before the Prince of Conde, who at the ſame time and before had demaunded this charge, whereupon he grew verie malcontente: then the King went to Fontaine Bleau, whether <hi>Anthonie de Bourbon,</hi> Duke of Vendomis, and as then King of Nauarre, thorough the deceaſe of the King his late Father in lawe,

Therefore hauing cauſed it, that night to be encloſed round with the light horſe, the next morning the armie lay encamped, ready to batter the place, after they had well viewed it thorough hot skirmiſhes, vnder the fauour wherof, they had gained as farre as the Courte, and quickely after was mounted and planted a part of the artillerie to batter downe with Cannon, out of the flankers of the Caſtle. But when they perceiued how little they preuailed thereby, by reaſon of the hard and bad ſituation thereof, they planted the Cannon, right in front and at the head, to batter a bulwarke, which couered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the onely paſſage and entrance vnto it, which they ſhot off ſo furiouſly, and beſtirred themſelues ſo well in ſo ſhort a ſpace, albeit that the breach was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to giue the aſſaulte to, as the deſired parlie, vpon ſome conditions. But being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his demaunds, and a ſhort anſwere being made him by this Prince, how that he ſhould ſpeake of no other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, then yeeld to his mercy,<note place="margin">The Caſtle of Hebermont yeelded.</note> otherwiſe that if he made not good haſt, he ſhould inſtantly bee cut in peeces, with all his, albeit that hee was nothing ſo neere daunger, as the faintneſſe of his heart imagined, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bountie of this Prince, he notwithſtanding yeeld himſelfe vnto his mercy: of which at the entreatie of <hi>Iametz</hi> he found experience, the D. of Neuers vſing ſuch ſweetnes, as to ſend him away with his wife, and family, and generally all the reſt of the ſouldiers which were within, their liues &amp; goods ſaued, without being any waies pilled or ranſomed. This done, the Prince ſent a number of light horſe, and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers on horſe backe, to view the ports of Iamoigne, Chigny, Roſsignol and Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, part whereof they found already abandoned, and the reſt yeelded at the firſt ſummons. They were determined to haue gone yet further forwards, and to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as far as Neufchaſtel in Ardaines. But the raynes, ſnowes, and great froſtes broke off their deſſeins. Now the only taking of this Caſtle of Hebermont, ought not to be placed among the leaſt, for beſides that it is naturally ſtrong and eaſie to bee made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable, as being ſituate vpon a high and hard rocke, on all parts vnacceſsible, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by this paſſage, by which it was battered, yet is it moſt proper &amp; conuenient for the aſſuring of the whole paſſages of the Ardenes, all the Champion ouer, and ſeconding the ſtrong Caſtle of Bouillon, to hold in awe all the fortes, of the long forreſts of Ardenes: it appertaineth to the comte Biliſten, and the Rochefort, to the keeping whereof: was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Captaine <hi>de la Croix,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Haute-Courte.</hi>
