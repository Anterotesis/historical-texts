            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of <hi>Love,</hi> the Original, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, and the Definition of it.</head>
               <p>THe nature of the whole Univerſe (according to the <hi>primo-geniture)</hi> tendeth to that which we are now determined to treat o f; for it was <hi>Love</hi> that moved God, not only to create the World, but alſo to create it beautiful in every part; the name whereof in <hi>Greek</hi> yieldeth a teſtimony
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109924:10"/>
of Lovelineſs and Beauty, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mundus,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a beautiful and well decked Ornament. Therefore ſeeing God hath created and framed it by <hi>Love,</hi> then indubitably <hi>Love</hi> is diſperſed throughout the whole World, and inveſted into every creature, as well Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Vegetable, as Animal, all obeying the ſtatute of the great Law-giver, inſtituted in <hi>primo Adami.</hi> The which cauſeth a <hi>Sympathie</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> in all things.</p>
               <p>Now to demonſtrate this in Man. He having by nature imprinted in his ſoul an affected deſire or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt inclination to that which ſeemeth good, is drawn as it were by neceſſity to ſearch it out in every thing which he eſteemeth fair and good, finds nothing ſo apt to be the center of his Affections, and to correſpond with his nature (her creation ſolely tending to that) as Woman. For after God had created Man, and placed him in the Garden to dreſſe it, <hi>It is not good</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Man ſhould be alone, I will make him an help meet for him:</hi> &amp; to demonſtrate how this help was not only meet, but alſo neceſſary for Man; <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth, that <hi>amongſt all thoſe living creatures, he found no help meet for</hi> Adam: For although all the Beaſts, and the reſidue of creatures were given to Man to aſſiſt him, ſo that being in the ſtate of innocency, wherein he was then, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all ſervice and ready obedience from them; nevertheleſs he had not yet an help of his kinde, for he could not have the familiarity and ſociety with Beaſts, nor receive ſuch help from them, as he could from a Creature of his own nature.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing Man was created for this end, he could not continue without generation, which could not be unleſs he were joyned to a Woman; which was before his fall a moſt pure and innocent <hi>love.</hi> But now becauſe of his corruption, his <hi>affections</hi> are irregular, and are made extreme; there is nothing ſo greatly exciteth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109924:10"/>
and carryeth away his minde, nor cometh more neer to his deſtruction, then this fooliſh <hi>paſſion</hi> endangereth his life. To prove which, many preſidents might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. <hi>Galacea</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> declairing oftentimes to a Maid of <hi>Pavia,</hi> whom he courted and made love to, that he would ſuffer a thouſand deaths for her ſake, which ſhe imagining was but ſpoken coggingly and in jeſt, commanded him to caſt himſelf into the River; which he preſently performed and was drowned. But we ſhall more fitly alleadge ſuch teſtimonies of the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> when we diſcourſe more particularly of every Vice that proceedeth from them.</p>
               <p>Yet, as well as Man, this <hi>amity</hi> (as I have ſaid) is ingraffed into every creature; this <hi>love, appetite,</hi> or <hi>univerſal inclination,</hi> or <hi>complacency,</hi> given to them at the creation likewiſe, and inciteth them to deſire and ſearch out that which is conſentaneous to, and agreeth and ſympathizeth with their own nature; ſo that there is nothing ſo inſenſible, which hath not in it ſelf this <hi>amity</hi> innate, propending and moving to its proper object, as <hi>Amber</hi> and <hi>Straw, Iron</hi> and <hi>Adamant,</hi> and the <hi>Palme-trees</hi> of both ſexes, expreſs not a ſympathy only, but a <hi>love paſſion;</hi> according to that of the Poet;</p>

Now the better to illuſtrate this by example, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> tels us of a <hi>Palme</hi> that <hi>loved</hi> moſt fervently, and would receive (if properly it may be ſo ſaid) no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, until her <hi>Love</hi> applyed himſelf to her; you might ſee the two trees bend, and of their own accord ſtretch out their boughes to embrace and kiſs each other. They (ſaith he) marry one another, and when the winde brings their odour unto each other, they are marvellouſly affected; they will be ſick and pine away for <hi>love,</hi> which the husbandman perceiving, ſtrokes his hand on thoſe <hi>Palmes</hi> which grow together, and ſo ſtroaking again the <hi>Palme</hi> that is <hi>enamored,</hi> they carry <hi>kiſſes</hi> from one to the other, or weaving their leaves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Love-net,</hi> they will proſper and flouriſh with a greater bravery. No creature is to be found <hi>quod non aliquid amat,</hi> which doth not love ſomething, no ſtock nor ſtone, which hath not ſome feeling of its effects; yet it is more eminent in Vegetables.</p>
               <p>To proſecute our diſcourſe, let us define what this <hi>Amorous Love</hi> is; <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> demonſtrateth it to be a deſire of the Soul, that eaſily and very ſpeedily gets entrance, but retireth back again very ſlowly. Another ſaith, It is an inviſible fire kindled within the hidden forges of the breaſts of <hi>Lovers,</hi> ſcorching and conſuming their miſerable hearts, and burning in the flames of deſire, yeelding no other ſign or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof, then an ardent deſire of the thing beloved. <hi>Montag. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. ſaith, that <hi>Love</hi> is nothing but an inſatiate thirſt of enjoying a greedily deſired ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, It is an appetite of generation by the mediation of beauty. Others will have it to be a motion of the bloud getting ſtrength by little and little, through the hope of pleaſure, almoſt a kind of Faſcination or inchantment. <hi>Tully</hi> thought it to be a wiſhing well to the party affected. <hi>Seneca,</hi> a great
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109924:11"/>
ſtrength of the underſtanding, and a heat that moveth gently up and down the ſpirits. And others ſay, that this <hi>Erotical paſſion</hi> is a kinde of dotage, proceeding from an irregular deſire of enjoying a lovely object, and is attended on by fear and ſadneſs (common ſymptomes of <hi>Love)</hi> according to <hi>Ovid;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris amor.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we been carryed away by the current of other mens judgements, and now have watched our advantage to ſwim back again, and ſhew our private opinion; and that is, That <hi>Love</hi> is an expanſion of the ſoul towards it object; which is, what ever is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive; and that naturally Man <hi>loves</hi> himſelf beſt and firſt, and all other things in ſubordination to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and whatſoever hath moſt ſimilitude of Man in nature, is the proper object of his <hi>love;</hi> then conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (in my opinion) no object ſo proper as the princeſs of the female ſex, <hi>viz.</hi> Woman, it being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and conſtituted for the propagation and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every ſpecies.</p>
               <p>We will illuſtrate this with that pretty piece of policy of <hi>Paris,</hi> which prompted him to the diſpoſal of the Golden ball, he being made umpire between three Deities, <hi>Juno, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> whereof he was to make one his friend, and two his enemies; it was his wiſdom to win favour with the moſt potent, for his own ſafety, which is <hi>Venus,</hi> if we may take an eſtimate of power from the extent of Dominions, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of command and conqueſt, all which are ſo clearly <hi>Cypria's</hi> as they leave no place for oppoſition. It is true, <hi>Juno</hi> commands the world by Riches, and <hi>Pallas</hi> by wiſdom, but <hi>Venus</hi> monarchizeth in the moſt unlimited manner of ſoveraignty over millions of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109924:12"/>
Worlds, if it will paſſe for ſterling, that every Man is a <hi>microcoſm,</hi> or a little World, the epitomy of the <hi>macrocoſm,</hi> or the greater World: She is that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Planet, that makes not only the rational, but irrational; not only the animate, but inanimate creatures, and Vegetables feel her influxious power. <hi>Lucr. l.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Tu dea, tu rerum naturam ſola gubernas,</l>
                  <l>Nec ſine te quicquam dias in luminis oras</l>
                  <l>Exoritur, neque fit laetum, nec amabile quicquam.</l>

                  <l>Nothing is lovely, nothing pleaſure brings.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore they that ſubmit not to the Scepter of the <hi>Paphian</hi> Queen, are Rebels againſt nature, and but the ſhadows of Men; but ſuch ſtubborn ones are as rare as a Horſe in the ſtreets of <hi>Venice,</hi> or a begger in <hi>Holland.</hi> I know not (ſaith <hi>Montag.</hi> in his <hi>Eſſayes lih.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.) who could ſet <hi>Pallas</hi> and the <hi>Muſes</hi> at oddes with <hi>Venus,</hi> and make them cold and ſlow in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of <hi>Love;</hi> as for me, I ſee no Deities that better ſute together, nor are more indebted one to another. Whoever ſhall go about to remove <hi>amorous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from the <hi>Muſes,</hi> ſhall deprive them of the beſt entertainment, and of the nobleſt ſubject of their work. And who ſhall debar <hi>Cupid</hi> the ſervice and converſation of Poeſie; ſhall weaken him of his beſt weapons. But for ſo much as I know of it, the power and might of this God, are found more quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſhadow of Poeſie, then in their own Eſſence: It repreſenting a kinde of air as lovely as <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf.</p>

Thus (equally tendering all theſe opinions to the Readers diſcretion, to reject or accept which of them he ſhall conclude moſt probable) I proceed on to demonſtrate the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this <hi>paſſion</hi> in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chapter.</p>

               <head>The Cauſes of <hi>Love.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE will now expreſs what <hi>ſpecial cauſes</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> tend moſt to the increaſe of this <hi>Paſſion.</hi> The <hi>Sages</hi> have ſought the <hi>true cauſes</hi> which diſpoſe the <hi>wils</hi> of Men to <hi>love;</hi> and have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many different opinions in this point. Some hold, it is a quality which God imprinted on nature: <hi>for it pleaſed him to create</hi> Adam <hi>on earth as his own image, and hath drawn Eve to be nnto Man a ſpirit of peace, and a love of a perpetual laſting;</hi> this indubitably is the firſt; for we muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that there is no <hi>reall love,</hi> no <hi>true delight,</hi> but proceeds from the ſupreme Divinity, the pure and immaterial Eſſence of the omnipotent Protector, and ſole Ruler of all Celeſtial and Terreſtrial creatures: It is a communicative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, whoſe chief propriety is perpetually to ſtream into the hearts and ſouls of all that are capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Others imagine (and 'tis reall) it comes from the influence of the Stars at their Nativities, and theſe (in my opinion) are the <hi>ſecond cauſes.</hi>

                  <l>God is (of all created) the prime cauſe:</l>
                  <l>Th' ſecond (in ſpite of <hi>Holmes)</hi> are ſtarry laws.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Others ſay, it proceeds from <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> and that's very probable. Others from a certain har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and conſonance of hearts which meeting in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord upon the ſame tone, having a natural correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie. The Maxime of Divines, and morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſaith, That fair and good (otherwiſe that which ſeems to be ſo) make all <hi>loves.</hi> And laſtly, Money.</p>
               <p>Now it is our intent and purpoſe to treat of every one of theſe <hi>cauſes</hi> diſtinctly (the firſt excepted, being explained in the firſt Chapter, and likewiſe in the beginning of this Section) therefore we will proceed to the ſecond cauſe, which is the Stars.</p>
               <p>The faireſt and enticing objects that proceed from Men and Women, that moſt frequently captivate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, and make them dote beyond all meaſure one upon another, aret by the force and power of the Stars <hi>(quod me tibi temperat aſtrum)</hi> ſuch a Woman doth ſingularly dote upon ſuch a Man, and likewiſe ſuch a Man upon ſuch a Woman; hate ſuch again, and give no reaſon for it, it being too high for the vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to attain to the knowledge of it. They by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence act upon the humors and bodies, and by their ſecret qualities tie creatures with the knot of <hi>love;</hi> for how many are there who <hi>love</hi> things which are neither lovely nor good? I mean, not only in effect, but in their own opinion and judgement, yet are they faſtened by ſome tie (unknown to any but the reall ſons of art, and thoſe which are acquainted with the ſublime ſciences) nor can they free themſelves from it but by the abſolute power of reaſon. Do we not dayly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109924:13"/>
finde by experience, that a Man who is, and who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to be deformed and wicked, yet by nature falleth not in <hi>love</hi> with himſelf? ſo through a love of Concupiſcence, he may <hi>love</hi> things which have neither beauty nor goodneſs, although he daily hath a blinde feeling of ſomething ſutable to ſenſuality and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible attractive. For there may be a ſympathy in Nature, and an antipathy in Complexion; and a ſympathy in Complexion, and an antipathy in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as in animals, there is amity betwixt the <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird</hi> and the <hi>Thruſh,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Crow</hi> and <hi>Hern,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Peacocks</hi> and <hi>Pigeons, Turtles</hi> and <hi>Parrats.</hi> Whence <hi>Sappho</hi> in <hi>Ovids Epiſt.</hi> writes to <hi>Phaon;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>To Birds unlike oft-times joyn'd are white Doves;</l>
                     <l>Alſo the Bird that's green black Turtle loves.</l>
                  </q>
For of what ſort the amities and enmities of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours be, ſuch are the inclinations of things ſubject to them in theſe inferiours. Theſe diſpoſitions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Love,</hi> are nothing elſe but certain inclinations of things, of one towards another, deſiring ſuch and ſuch a thing if it be abſent, and to move toward it, and to acquieſce in it when it is obtained, ſhunning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and dreading the approach of it. He that knowes the amities and enmities the ſuperiours have one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, knows my meaning, and will quickly give you a reaſon, and that none of the worſt, let the Prieſts ſay what they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The third Cauſe is from Parents and Education. This cauſe is from our firſt Parents, for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and propagation of the <hi>Species,</hi> and will ſo continue till nature ſhall be no more. It is according to the old Adage, <hi>Qualis Pater, talis Filius;</hi> like Father, like Son. Cat to her kinde; if the Dam trot, the foal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109924:14"/>
will not amble. Experience and nature approves it, that the fruit will reliſh of the tree from whence it ſprung. Conſider how <hi>Love</hi> proceeds from Parents, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcends; that ſo ſoon as we are come to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that our bloud begins to boyl in our veins, we devote our ſelves to a Woman, forgetting our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a wiſe, and the womb that bare us in that which ſhall bear our image. This Woman bleſſing us with Children, our affection leaves the levell it held before, and ſinks from our bed unto our iſſue and picture of poſterity, where affection holds no ſteady manſion: they applying themſelves to a Woman, take a lawful way to love another better then our ſelves, and thus run to poſterity.</p>
               <p>But Education is more potent, for <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in his youth (as himſelf confeſſeth) for want of Diſcipline, was carryed away by the <hi>laſcivious</hi> and <hi>hot paſſion</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> like to a young unbridled Colt, untill that by <hi>Miltiades</hi> example, who was then famous among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he cauſed the heat of his courage to be cooled, and the laſciviouſneſs which was naturally in him, to attend upon virtue: he fed delicately and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Qualis cibus, talis ſanguis &amp; membrum;</hi> ſuch as the meat, ſuch is the broath; for luſcious fare, is the only nurſe and nouriſher of ſenſual appetite, the ſole maintenance of youthful affection, the fewell of this inordinate <hi>paſſion,</hi> nothing ſo much feeding it, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſates the underſtanding by delighting in it. He was very idly educated, which is one main branch that cauſeth <hi>love,</hi> and the firſt arrow that <hi>Cupid</hi> ſhooteth into the hot Liver of a heedleſs <hi>Lover.</hi> For the Man being idle, the minde is apt to all uncleanneſs; the minde being void of exerciſe, the Man is void of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Doth not ruſt corrode the hardeſt Iron, if it be not uſed? Doth not the Moth eat the fineſt garment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109924:14"/>
if it be not worn? Doth not impiety infect the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt acute wit, if it be given to idleneſs? Doth not common experience make this common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that the fertileſt ground bringeth forth nothing but weeds, if it be not tilled? The particulars of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as immoderate ſleep, immodeſt play, unſatiable drinking, doth ſo weaken the ſenſes and bewitch the ſoul, that before we feel the motion of <hi>Love,</hi> we are reſolved to luſt. <hi>Cupid</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a crafty Gentleman, he followes thoſe to a hair that ſtuddy pleaſure, and flies thoſe that ſtoutly labour. Likewiſe though their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination be to virtue, if they be Educated, in Dancing-ſchooles, Schooles of Muſick, lead a riotous life, they will be much ſubject to this <hi>paſſion,</hi> they will prefer fancie before friends, lay Reaſon in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being too ſalt for their taſt, and follow unbridled Affection ſuitable to their education.</p>
               <p>But let their inclinations be never ſo ſtrong, if they have been well brought up and inſtructed, they are in ſome ſort forced to moderate themſelves, not ſuffering <hi>Love</hi> to have ſuch pernicious effects in them, as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are inclined to; whereupon (in my opinion) that old proverb was not ſpoken without reaſon, That Education goeth beyond Nature: ſo that <hi>Quintilian</hi> would not have Nurſes to be of an immodeſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely ſpeech; adding this cauſe, Leſt (ſaith he) ſuch manners, precepts, and diſcourſes as young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren learn in their unriper years remain ſo deeply rooted, as they ſhall ſcarce ever be relinquiſhed. Sure I am, that the firſt impreſſions, whether good or evill, are moſt continuate, and with leaſt difficulty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>

               <p>Beſides Education and cuſtome have power not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change the natural inclination of ſome particular Men, but alſo of whole Countries, as the Hiſtories of moſt Nations declare unto us; and namely that of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> (and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians)</hi> had neither Law nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, knowledge nor forme of Common-wealth (but were led and carryed on by the current of their own inclinations, and as their wils was inclined by the influence of the ſuperiours) whereas now they will give place to no Nation for good inſtitution in all things. To reform the <hi>Lacedemonians, Lycurgus</hi> uſed this piece of policy; He nouriſhed two whelps both of one <hi>Sire</hi> and one <hi>Dam,</hi> but in different manner; for the one he trained up to hunt, and the other to lie alwaies in the chimney-corner at the porridge-pot; afterwards calling the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> into one aſſembly, he ſaid, Ye <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to the attaining of virtue, education, induſtry and exerciſe is the moſt noble means; the truth of which I ſhall make manifeſt to you by tryall; Then bringing forth the whelps, and ſetting down a porridge-pot and an Hare, the one run at the Hare, and the other at the pot: the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> not underſtanding the myſtery, he ſaid, Both of theſe be of one <hi>Sire</hi> and one <hi>Dam,</hi> but you ſee how Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altereth Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:109924:15"/>
Let us therefore (that ſeeing our flexible nature is aſſaulted and provoked to the acting of any thing which is not good) endevour to accuſtome and exerciſe our ſelves in virtue, which will be as it were unto us another nature; let us uſe the means of good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inſtruction in Wiſdom, whereby our ſouls ſhall be made conquerors over theſe <hi>hot paſſions,</hi> and our mindes moderated and ſtayed in all our actions.</p>
               <p>We will now proceed on to the next, and fourth cauſe, which is a certain <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>conſonancy</hi> of hearts, which meeting accord upon the ſame <hi>tone,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a natural correſpondency. For it is Mans nature to <hi>affect</hi> all <hi>harmony,</hi> and ſure it is (where <hi>Cupid</hi> ſtrikes this ſilent note (for <hi>Love</hi> is the muſick, the harmony, complexion, the genus, and very ſoul of nature) more ſweet and melodious then the ſound of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; for there is muſick whereſoever there is an harmony. And thus far we maintain the muſick of the <hi>ſpheres:</hi> for theſe well ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no ſound unto the ear, yet to the underſtanding of the parties affected, they ſtrike a <hi>love-note</hi> moſt full of <hi>harmony.</hi> I deſire leave to inſiſt a little upon this.</p>
               <p>Every body hath its projections and unperceiveable influences, as we finde in the power of <hi>Amber</hi> and the <hi>Adamant,</hi> which attract Iron and Straw, by the expiration they ſcatter in the aire, to ſerve as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hands to their attractions. This being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to other natures of Plants, Metals, and living creatures, we muſt not think but that the body of Man participateth therein, by reaſon of its vivacity and multitude of pores which give a more eaſie paſſage to ſuch emiſſions. There then cometh forth a ſpirituous ſubſtance, which is (according to <hi>Marcilius Ficinus):</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:109924:16"/>
vapour of bloud, pure, ſubtle, hot and clear, more ſtrong or weak according to the interiour agitations of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which carryeth along with it ſome friendly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and temperate quality, which inſinuateth it ſelf into the heart and ſoul, doth (if it there finde a diſpoſition of conformity) abide, as a ſeed caſt into the earth, and forms there an <hi>harmony,</hi> and this love of correſpondency, with an admirable promptneſs and vigor; ſo it happeneth that the ſpirits, being tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from one body to another, and carrying on their wings qualities conſonant, do infallibly excite and awaken the inclinations. The eye is principally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed herein, breathing thence the moſt thin ſpirits and darting forth the viſual rayes, as the arrows of <hi>Love</hi> which penetrate the heart, ſtriking a moſt dulciſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>harmony,</hi> and are united one within another; then heating the bloud, they ſtrike upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and attract the will, which are linked one to another, that they are tyed together with an unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable knot; and ſo by this means <hi>Love</hi> entereth into the heart.</p>
               <p>The fifth Cauſe is that of the Divines and morall Philoſophers, That <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> make us <hi>love.</hi> Which two if they be found both in one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (ſhe's <hi>rara avis,</hi> a very rare thing indeed) are moſt availeful advantages. <hi>Love</hi> varies as its objects varie, which is alwaies good, beautiful, amiable, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and pleaſant, or at leaſt which ſeems to be ſo; from Goodneſs comes Beauty, from Beauty Grace and Comelineſs, which reſult as ſo many rayes from their good parts, makes us to <hi>love,</hi> and ſo covet and deſire it: for were it not pleaſing and gratious in our eyes, we ſhould not ſeek it. <hi>Omne pulchrum amabile,</hi> and what we <hi>love</hi> is fair and gratious in our eyes, or at leaſt we do ſo apprehend or eſteem it. <hi>Suum cui<expan>

                     <l>In all mens eyes, yet in his own moſt faire.</l>
                  </q>
Amiableneſs is the object of <hi>love,</hi> the ſcope and end is to obtain it, for whoſe ſake we <hi>love,</hi> and with our minds covet to enjoy. Likewiſe Grace and Beauty are ſo wonderfully annexed, do ſo ſweetly and gently win our ſouls, and ſtrongly allure, that they confound our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot be diſtinguiſhed. And this makes the Poets ſtill put the three <hi>Graces</hi> in <hi>Venus</hi> company, as attending on her and holding up her train.

                  <l>The needle of a Diall Northward turns,</l>

               </q>
               <p>As this <hi>Magnet</hi> draweth the heavie Iron, and the Harp the ſwift <hi>Dolphin;</hi> ſo <hi>beauty</hi> allureth the <hi>chaſt minde</hi> to <hi>love.</hi> In that exquiſite Romance of <hi>Clytiphon</hi> and <hi>Lucippe,</hi> where <hi>Clytiphon</hi> (being captivated with her <hi>beauty)</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf, ingenuouſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he no ſooner came in <hi>Lucippe</hi>'s preſence, but ſaith he, <hi>Statim ac eam contemplatus ſum, occidi; oculos à Virgine avertere conatus ſum, ſed illi repugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi>

He was wounded at the firſt ſight, his heart panted, he could not poſſibily turn his eyes from her.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Beauty</hi> hath great power to procure <hi>love;</hi> for where it appeareth in the exterior parts in any body, it is as it were a witneſs and teſtimony of the beauty in the ſoul. For the Creator created all things in ſuch manner that he hath commonly joyned <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> together; in the beginning there was nothing made, but it was <hi>very good</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> in his kind, therefore there is an agreement between the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>ſoul;</hi> for <hi>bodily beauty</hi> is as it were an image of the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and promiſeth after a ſort ſome good thing of the <hi>inward beauty;</hi> for <hi>internal perfection</hi> breedeth the <hi>external;</hi> whereupon the <hi>internal</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and the <hi>external, beauty.</hi> Many would willingly die for the <hi>beauty</hi> of others, and are ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and toſſed, that they become ſenſeleſs and phrenetick, being captivated with looking upon a <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful face,</hi> which hath ſuch a ſting that it pierceth even unto the livelieſt part of their <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoul.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it falleth out that poor ſilly <hi>Lovers</hi> are ſo full of <hi>paſſions,</hi> that they ſtand altogether amazed; making their ſouls ſo ſubject to their deſires, that ſhe muſt obey them, as if ſhe were ſome poor Chamber-maid or drudge. It is the Witch of Nature, as gold is the god of the World; for a Woman without <hi>beauty</hi> hath as few followers, as a Man without <hi>money</hi> hath friends.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why Womens <hi>beauty</hi> is of ſuch force, that it overcomes men, is that the ſenſe being too much faſtened upon it, doth not only (as if it gazed upon an object above its ſtrength) remain dazled with the rayes thereof, but reaſon it ſelf is darkned, the heart is fettered, and the will by <hi>love</hi> made a priſoner. And I muſt needs tell you in plain terms, that <hi>beauty</hi> without
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109924:17"/>
the indowments of a virtuous minde is ſtark naught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet moſt commonly, the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>minde</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the <hi>face,</hi> as it were in a looking-glaſs; for in it is ſeen a modeſt bluſh the vail of ſhame fac'dneſs, the true ornament of an honeſt minde, the treaſure of Chaſtitity, the ſplendor of Clemency, the riches of Silence, the majeſty of Virtue, the lodge of Love, and the neſt of Grace; becauſe the <hi>face</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the other corporal parts) is the more noble, where the minde by thoſe ſenſes that are in it exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its effects and operatious.</p>
               <p>Having diſcourſed thus much of <hi>beauty</hi> in general, we will now deſcend to the particulars of <hi>beauty,</hi> and demonſtrate their force in cauſing <hi>Love.</hi> For there is not any that <hi>loves,</hi> but there is ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part, either in form or condition, which pleaſeth moſt, and inflameth him above the reſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> cals <hi>Cupids arrowes;</hi> the black, round, quick ſparkling <hi>eye,</hi> is the <hi>moſt fair, amorous</hi> and <hi>enticing,</hi> the ſpeaking, courting, enchanting <hi>eye.

The Poet <hi>Propertius</hi> cals the <hi>eyes</hi> the <hi>conductors</hi> and <hi>guides</hi> in <hi>Love.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Si neſcis, oculi ſunt in amore duces.</l>
                  </q>
It is the <hi>eyes</hi> that infect the ſpirits, by the gazing upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109924:18"/>
an object, and thence the ſpirits infect the bloud. To this effect the Lady in <hi>Apuleius</hi> complained, <hi>Thou art the cauſe of my grief, thine eyes piercing through mine eyes into mine inward parts, have ſet my bowels on fire, therefore commiſerate me that am now ready to die for thy ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>eye</hi> is the judge of <hi>beauty,</hi> and is as it were the looking-glaſſe of the ſoul, in which are deſcribed all the <hi>affections</hi> of the Soul, as <hi>Love, paſſion, anger, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>eye</hi> exceedingly luſteth after <hi>beauty</hi> (and whilſt it contemplateth the colours, formes, features, comelineſs, grace, laughter, and whatſoever excellent quality appertaines unto <hi>beauty)</hi> is deemed fitteſt to be the principal judge thereof; the <hi>eye</hi> being an Organ by which a <hi>Lover</hi> doth beſt diſcern the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thoſe principal parts, which are required to the framing of a compleat <hi>beauty;</hi> for we often times ſee, by the bare report of virtue, in any honorable breaſt <hi>love</hi> imperfectly; but if report be once confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an interview, and the <hi>eye</hi> be made judge as well as the ear, it gathereth ſtrength, and exceedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; which proceedeth from no other cauſe then from the great force that the <hi>eye</hi> hath in the true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſible things, beſides the power thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelf more then all the other ſenſes to the multitude of objects, and more ſpeedily apprehending them. Pardon me for ſtepping a little out of the way, but I ſhall quickly be in again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Faire hair,</hi> as the Poets ſay, are the priſons of <hi>Cupid;</hi> that is the cauſe (as I ſuppoſe) that Ladies make Rings, and Bracelets, and <hi>love-locks</hi> to ſend to their <hi>Lovers.</hi> And that's the cauſe too (for I muſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle both ſexes) that Men curle and powder their hair, and prune their pickativants, making the Eaſt ſide cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the Weſt.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:109924:18"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>Tongue,</hi> is called by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> the <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>love.</hi> But we wil take all the actions and geſtures of the mouth together with it; what a bewitching force hath a gratious laughter, a pleaſant and eloquent delivery, a modeſt courting, a <hi>Syrens</hi> ſong, or any other comely carriage or manifeſtation of the minde, a corral lip, a comely order and ſet of two Ivory rails? How great force and enticements lie in kiſſing? <hi>Balthazer Caſtilio</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam pluribus oculis labra cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitabant, animarum quoque mixturam facientes, inter mutuos complexus animas anhelantes:</hi> They breath out their ſouls and ſpirits together with their kiſſes, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hearts and ſpirits, and mingle affections as they do kiſſes, and it is rather a connexion of the minde then of the body.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſome are enamoured of an handſome tall and ſlender body; ſome again are taken with one of a middle ſize and plump; but many are captivated with a handſome leg and foot.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, their <hi>breaſts</hi> and <hi>paps</hi> are called the <hi>tents of Love;</hi> for which cauſe Women do ſo much diſcover them, (for Women, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> are <hi>Natures Errata,</hi> continually ſtudying temptations) together with their <hi>naked necks, ſhoulders</hi> and <hi>armes,</hi> having all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and in readineſs, that may either allure the minde to <hi>love,</hi> or the heart to <hi>folly.</hi> What is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their affected carriages, thoſe Garments ſo pompous, thoſe guizes ſo ſought after, thoſe Colours ſo fantaſtick, the Jewels and Pendants ſo ſumptuous, that painting ſo ſhameleſs, thoſe Curles and Patches, their ſilk and Bow-die ſtockins, with their coats tucked
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109924:19"/>
up that their neat leg and foot may be ſeen, their lac'd ſhooes, thoſe curteſies, ſalutations, cringings and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing gates; but to cut the throat of Chaſtity, and are ſpringes to catch Wood-cocks. A Ship is not ſo long a rigging, as a yong Lady is in trimming her ſelf againſt the coming of her Sweet-heart. Eye but the dreſſes of Women which are now in uſe, and thou ſhall not only ſee the carved vizard of a lewd Woman, but the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate viſage of a laſcivious wanton; not only the ſhadow of <hi>love,</hi> but the ſubſtance of <hi>luſt.</hi>

Yet if ſhe have <hi>caſh,</hi> Oh how amiable is ſhe! without doubt ſhe hath no leſſe then twenty <hi>Suitors,</hi> never rack ſhe's good enough. <hi>Eſt natura hominum,</hi> to love thoſe that are fortunate and rich, that thrive, let them get it as they will, by hook or crook, all's one ſo they have it. <hi>De moribus ultima fiet qneſtio;</hi> to enquire of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Education is the laſt interrogatory.

               <p>We will now declare what the Poets ſay is the <hi>cauſe of Love.</hi> They ſay that when <hi>Jupiter</hi> firſt formed Man, and all ſouls, he touched every one with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pieces of <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> and afterwards put all the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109924:22"/>
pieces in a place by themſelves; likewiſe, the ſouls of Women after he had touched them, he put them in a Magazine by themſelves: afterwards when he had ſent the ſouls into bodies, he brought thoſe of the Women to the place where the <hi>Load-ſtones</hi> were which touched the Men, and made every one to take one piece; if there were any theeviſh ſouls, they took ſeveral pieces and hid them. Now when that Man meets with that Woman that hath the piece which touched his ſoul, it is impoſſible but he muſt <hi>love</hi> her; the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> which ſhe hath doth attract his ſoul: And from hence doth proceed the ſeveral <hi>effects of Love;</hi> for thoſe who are <hi>loved</hi> of many, are thoſe theeviſh ſouls who took many pieces of the <hi>Loadſtone;</hi> if any do <hi>love</hi> one who <hi>loves</hi> not him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again, that was one who took his <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> but he not hers. And from hence (ſay they) comes it to paſſe, that we do often ſee ſome perſons <hi>love</hi> others, who in our eyes are nothing amiable. Alſo from hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe ſtrange <hi>loves</hi> which ſometimes fals out, as that a <hi>Gaul</hi> brought up amongſt many <hi>beauties</hi> fals in <hi>love</hi> with a barbarous ſtanger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fonſeca</hi> holds (and I am of the ſame minde) there is ſomething in a Woman beyond all humane delight, a <hi>magnetick virtue,</hi> a <hi>charming quality,</hi> and a <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive.</hi> To illuſtrate this; There is a ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Lives of the Fathers,</hi> of a Childe whoſe Education was in a Deſert from his infancy, by an old <hi>Hermite;</hi> being come to mans eſtate, he acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſpied two comely Women wandering in the Woods; he enquired of the <hi>Hermite</hi> (having never ſeen ſuch before in his life) what creatures they were, the <hi>Hermite</hi> told him that they were <hi>Fairies;</hi> after ſome tract of time, being in diſcourſe, the <hi>Hermite</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him which was the pleaſanteſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109924:23"/>
ſight that ever he ſaw in his life? He readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replyed (without any pauſe or further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the two <hi>Fairies</hi> he eſpied in the Deſert. So that indubitably, there is in a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a magnetick power, and a natural imbred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which moves our concupiſcence. And this ſurely proceeds from the particular inſtitutes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the perfections a Man imagins in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature of his likeneſs, which he thinks may become another ſelf: for with the diſtinction of ſexes which nature hath beſtowed on man, as well as irrationall creatures; ſhe hath put certaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the brain (as in this young man) which makes a Man at a certain age, and at a certain ſeaſon, to look on himſelf as defective, and as if he were but the half of an whole, whereof a perſon of the other ſex ought to be the other half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the acquiſition of this half is repreſented to us confuſedly by nature, as the greateſt of all imaginable goods; and although he ſee many perſons of the other ſex, he doth not therefore deſire many at the ſame time, by reaſon Nature makes him conceive that he hath need of no more but one half; but when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome thing in any one, that likes him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any thing he hath marked at the ſame time in the reſt; that fixes the ſoul to feel all the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which nature hath given him to ſeek after that good, that ſhe repreſents to him, as the greateſt he can poſſibly poſſeſſe, on that Woman only; and this is it which furniſheth the <hi>Romancers</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> with ſtuffe.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter; It may be, that ſome will expect, that I ſhould preſcribe ſome things to <hi>cauſe love;</hi> as to teach them how to temper and ſpice an amatorious cup, and what time may be elected for

               <p>That there is things that have power and virtue to <hi>cauſe Love</hi> is not to be doubted; for the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World (according to <hi>Corn.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes a ſhorter cut to obtaining; for a Man of armes is always void of ceremony, which is the wall betwixt <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> that is, Man and Woman; for there is no pride in Women, but that which rebounds from our own baſeneſſe (as Cowards grow valiant upon thoſe that are more Cowards) ſo that only by our <hi>pale asking</hi> we teach them to <hi>deny,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:109924:32"/>
and by our <hi>ſhamefacedneſſe</hi> we put them in minde to be modeſt. This kinde of <hi>baſhfulneſſe</hi> is far from Men of valorous diſpoſitions, and eſpecially from Soudiers; for ſuch are ever Men (without doubt) forward and confident, loſing no time, leſt they ſhould loſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which is the beſt <hi>factor</hi> for a <hi>Lover.</hi> And becauſe they know Women are given to <hi>diſſemble,</hi> they will never believe them when they <hi>deny.</hi> They will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Miſtreſſes even in a wrong and unjuſt cauſe; for from the firſt moment that they faſtened their <hi>affections</hi> upon that object, they prize it above their <hi>own proper eſſence,</hi> and therefore how juſtly ſoever an injury or violence may be offered unto it, they think no injuſtice in themſelves to defend it; or becauſe winking at the wrong offered their <hi>Sweet hearts,</hi> they make themſelves unwortby of their <hi>grace. Plato</hi> is of opinion that it was the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> made <hi>Mars</hi> couragious and valorous: and (truly) who would not be valorous to fight under ſuch colours? Before this cowardly age, there was no way known to win a Lady but by <hi>tilting</hi> and <hi>turning,</hi> and <hi>riding,</hi> to ſeek <hi>adventures</hi> through <hi>dangerous Forreſts;</hi> in which time theſe ſlender ſmall bon'd ſtriplings with little legs, were held but of ſtrength enough to <hi>marry</hi> their <hi>widowes.</hi> And even in our days there can be given no reaſon of the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Servingmen upon their Miſtreſſes, but only that uſually they carry their Maſters weapons, and their valour. It is better to be admitted to the title of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant acts; at leaſt that imports the venturing of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and all Women delight to hold him faſt in their armes, who hath eſcaped thither through many <hi>dangers.</hi> To ſpeak at once, Man hath a priviledge in valour.

of her. A <hi>ſcar</hi> in a Mans <hi>face,</hi> is the ſame that a <hi>mole</hi> is in a Womans, and a <hi>mole</hi> in a Womans <hi>face,</hi> is a jewell ſet in white, to make it ſeem more white; ſo a <hi>ſcar</hi> in a Man is a mark of honour, and no blemiſh; for 'tis a ſcar and a blemiſh in a Souldier to be without one.

               <p>There is one Love-ſimplician who is ſo led by the noſe into <hi>fools Paradiſe,</hi> that if he ſee an <hi>handſome maid</hi> ſmile and laugh upon him, or ſhew a pleaſant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or look <hi>(obliquis ocellis)</hi> aſquint upon him, or uſe ſome gratious words, or amorous geſtures (as many are too full of) he applies it all to himſelf, as done in his favour, thinking that ſurely ſhe <hi>loves</hi> him; to the Tavern he runs, looks big, erects his Mouchatoes, ſtampes, ſtares, and cals the Drawer Rogue, drinks to his <hi>Venus</hi> in a Venice-glace, and thinks he ſees the ſmile ſhe gave him in it, and to moralize her ſex, throwes it over his head and breaks it. This fellow is like to <hi>Mullidor</hi> (in <hi>Greenes never too late)</hi> who ſaid to his Mother, that he compared the Church to a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe, for as a Man may ſee himſelf in the one, ſo in the other the wenches eyes are a Certificate; for upon whom you ſee all the Girles look, he for <hi>foot</hi> and

Oh! war Mother, when a Dog wags his tail he loves his Maſter, and when a wanton laughes, for my life, ſhe is over head and ears in <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Gull</hi> ſeeks to win his Miſtreſſes <hi>affection</hi> with gallant and coſtly apparell, putting all he hath on his back, thinking Women are marryed to fine clothes; making his <hi>Taylor</hi> his <hi>Baude,</hi> and hopes to inveagle her <hi>love</hi> with ſuch a coloured ſuit; ſurely the ſame Man hazzards the loſſe of her favour upon every change of his clothes.

at liberty, always preſent, continually talking with her, ſhe cannot ſtir a foot, but you muſt do the like.

Do you think this is the way? no, no, it is in <hi>Love</hi> as in all things elſe, the mean is the beſt meaſure; ſo as to avoid all frivolous follies and troubles (as they are no other when you have made the beſt of them) the only way is but to <hi>love</hi> indifferently; and if you will be ſilly fools, and muſt needs have Miſtreſſes, your beſt way is never to tie your ſelf to one; for to <hi>love</hi> one only, gives her an occaſion to think that it is for want of courage, that you dare not attempt to <hi>love</hi> any elſe, and therefore ſhe will ſcorn ſuch a fainthearted <hi>Lover:</hi> whereas, did you <hi>Love</hi> all you look upon (or at leaſt a good many of them) ſhe will not think you came to her, becauſe you know not whither to go elſe; but ſhe will then prize you the higher, and will be obliged to <hi>love</hi> you, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you particularize her above any other; and once a week is often enough to tender your ſervice to her, for oftener is a palpable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109924:34"/>
what belongs to <hi>Love!</hi> and then having recovered his breath, for (through the vehemency of anger towards me) he had almoſt loſt it, he begins to object again, ſaying, Thoſe <hi>effects</hi> which belong to an <hi>extreme Love,</hi> and one that knowes, what Sacrifice and Duties belong unto the Altars of <hi>Love,</hi> is ſo far from calling thoſe <hi>effects, troubles,</hi> or <hi>follies</hi> (as you terme them) as they think them <hi>felicities</hi> and <hi>perfect contentments;</hi> Likewiſe he ſaith, that <hi>Love</hi> is to die in ones ſelf, that he may live in another; Never to love any thing but what is pleaſing and agreeable to the party <hi>loved.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> muſt be transformed into a <hi>night toy</hi> he cals a Miſtreſſe.

               <head>The Power and Effects of <hi>Love</hi> in Widowes.</head>
               <p>REader, I pray thee ſmile, but do not jear at my curioſity in deſcribing the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in Widowes (who, like <hi>Heralds</hi> Herſe-clothes, ſerve to many Funerals with a little altering the colour) and the wylie lures they lay to bring on their <hi>Suitors.</hi> It would make a Dog laugh to hear how they will belie their age, ſaying, they are little paſt 30 when they have ſcarce a tooth in their heads. As one reports, who <hi>loved</hi> a Widow of 50 years of age, ſhe ſwore ſhe was but 32 the next <hi>December,</hi> and 'tis a thing more familiar with ſtale Batchelours; but <hi>Venus haec perjuria ridet: Venus</hi> laughes at theſe perjuries.</p>
               <p>They will artificially diſcourſe of their former Husbands, ſaying, they have no memory of life, unleſſe it be to think of, and to live in him; thinking thereby to engage their <hi>Lovers</hi> the more, and to let them ſee how much they doe deſerve to be <hi>beloved,</hi> in ſhewing them how capable they are of <hi>Love,</hi> and how much they can cherriſh
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109924:39"/>
the affections of a living Man, ſince they ſo long retain thoſe of dead ones; imitating ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyes, as to gain another Mans money, doe willingly depoſite ſome of their own. O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! ſaith ſhe, (relating her <hi>Love</hi> to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Husband) how doe I reſent his loſſe, and have ever ſince preſerv'd ſo lively a memory of him in my ſoul (for I did <hi>love</hi> him with moſt perfect <hi>affection)</hi> that me thinks I ſee him every hour before mine eyes, and me thinks I hear him every minute bid me <hi>love</hi> him ſtill; making a dead Man a ground bait to draw <hi>Suitors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> on; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the multitude of them; for by them ſhe gaines: one ſerves to draw on another, and with one at laſt ſhe ſhoots out another, as boyes do pellets in Elder-guns.</p>
               <p>She has a trick to commend to them a ſingle life; juſt as Horſe-courſers do their Jades to put them away. While ſhe is a Widow (obſerve her) ſhe is no morning Woman; the evening and a good fire may make her liſten to a Husband; but if ever ſhe be made ſure, 'tis upon a full ſtomach to bedward.</p>
               <p>They (all of them) are full of ſuſpicion of their <hi>Lovers,</hi> extremely jealous, leſt they be deceived by young wenches, exceeding hard to be won, and very eaſily loſt, quickly offended, but abominably hard to be pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Really, I admire at thoſe Men, who take delight to Court Widowes. What a fantaſticall ſtomach muſt he needs have, that cannot eat of a diſh of meat, till another have cut of it? Who would waſh after another, when he might have freſh water enough for asking? or what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109924:39"/>
a pitiful thing is it, for a Man that is about to go a long journey, to be tyed to Ride on a Beaſt that is half tyred to his hand? Men will ſay he is benighted, and is now glad of any Inne. Therefore I wiſh you never to marry any Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that has had other Incumbents; for he that takes her, has but a Reverſion in taile, and if ſhe prove good, he may thank Death for his aime; if evill, upbraid him, and not unjuſtly for his occaſion. But hold, a Church-man ſhe dares not venture upon, for ſhe hath heard Widowes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of dilapidations. Never (with the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) drink of that Fountain another hath dyed in.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is a reſolution of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> of what mean quality ſoever he be, he will not marry a Widow, although ſhe be very young and wealthy, and it hath been a reſolution of theirs from antiquity, and continueth to this day: and to this effect one of them made this anſwer,
<q>
                     <l>I will no Widow wed, my reaſon's ſound,</l>
                     <l>I'le drink no water wherein one was drown'd.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He that takes her halfe worne, makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhe hath that will pay for new dreſſing; ſhe ſeems to promiſe ſecurity in her peace, yet invites many times to a troubleſome eſtate; when the conqueſt atchieved, ſcarce countervails the Wars, the principall of her <hi>love</hi> is periſhed with the uſe.</p>

The hair of his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes ſtand upright and grow hard, he rubs his <hi>eyes</hi> very much as though he were ſleepy, he rols his <hi>eyes</hi> much. His <hi>eyes</hi> are all white, either to weare the livery of his Miſtreſſe <hi>complexion,</hi> or to keep <hi>Cupid</hi> from hitting the black.</p>
               <p>Hair growing thick behind the ears, and beſides the temples, is a ſigne of a vehement inclination to <hi>love. Valeſcus de Tarenta</hi> the moſt famous Phyſitian of his age, obſerves the chopping of <hi>lips</hi> in Women to be a ſign of their inclination to this malady; for that it denotes the intemperate heat of the matrix. They cannot endure to look any in the face, becauſe they think, that through their eyes they ſee their hearts.</p>
               <p>His <hi>armes</hi> are careleſly uſed, as if their beſt uſe were nothing but <hi>imbracements.</hi> He is untruſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttoned, ungartered, not out of careleſneſſe, but care; his fartheſt end being but going to bed. Her <hi>favours</hi> lift him up as the Sun doth moiſture; when ſhe <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favours,</hi> unable to hold that happineſſe, it fals down in tears. If you aske him a queſtion, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers not, or not to the purpoſe; and no wonder, for he is not at home, his thoughts being gone a wool-gathering with his Miſtreſſe. Stragling <hi>thoughts</hi> are his content, they make him dream waking. Speak to him, he hears with his <hi>eyes, eares</hi> follow his <hi>minde,</hi> and that's not at leaſure.</p>

It came to me by a great chance; for as I looked on a fair flower, a thing I know not what, crept in at mine eyes, and ran round about all my veins, and at laſt got into my heart, and there ever ſince hath remained, and there (Mother) ſo wrings me that <hi>Mullidor</hi> muſt die, and with that he fell on weeping.

               <p>An <hi>unfortunate Lover</hi> ſpeaks of nothing but his <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi> and his <hi>flames,</hi> he is alwayes in the fire like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> he has a perpetual <hi>Mount Aetna</hi> in his breaſt; nay, ſaith he, I will touch a Forreſt with my finger, and it will totally burn and waſte it.

               <p>Yet, ſome there are, who are not ſuch kinde <hi>ſouls,</hi> nor half ſo <hi>paſſionate,</hi> more diſcreet in their choiſe, and

in the <hi>paſſages</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> more temperate.

               <p>Some Artiſts will undertake to judge who are in <hi>Love</hi> by <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> by the lines of the hand.

               <p>There are many forward Virgins of our age are of opinion, that this commodity can never be taken up too ſoon, and howſoever they neglect in other things, they are ſure to catch time by the forelock in this; if you aske them this queſtion, they will reſolve you 14 is the beſt time of their age, if 13 be not better then that, and they have for the moſt part, their Mothers example before them to confirme and prove their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and this withall they hold for a certain ground, that be they never ſo little, they are ſure thereby to

               <p>This <hi>paſſion</hi> is more tolerable in youth, and ſuch as are in their hot bloud; and ſhall I be bold to ſpeak it without offence to the ſtale Batchelors, that <hi>Love</hi> is not properly nor naturally in ſeaſon, but in that age next unto infancy.</p>

And truly a <hi>gray-head</hi> and a <hi>wanton-heart</hi> are ill ſuited; it is more ridiculous to ſee it in Women then men.

Not but that he was of his naturall inclination as much devoted ſervant unto Ladies, but being continually exerciſed in buſineſſe much different from idleneſſe, he had no pleaſure to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109924:51"/>
let <hi>Love</hi> ſow any ſeeds in his ſoul; for ever ſince he was able to bear armes, moved by a generous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which invites noble ſpirits unto dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, he was perpetually in wars, where he did moſt heroically ſignalize himſelf.</p>
               <p>Some have given two reaſons, why <hi>youth</hi> is more ſubject to this <hi>illimited paſſion,</hi> then any other <hi>age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, That naturall heat or vigour which is moſt predominant in youth, provoking him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the greateſt of difficulties, rather then ſuffer the repulſe where he affects.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, Want of imployment, which begets this diſtemperature; <hi>Vacuo pectore regnat amor,</hi> Love playes <hi>hai-day</hi> in an idle perſon. <hi>Amor otioſae cura eſt ſolicitudinis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> it is an affection of an idle minde. Alſo it foſters it ſelf by a writ of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the hearts of young men, who abounding with much bloud, and conſequently with great ſtore of Vitall ſpirits, are more fiery and ardent, making them full of wanton and youthfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>I have many times obſerved a great <hi>ſympathy</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> young <hi>boyes</hi> and <hi>girles</hi> have one to another; and (indeed) there is a pretty pleaſing kind of wooing, drawn from a conceived, but concealed fancy, which ſuits well with theſe <hi>amorous younglings;</hi> they could wiſh with their hearts, ever to be in the preſence of thoſe they <hi>love,</hi> ſo they might not be ſeen by them. Might they chuſe, they would converſe with them freely, conſort with them friendly, and impart their trueſt thoughts fully; yet would they not have their <hi>baſhful loves</hi> finde diſcovery. They would be ſeen, yet ſeem obſcured; <hi>Love,</hi> but not diſcloſe it; ſee whom they <hi>love,</hi> but not be eyed. Yea (which hath ſtruck me into

from the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>concupiſcency,</hi> for <hi>jealouſie</hi> is a <hi>fear</hi> (as I have ſaid) which a Man hath, leſt another ſhould enjoy the thing he deſireth: the reaſon thereof is, becauſe we judge it hurtfull either to our ſelves, or to thoſe whom we <hi>love,</hi> if others ſhould enjoy it.

               <p>Next time you ſee a <hi>jealous Lover,</hi> doe but mark him, and you ſhall ſee (without a pair of Spectacles) how he miſinterprets every thing is either ſaid or done, moſt apt to miſtake or miſconſter, he peeps into every corner, followes cloſe, obſerves to an hair all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures

and actions of his Miſtreſſe, he will ſometimes ſigh, weep, and ſob for anger, ſwear, ſlander, and belie any Man, ſometimes he will uſe obſequious and flattering ſpeeches, and aske forgiveneſſe, condemning his raſhneſſe and folly, and then immediately again, he is as impatient and furious as ever he was; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh (Gentlewomen) to beware of ſuch <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who wax and wane an hundred times in an hour, as though they were got in the change of the <hi>Moon:</hi> ſo ſtrange is the inferences of this <hi>malicious jealouſie,</hi> that it never makes a good <hi>Logician.</hi> He pries on all ſides, accurately obſerving on whom ſhe looks, and who looks on her. <hi>Argus</hi> did not ſo keep his <hi>Cow,</hi> the watchfull <hi>Dragon</hi> the <hi>golden Fleece,</hi> or <hi>Cerberus, Hell gates,</hi> as he does her, toyling and waſting away himſelf in purſuite of ſo concealed a myſtery, and ſo obſcure a verification.

               <p>Now as touching Women, they have the <hi>ſymptomes</hi> of this <hi>paſſion</hi> more vehemently, their <hi>wils</hi> being ſtronger then their <hi>reaſon,</hi> there is no counſell to be given them againſt this evill of <hi>jealouſie,</hi> their nature being wholly ſuſpicion, vanity and curioſity. If you ſeek to perſwade them, they will flie out againſt you like ſo many <hi>Lyoneſſes,</hi> objecting, How can they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their <hi>paſſions?</hi> how can they but be <hi>jealous,</hi> when they ſee themſelves manifeſtly neglected, contemned, loathed, unkindly uſed, and their <hi>unkind Lovers</hi> court Ladies to their faces? There is a tree in <hi>Mexicana</hi> which is ſo exceedingly tender, that a Man cannot touch any of its branches, but it withers preſently: ſo Women are ſo ſubject to this <hi>paſſion,</hi> that (like tinder) they will take fire at the leaſt ſparke of ſuſpicion, and a ſmall touch will wound and kill their <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>paſſion</hi> is moſt predominant in old Men (as ſaith the Author of the <hi>Accompliſht Woman)</hi> which very properly be compared to <hi>Ivy,</hi> becauſe that grows ordinarily upon old heapes or ruines; ſo this <hi>paſſion</hi> wreathes it ſelf moſt commonly about old tortured and dejected ſpirits, ſuch as marry young wenches, and how can they be otherwiſe, all things conſidered?

It is no great miracle, if <hi>jealous</hi> ones be lean, their <hi>paſſions</hi>

feeding on nothing but faintneſſe; and nothing like <hi>melancholy</hi> to entertain <hi>jealouſie.</hi> Therefore I exhort Gentlewomen not to beſtow themſelves upon fools, or apparent melancholy perſons, <hi>jealouſie</hi> being a ſymptome of that diſeaſe, and fools have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>It is an enemy with poyſoned weapons, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is enough to overthrow; when the <hi>memory</hi> hath once received it, <hi>reaſon</hi> often comes too late for a reſiſtance. I hope I ſhall not be thought a vagrant from my ſubject, if I tell marryed couples that <hi>ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> of it ſelf is able to make one flie out that was otherwiſe honeſt. If we conſider that <hi>jealouſie</hi> and <hi>Cuckolds</hi> differ no otherwiſe then a City Sheriffe and Alderman, a little time makes the one the other; for it is as common as the <hi>Moon</hi> gives hornes twice a moneth to the world, for a <hi>jealous</hi> Man to wear <hi>Actaeons</hi> badge; the Miller ſees not all the water that goes by his Mill: ſometimes <hi>Sweet-heart</hi> and <hi>Cuckold</hi> are reciprocal termes: many a good Gentleman hath worn a plume of Buls feathers in his creſt, being ſet in by his arrant honeſt Miſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>There was a <hi>Roman</hi> named <hi>Cydippus,</hi> who took ſo great a delight to ſee Buls baited, that it ſet ſuch an impreſſion in his <hi>Idea,</hi> as he thought ſo much of it over night, that he aroſe in the morning with a horned head. This ſpectacle pleaſed him, for that he had entertained his fancy with it, and in the end his imagination did him this ill office. There is no malice ſufficiently black to blind this <hi>paſſions capacity;</hi> it gives ſubtlety and craft to the dulleſt, and perverts the moſt vertuous to ſeek ſatisfaction for the injury: if has no bound to inventions, it brings ruine to its foſterer, as it did to <hi>Procris,</hi> jealous of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Cephalus,</hi> ſhe imagined he had a Miſtreſſe

Continuall reſort and frequent made them inſeparably one; no day ſo pleaſing as when they were together, no hour ſo tedious as when they were aſunder. But ſhort is that moment of fading happineſſe, which hath in it a reliſh of lightneſſe, and is not grounded on eſſentiall goodneſſe. Long had they not thus lived, and ſociably <hi>loved,</hi> but the Gentlewoman concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome private ſuſpicion that her ſelf was not the ſole ſoveraigneſſe of his heart; but that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was become ſharer in his <hi>Love.</hi> Neither was this Competitrice, whom ſhe ſuſpected, any other then her own attendant, whoſe Casket ſhe ſecretly opened, where ſhe found a Ring of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall

               <p>We will begin at the <hi>ſecond cauſe, viz.</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> (for the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> inſtituted by the Creator was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and good.) As the <hi>minde</hi> hath its <hi>natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſo the <hi>will</hi> hath her <hi>natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> from the <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>Stars;</hi> for they do incline the <hi>will</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> but do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it; <hi>agunt non cogunt;</hi> of their own nature they are good, as they are taken from the firſt nature created of God; neither would they be at any time hurtfull, if there were not exceſſe in us proceeding from nature corrupted; which afterwards by the force of their influence, breed in us ſuch <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> as are theſe <hi>paſſions.</hi> For God in the beginning made all things good; neither doth he forbid and condemn this <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> in his Law,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109924:60"/>
ſo far forth as it is ruled thereby, but approveth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtituted in the Creation. But when this <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> is diſordered in us, and is inflamed, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to the power of the ſuperiours to work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, it is not only <hi>vitious,</hi> but is as it were the originall and fountain of all <hi>vices,</hi> (for what <hi>vice,</hi> would a Man, whoſe <hi>reaſon</hi> is governed by <hi>will,</hi> and that <hi>will</hi> inclined by the <hi>Stars,</hi> leave unperpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to effect them?) whereas if it were well ordered, and ruled according to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>inſtitutes</hi> of God, it would be the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>well-ſpring</hi> of all <hi>vertues.

then it is more difficult to make them marry, then cure the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Cyptian</hi> found nothing more powerfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the temptations of <hi>Venus,</hi> then to turn the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the medall. But above all it behoveth us to uſe the example of an <hi>Arabian,</hi> who preſented to himſelf perpetually over his head, an eye which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened him, an ear which heard him, a hand which meaſured out all his deportments, and demeanors, and guards of chaſtity, which daily blunt a thouſand arrowes ſhot againſt the impenetrable hearts of brave and undaunted champions: that you may not fall into the fire, it is good to avoid the ſmoke, not to truſt our ſelves too much to petty dalliances, which under pretext of innocency, ſteal in with the more liberty: for to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>dally</hi> with <hi>beauty</hi> (as we ſhall hereafter declare) is an enterpriſe of danger; for ſome I have known, who upon their acceſſe to <hi>beauty</hi> have been free men, but at their return have become ſlaves.</p>
               <p>We now intend to extinguiſh the heat and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of <hi>Love</hi> in the <hi>fourth cauſe,</hi> which is <hi>meer beauty,</hi> and the particulars of it. Be not ſo ſenſual as to <hi>love</hi> only the body, and to dote upon an outſide, but look higher, and ſee ſomething in the perſon <hi>loved</hi> of an <hi>Angelical nature;</hi> that is, a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vertuous minde,</hi> which to an underſtanding ſoul appears to be of a <hi>divine eſſence,</hi> and to which he mingles his ſoul in <hi>love,</hi> which is (if really conſidered) a far more excellent and permament <hi>love,</hi> then that of an externall and fading <hi>beauty,</hi> and conſequently much more pleaſant. Do we not commonly ſee, that in painted pots of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> are contained the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt poyſon? that the <hi>Cypreſſe tree</hi> bears a fair leaf, but no fruit? That the <hi>Eſtrich</hi> carryeth fair feathers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109924:62"/>
but rank fleſh? How frantick then are thoſe <hi>Lovers,</hi> who are hurried headlong with the gay gliſtering of a <hi>fine face?</hi> the <hi>beauty</hi> whereof is parched with the Suns blaze, and chapped with a Winters blaſt: which is of ſo ſhort continuance, that it fadeth before we ſee it flouriſh; of ſo ſmall profit, that it poyſoneth thoſe that poſſeſſe it; of ſo little value with the wiſe, that they account it a delicate bait with a mortall hook; a ſweet <hi>Panther</hi> with a devowring panch, a tart poyſon in a ſilver pot.</p>
               <p>But hark, one word with you, <hi>Love Symplicians.</hi> Let your humane imaginations think and aſſemble into one ſubject whatſoever is moſt <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>delicious</hi> in nature. Do you imagine a <hi>Quire of Sirens,</hi> and do you joyne in conſort, both the <hi>harpe of Orpheus,</hi> and the <hi>voice of Amphion.</hi> Let <hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Muſes</hi> be there to bear a part; and do you ſearch within the power of nature, rifle up her treaſure, and all the extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which it hath produced in the world hitherto, to charme our ſouls, and to raviſh our ſpirits; what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency and felicity do you finde in all theſe? They are meer <hi>Chimeraes,</hi> and as a vain <hi>Idea;</hi> a meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a body of pleaſure in compariſon of vertues, and thoſe divine thoughts and pleaſures which may be enjoyed in the contemplation of the Almighty, and his infinite beauty, glory, and love, and of the felicity of felicities which he hath prepared for them that love him. So that happy are thoſe (but too few are they) who with wiſe <hi>Ithacus</hi> hudwink themſelves, and ſtop their eares to thoſe ſoul-tainting, and ſin-tempting <hi>Sirens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a great example of <hi>continency</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>beauty</hi> was that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great, towards the <hi>fair Greek, Irene;</hi> whom albeit he entirely <hi>loved;</hi> yet to ſhew to his Peers, a princely command of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109924:63"/>
himſelf, and his affections; as he had incenſed them before by <hi>loving</hi> her, ſo he regained their love by ſlighting her; whence the Poet,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>With that he drew his <hi>Turkiſh Cymeter,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Which he did brandiſh o're the <hi>Damſels</hi> head,</l>
                  <l>Demanding of ſuch <hi>Janizers</hi> were there,</l>
                  <l>If 't were not pity ſhe ſh'd be ſlaughtered?</l>
                  <l>Pity indeed; but I perforce muſt do</l>
                  <l>That which diſpleaſeth me, to pleaſure you.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Many ſuch inſtances, ancient and modern Hiſtories afford, but I muſt not inſiſt on each particular leſt I ſhould enlarge my ſelf too much, and ſwell that into a volume, which I intend but a Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>How many do we finde, who having their ſpirits poſſeſſed with other <hi>paſſions,</hi> one of Ambition, another of Avarice, another of Revenge, another of Envie, another tranſported by the ſolitude of a Law ſuite, and the turmoile of a family, who think very little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Love?</hi> how many others are there, from whom ſtudy affaires, charges, (wherein they ſtrive ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to tranſcend) free their mindes from all other thoughts, not ſuffering them to have any <hi>complements</hi> with <hi>Cupid?</hi> And how many Ladies do we ſee in the World, with countenances ever ſmiling, of humours cheerfull, and converſation moſt pleaſing, who make <hi>love</hi> to wits and ſpirits, as Bees to flowers; but have with the body no commerce at all? The Author of the <hi>Theater of Nature,</hi> holdeth, that the <hi>Baſilisk</hi> alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Serpents cannot be enchanted: and I dare really affirm, that there are Men who have the like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and have their eyes <hi>love proof,</hi> and their hearts ſhut up and defended as with a <hi>palizado</hi> againſt the piercing darts of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and the fiery aſſaults of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109924:63"/>
                  <hi>Idalian flame. Democritus</hi> made himſelf blinde volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, by ſtedfaſtly beholding the Sunbeams, to free himſelf from the charming beauties, and inticing opportunities of Women: And (ſeriouſly) I think he ſhut up two gates againſt <hi>Love,</hi> to open a thouſand to his imagination. For ſome affirm that this <hi>malady</hi> or <hi>Love melancholy,</hi> is cheriſhed by the preſence of the party <hi>affected:</hi> and that the contrary, to wit, <hi>abſence</hi> is the beſt <hi>remedy.</hi> And this they ſeem to prove by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling our <hi>paſſions</hi> with <hi>Ecchoes:</hi> (but <hi>omne ſimile non eſt idem,</hi> every like is not the ſame thing) For (ſay they) do you not ſee the <hi>Ecchoes,</hi> the further you go from them, the leſſe repercuſſion there is, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing and loſing themſelves in the aire; ſo the <hi>affection</hi> which is cauſed by the <hi>reflexion</hi> of the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> which you dayly behold with ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, will quickly vaniſh by a little ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>But may I be ſo bold as to whiſper my opinion in your ear, craving leave to inſiſt a little upon this; To prove that abſence doth more augment then decreaſe the heat of this <hi>paſſion.</hi> I will be brief.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe <hi>eyes</hi> may conceive and produce a <hi>green infant affection,</hi> but there muſt be ſomething more ſolid and ſubſtantial to make it grow unto perfection; and that muſt be by the knowledge of the <hi>vertues, merits,</hi> (as well as <hi>beauty)</hi> and a <hi>reciprocall affection</hi> of the party <hi>loved.</hi> Now this knowledge doth take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed its originall from the <hi>eyes,</hi> but it muſt be the <hi>ſoul</hi> which muſt afterwards bring it to the teſt of judgement, and by the teſtimonies both of the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears,</hi> and all other conſiderations concoct a verity, and ſo ground upon it. If this verity be to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, then it produceth ſuch thoughts, whoſe ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot be equalled by any other kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109924:64"/>
then the effects of the ſame thoughts. If it be advantagious to the party <hi>affected,</hi> then doubtleſſe it doth augment our <hi>affection;</hi> but yet with violence and inquietude; and therefore no queſtion but <hi>abſence</hi> doth augment <hi>love,</hi> ſo that it be not ſo long, as that the very image of the party <hi>loved</hi> be quite effaced; whether it be that an <hi>abſent Lover</hi> never repreſents unto his <hi>fancy</hi> but only the <hi>perfections</hi> of the perſon <hi>loved;</hi> or whether it be that the <hi>underſtanding</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wounded will not <hi>fancy</hi> any thing but what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; or whether it be that the very thought of ſuch things does add much unto the perfections of the party <hi>loved:</hi> yet this is infallibly true, that he does not <hi>truly love,</hi> whoſe <hi>affection</hi> does not augment in <hi>abſence</hi> from the party <hi>loved.</hi> For in <hi>abſence</hi> nothing can content the <hi>reall Lover;</hi> not ſweet harmony, not beautiful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, or Groves, not pleaſant Company, not eloquent tongues, not civill entertainment, but every ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is converted into ſowreneſſe, all ear-pleaſing harmony is turned into an obſtreperous jangling, and nothing can content but the wiſhed object, which being far diſtant from their <hi>enflamed deſires,</hi> do ingender a vehement grief in the <hi>heart,</hi> which cannot be expreſſed by them that prove it; much leſſe by my pen which is not acquainted with ſuch miſeries. Now it is objected, That <hi>abſence</hi> is the greateſt and moſt potent and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy that <hi>Love</hi> hath. But (with their favour) <hi>preſence</hi> without compariſon is much more, as we may dayly ſee by experience; for you may ſee a <hi>thouſand loves</hi> change in <hi>preſence</hi> for <hi>one</hi> in <hi>abſence;</hi> for in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> ſome <hi>imperfections</hi> may be found, which may cauſe a <hi>detestation,</hi> which <hi>abſence</hi> could never do; and to illuſtrate and confirm this by example. The excellent Philoſopher <hi>Raymund Lullius,</hi> was paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately enamoured of a Lady, wiſe, prudent and honeſt;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109924:64"/>
ſhe purpoſely to cure his frenzie, ſhewed him one of her breaſts eaten and knawed through with a Canker, and extremely hideous to behold, <hi>Stay ſimple Man</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>behold what you loved;</hi> he at that inſtant coming to himſelf uttered; <hi>Alas! was it for this I loſt ſo many good houres, that I burned, became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced, that I paſſed through fire and water?</hi> All <hi>Lovers</hi> would ſay the like if the ſcarffe were taken from their eyes. Conſider that if one abſent ceaſe from <hi>loving</hi> (which is very rare) its ceſſation is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence or noiſe of ſtrugling, and the change (through a long tract of time) is only becauſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is by degrees ſmothered with oblivion, as a fire is with its own aſhes. But when <hi>Love</hi> breaks off in <hi>preſence,</hi> it is never without a noiſe and extreme vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and (which is a ſtrange argument to prove my aſſertion) converts that <hi>love</hi> into a <hi>greater hatred</hi> then if <hi>love</hi> had never been: which proceeds from this reaſon; a <hi>Lover</hi> is always either <hi>loved</hi> or <hi>hated,</hi> or held in a degree of <hi>indifferency;</hi> if he be <hi>loved,</hi> as an abundance is apt to glut, ſo <hi>love</hi> being loadened in preſence with too many favours, growes weary. If he be <hi>hated,</hi> then he meets with ſo many demonſtrations of that <hi>hate</hi> every moment, as at length he is forced to eaſe himſelf. If he be in a degree of <hi>indifferency,</hi> and findes his <hi>love</hi> ſtill ſlighted, he will at length, if he be a Man of any courage, make a retreat and reſiſt the continual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts which are put upon him; whereas in <hi>abſence,</hi> all favours received, cannot by their abundance glut, ſince they do rather ſet an edge on <hi>deſire,</hi> And the knowledge of <hi>hatred</hi> entering into our <hi>ſouls</hi> only by the <hi>eare,</hi> the blow ſmarts not ſo much as that which is received by <hi>ſight;</hi> and likewiſe <hi>diſdain</hi> and <hi>ſlight</hi> be more tolerable in <hi>abſence,</hi> then <hi>preſence;</hi> doubtleſſe <hi>abſence</hi> is then more fit to preſerve <hi>affection,</hi> then <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:109924:65"/>
for there is a vaſt difference betwixt the <hi>love</hi> that is nouriſhed by the <hi>eyes,</hi> and a <hi>love</hi> that is nouriſhed by the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> As much as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is ſuperiour to the <hi>body,</hi> ſo much is the <hi>underſtanding</hi> to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>eyes.</hi> And <hi>abſence</hi> is ſo far from dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing <hi>love,</hi> that it augments and begets freſh and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent <hi>deſires</hi> to augment it; and the <hi>contemplation</hi> of a <hi>beauty,</hi> doth imprint it deeper in the <hi>fancy,</hi> then any <hi>eye</hi> can. Therefore (you <hi>Love ſimplicians)</hi> make a little reſiſtance, caſt away thoſe idle toyes that afflict you; let not <hi>abſence</hi> be ſo troubleſome, that you muſt torture your <hi>bodies,</hi> vilifie your <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and yeeld up your <hi>reputations</hi> as preyes to ſlander. If you know what you deſired, you would be aſhamed of your ſelves, you would be amazed that ſo <hi>noble ſpirits</hi> ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be tranſported with ſuch <hi>follies.</hi> Repreſent to your ſelves that a thouſand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted courages, have ſet themſelves free, at liberty, and enjoyed tranquillity of ſpirit; and you for want of a little reſolution, tumble and involve your ſelves faſter and faſter in theſe fetters. Will any man in his wits be thus deluded? can he be ſo ſilly as to conſume himſelf in ſeeking ſuch a toy? Do you call this <hi>Love,</hi> forſooth? may it not rather be called <hi>madneſſe</hi> and <hi>folly?</hi> What, languiſh in the lap of an ungratefull Miſtreſſe? fie, fie, it is an errour far unworthy of a man, that pretends unto any wiſdom or courage. Put a ſtop to your <hi>paſſions,</hi> and couragiouſly contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. You ſhall no ſooner have put the wedge of courage into the block, but it ſhall be done; you ſhall have your <hi>ſouls</hi> victoriouſly elevated over <hi>paſſion,</hi> which ſhall rejoyce amidſt the trophies thereof. Never ſtay upon thoughts and imaginations of <hi>love;</hi> but ſo ſoon as it preſents it ſelf, chaſe it away, and extinguiſh it in your hearts, no otherwiſe then you ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109924:65"/>
a hot Iron in a River. If it be in preſenim reſtrain your <hi>eyes,</hi> for they are the windowes, the allurements, the ſnares and the conducts of <hi>Love.</hi> It buddeth in the <hi>eyes,</hi> that it may at leaſure bloſſome in the <hi>heart;</hi> therefore divert your ſight from objects which dart a ſting into the <hi>minde</hi> apt to receive, and ſenſible of ſuch penetrations. Likewiſe leſt it get entrance at the <hi>ear,</hi> ſtop them againſt the inchanting melody of <hi>Sirens ſongs,</hi> and charming muſick of their tongues, never open them to be auditors of any laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſcourſe. But if you be already tainted with theſe charmes, unlooſe your ſelves, ſtoutly take your ſelves off, diſpute not any longer with your <hi>paſſions;</hi> flie from it, cut the Cable, weigh Anchor, ſpread ſails, ſet forward, go, flie, look not for any more letters, regard not their pictures, no longer preſerve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, let all your endevours be to preſerve your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I add one advice (which I think very eſſential) which is infinitely to fear a relapſe after health, and to avoid all objects that may re-inkindle the flame. For <hi>Love</hi> oftentimes reſembleth a Snake enchanted, caſt aſleep and ſmothered; which upon the firſt occaſion awaketh and becomes more ſtrong, and more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then ever. You muſt not only fortifie your <hi>bodies</hi> againſt it, but alſo your <hi>ſouls.</hi> But my diſcourſe like <hi>Nilus</hi> overflowes, it ſhall return within its banks; concluding with this, that <hi>Terreſtriall beauty</hi> is like a ſhadow, and therefore we are not to fix the <hi>eyes</hi> of our <hi>underſtanding</hi> upon it, but to turn them to that <hi>ſoveraign beauty</hi> which is permament and free from all <hi>change</hi> and <hi>paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will now indevour our ſelves to remove the cauſe of <hi>Money cauſing Love,</hi> which is meer Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (the root of all evill) and to ſatisfie their own voluptuouſneſſe, having their only delights upon earth;

who deſire not the <hi>woman</hi> but her <hi>riches</hi> to make his houſes the larger, to fill his cheſts fuller, being reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of a virtuous Woman, and the ſupreme good wherein all happineſſe conſiſteth. And this, he ſaith, is to raiſe a fortune for his (I ſay ſeldom thriving) poſterity; ſtudying how he may become an eternal affliction to himſelf. His <hi>minde</hi> is ſo fixed on <hi>money</hi> (not on the <hi>woman)</hi> as he findes no time to erect it to heaven. He employes ſo much time in getting and gathering of goods, as he reſerves no time for doing good. He runs on ſtill in deſire (not of his Miſtreſſe) labouring of a diſeaſe incurable till death cure him. He encreaſeth his cares with his ſubſtance, (not his <hi>love</hi> to his Wife) and the more he adds to his eſtate, the more he detracts from his content, and <hi>love</hi> towards her. But conſider (you <hi>Money-lovers)</hi> and ſeek for a remedy while it is to be had, leſt you repent your delay when 'tis too late) How ſecure was the Rich-man (as he thought) when he invited his wretched ſoul to take her reſt, having much goods laid up for many years! but this ſelf-ſecurity, was the occaſion of his ſucceeding miſery; for that night was his ſoul to be taken from him. O how terrible will the approach of death ſeem to you, being to be divided from the ſtaffe of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, from thence to deſcend without the leaſt hope of comfort to the land of forgetfulneſſe; for as the <hi>Scorpion</hi> hath in her the remedy of her own poyſon, a receipt for her own infection; ſo the evill and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous carry alwayes with them the puniſhment of their own wickedneſſe, the which doth never leave (ſo inceſſant is the torment of a guilty conſcience) to wound and afflict the <hi>minde,</hi> both ſleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: ſo as to what place he betakes him, he cannot ſo privily retire, but fear and horrour will awake him; nor flie ſo faſt, though he ſhould take the <hi>wings of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109924:67"/>
morning,</hi> but fury and vengeance will overtake him. Conſider this (I ſpeak to both ſexes) and let not <hi>money</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> be the ſole object of your <hi>love;</hi> but look at that which is far more noble, that which is more permanent, that <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> that chief good, which will direct you the way to all felicity.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed any further, we will (hoping ſuch variety will prove the more pleaſant) turn our diſcourſe a little in particular to the female ſex, ſuch whoſe kinde hearts, like wrought Wax, are apt to receive any <hi>amorous impreſſion.</hi> Therefore to you (loving ſouls) do I recommend theſe neceſſary cautions; which if carefully obſerved, will preſerve you from the <hi>cauſes</hi> and conſequently the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and may make you wiſer then you thought of; and to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of that, which before you had never minde of.</p>
               <p>The beſt preſervative and ſoveraigneſt receipt is, to fortifie the weakneſſe of your ſex with ſtrength of reſolution, for the imagination of <hi>Love</hi> is ſtrong, and works admirable effects on a willing ſubject. Give not power to an inſulting <hi>Lover</hi> to triumph over your weakneſs, or which is worſe, to work on the opportunity of your lightneſſe. Ram up thoſe portals which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you to your enemy, and prevent his entry by your vigilancy. Keep at home, and let neither you nor your thoughts ſtray abroad, leſt by gadding you incur <hi>Dinah's</hi> fate. Check your madding, and to Love inclining fancy, and if it uſe reſiſtance, curbe it with reſtraint; forbear to reſort to places of publick meeting, till you have drawn up and ſealed a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with your <hi>eyes,</hi> to ſee nothing that they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully covet. This will yeeld you more liberty then the whole worlds freedome can afford you. Be not too liberall in beſtowing your favours, nor too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109924:68"/>
in publick converſe. Preſume not too much on the ſtrength of a weak fort. Make a contract with your <hi>eyes,</hi> not to wander abroad, leſt they be catch'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home. Treat not of <hi>love</hi> too freely; be not too bold to play with the blinde boy; he hath a dangerous aime, though he hath no eyes; the Cat playes with the Mouſe, but at laſt bites off her head; the Flie playes with the Candle, till at laſt her light wings are ſind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Sport not with him, that will hurt you; play not with him, that would play on you; your ſports will turn to a bad jeaſt, when you are wounded in earneſt. If this wanton frenzie hath never ſurpriz'd you; prevent the means, and it will never invade you; be not ſuch foes to your ſelves as to purchaſe your own diſquiet. If <hi>Love</hi> iſſue out in too violent a ſtream, it is to be cooled by a temperate expoſtulation with <hi>fancy,</hi> or elſe fix your <hi>eyes</hi> upon ſome more attractive object; divert the courſe of that madding <hi>paſſion,</hi> as Phyſitians do to their patients who having a violent efflux of bloud in one place, cut a vein in another to turn the courſe of it another way. Expoſtulate with <hi>fancy</hi> (as <hi>Brathwaite</hi> adviſeth in his <hi>Engliſh Gent.)</hi> thus; <hi>How is it with me? me thinks it fares with me otherwiſe then it hath done formerly. A ſtrange diſtemper I finde in my minde; and might ſeem to reſemble Love, if I knew the nature of it. Love! can Virgin modeſty return that accent and not bluſh? yes, why not? If the object I affect he worth loving.</hi> (If the party <hi>affected</hi> have more <hi>virtues</hi> then <hi>money,</hi> and not more <hi>money</hi> then <hi>virtues) And if not, what then? Is not the Lover ever blinde in affection towards his beloved? He who may ſeem a</hi> Therſites <hi>to another, may be a</hi> Paris <hi>in mine eye. Yea, but a little advice would do well. Art thou perſwaded that this Non-parallel, thou thus affecteſt, hath dedicated his ſervice only to thee? that his affection is really to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109924:68"/>
thee? that his proteſts, though delivered by his mouth, are ingraven in his heart? yea, his proteſts have confirmed him mine. That hour is tedious wherein he ſees me not. His eye is ever fixed on me; his ſole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to me.</hi> Theſe I muſt confeſſe are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing arguments of <hi>Love;</hi> yet theſe may deceive you, and conſequently leave you in a miſerable error.

unlawful pleaſure; which obtained, they leave them to bewail their loſt honour. I exhort you to ſift him narrowly to ſee what bran there is in him, before you chuſe him. Taske him before you take him. As thus; Hath his fair carriage got him eſtimation where he lives? Hath he never enured his tongue to play the hypocrite with his heart? Hath he kept a fair quarter, and been ever tender of his untainted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Hath he never boaſted of young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens favors, nor run deſcant on their kindneſſe? Hath he ever ſince he vowed himſelf your ſervant, ſolely devoted himſelf yours, and not mixt his <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with forain <hi>beauties?</hi> If ſo, then chuſe him, he well deſerves your choiſe. Be like the <hi>Juniper tree,</hi> whoſe coal is the hotteſt, and whoſe ſhadow is the cooleſt; be hot in your <hi>affection,</hi> but cool in your <hi>paſſion.</hi> Set before your <hi>eyes</hi> the difference betwixt a <hi>wiſe</hi> and a <hi>wilde paſſion;</hi> the one ever <hi>deliberates</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <hi>love,</hi> and the other <hi>loves</hi> before it <hi>deliberate:</hi> therefore let your <hi>fancy</hi> be grounded with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you be a Maid, ever fear to become a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and caſt not the garland of your Virginity under the feet of Hogs. Give not a hair of your head to thoſe who promiſe you golden mountains, for ſuch will deceive you, and when they moſt deſire you in the queſt of marriage, then is the time you muſt leaſt be for marriage: for all you grant to their importunities, will be the ſubject of your diſgrace; and when they ſhall have marryed you, though you ſhould live as chaſt as <hi>Suſanna,</hi> they will be <hi>jealous,</hi> and continually imagine you will be liberal to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that whereof you were prodigal to them.

Account the reſolutions you make to this purpoſe, as treaſons, and think whatſoever ſhall to you ſuggeſt the ex cution of them, will poiſon you by the eare to murther your chaſtity.

                  <hi>Thebane Crates</hi> ſaith, there is no other remedy for <hi>Love</hi> then <hi>Time,</hi> and that muſt wear it out; if <hi>time</hi> will not, the laſt refuge (ſaith he) is an <hi>halter.</hi> And that's a ſpeedy and ſure remedy, very quick of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>But when all fails, apply that Cordiall ſalve to your corroding ſore made by <hi>loves</hi> wounding weapon, that excellent remedy, that ſoveraign balme, that univerſal medicine, which if ſeaſonably adminiſtred, will give you comfort when you are moſt diſtempered. The Recipe is, <hi>Divine Contemplation;</hi> for certainly thoſe ſpirits which are truly raiſed to the ſtudy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>divine things,</hi> and do well know the art of <hi>celeſtiall contemplation,</hi> are elevated above all <hi>terreſtrial pleaſures,</hi> in as much as <hi>eternity</hi> is above <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>infinite felicities</hi> above <hi>vanities.</hi> And not finding any thing on earth worthy our <hi>deſire,</hi> and to fix our <hi>affections</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let the object of our <hi>love</hi> and felicities be in the <hi>Empyreall heaven.</hi> And while we are in theſe <hi>divine extaſies,</hi> let our ſpirits be ſo ſtrong, as they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of our bodies; ſo heavenly, that they may eſteem the chiefeſt pleaſures of the body (as this of <hi>heroick love)</hi> but as dung and droſſe, nay worſe if worſe may be, in compariſon of thoſe <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>celeſtial pleaſures</hi> we enjoy in our <hi>ſouls.</hi> And in ſuch compariſon we may rejoyce more in contemning theſe <hi>corporeal delights,</hi> and being above them, then in the fruition of them. Therefore in ſtead of placing our <hi>affections</hi> on <hi>terrene objects,</hi> let us ſeek after that fountain and well-ſpring of all <hi>love, lovelineſſe, beauty, ſweetneſſe,</hi> and <hi>excellencies</hi> of the <hi>Creator;</hi> which is infinitely more permanent, and doth as much tranſcend all other <hi>beauties</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi> in the world, if they were all united in one: ſo that when a ſoul is poſſeſſed with the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God, it will have the eye of its imagination fixed

on him, often ſoaring and mounting up to heaven as its <hi>center,</hi> on the wings of <hi>contemplation;</hi> and a sa vapor exhaled by the <hi>Sun,</hi> often gliding after its <hi>love,</hi> being thereunto attracted by the allurements of his moſt <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, fair</hi> and <hi>divine luſtre</hi> and <hi>lovelineſſe;</hi> inſomuch as it will be enlightened with <hi>glorious Ideas, touring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, ardent affections,</hi> and <hi>celeſtial raptures.</hi> We will conclude with that Poetical and Divine ſtrain of the Nightingale of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>I Know I ſhall come under the laſh of a <hi>Satyrical dijudication,</hi> and be boy'd out of countenance, for preſuming to appear in this Subject, which would have become the neat flouriſhes of a more <hi>elegant pen.</hi> Therefore I will acknowledge that <hi>Philomus</hi> as one of my moſt energetical <hi>palizadoes,</hi> who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this <hi>Enchiridion</hi> againſt the malevolous aſperſions of the venemous tongues of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors, that will endevour to derogate its worth by calumny.
