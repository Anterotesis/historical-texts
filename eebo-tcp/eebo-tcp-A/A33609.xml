            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF Thou delighteſt in Timber-Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or haſt occaſion for Much; Thou haſt here a Line ſo Fit for thy Purpoſe, that thou canſt not imagine, much leſs, wiſh a better.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on Mr. <hi>Partridge</hi>'s Scale the Content is the Sixth Number, which is far more troubleſome then with Compaſſes. The

Alſo the Girt-Line being ſubdivided into Halfs and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Inches, renders this way more exact then any other way, by Decimal Diviſion.

            <p>THE double Scales Contrived by Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> are well known, and deſervedly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet in this Point of <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Meaſure,</hi> they are not ſo uſeful; The Meaſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re this way upon theſe Scales, being far more troubleſom and uncertain, then on the ſingle Line of Numbers with Compaſſes. Whereas the Line here treated of, is ſo eaſie, ſpeedy to work, exact, and alſo ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102751:5"/>
as that a better cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>The Line begins at 4, and is unequally divided to 40, each Diviſion ſubdivided into four, it repreſenting Inches, with their Halfes and Quarters, but Numbred thus, 4.5.6.7.8.9.1.2.3.4. Which 1.2. and 3. moſt commonly ſignifie 10.20. and 30. Though ſometimes, (when there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Meaſuring any thing ſo ſmall) they ſignifie themſelves only. At 12 let there be four Pricks in a <hi>Rhombus</hi> thus <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> As alſo there may be ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at 41.57, for an uſe hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. So that as far as 40 In<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hes; the Girts (by which name we call a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Circumference) are actually on the Line; Though beneath 4 Inches it is not accounted Timber. And if the Girt be above 40 Inches, yet ſhall it be exactly Meaſured by this Line. As alſo all Flat Timber, that is, ſuch as hath bredth and depth, may be ſpeedily Meaſured hereby, the Mean Proportional
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102751:5"/>
being found by the help of this Line more eaſily, then on the ſingle Line with Compaſſes. Herein it excelling any other Meaſure now in uſe.</p>
            <p>This Line divided, as hereafter is ſhewn, and thus Numbred, is to ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Line of Numbers in two Lengths, to which it is exactly equal, which as in other Meaſure is to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated as occaſion requires. Ordinarily 1.10.100. Sometimes, 10.100.1000. And ſometimes ·1 or 1/10 1.10. The firſt Eſtimate is always meant, if it be not otherwiſe limited. Theſe things Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I ſhall ſhew you the Uſe of this Line.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To Meaſure Round Timber.</head>
               <p>TO which purpoſe you may take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in Meaſuring the length of a Tree, they begin at the Ground-end, at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102751:6"/>
the ſecond Chip, and Meaſure to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in feet and half-feet, (for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any Buyer Meaſure in leſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, then half a foot in the length and content, nor leſs then a quarter of an inch in the Girt,) then back again half-way, where they take the Circumference with a Cord, and Meaſure a fourth Part thereof (having doubled it twice) in Inches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quarters of Inches. And this muſt be obſerved, that the length be g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven in Foot meaſure, and the Girt in Inch-meaſure, though it be one, two, three Foot, or more in length.</p>
               <p>This done, you have three Numbers given, <hi>viz.</hi> 12. which is always the firſt; then the length, which is the ſecond; and the Girt, the third; whereof 12 and the Girt are always on my Line (which I ſhall therefore hereafter call the Girt-Line,) the Length and Content on the Line of Numbers. But you may Note by the way, that though Timber is Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured uſually in feet and half-feet; And in Inches, halfes, and quarters of Inches;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102751:6"/>
and I never ſaw any Meaſured other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Yet any man may Meaſure in leſs Dimenſions if he pleaſe, or the Cuſtom be ſo. But always the Length in Foot-meaſure, and the Girt in Inch-Meaſure, as is before ſaid.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the Rule, ſet 12 on the Girt Line (marked as before) to the Length on the Line of Numbers; Againſt the Girt on the Girt-Line, you have the Content on the line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So that the lines being ſet to the length, you have at one View againſt any Girt his own Content at that length; As alſo, what is got or loſt by adding or abating a quarter, or half an Inch, which convenience no other Way of Meaſure affords.</p>
               <p>Now there being ſeveral Caſes in Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Meaſure, I ſhall ſet down the moſt ordinary, and give an Example of each, whereof this ſhall be the firſt.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the Rules.</head>
                  <p>Let them, as other double Rules, run between two Loupes, upon a Spline, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther planed ſo, or glewed into one, with a furrow in the other, and of one or two foot in length. If of one foot length, the Line of Numbers is ordinarily 11 inches preciſely, and on this we may meaſure to a foot as far as 200 foot. But if they be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102751:14"/>
2 foot long, far farther to half a foot, the Lines being near 23 inches.</p>
                  <p>As to that of a Foot my Advice is this.</p>
                  <p>Let the bredth of each be about ſix tenths of an inch, let both the Loupes be fixed to that which hath the Spline on it, ſo the other ſhall always run in one Loup, whitherway ſoever you move it. And on this Account I call one Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the other fixed.</p>
                  <p>On this Loup'd or Fixed Rule, let the Line of Numbers begin at the end next you, when it lieth toward your left hand, that this Girt-line may ſlide againſt it on the right hand.</p>
                  <p>To the outward Edge of this Loup'd Rule on this flat, let the Foot be divided into 100 parts.</p>
                  <p>In the other Flat, let the double Scale of Numbers be put on, but let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the other end, ſo ſhall the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rule be to your right hand, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102751:14"/>
the beginning of the Lines are toward you, which I hold convenient.</p>
                  <p>On this Flat to the left Hand, let the foot be into 12 inches; each into ten parts for Decimal Meaſure. So is it Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for any one that uſeth a Two-Foot Joynt-Rule beſides, to meaſure the Girt or any other meaſure.</p>
                  <p>But if any Gentleman or other pleaſe to have this Fitted for other Meaſures, it may be conveniently and eaſily done thus. Let the moveable or furrowed Rule be an inch longer then the other, that being drawn out to 2 Foot in length, it may be there Fixed by a ſmall Vice-Nail through the Loup, which is at the end of the ſingle line of Numbers, the Screw-Nut being let into the Rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Loup be fixed; it having alſo two Shouldrings, that the Loup being Fixed, it may alſo be immoveable. One Pin going through on one ſide the ſaid Screw-Nut, the other on the other.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102751:15"/>
Then there being room towards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the moveable Rule. Let there be put on the ſame Flat on which the Girt-line is, 12 inches, divided into Halfes, quarters and half-quarters, but Numbred from the Loup, 13, 14, 15, &amp;c. to 24. at the end.</p>
                  <p>On the other Flat of this moveable Rule, next the outward edge, let be 12 inches divided, as next before, into halfes quarters and half-quarters. But numbred from the ſaid end to the Loup, with 1.2. 3.4. &amp;c. to 12 at the Loup.</p>
                  <p>So any Girt or thing of one Foot or under, may be meaſured on this laſt. But if it be above, it may be meaſured on the other Flat, beginning at the empty Loup, and ſo toward the end of the moveable Rule.</p>
                  <p>Or it may be annexed to the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Two-Foot Joynt-Rule, having two Loups fixed to the immoveable Leg, the Spline being alſo glewed into the ſaid
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102751:15"/>
Leg, and the lines of Numbers, and this line put on in every reſpect, as before. But let the Inch-lines be put on thus.</p>
                  <p>On the Flat whereon the Girt-line is, let the inches be put on to the inner Edges of the Joynt-Rule, to begin at the double end with 1.2.3. and to 24. at the ſingle end, ſubdivided into halfes, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and half-quarters: On the other Flat let them be put on in the like manner, but to begin at the ſingle end. Alſo the Foot into 100 parts, and into 12 inches, each inch into 10 parts, maybe put on the ſingle Rule toward the outward Edges, one on one Flat, and one on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>There are two Properties which may be Noted on this Line, which (if there be no other uſe of them,) will try the truth of the Diviſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Set 10 on mine to 1 in the middle of the Line of Numbers, which muſt be reckoned 100. So ſhall every diviſion

               <head>A Diagonal Scale of <hi>100</hi> Parts in a quarter of an Inch.</head>
               <p>FINDING a Scale of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Wings</hi> Book of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying, made by Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> being above three inches broad, and having in 20 Chains, and the Diagonal 1760 Pricks; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it troubleſom to make, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Author <hi>J. W.</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hard Names as troubleſom to ſpeak; I here offer the ingenious Surveyour one in little more then half the Bredth, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102751:18"/>
long as he pleaſe, without one Prick, and but four ſhort Lines more than his of the ſame length, yet of as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and certain uſe as his or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Let the bredth of the Rule be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one inch and eight tenths and an half, or 1.85 inches. Let the length be as you pleaſe, divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to transverſe parallels equally, at a quarter of an inch diſtance for the Chain Lines. Setting of two tenths toward the left hand, for Figures for Numbring the Chains, draw the firſt long or Link-parallel, repreſenting 0, draw 20 long parallels more, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight Cents of an inch equal diſtance from this and one another, which ſhall be the Link-parallels.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe parallels that repreſent 5.10. and 15, <hi>viz.</hi> The 6th, 11th, and 16th from the Figures, or left hand edge of the Scale be only ſcratc'ht through the Chain-parallels, not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102751:18"/>
drawn clean through, except through the Diagonal Integer or quarter of inch, being the uppermoſt, where they muſt be drawn through.</p>
               <p>On the top of the Scale over the ſaid 5 and 15, ſtamp or cut a 5 over 10 a Cypher: as alſo put a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher between every ſcratch in the ſaid Link-line repreſenting 10. So will the Scale be divided as it were into two Scales, by the ſaid row of Cyphers.</p>
               <p>Figure the Chain-lines as in other Scales from the Diagonal Integer downward.</p>
               <p>Divide the uppermoſt Integer at each end into five equal parts exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Draw Diagonals from 0 on the Left hand to the firſt on the Right, and from the firſt on the Left to the ſecond on the Righr; and ſo on as in other Diagonal Scales.

                  <p>This you will finde after a very little practice to be no trouble, but very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and exact. And being in a ſmall Volume, it is not troubleſom.
