            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

According to my true duty, therefore, I publiſhed a ſhort and defenſive Reply to their long Anſwer; wherein, I hope the judicious will witneſſe, that the Truth ſuſtains no loſſe: Now, inraged with a moderate oppoſition, they heat their furnace ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times more, and break forth into a not more volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, then vehement Invective.

Divers of theſe words I confeſſe to have uſed, but to another purpoſe, upon a different ſubject; that which I ſpeak of the things, they unjuſtly take of the perſons: For example; I talk of falſe, and frivolous exceptions; They ſay, I call them falſe and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous men: I talk of vain cavills; They charge me to ſay, they are vain cavillers: I ſpeak of a riot of aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; They cry out, that I call them riotous men: I ſay, a ſuggeſtion is envious; They take it to themſelves: I call the Libellers, Factious perſons; They miſ-apply it, as ſpoken of them: I ſay an intimation is witleſſe and malicious; I am taken to ſay the men are ſo: And not to weary you with ſo odious a rabble, I ſay, this is weakly and abſurdly objected; They ſay, I call them weak and abſurd men. Thus, I could eaſily paſſe through the reſt; and ſhew you, that what I ſpeak by way of ſuppoſition, they take abſolutely; what I ſpeak as dehorting, they as accuſing; what of ſpeeches, they of perſons; what of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they of themſelves: And thus riſes the rare Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick which they have imputed to me; wherein I doubt not, but ye my Readers, will take occaſion to think, what fidelity ſhall we expect from theſe men, in citing other Authors, when they do ſo foully miſ-report the Book in our hand? They arenot then my flowers, but their own weeds, which they have thus bundled up together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But had I ſo far over-laſhed, as is pretended, your wiſdom, Readers, would ſend you to inquire of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: For ſurely, the occaſion may, if not juſtifie a mans act, yet abate his blame; When therefore ye ſhall look back, and ſee with what ſtrange inſolence I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by theſe undertakers, ye will be ſo far from
<pb facs="tcp:93954:5"/>
complaining of my ſharpneſſe, that ye will rather cenſure my patience;</hi>

               <hi>How blinde ſelf-love will make men in their own concernments? Theſe men will not ſee in themſelves that true guilt, which they unjuſtly cry out of, in another: So, I have heard a man with a very noyſome breath, cenſure the ill lungs of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; Let my Margin preſent thee, Reader, with but an handfull out of a full ſack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are their terms in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie firſt papers; without any pretence of imitation: But if we ſhould rake together the ſcornfull, girding and (as ſome of their betters have ſtyled them) unmannerly paſſages of this their angry vindication, it were enough to fill a Book alone. Readers, ye may, if you pleaſe, beleeve, how eaſie it were for me, to pay them home in their own coyn; But I had rather to conſider what is fit for me (how nameleſſe ſoever) to give, then what they are worthy to receive: Some others may perhaps be more ſenſible of this indignity then my ſelf; who have learned to think more meanly of my ſelf, then they can ſpeak; and at once both to pitie this petulancie, and diſ-regard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the third place they talk of daring proteſtations, and bold aſſeverations; and ſpend ſome inſtances of the particular expreſsions of my confidence. Do not think, Readers, that I will be beaten out with words; there is
<pb facs="tcp:93954:6"/>
no one line of thoſe paſſages, which they have recited, that I will not make good againſt all the clan of</hi> Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymnuus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither can I, out of this aſſurance, decline any Bar under Heaven, for the triall of my righteous cauſe; It is therefore an unreaſonably envious ſuggeſtion of theirs, that in dedicating my Book to His Sacred Majeſtie, I did, ever the more, flye from the judgement of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when in that very Epiſtle, I made confident mention of my ſecure reliance upon the noble juſtice of their Iudicature; Beſides, that it is not too wiſe, nor too loyall an intimation of theſe men, which would imply ſuch a diſtance betwixt Soveraign, and Parliamentary intereſt: For me, I would ever ſuppoſe ſuch an entire union betwixt them, as the head and the body; that they neither ſhould, nor can be ſevered in the rights of their ſeverall concernments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for that reſolute averment of the Author of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie by Divine Right, That he offers to forfeit his life to Iuſtice, and his reputation to ſhame, if any living man can ſhew any Lay-Presbyter (not as they pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the word, a Ruling Elder) in the world, till</hi> Farell <hi>and</hi> Viret <hi>firſt created him; Let me be his hoſtage; let my life go for his, if any one ſuch Lay-Presbyter can be produced. Let them ſearch Records, and try their skill; and when they have overcome, triumph. But in the mean time, they may not think to fob us off, with the colourable teſtimonies of B.</hi> Whitgift, King, Saravia, <hi>who were all well known to be juſt ſo good friends to Lay-Presbytery, as themſelves are to Epiſcopacie. For the reſt, If I have been ſomewhat bold with them, in telling them, right-down, of poor arguments, verball excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:93954:6"/>
meer declamations, ſhuffling of teſtimonies, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving illuſtrations, I may crave your pardon, Readers, but theirs I cannot; as not conſcious of any ill-placed word, in this eaſie Cenſure. Shortly, my much reverenced friend, learned</hi> Rivetus, <hi>will give them but a little thanks in miſ-applying his cenſure of Biſhop</hi> Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>to a man ſo differently tempered, whom he hath with particular reſpects vouchſafed to honor, and oblige.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the fourth place, they tell you, that after all theſe Thraſonicall boaſts of mine, if their whole Book were divided into four parts, there is one quarter, of which I make no mention: Wherein, Readers, I think verily you may beleeve them; For in the firſt leaf of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I fore-told you ſo much; as finding nothing in that ſwollen bulk, but a meer unſound Tympanie, inſtead of a truly ſolid conception; whereof you may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the one half (well neer) beſtowed either in meer verball quarrells, or in reall diſputes of things uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. I am more thrifty of my good hours, then to follow them in ſo wilde a chace: pitching, onely, upon thoſe points, which I conceived to be valuable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; wherein my profeſsion was, ſo to ſave time, as that I ſhould not loſe ought of truth: It is an injurious ſuggeſtion therefore, which theſe men make, that where their proofs are ſtrongeſt, there I have glided away without anſwer; ſince I can ſafely call God to witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoul, that I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any one conſiderable argument of theirs, that I have balked in my replicatory Defence: But if in their eſtimation, there be any ſuch, as wherin they have placed an over-weening confidence, let them not ſpare to re-inforce it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; that the world may witneſs their valour, and my cowardiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93954:7"/>
               <hi>What need is there of this, you will ſay, when they have already gloried in the victory; vaunting, that they have me,</hi> confitentem reum; <hi>and, in effect, the cauſe granted by me, in thoſe things which are moſt materiall? Were it ſo, Readers, as they pretend, that I come neerer to their Tenets, then ſome others; one would think they ſhould, in this, finde cauſe to acknowledge, and imbrace mine ingenuity, rather then to inſult upon me, as in way of diſgrace. I wis, it is not the force of their argutation, that could move me one foot forward; but if Gods bleſsing upon my free diſquiſition of truth, ſhould have ſo wrought upon my better-compoſed thoughts, as that I ſhould have yeelded to go ſome ſteps further then others, towards the meeting of peace, one would not think this ſhould yeeld any fit matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration; But, the truth is, I have not departed, one inch, from either my own Tenet, or from the received judgement of our Orthodox Divines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that they may ſee the fault is not in my levity, but in their own miſ-underſtanding; that Identity of the names and offices of Biſhops and Presbyters, in the beginning of the Apoſtles times, whereat they take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they may ſee averred, at large, in Epiſcopacie by Divine Right,</hi> 2. Part. §. 4. <hi>and, to ſecond it, they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Defence, p. 48.</note> 
               <hi>are challenged in my Defence, to name any one of our Writers, that hath not proclaimed this truth; Where then lyes the contradiction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The clear nominall diſtinction of the three Orders of Biſhops, Presbyters, Deacons, I profeſſed to prove onely out of the writings of thoſe, who were the next ſucceſſors to the Apoſtles; What is here of either yeeldance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? And if I have ingenuouſly granted, that
<pb facs="tcp:93954:7"/>
the Primitive Biſhops were elected by the Clergie, with the aſſent of the people; That Biſhops neither do, nor may challenge to themſelves ſuch a ſole intereſt in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or Iuriſdiction, as utterly to exclude Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from ſome participation in this charge, and Act; That they ought not to deveſt themſelves of their Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive power, by delegating it to others; That the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary managing of ſecular imployments is improper for them; If, in all theſe, I have gratified them, why do they complain? and if I have diſadvantaged my cauſe, why is it not urged to my conviction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is warily ſaid of theſe men, that I almoſt grant Lay-Elders in Antiquity; I do ſo almoſt grant them in my own ſenſe, that I utterly deny them in theirs: Why ſhould I make any doubt to yeeld unto the Iuſtice of their complaints, in the Poſt-ſcript againſt the inſolence, and tyrannie of Popiſh Prelates? What loſe we by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcent? Or how can they plead they are not juſtly taxed for diffuſing other mens crimes to the innocent, when their conſciences cannot but flye in their faces for this injuſtice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, I am charged with ſhamefull ſelf-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which ſurely muſt needs argue great raſhneſſe, or much weakneſſe of judgement. See the inſtances; In the ſame Epiſtle, I profeſſe not to tax their abilities, and yet call them impotent aſſailants: And why not both of theſe? He that taxeth not their abilities, doth not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently approve them; they may, perhaps, not want good abilities in themſelves, and yet be unable to prove their cauſe; they may be able men, and yet impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent matches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The contradiction they would raiſe in the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:93954:8"/>
Euangeliſts, is meerly cavillatory; May you be pleaſed to turn to the ninety fourth Page of my Defence, you ſhall clearly acknowledge it. The word in a common ſenſe, ſignifies any Preacher of the Goſpel; but in the peculiar ſenſe of the New Teſtament, it ſignifies ſome perſons extraordinarily gifted, and imployed; not ſetled in any one place, but ſent abroad by the Apoſtles on that bleſſed errand: Now, to ſay that any of theſe latter were ſuch as had ordinary places, and ordinary gifts, (as they do,</hi> Sect. 13. pag. 48.) <hi>I do justly blame as a meer fancie, not herein contradicting any thing, but their light imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the contradiction pretended to be, concerning the extent of Epiſcopacie, ſure they cannot but check them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; In my Remonſtrance and Defence, they report men to ſay ſomewhere (but, where, no man can tell) that Biſhops had been every where; and, that all Churches through the whole Chriſtian world, have uniformly, and conſtantly maintained Epiſcopacie; Elſwhere, that I ſay they were not every where, and that there are leſſe noble Churches that do not confer to Epiſcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Words are more eaſily accorded, then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; There are not, there have not been every where ſetled Chriſtian Churches; Where ever there have been ſetled Chriſtian Churches, there have been Biſhops; From the Apoſtles times to this preſent Age, there have been Biſhops in all Chriſtian Regions; now, ſome late Reformed Churches have been neceſsitated to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them; Where, I beſeech you, lies the contradiction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have often granted, that the name of Biſhops, and Presbyters was, at the first, promiſcuouſly uſed, and yet, I do no leſſe justly maintain, that for this ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:93954:8"/>
years, the name of Biſhops hath been ordinarily appropriated (in a contra-diſtinctive ſenſe) to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governors in an apparent ſuperiority. Diſtinguiſh times, and reconcile Hiſtories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The two next exceptions concerning Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Civill government, are fully cleared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in the due places of this inſuing Anſwer; I ſhall not blur paper in an unſeaſonable anticipating my own Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sole Ordination, and ſole Iuriſdiction, we ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, as that we hold the power of both, primarily in the Biſhop, the concurrent aſsistance in the Presbyters; What oppoſition is there in an orderly ſubordination?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt contradiction clearly reconciles it ſelf: In ſtating the queſtion concerning Epiſcopacie, I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Divine and Apoſtolicall Authority, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing, not to affirm that Biſhops were immediatly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt; and yet averring, that Chriſt laid the grounds of this imparity in his first agents; What diſcordance is in theſe two? Is the ground-work of an houſe, the whole frame of it? Can they finde the roof in the foundation? In the Epiſtles to the ſeven Aſian Churches, Chriſt (I truly ſay) acknowledges (at leaſt intimates) the Hierarchie of thoſe ſeven Angels: Do I imply that he did immediately ordain them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Readers, ye have ſeen the poor ſtuff of theſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected exceptions: Beleeve it, ſuch are all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions to me, as theſe contradictions which they finde in me, to my ſelf, groundleſſe, and worthleſſe: As I ſhall make good in this following Diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient, holy, and beneficiall uſe of ſet-Leiturgies
<pb facs="tcp:93954:9"/>
in the Church. This ſubject, becauſe, as it is untracked with any frequent pens of others, ſo it is that, wherein my Adverſaries ſeem moſt to pride themſelves, (as ſuppoſing to have in it the moſt probable advantages againſt me) I have ſomewhat largely handled, to your ample ſatisfaction. But, as for that other head of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie, which hath already filled ſo many rhemes of waſte-paper, for as much as I ſee they offer nothing, but that which hath paſſed an hundred ventilations, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat. I have reſolved to beſtow my time better, then in drawing this Sawe to and fro, to no purpoſe. Let them firſt give a full, and punctuall Anſwer to that, which hath been already, in an intire body of a Treatiſe, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning the Divine Right of Epiſcopacie; and then, let them expect, that I ſhould trouble my ſelf with ſweeping away theſe looſe ſcraps of their exceptions. Till then, let them, if they can, be ſilent, at leaſt I ſhall; as one that know how to give a better account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my precious hours.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſorry, Brethren, that your own importunitie will needs make you guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your further ſhame: Had you ſate down ſilent in the conſcience of a juſt reproof, your blame had been by this time dead, and forgotten; but now, your impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Defence ſhall let the world ſee, you did in vain hope to face out an ill cauſe with a ſeeming boldneſſe. I may not ſpend Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes upon you, but ſome Lines I muſt: enow to convince the Reader of the juſtice of my Charge, and the miſerable inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie

ciencie of your Vindication; It is not your ſtiff deniall that can make it other then Gods truth, which I maintain, or that can juſtifie your Errors; Let the cauſe ſpeak for it ſelf, and let that great Moderator of Heaven, to whom we both appeal, judge.</p>
               <p>It was a light touch, that I gave to your Grammaticall ſlip of <hi>Areopagi;</hi> wherein it would not have hurt you, to have confeſſed your over-ſight; had you yeelded that you ſtumbled, though withall you ſay, <hi>You ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled like Emperors,</hi> we could have paſſed it over with a ſmile; but now, that you will needs fall into a ſerious conteſtation, and ſpend almoſt a whole leaf in a faulty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; I muſt tell you, that you make this an hainous trifle: To face out wilfully the leaſt errour, is no leſſe then a crime; and ſuch is this of yours, as every true Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian knows: I doubt not, but you had heard of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita;</hi> but if you ſhould have cited him under the name of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagus,</hi> every Scholar would have laughed you to ſcorn: Had you ſaid, <hi>The admired ſons of Iuſtice, the Areopagus;</hi> I grant it had been good, according to that which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93954:10"/>
you cite out of <hi>Sarisburienſis;</hi> but to ſay, <hi>The admired ſons of Iuſtice, the Areopagi,</hi> no Grammar, no authoritie can bear you out; and however you face it, that you can bring precedents enow, out of approved Authors, name but one, and take all: That of <hi>Sarisburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis,</hi> which you alledge, is altogether for me, againſt your ſelves: he ſayes <hi>that Senate</hi>

Brethren, this matter of Latinity is but a ſtraw, but let me ſay, this willing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a plain falſhood, is a block, which your very friends cannot but ſtumble at; and how can the Reader chooſe but think, he that will wilfully ſtand in the defence of a known falſhood in Language, will not ſtick to defend a known Errour in his cauſe? Before, ye ſtumbled; now, ye fall: riſe up for ſhame in a juſt confeſsion, and look better to your feet hereafter.</p>
               <p>But belike, you have not a better facultie in ſtumbling, then I in leaping: and talk of huge great blocks that I have over-skipped in this whole Book: Where are they, which be they, Brethren? If ſuch were, they are, I

hope, ſtill viſible; ſhew them me, I beſeech you, that I may yet trie my skill: You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome words ſounding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; I thought what theſe blocks would prove: meer matter of words, not leſſe windy, then the froth of your next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph; wherein your gravitie is ſet upon a merrie pin; and, in a becoming jeer, tells us <hi>of the Gentleman ſtudent in Philoſophy, that deſires to learn the rare ſecret of the ſinking of froth;</hi> for which, I remit you, and your deep ſtudent, to the next Tapſter.</p>
               <p>IT is not all your ſhuffling that can ſhift <note place="margin">Parag. 2.</note> the juſt charge of your groſſe uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe; The Remonſtrance comparing in a generall notion, the forms of Civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eccleſiaſticall, expreſſes it in theſe Terms; [Since if Antiquitie may be the rule, the civill Polity hath ſometimes varied, the Sacred, never; And if originall authoritie may carry it, that came from arbitrarie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, this from men inſpired:] then which, no word can be in a right ſenſe more ſafe, or more innocent: Your good gloſſe appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 4.</note> what <hi>(in theſi)</hi> was ſpoken of all forms of

               <p>See, Reader, this latter is in the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants judgement, worthy of more then an eaſie cenſure, the others accuſation is no leſſe then deadly: Whether now doth hee hold leſſe culpable? Truly, brethren, if you be not aſhamed of this unjuſt crimination,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93954:12"/>
I hope ſome body will bluſh for you. With how bold a face dare you appeale to the Reader, yea to the moſt honourable Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the Sacred Majeſty of our Soveraigne, that you doe the man no wrong? Joyne iſſue then and let all theſe judge: Firſt you ſay, <hi>one of the moſt confident Advocates of Epiſcopacy, hath ſaid, that where a Nationall Church is ſetled in the orderly regiment of certaine grave Overſeers, to ſeeke to abandon this forme, and to bring in a forraine Diſcipline is as unreaſonable, as to caſt off the yoke of juſt and hereditary Monarchy, and to affect many-headed Soveraignty;</hi> This you think an aſſertion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent enough, that ſets the Mitre, as high as the Crowne; But what a foule injury is this? Reader doe but view the place, and ſee, where the Mitre ſtands: The words run thus: [So were it no leſſe <note place="margin">They cite it <hi>[No leſſe haynous]</hi> Theſe words <hi>[Ruling under one acknowledged Soveraigne]</hi> are purpoſely left out in their citation of them to make the propoſition odious: what fidelity there is in this, let the Reader judge.</note> unreaſonable where a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church is ſetled in the orderly regiment of certaine grave Overſeers, ruling under one acknowledged Soveraign, by wholſome and unqueſtionable Laws, and by theſe Laws puniſhable if they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſh:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93954:12"/>
&amp;c.] Say now, Reader, whether this man ſets the Mitre as high as the Crowne? Neither doth hee ſay, <hi>it were no leſſe haynous,</hi> (for the difference of the morality is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) but, <hi>no leſſe unreaſonable:</hi> as that which is there ſaid to argue a ſtrange brain-ſick giddineſſe in either offence.</p>
               <p>Yet more anger; The Remonſtrant riſes higher and ſets the Mitre above the Crown? Wherein, I beſeech you, brethren? What a <hi>Woolſeian</hi> inſolence were this? Hee tels us (you ſay) <hi>that Civill government came from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary impoſers, the Sacred from men inſpired; now Civill government here includes Monarchy; therefore this is to advance Epiſcopacy above Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; ſince the one challenges God for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the other humane arbitrement.</hi> Brethren, had your argument as much reaſon, as ſpight, it would preſſe ſore: now, as you have framed it, it is a meere cavill. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant ſpeaks of all Civill government in generall; the ſeverall formes whereof amongſt ſeverall nations, and people, no reaſonable man can deny were introduced variouſly, according to the firſt inſtitution of their Founders; What error can your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93954:13"/>
ſharpe eyes finde in this propoſition? Now, you will needs draw this by an envious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Monarchy, as if I meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it onely from men, not from God: Ye are miſtaken, brethren: they are your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friends, that thus deduce Monarchy; For us, wee hold it is from God, by men, from God as the author &amp; ordainer, by men, as the meanes; wee fetch it not from earth, but from heaven; wee know who ſaid, <hi>By me Kings raigne;</hi> and from him we derive their Crownes and Scepters: But yee may know (which we have oft bluſht, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee laid in our diſh, by Popiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) who it was that ſaid; Kings, Princes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors <note place="margin">

               <p>It is but a poor put-off, that you cenſure not my words as treaſonable, from my pen, which from yours had received no better conſtruction: The words are the ſame, the intimation evident; and not leſſe evincible, then your vilifying of the judgement of that wiſe, &amp; (above all examples) learned K. <hi>Iames;</hi> whom whiles you ſmooth in words, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſe in his well-grounded Edict, concerning the Liturgy of the Church, what do you but verbally praiſe, and really check? Ye cannot therefore ſo eaſily wipe off theſe aſperſions of uncharitableneſſe, by either ſtiffe deniall, or unjuſt recrimination; For me, ſuch is my malice towards you, that I can at once convince your want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and forgive it.</p>

It was their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery therefore, that made them inſolent, and their inſolence, that made them odious to Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hath been</hi> (ye ſay) <hi>the uſuall quality of former and later Biſhops, to tyrannize over ſuch as fear them, and to flatter ſuch as they fear:</hi> Your tongues are your own; But, Brethren, if this be their qualitie, it is your fault that you will not ſuffer it to be their propertie: There are thoſe that can do this, and more; can tyrannize over thoſe whom they ought to

               <p>As for your <hi>Pius;</hi> ſhould not the Pope have been my Antichriſt, I am ſure he is yours; Little reaſon therefore could you have, to uſe his teſtimonie againſt your own profeſsion. But, <hi>Why may we not</hi> (you ſay) <hi>uſe the teſtimony of Antichriſt, againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Biſhops?</hi> Brethren, I underſtand you not; I hope you have more grace, then to call ours ſo: If you have ſo much of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt in you, many good hearts will juſtly grieve to ſee that ye pretend to come forth under Licenſe; ſure you dare not mean, you dare not ſay, that the publique Government eſtabliſhed here by Law, is Antichriſtian; this were to ſtrike where you would not; or, if you could be ſo bold, Authoritie might over-ſee, but would never allow ſo lawleſſe an affront: If our Biſhops be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, whence is your Ordination?

               </p>
               <p>Full wittie, and ſound is the inference which you draw from the grounds, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93954:15"/>
I give of the Popes unwillingneſſe to yeeld a Divine Right to Biſhops; for that hee would have them derive their authoritie meerly from himſelf: Therefore (ſay you) it follows, <hi>That they have no more Divine Right, then the Pope:</hi> Juſt; for the Pope thinks ſo; pretending his own (falſe) Right, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming their true.</p>
               <p>But whats this (I ask) to our Biſhops, who profeſſe notwithſtanding the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, that is, Divine Right of their calling, to hold the places and exerciſe of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, wholly from His Majeſtie: You anſwer, <hi>[Surely ours have begun to affect the ſame exemption from ſecular power; to make large and haughty ſtrides, towards an independent Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.]</hi> Where, or wherein, Brethren? Will any Juſtice hold it enough to accuſe? I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge your inſtances, If you can finde an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall guiltineſſe this way, ſpare us not; I ſhall yeeld, we cannot ſuffer too much: But if your exceptions be either none, (as your ſilence argues) or particular, why ſhould not you ſmart for the unjuſt branding of a whole Order?</p>

Me thinks you ſhould ſhame and feare to ſpeake of our affected independence of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, when ye know that an independent parochiall Hierarchy (if it could be worth ſo high a name) is in publique Pamphlets, and open Sermons ſet a-foote with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe by thoſe, who would be thought no meane ones in your fraternity; And when you cannot but know, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Bench is openly challenged in the name of too much dependence upon Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty?

               <p>YE doubt to bee chid for this licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Parag. 4.</note> of your pen; and ſo you well may; for it can be no leſſe then a foule ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93954:16"/>
to charge that faction upon whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, which you dare (upon urging) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but to a few. <hi>The more</hi> (ye ſay) <hi>is your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that a few Biſhops can put both the Kingdomes into ſo dangerous a combuſtion.</hi> True; But, if it be your miſerie, it is not our ſinne; Blame the guilty, ſtrike not the innocent: But, <hi>if but a few can doe this</hi> (ye ſay) <hi>what a ſtir would they all make, if they ſhould unite their powers?</hi> This is in your owne phraſe <hi>argumentum galeatum;</hi> If a few factious Preachers in our neighbour Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, ſince the entring of this Parliament, have kindled ſuch a fire in the City, and Kingdome, what would they all do, if their ſeditious tongues were all united?</p>
               <p>But now, ye ſpeake to purpoſe; <hi>If but a few were factors for this attempt; how was it that one of the Epiſcopall tribe in open Court called the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh deſigne, Bellum Epiſcopale?</hi> Who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſmile at this doughty proofe? Why, Brethren, was that word too big for one mans mouth? Could hee not utter it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help of his fellowes? Did they either ſay, or think it, the more, becauſe hee ſpake it? What reaſon have you to feoffe a private
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93954:16"/>
conceit on all? eſpecally when the words may be capable of a leſſe evill conſtruction, as referring to the Northerne riſe of that quarrell, not to our proſecution.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>where</hi> (ye ſay) <hi>were the reſt of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and orthodoxe Biſhops the while?</hi> Truly in all likelyhood, at home, quietly, in their own Sees; in their retired ſtudies; without notice of any plots, without any intimation of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; much more without intermedling in any ſecrets of State, or cloſe ſtratagems of diſturbance; So as, it was not their love to peace and truth, that could oppoſe, what they never could reach to know: Neither is it any fault of theirs, that the deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious name of Epiſcopacie is expoſed to baſe and vulgar obloquie. Let thoſe who will needs poure contempt upon the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, looke for a juſt revenge from him, who hath ſaid, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Still therefore muſt I take leave to crie, Fie, upon thoſe my Brethren, that dare to charge faction upon Epiſcopacie, and withall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the unhappy miſ-cariages of any of our

               <p>Mark well, Readers, for certainly, in plain Engliſh, theſe men go about to mock you: The queſtion is of the preſent Leiturgie, which is pretended to vary extremely much from that in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies; Now come our braving Vindicators, and, after all their brags, labour to ſhew that this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Leiturgie differs from that in the daies of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt; and ſpend one whole

Do not the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forms of our publique Prayers in all Parochiall, and ſome Cathedrall Churches, in Chappels, in houſes, ſtand intirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe? Why do you therefore bring in theſe things, as eſſentiall to Leiturgie; In the meet omiſsion of ſome whereof, no doubt, ſome Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> (no leſſe zealouſly conſcionable, though better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, then your ſelves) may be found to conſpire with you: As for the nameleſſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, whom you cite, you muſt pardon me, if I did not underſtand either you, or him; for the words in your Defence, run, <hi>[That the Service of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not ſo dreſſed, that if a Pope ſhould come and ſee it, he would claim it as his own.]</hi> Now you report them to be, <hi>That the Service of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is now ſo dreſt, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as you cannot blame me if I knew not the meaning or the man; But by this your deſcription of his preaching it as

matter of humiliation to all the Biſhops of this Kingdome, in a day of ſolemne and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall faſting, I perceive it is the Reverend Biſhop of Carlile whom you thus cited, and whom you have, herein, not a little wronged; I acquainted that worthy Prelate with the paſſage, he diſavows the words, and defies the reporters, vehemently proteſting, that he never ſpake either thoſe words, or that ſenſe; and to make it good, delivered me the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended clauſe, tranſcribed out of his notes, with his owne hand; which I reſerve by me; no whit ſounding that way; but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying onely a vehement diſlike of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, as the turning the Table to an Altar, and the low crindging towards the Altar ſo erected; but, as for the Leiturgy or Service of the Church of England, not a touch of either in his thoughts, or tongue: Now brethren, learne you hence juſt matter of private humiliation, for ſo foule a ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a grave and religious Biſhop, and in him, of this whole Church.</p>

It is neither thank to your bounty, nor praiſe to your ingenuity, that the queſtion is halfe-granted by you; but an argument of your ſelf-contradiction; An order of Divine ſervice you yeeld, but not a forme; or a forme, but not preſcribed, not impoſed; and for this, you tell us a tale of <hi>Iuſtin Martyrs</hi> Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, and <hi>Tertullians</hi> Leiturgie, how much to the purpoſe, the ſequell ſhall ſhew.</p>

                  </gap> that the ſame form <note place="margin">Conc. Laod. c. 8.</note> or Liturgy of Prayers was to be uſed mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening; And <hi>Clemens</hi> (though not the true, yet ancient) tels us, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>You might then bee aſhamed to object want of fidelity to me in the citation of that teſtimony, which I but barely quoted in my margin. Neither can you avoid a ſelf-confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

in your owne proofes; There was no noiſe of the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie till the Nicene Councell; The Councell of Laodicea (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſet formes are notified) was before the Nicene by your owne account: Yea, but, ſay you, <hi>the hereſie of</hi> Arrius <hi>was not juſt borne at the period of the Nicene Councell;</hi> True; but was it borne ſo long before, as that any Councell tooke notice of it, before the Nicene? This you dare not affirme: But (for a ſecond ſhift) <hi>the hereſie of</hi> Arrius <hi>troubled the Church ſometime, before the name of</hi> Arrius <hi>was borrowed by it;</hi> Grant we (upon good authority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councels) that the ground of the curſed error of <hi>Arrius,</hi> concerning the Son of God, was laid before by others; what is that to the queſtion of ſet prayers? What is, if this be not a plaine ſhuffle? Neither is it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a meere ſlurre, wherewith you paſſe over the unanſwerable preſſure of the Laodicean Councell, before mentioned, by cavilling the difference betwixt <hi>preſcribing,</hi> and <hi>compoſing;</hi> the Councell is flat in both, and injoynes one and the ſame Liturgy of prayers: Certainly, brethren, you finde cold comfort at Laodicea; Let us ſee how you

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93954:25"/>
want of care, contrary to the faith.</p>
               <p>Say, Readers, is not this a likely teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to bee produced againſt ſet formes of Prayer? What is it then that you would hence inferre? Firſt, <hi>that this being</hi> (Anno 416.) <hi>is the firſt mention of prayers to be approved or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a Synod, and the reſtrayning to the uſe of them:</hi> Grant that it were ſo, of prayers to bee ratified, or reſtrained, Is it ſo of prayers to be uſed? Are you not ſufficiently convinced herein, by the Synod of Laodicea? It is the occaſion that draws on the Law; till now, this preſumption of obtruding private mens prayers upon the publique uſe of the Church, was not heard of in thoſe parts; now only was it ſeaſonable for correction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſay the reſtriction was not ſuch but that it admitted a toleration of prayers, framed by prudent Divines; no leſſe, then thoſe which were approved by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; What gaine you by that? when theſe prayers were ſaid, and not conceived; and ſo ſaid, that they were put into formes, not left to arbitrary delivery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the occaſion of this reſtriction (being the prevention of errours in praying)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93954:25"/>
is ſo univerſall both for time and place, that it may well argue this practiſe to be moſt ancient for the originall, and worthy to be perpetuall for the continuance.

               <p>TO prove that the Jews had a form of <note place="margin">Parag. 5.</note> Liturgy even from <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a monument above the reach of your either knowledge, or cenſure; a Samaritan Chronicle, now in the hands of our moſt learned and famous Primate of Ireland; written in Arabick, tranſlated into that

Thus he. This is our evidence; now let us ſee your ſhifts: Firſt, you tel us, <hi>Thoſe were onely Divine hymns, wherein there was alwayes ſomething of Prayer.</hi> If but thus,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93954:28"/>
wee have what wee would; for what are prayſes, but one kind of prayers; And what can be more ſaid for a ſet forme of hymns, then of petitions? But, brethren, yee might have ſeene in the Authors owne words, (which you are loath to ſee) Songs and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which were ever uſed before their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and were compriſed in that ancient Service-book: See now Reader, whether there bee not ſomething for ſet Prayers in the Authors own words, which theſe men would wittingly out-face, and not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee.</p>
               <p>The Teſtimony cannot be eluded, now it muſt be diſparaged; <hi>[Ioſeph Scaliger had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly but two Samaritan Chronicles]</hi> Who ſaies he had more? I cited but one, what needed you (but to ſhew the world you can tell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) to talk of two? What buſineſſe have we with that ſhorter Chronicle, which you will needs draw into mention? Let that bee as fond, as your exception is unſeaſonable; What is that to us?

poore oſtentation; ſpeake to the purpoſe; What can you ſay againſt that large Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Chronicle, which I produced, turned out of Hebrew into Arabick, written in a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Character, and now not a little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the great, and eminently judicious Primate, in whoſe Library it is? Surely, as I have heard ſome bold pleaders; when they have feared a ſtrong teſtimony, pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels at the face of the witneſſe; ſo doe you, brethren, in this caſe. <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelfe you ſay (the former owner) <hi>paſſes this cenſure upon it, that though it have many things worthy of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet they are cruſted over with Samaritan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</hi> Who can expect other but that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan ſhould ſpeak like himſelfe, when it comes to a difference in Religion? but this is no reaſon, why in matters accorded, there ſhould bee any diſtruſt: What a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writes of the holy Trinity paſſeth for no leſſe currant then the beſt of our owne; If <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> lived and died a Separatiſt, yet we dare beleeve him in his report of Jewiſh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, no leſſe then <hi>Broughton, Weems, Druſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> So as this winde ſhakes not the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93954:29"/>
But, judge (you ſay) how much credit we are to give to this book for Antiquitie, as far as <hi>Moſes,</hi> which makes no mention of their own originall, any other wayes, then, <hi>That they came out of Egypt by Moſes;</hi> A poor and groundleſſe exception: for that which wee alledge this Author for, is onely the report of a booke containing the formes of prayers uſed by the Jewes ſince <hi>Moſes;</hi> and as for the mention of their owne Originall, it was their glory to fetch themſelves from the firſt Jewiſh Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks, (as the Samaritan Woman did at <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well) neither would they challenge a lower riſe; no marvell therefore if they paſſed in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Hiſtorie of the defection of the ten Tribes; as rather tending to their owne ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; eſpecially conſidering, what <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports of their faſhion, <hi>That ever when the Jewes proſpered, they claimed brotherhood of them; when contrarily, they proclaimed hoſtility;</hi> And what if this Author doth onely touch the names of <hi>Sampſon, Samuel, David,</hi> what doth this detract from the credit and validity of his hiſtorie? So as notwithſtanding your frivolous cavils, we will take leave to make ſo much of our Samaritan Cronicle, as to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93954:30"/>
avow it for a noble and ancient proofe of that my confident aſſertion of the uſe of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies ſince <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOur pretended proofe to the contrary, which you ſo gloriouſly bring out of <note place="margin">Parag. 6.</note> your famous Rabbi <hi>Moſes Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>Miſhneh,</hi> will prove but a vain flouriſh; &amp; if it worke any thing, it will be for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For what is it that hee ſayes? <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>an affirmative precept, that prayers ſhould be made to God, every day, &amp;c.</hi> Caeterùm neque numerus, &amp;c. <hi>But neither the number of thoſe prayers, nor the obligation to this, or that prayer, nor the certaine, and definite time of prayer, is injoyned in the Law:</hi> Thus he. Now, how doth that concerne us? Who ever defended, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Letter of the Law, had given order for either number, or time, or obligation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prayers of ſeverall Iſraelites? although, under your good favour, we know that even then there were ſolemne formes of words, to bee uſed in the remove and reſting of the Arke; and in the ſolemne benedictions of Iſrael, and in the trialls of Jelouſie, preſcribed <note place="margin">Num. 10. 35, 36. Num. 6. 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> by God himſelfe to the Prieſts; whereof
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93954:30"/>
what can yee make other, then a ſhorter kind of ſtinted Liturgie? Length, or brevitie makes no variance. But what doth this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply other, then that there were of old, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions both of number, and time, and formes, though not expreſſed in the Law? particulars whereof we ſhall produce in the ſequell; ſuch as were not onely for the helpe of the ignorant, but for the direction of the Prieſts themſelves, and for the better devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people. That <hi>Ezra</hi> therefore and the men of the great Synagogue, made uſe of thoſe eighteene formes of prayers, or benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, preſcribed by them ſo long agoe, it argues nothing, that the like formes were not in ſet practiſe before their times; ſo as your <hi>Maimonides</hi> (after all your proritation) holds no other then faire termes with our Samaritan Chronicle.</p>
               <p>And would learned <hi>Capellus</hi> (thinke you) make himſelfe ſo merrie at the view of this paſſage? ſurely, brethren, it would be at your fond and ridiculous miſ-priſon, in playing not upon my words, but your owne idle fancy.</p>
               <p>I cited <hi>Capellus</hi> for the formes of prayer <note place="margin">Capell. ſpicil. in Act. 2.</note>

uſed at the <hi>Minchah,</hi> and other Sacrifices, which you cannot gain-ſay, but that I ſhould inferre from him, <hi>that the Jewiſh Liturgies were as ancient as Moſes;</hi> it is your meere dreame, not my aſſertion: It would become you to make more conſcience of your ſuggeſtions. As for the marginall note out of <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> it is worthy of but a marginall touch; What ſuch abuſe were it to ſay, that <hi>Maimonides</hi> tooke thoſe thirteene Articles of his Creed, from the Jewes devotion; when the ſame Author confeſſes they had a being before; but were by <hi>Rabbi Moſes Bar Maimon</hi> redacted into this Order, wherein they ſtand? Surely, that ever ſince <hi>Ezra's</hi> time they had a known forme of prayer, is confeſſed clearely by the ſame <hi>Rabbin,</hi> in his <hi>Miſnah,</hi> as we have formerly ſeene; and, what place could bee more proper for the ſeat of a Creed? But, to meet a little with your crowing inſultation, in this paſſage of the age of the Jewiſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, what ſay you to that expreſſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> (a man, one of the beſt <note place="margin">P.

               <p>Beſides this, there was a ſet forme (and that ſomewhat large) of prayer and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which the Maſter of the Familie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jewes, was privately wont to uſe in his holy feaſts; which the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor elſewhere in his Chaldee Paraphraſe, upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. fully expreſſes; adding withall, (which you were pleaſed to make ſport with, as mine) <hi>Veriſimile eſt Chriſtum quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

               <p>If the quarrels that you pickt with the both Originall and Confirmation of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie prove unjuſt, you may well allow me to call your arguing about it, no other then wrangling. For the Originall, I deduced it from ancient models, not Roman, but Chriſtian; you except at the termes of <hi>pretended oppoſition,</hi> and ſtill could fetch <hi>ſparkes</hi> to fling in the face of him, who by the ſuffrages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Divines hath ſhewed the juſt ſenſe of the true viſibilitie of the Roman Church. Truly, brethren, this is meerely to bark where you have no power at all to bite. What faculty you have in flinging ſparkes I know not, but I am ſure, if you blow this coale hard, the ſparkes will flie in your eyes. The queſtion is ſo throughly ſetled by thoſe (which you ſpitefully call begged) ſuffrages, that no wit of man can finde but a probable colour to revive it.</p>
               <p>Faine would you have ſomething to ſay to Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> if ye knew what it were; In his book of <hi>the old Religion,</hi> he cites a ſpeech of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> that this good friend of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaies, <hi>Under
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93954:35"/>
the Papacie is true Chriſtianitie, yea the very kernell of Chriſtianitie:</hi> What of this? Did Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> faine that <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid ſo? Or doe theſe men feare that <hi>Luther</hi> is turn'd Papiſt? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this (you ſay) with that the Biſhop of Salisburie ſaith, in his begged ſuffrage, who thus, ſpeakes; <hi>That the Church of Rome is no more a true Church, then an arrant whore is a true wife to her husband.</hi> Well: Compare <hi>Luther</hi> with the Biſhop of Salisburie; two worthy Divines, what then? They will, I hope, prove good friends, and Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> with them both; whoſe owne ſuffrage hath bin, and is no leſſe peremptorie againſt Rome, then this which he begged; <hi>A married woman, though ſhe be a cloſe harlot, is yet a wife; and though ſhe be not true to her husbands bed, yet ſhe is truely his wife, till ſhee belegally divorced:</hi> Such is the ſtate of the Roman Church, to Doctor <hi>Davenant,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> and all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines. Where now is your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in raiſing ſuch groundleſſe intimations againſt your innocent brethren?

It was truly told you, that <hi>if you intended onely a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſome inconvenient expreſsions, no doubt it would bee conſidered of, by wiſer heads then your owne;</hi> whereby I meant, that honourable and reverend <hi>Committee,</hi> to which this great care was, by publick aſſent, referred; you ſtraight

Will thoſe ſolid judgements bee likely to be ſwayed by colours? Why do you caſt that aſperſion upon them, to whom yee ſay you have preſented theſe conſiderations; and to whoſe grave wiſdoms we do no leſſe humbly ſubmit? That God, who ſits in the aſſemblie of the Judges of the earth, will, we hope, ſo guide the hearts of thoſe great, and prudent <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> that they ſhall determine what may conduce moſt to peace, and godly uniformitie.

THe alteration of the Liturgie ſent into <note place="margin">Paragr. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> is a buſineſſe utterly unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us: whatever unhappy hands were in it, would God they had beene prevented by ſome ſeaſonable Gout, or Palſie; in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the alteration made of the Liturgie in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, I feare, you doe not well agree either with truth or with your ſelves, if we compare this paſſage with your firſt entry into this large Section; let the ſcanning of it be left to the Readers better leiſure: as not worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard our way. Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> (whom you are pleaſed ſeriouſly to honour with the titles of my <hi>Ironie)</hi> hath made good amends, belike, for the praiſe he gave to our Liturgie which he helped to compoſe, in his cenſure of a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Licence,</hi> and the Prieſtly robes; the one whereof (you ſay) hee called <hi>the marke of the Beaſt,</hi> the other <hi>a Fooles coat:</hi> But, what if <hi>the ſtrange variety of Popiſh veſtments,</hi> ſeemed to that holy Martyr, <hi>ridiculous?</hi> What if <hi>to take a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to preach from the hands of a Popiſh Biſhop,</hi> ſeemed to him no better then to receive <hi>the marke of a Beaſt?</hi> what is that to us? what to the cauſe? Were theſe tenets erroneous, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93954:38"/>
this ſufficient to enervate his teſtimonie, for the allowance of that <hi>Letanie,</hi> which he made his laſt prayer at his parting with his deare conſort? And for the free uſe whereof he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that God to whom hee was ſending up his ſoule? Were it a good ground of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he, who once erres, can never ſay true? But, for this cenſure of the good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, let thoſe that feele the ſmart of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</p>
               <p>Let us deſcend (ſince you will have it ſo) to the re-examination of thoſe <hi>your reaſons, which enforce your deſired alteration:</hi> Firſt, <hi>it ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeth with the Popiſh Maſſe:</hi> I ſay, neither as <hi>Maſſe,</hi> nor as <hi>Popiſh:</hi> you diſprove me in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither indeed can doe. Could you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, This prayer is Superſtitious, that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, this Hereticall, that Erroneous, you might have juſt reaſon to except at any touch of our <hi>ſymbolizing</hi> with them; But, if the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be good, and holy, why ſhould I more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, as comming from a <hi>Papiſts</hi> mouth, then I would make uſe of a vicious prayer comming from the beſt Proteſtant? Where I ſaid, <hi>If the Divell confeſſe Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, ſhall I diſclaime the truth, becauſe it paſſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93954:38"/>
through a damned mouth?</hi> You anſwer, <hi>But you know Sir, that Chriſt would not receive ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion from the Divels mouth, nor</hi> Paul <hi>neither, Act.</hi> 16. True, in reſpect of the <hi>perſon confeſsing,</hi> not of the <hi>truth confeſſed:</hi> As it came from an evill ſpirit, our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to refuſe it; but neither of them would diſclaime the <hi>matter</hi> of that truth, which was ſo averred. There is great difference betwixt the words of <hi>a foule ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>a faulty man;</hi> but if you will needs make a parallel, it muſt be <hi>perſonall:</hi> Chriſt would not allow a <hi>Divell</hi> to confeſſe him; we will not allow a <hi>Popiſh ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer</hi> to uſurpe our good prayers; but if my Saviour would not diſ-allow that I ſhould make uſe of the good Confeſsion of an evill ſpirit, much leſſe would hee diſlike that I ſhould make uſe of that good prayer, which was once the expreſsion of an evill man: And yet theſe were not ſuch, being taken from the compoſures of holy men, and ill places; ſo as this is no other, then to take up gold miſ-laid in a channell, which could not impure it: you may well aske why it was laid there; you have no reaſon to aske why a wiſe man ſhould take it up: Your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93954:39"/>
queſtion therefore; <hi>What need wee go to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Portuiſe for a prayer, when wee can have one more free from jealouſies in another place;</hi> might have been moved to thoſe Worthies, which gathered this pile of devotion, who would eaſily have anſwered you, that <hi>your jealouſie is cauſeleſſe, whiles the prayers themſelves are past ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;</hi> but can with no colour of reaſon bee charged upon us, who take holy prayers from good hands, not needing to enquire whence they had them.</p>
               <p>YOur ſecond reaſon is as forceleſſe, as your firſt. <hi>Our Liturgie was compoſed</hi> (you <note place="margin">Paragr. 11.</note> ſay) <hi>into this forme on purpoſe to bring the Papiſt to our Churches; that failing, there is no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.</hi> The argument failes in every part: Firſt, our Liturgie was thus compoſed on purpoſe, that all Chriſtians might have a form of holy devotion, wherein they might ſafely, and comfortably joyne together, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately, in an acceptable ſervice to their God; and this end, I am ſure, failes not in reſpect of the <hi>intention of the compoſers,</hi> however it ſpeed in the <hi>practiſe of the uſers of it.</hi> Secondly, there is no reaſon that where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93954:39"/>
the <hi>iſſue</hi> of things faileth, the good <hi>intention</hi> of the agent ſhould bee held fruſtrate, or his act void: Our end in preaching the Goſpel, is, to win ſoules to God; if we prevaile not, ſhall we ſurceaſe, and condemne our errand as vaine? But here, I ſay, the project ſped; for till the eleventh yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was no Recuſant. You tell me, <hi>It was not the converting power of the Liturgie, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining power of the Law, that effected this:</hi> But, brethren, what <hi>conſtraining power</hi> was of any uſe, where there was no Recuſant? Every conſtraint implies a reluctation, here was none: If then our Liturgie had no power of converting to our Churches, yet it had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of averting from them. What the Popes negotiations were with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> at this time, imports nothing; I am ſure I have thoſe Manuſcript Deciſions of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſh Caſuiſts, which firſt determined it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to joyne with our aſſemblies; till which our Liturgie had ſo good effect, that thoſe, who differed from us in opinion, were not ſeparated in our devotion. But how am I miſtaken? That which I boaſted of, as the praiſe, is objected to mee as the reproach of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93954:40"/>
our divine ſervice. <hi>What credit is this to our Church</hi> (you ſay) <hi>to have ſuch a forme of publicke worſhip, as Papists may, without offence, joyne with us in,</hi> &amp;c. Or, <hi>How ſhall that reclaime an erring ſoule that brings their bodies to Church, and leaves their hearts ſtill in errour?</hi> I beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what thinke you of the <hi>Lords Prayer?</hi> Is that a perfect platforme of our devotion, or is it not? Tell me then, what Chriſtian is there in the world, of what nation, language, ſect ſoever, (except the Separatiſt onely) will refuſe to joyne with their fellow Chriſtians in that forme of prayer? And, <hi>What credit is it to our Chriſtian profeſsion to have ſuch a forme of publicke prayer, as Papiſts, Grecians, Moſcovites, Armenians, Jacobites, Abaſsines, may, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, joyne with us in?</hi> I had thought you would have looked for the reclamation of erring ſoules by the power of preaching? Here is no unteaching or confutation of errors, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of either <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Uſes</hi> in the formes of our prayers: And if I ſhould aske you how many you have reclaimed by your <hi>conceived prayers,</hi> you would not, I feare, need to ſpend too much breath in the anſwer.</p>
               <p>When I therefore impute the rare gaine of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93954:40"/>
ſoules to the want or weakneſſe in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you think to choak me by an exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the fault of your Governors: Let the Biſhops ſee how they will cleare their ſoules of this ſinne, who, having the ſole power of admitting Miniſters into the Church, have admitted ſo many weake ones, and have rejected ſo many faithfull, able Preachers, for not conforming to their beggerly rudiments:</hi> Let thoſe whoſe guiltineſſe findes themſelves galled with this crimination, flie out in an angry an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but if there be thoſe, who have beene conſcionably carefull not to admit them that are not competently <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not to eject any peaceable, and conſcionable Divine, for meere matter of ceremonie, how injuriouſly have you faſtened upon them other mens delinquences? although it is not unpoſsible, that men may be able Preachers, and yet tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent; and there may bee ceremoniall rites, neither <hi>theirs,</hi> nor <hi>beggerly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are deceived, brethren, it is not our Liturgie that hath loſt any; too many have loſt themſelves by a miſ-taught prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Liturgie: as for the miſ-catholick part, tell me, I pray you, whether is it more likely that a ſtaggering Papiſt will rather
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93954:41"/>
joyne with a Church that uſeth a Liturgie, or one that hath none? With a Church that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſome of their wholeſome prayers, or that which rejects and defies all, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo holy, becauſe theirs? And for our own, ſurely, if our acute Jeſuits had no keener ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, then this you bring, we ſhould be in ſmall feare to loſe Proſelytes; For what weake Proteſtant could not eaſily replie, <hi>The Church of Rome was ancient, but yours is new; that was orthodox, this falſe: The ſervice was not yours, but borrowed and uſurped from better hands; we make uſe of it (as wee may) in the right of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, not in any relation to you, and your errours?</hi> So much for you and your Jeſuit in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon.</p>
               <p>YOur third Reaſon is grounded upon ſtumbling blocks, it is no marvell if it <note place="margin">Paragr. 12.</note> fall: <hi>Thoſe,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are laid by the Liturgie;</hi> and I ſay, removed by many: So yee know they are by <hi>Hooker, Abbot, Hutton, Morton, Burges, Covell,</hi> and I know not how many others; amongſt the reſt I ſtumbled upon a blinde man, whoſe inward ſight abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplyed the want of his bodily eyes; who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93954:41"/>
hath in many of thoſe points given, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, very cleare ſatisfaction; but ſure you could not ſuppoſe me ſo weak, as to imagine that his lack of eyes could exempt him from errour; although divers of your exceptions are (if they were worth our inſiſting upon) more groundleſſe then his tenets; But whiles I allowed many of his paſſages, I never meant to juſtifie all: It is far from mee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or patronize other mens Paradoxes. We know the old diſtinction of <hi>Scandals, taken,</hi> and <hi>given;</hi> if there be any danger of the latter, it is (I ſay) under carefull hands to remove it; and, however it pleaſes you to fall into cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick compariſons, perhaps thoſe hands which you ſleight, may not bee the leaſt active.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, which is the <hi>Idolizing of the Liturgie,</hi> I ſay truly, Separatiſts abhorre it for ſuch; never true Proteſtant adored it for ſuch. Show us the man that <hi>ever worſhipt the Service-booke,</hi> that wee may wonder at that uncouth Idolatrie: Show us the man that holds it <hi>the onely worſhip of God</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as you unjuſtly pretend.</p>
               <p>I tell you of ſome others that ſtick not to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93954:42"/>
ſay, <hi>Too many doe injuriouſly make an Idol of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:</hi> (Why ſhould you hope I am not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in affirming ſo undoubted a truth?) yet we may not thinke of abandoning it: Even, in coole bloud the argument holds firme, without equalizing one with the other. Some have made an Idol of their ſilver and gold, muſt I therefore caſt away this metall? You needed not feare that I would ſpeake ought to the derogation from my owne profeſsion; But if I compare Gods ordinance of <hi>prayer,</hi> with his ordinance of <hi>preaching,</hi> and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall <hi>Liturgie,</hi> with that individuall <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> I hope there is no danger in that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>TO the fifth, <hi>The great diſtaſte which theſe publick prayers meet withall, is truly lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Paragr. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and the effect of that diſtaſte, ſeparation:</hi> yet more? Let thoſe miſ-zealous men who have infuſed theſe thoughts into well-meaning ſoules ſee how they will anſwer it in that great day, to the Judge of the quick and dead; ſurely, if the caſe were mine, I ſhould feare it would fall heavie upon my ſoule; for, if it be granted, that there are divers paſſages in our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93954:42"/>
Liturgie faulty, and worthy of correction, yet no wiſe enemie can ſay, they are ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that they barre all Communion: Did they containe hereſie, or blaſphemie, wee could but ſeparate from their uſe; now, their ſeparation can no more be without our pitie, then without their owne ſinne: Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hence inferred, that <hi>the partition wall of our offenſive Liturgie ſhould bee removed, becauſe ſome</hi> brain-ſick <hi>men</hi> (for that title is here mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your owne, not mine) <hi>are ſcandalized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> will no leſſe hold, if this our Liturgie were either altered, or aboliſhed: for, are there not thouſands that profeſſe to bee no leſſe ſcandalized with any ſet formes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? So then, if wee have any preſcribed, or ſtinted devotions at all, the partition wall ſtands ſtill; and if that ſhould be demoliſhed, how many more, and more conſiderable thouſands doe ye thinke, would be ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the want of thoſe holy formes, whereto they have beene ſo long, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficially inured? Here is therefore a ſcandall on both parts, vnavoidable; and it will bee our wiſedome and pietie, to fall upon the leaſt. You ſay, <hi>ye thinke, nay, you know that ſome

few Prelates, by their over-rigorous preſsing of the Service-booke, and Ceremonies, have made more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, then all the Preachers diſ-affected to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in England:</hi> I examine not the truth of your confident aſſertion; but will you to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>occaſions:</hi> The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of thoſe few Prelates might be the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> but the miſ-perſwaſions of thoſe diſ-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Preachers were the <hi>cauſes</hi> of this wofull ſeparation: Both might unhappily concurre to this miſchiefe; but thoſe more, who are the direct and immediate agents in ſo bad a ſervice.</p>
               <p>YOur laſt Reaſon is ſo ſleightly enforced, <note place="margin">Paragr. 14.</note> that it merits rather pitie then refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I doe juſtly averre that, <hi>There is no reaſon why difference in Liturgies ſhould breed diſ-union betweene Churches; or why union in religion ſhould binde us to the ſame Liturgies;</hi> diſtinguiſhing (as I ought) betwixt <hi>Eſſentiall points,</hi> and <hi>mere outward Formalities.</hi> How faintly you reply, that, <hi>[It is true, every difference in Liturgies doth not neceſsitate a diſ-union of Churches: But here the difference is too large to be covered with a few fig-leaves!]</hi> Grant it to be larger then it is; is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93954:43"/>
it yet <hi>Eſſentiall?</hi> The queſtion is not, what may <hi>cover our differences,</hi> but what may <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite our Churches?</hi> It is not formes of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, but matter of obſtinate and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall error, that can draw on ſuch an effect: Tell not me therfore, or your Reader, of ſome Ceremonies of ours, that will not downe with other reformed Churches; when yee may, as good cheape, heare of ſome faſhions of theirs, which will not downe with us: It is good reaſon, that as we give, ſo we ſhould take liberty in things indifferent; without any reciprocall diſlike. As for precedency of time in our Liturgie, and of dignity in our Church, they may well have this operation with us, that our Liturgie could not conform to that which had no being; and that other Churches ſhould rather conforme to ours, which was ever noted for more noble, and eminent. You deſire not to <hi>eclipſe</hi> the glory of this Church, as you profeſſe; yet you are willing to <hi>over-ſhadow</hi> it ſomewhat darkely; whiles you can ſay, <hi>Our firſt reformation was onely in Doctrine, theirs in Doctrine and Diſcipline too:</hi> wherein you are double-faultie; firſt, in imputing a defect to our Church, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93954:44"/>
in the extent of our Reformation. What? Was there no Reformation but in matter of <hi>Doctrine?</hi> None in matter of Practiſe? None in Idolatrous or Superſtitious rites? None in offenſive Cuſtomes? None in corruption of Government? None in lawes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call? What call you eclipſing, if this be none? Secondly, in imputing that to the reformed Churches as their perfection, which is, indeed, their unwilling, and forced defect: Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion implies the renuing of a forme that once was; now, ſhow us, if you can, where ever in the world, that form of Diſcipline (whoſe erection you applaud to ſome neighbour Churches) found place, before it was in this laſt age proviſionally taken up, by thoſe, who could not bee allowed, with the libertie of true religion, to injoy their former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? As for the compariſon you are pleaſed to mention, betwixt the Liturgies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and thoſe of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Grecians, Armenians, &amp;c. wherein you ſay, <hi>If you ſhould ſet downe what you have read in the Liturgies of thoſe Churches, you beleeve the Remonſtrant would bluſh for intimating, there is as much reaſon to conforme to their Liturgies, as thoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93954:44"/>
of the reformed Churches:</hi> I muſt tell you, it is of your owne making, neither did ever fall from my pen; I doe bluſh indeed, but it is to ſee your bold miſ-takings, and confident obtruſions of things never ſpoken, never meant: I doe not mention a conformitie to their Liturgies, as equally good; but onely aske, <hi>Why wee ſhould be tied to the formes of one Church, more then another,</hi> as thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire within our ſelves, and equally free from obligations to any; ſo as you ſhut up your firſt <hi>quaere</hi> with a mere cavill, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereby you indevoured to back it, are utterly reaſonleſſe.</p>
               <p>YOur ſecond <hi>quaere</hi> is to ſeek of ſo much <note place="margin">Paragr. 15.</note> as any good pretence of reaſon, yea of ſound authoritie; <hi>Whether the firſt reformers of Religion did ever intend the uſe of a Liturgie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to be an help in the want, and to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Miniſters?</hi> For firſt, have they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſed their whole and ſole intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or have they not? If not, how come you to know what they never expreſſed? If they have, why have you ſuppreſſed it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is obvious to every common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93954:45"/>
that there were other reaſons beſides this, of framing ſet formes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgies; as, <hi>The uniformitie of Divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in every nationall Church, the opportunitie of the better joyning together of all hearts in common devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the better convenience of fixing the thoughts upon the matter of a fore-knowne expreſsion:</hi> So as this, which you have ſo groundleſly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, cannot be imagined to be the onely reaſon of preſcribed Liturgies. Tell me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, what thinke you of our Saviours Epitome of a Liturgie, the Lords Prayer? for certainly it was no other; a forme of prayer injoyned by divine authoritie: Was that <hi>onely</hi> intended to be an helpe in the <hi>want,</hi> and to the <hi>weakeneſſe</hi> of the Miniſters? Was it not preſcribed for the help of the devotion of all diſciples? Your inſtances are (if it might be) poorer then your aſſertion. The 23. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> ordaines, <hi>Ut nemo Patrem nominet pro Filio, &amp;c.</hi> In a care to prevent the dangerous miſ-priſons of ſome ignorant Prieſts in <hi>Africk,</hi> in miſ-naming the ſacred perſons in the Trinitie, it charged them not to miſ-apply the termes; <hi>Therefore all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed formes of prayer are onely intended to ſupply
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93954:45"/>
wants, or weakneſſes, of Miniſters:</hi> A ſtout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and irreſiſtible. The compoſers of the Liturgie for the <hi>French</hi> Church at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> tell us, <hi>Hae formulae inſerviunt tantùm rudioribus; nullius libertati praeſcribitur: Theſe formes ſerve onely for the ignorant ſort; not preſcribing to any mans libertie.</hi> What meane you, brethren, to urge ſo improbable a proof? Firſt this was but a particular congregation, and therefore of no uſe or validity for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the whole Church: Secondly, theſe prayers, which they ſet forth, were onely for the private uſe of Chriſtians; for I hope you will not imagine, that when they ſay <hi>[rudiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tantum inſerviunt, they ſerve onely for the more rude and ignorant ſort of people,]</hi> that they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in meant to point out the Miniſters; ſo as your very allegation confutes your ſelves, and ſeconds me. Your following inforcement in this Paragraph failes of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> much more of <hi>reaſon;</hi> and doth but <hi>begge</hi> what it cannot <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> You tell mee of thouſands, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to worſhip God with devout hearts, that cannot bee eaſily perſwaded that theſe ſet formes, (though never ſo free from juſt exception) will prove
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93954:46"/>
ſo great an helpe to their devotion; I tell you of many more thouſands then they, and no leſſe devoutly affected, that bleſſe God to have found this happy, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effect, in the fore-ſet prayers of the Church. Neither doth this plead at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the uſe of preſent conception, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in praying, or preaching; or derogate any thing from that reverent and pious eſteeme of conceived prayer, which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly profeſſed: Surely, I doe from my ſould honour both; I gladly make uſe of both, and praiſe God for them as the gracious exerciſes of Chriſtian pietie, and the effectuall furtherances of ſalvation: there is place enough for them both; they neede not juſtle each other: And, if experience had not made good this truth of mine to many, the moſt eminent Divines of theſe later times (eminent, I meane, not more for learning, then ſtrict pietie) why would they in their prayers, both after, and eſpecially before their Sermons, have confined themſelves to a ſet forme of their own making, without the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of any one clauſe, as I can abundantly inſtance? Certainly, they wanted not that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93954:46"/>
of either ſpirit, or tongue which is challenged by meaner perſons, but did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely hold themſelves to the uſuall concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherewith their thoughts, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eares were beſt acquainted.</p>
               <p>As for the difference which is pretended in the uſe of Liturgies in other reformed Churches, which you ſay doe <hi>uſe</hi> Liturgies, but doe not <hi>binde</hi> their Miniſters to the uſe of them, it will prove no better then a mere Logomachie. In this point, if wee bee underſtood, wee ſhall not differ: If, as you explicate your ſelves in the ſequele, out of the Canons and Rubrick both of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Genevian</hi> Churches, you meane onely, that the Miniſters were not ſo tyed up to thoſe preſcribed formes, that they might not at ſome times, and upon ſome occaſions, make uſe of their owne conceptions, you have herein no adverſary: Doubtleſſe, all Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have ever had that liberty in all the Churches that have profeſſed the name of Chriſt; neither ought it, neither can it bee denyed to any, either of theirs, or ours: All allegations to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93954:47"/>
this ſenſe, might well have beene ſpared; wee ſhall willingly concurre with you, both in opinion, and practiſe: But, if by this <hi>[not binding to the uſe of a Liturgie]</hi> you underſtand either an arbitrary power not in uſe in any Liturgie at all, or an abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from any whatſoever uſage of their publickly-preſcribed formes, and a wilfull rejection of them, as either unfit or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, becauſe ſet and ſtinted; none of your cited Authorities, no practiſe of any well governed Church will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo ſtrange a Paradoxe: In this <hi>Calvin</hi> fights directly againſt you, whiles hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Ut certa illa extet, à quâ pastoribus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcedere</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Calvin Epiſt. <hi>to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, &amp;c.</hi> prius citat.</note> 
                  <hi>non liceat: That there ſhould bee a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme, from which it may not bee lawfull for Ministers to depart:</hi> The contradiction whereunto, alledged out of your nameleſſe Liturgie, of <hi>Formulae pro arbitrio,</hi> I leave to your owne reconciling.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, though they have more ſuperfluitie then want, yet why they ſhould bee excluded out of the Liſt of the Reformed, I know no reaſon; ſince, if all Proteſtant Churches (which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93954:47"/>
is the uſuall contradiſtinction from Popiſh) come under that ſtile, theſe are wont to challenge the deepeſt ſhare in that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Neither is it out of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to the Churches reformed (as your charity would faine ſuggeſt) that I ſay, <hi>they are but a poore handfull in compariſon of the world of Chriſtians abroad;</hi> (I have ever honoured them, no leſſe then your ſelves) but in regard of the paucitie of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours; Their value is no whit the leſſe, becauſe their number is ſo. One ſparke of a Diamond may bee worth large piles of Marble: But I might well argue, that in a point; wherein no judicious man can place an errour, there can bee no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that wee ſhould abandon the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved practiſe of all the Chriſtian Churches upon earth, for the late inſtitution of a few: If herein I miſ-judge, I am willing to bee convinced.</p>
               <p>THe Rubrick of King <hi>Edward the ſixth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Paragr. 16.</note> agreeing with the liberty given by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ordinances, at this day, of omitting
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93954:48"/>
(upon ſome great occaſions) part of the Liturgie injoyned, makes nothing for the proofe of the propoſition, ſuppoſed in your <hi>Quaere, [That the Reformers of Religion did never intend the uſe of a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, further, then to bee an helpe in the want, or to the weakeneſſe of a Minister:]</hi> It will be an hard taske to make theſe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then inconſequent: You tell mee of the practiſe of ſome ſtiffe Ordinaries, that have denyed this liberty; and plead, that what ſome Ordinaries have volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily yeelded, you cannot be blamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as a favour from the high Court of Parliament: It is not for mee to returne the anſwer of my Superiours; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but put you in minde, that there is a vaſt difference betwixt an act of <hi>occaſionall indulgence,</hi> and a <hi>conſtant claime;</hi> betwixt a <hi>particular diſpenſation,</hi> and an <hi>univerſall rule:</hi> Further then this, I preſcribe not, but obey. However the ſtate of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Liturgies bee much different, theſe latter having been, even from the Primitive times, preſcribed to the common uſage of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93954:48"/>
Church, which the former offers not to challenge; yet I granted, that, <hi>If wee did utterly abridge all Miniſters of the publicke uſe of any conceived prayer, on what occaſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the argument might hold force againſt us.</hi> You tell mee of ſome men that have ſacrilegiouſly done ſo: I ſend you to thoſe <hi>ſome men</hi> for your anſwer: <hi>The commands and practiſes of the Church of England are within the taske of my Defence:</hi> Let private men ſpeake for themſelves. From the <hi>Deske</hi> you leape into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and tell us, that <hi>your argument is as ſtrong againſt limiting in Prayer, as limiting in Preaching;</hi> wherein you are unwilling to know, that our Church allowes equall freedome in both; Who that hath ſate within the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Pulpits, can but ſay, that our Miniſters doe there ordinarily pray, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they preach? I pray God they may doe it holily and diſcreetly in both: Whiles they are allowed this freedome in their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> what inconvenience can it be to be limited to ſolemne, publick (but ſacred) formes in their <hi>Deske?</hi> We allow both, you would rob us of one, where is the ſacriledge?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93954:49"/>
So then, in all this eager paſſage, your Reader ſees what fearefull venies you give to your owne ſhadow; for certainly, you have here no viſibly reall adverſary: if by a ſet Liturgie wee went about to infringe all liberty of conceived prayer, you might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome ground of a quarrell; but when wee allow, and commend, and practiſe both, in their due places, where can you faſten?</p>
               <p>THe reaſon is lamentable which you urge in the fifth place, that <hi>many denie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Paragr. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>their preſence at our Church-meeting, in regard of thoſe impoſed prayers;</hi> Our eyes can witneſſe (not without teares) the too much truth of this ſad aſſertion; wee have ſeene, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied to ſee many poore miſ-guided Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, waiting abroad in the Church-yards, for the good houre; who, ſo ſoone as ever the long expected Pſalme calls in to the enſuing Sermon, have throng'd into the Congregation, as now onely worthy of their preſence; Alas poore ſoules, were their knowledge (which they over-weene) but equall to their zeale, they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93954:49"/>
would ſee, and hate their own miſ-judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In the meane time (ſhift it how you pleaſe) woe, woe be to thoſe teachers that have miſ-led well-meaning people, to this dangerous, and ungodly prejudice: It had beene better for them never to have beene borne, then to have lived to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſo pernicious a Schiſme in the Church of God. I have no reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you, whom I know not; although I muſt tell you, your cold put-off doth little leſſe then accuſe your ſelves: <hi>For your parts, you ſay, you profeſſe that you are not againſt a free uſe of a Liturgie;</hi> Wee thanke you for this favour; what is this but to ſay, <hi>If a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie be not left free, wee profeſſe our ſelves to bee againſt it, wee animate all others in that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are yet more courteous, and tell us, <hi>Yee doe not count a Liturgie a ſufficient ground of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church:</hi> Marke, Reader, there is fraud in the words; they ſay, <hi>they doe not count a Liturgie a ſufficient ground of ſeparation;</hi> they doe not ſay, <hi>this Liturgie:</hi> ſuch a Liturgie as they could deviſe, and upon ſuch termes, might perhaps bee no ſufficient ground of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93954:50"/>
a ſeparation; but <hi>this Liturgie</hi> of our Church, as it now ſtands, they doe not undertake for. Speake out, brethren, and doe not ſmother your thoughts; declare freely to your Auditors, whether the Liturgie eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this Church, be ſuch, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ought to joyne; and whether that come within Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule of <hi>non-ſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendas Eccleſias:</hi> were you leſſe reſerved, the Church would perhaps be more happy.</p>
               <p>The Remonſtrants <hi>Dilemma</hi> may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture come too late, when you have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled the minds of ignorant men with ſtrong reſolutions againſt all impoſed Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, but eſpecially our owne: Now, you can confidently ſay, <hi>[The perſons concerned will denie, that either the Liturgie is good; or lawfully impoſed, if it were good;]</hi> and here (for ought I ſee) they and you are reſolved to reſt: in vaine ſhall we go about to make good the Premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whiles you have taught them to hold faſt the Concluſion: Diſputes will not do it; you have found a way that will worke the feate: <hi>By looſing the bond of impoſition, and taking away the cauſe of diſputes, and troubles of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand conſciences.</hi> Why now, Brethren, I like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93954:50"/>
you well; plaine-dealing is a jewell: The way not to be troubled with Liturgies, is to have no Liturgies at all; and the way to have no uſe of Liturgies at all, is not to injoyne them: as if you ſaid, <hi>The way to looſe the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian knot, is to cut it in pieces; the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger of violating Lawes, is to let them looſe, or make them arbitrary; the way to remedie the diſcontent of Popiſh Recuſants, is to retract the Oath; the way not to be barred by the gate, is to throw open the hedge:</hi> Truely, brethren, if this bee the onely meanes of redreſſe, you have reduced us unto a good condition; it is the eſtabliſhed, and (as hath hitherto beene thought) the wholeſome Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that this (and this onely) Liturgie ſhould be uſed, and frequented by Miniſters, and people; and this hath hitherto been obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently, and peaceably obſerved: now, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome new exotick ſcruples, good people are taught to place pietie in the diſobedience of thoſe acknowledged Lawes, and nothing will quiet their <hi>many thouſand conſciences,</hi> but an abrogation of the good Lawes they were wont to live under. What muſt the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader needs think of this? The Law is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93954:51"/>
the ſame it was, under which our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fore-fathers went happily to heaven; the change is in us. Oh miſerable men, whom ſome few tempeſtuous blaſts from <hi>New-England,</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> have thus tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about, and made inſenſible of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bleſsings!</p>
               <p>Meane while, that which pincheth you in my Reply, you are willing to paſſe over in ſilence. Were the impoſition amiſſe, what were this to the people? The impoſition (if faulty) is upon the Miniſter; how can that more concerne the people, then their joyning with him in an uſuall prayer, (whereto hee ties himſelfe) of his owne making? If the caſe bee equall, why doe you not labour to convince your people of ſo unjuſt a partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and to reclaime them from ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an errour? the end whereof (without a ſpeedy remedy) can bee no other then that I have moſt unwillingly fore-ſpoken, perfect difformity and confuſion.</p>
               <p>I May not omit to proclaime to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Paragr. 18.</note> your eminent charity to me, of whom you ſay, <hi>Yea, ſo reſolute he is not to yeeld to a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93954:51"/>
in what is eſtabliſhed, &amp;c. that wee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee by his anſwer, that had the reading of Homilies beene as ſtrictly enjoyned as the Booke of Common Prayer, the ablest Miniſter in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (were the Law in the Remonſtrants hands,) muſt be held as ſtrictly to them, as to this.</hi> How now, Brethren? What, in ſo angry a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence? On what ground, I beſeech you? The Remonſtrant is well knowne to have beene as diligent a Preacher as any in your Alphabet; and to bee ſtill (as not yet defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in that dutie, ſo) as great an incourager of Preaching as the beſt of your Patrons; why will yee thus unjuſtly raiſe ſo envious a ſuggeſtion againſt him? <hi>[Hee is ſoreſolute not to yeeld a liberty;]</hi> Alas, what power hath hee, to either yeeld, or denie a libertie, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth (as hee ought) nothing but humble obedience? But when a queſtion is ſtated concerning the injunction, or freedome of a Liturgie, you may be pleaſed to give mee leave to defend that part which my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (and I thinke upon ſure grounds) dictates to me for a certaine truth: <hi>Non eadem ſentire bonis, &amp;c.</hi> had wont to bee a received
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93954:52"/>
rule; but, as to this challenge it ſelfe, might the Readers leiſure ſerve him to caſt back his eye upon this paſſage of my Defence, he ſhall no leſſe marvell at the injuſtice, then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe of it: Hee ſhall there ſee with what inoffenſive caution I marſhall <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and <hi>Liturgie</hi> in the ſame ranke; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our obedience the rule of the uſe of both, as that I profeſſe a juſt liberty yeelded in both; ſhowing, that <hi>if Homilies were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be read, and yet a free uſe of Preaching al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, there were no more cauſe to refuſe them, then we have now to refuſe the Liturgie, having withall a freedome to our conceived Prayers:</hi> In which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I would faine ſee what malice it ſelfe can finde to carpe at.</p>
               <p>AS for that ſtrange project of yours, <hi>of</hi>

either the Cardinall came into the line, or the Noble Peere into the margin, he were wiſe that could tell. What was profeſſed in the hearing of ſome of you, and ſome of your Superiours, of a willing condeſcent to part with that which is indifferent to themſelves, if they might bee informed it is offenſive to others, muſt be ſuppoſed to import, as a true information, ſo, a juſt offence; wherein they ſhould bee ſure of the concurrence of ſome whom you are pleaſed to cenſure, as leſſe mercifull; then whom, none can bee more ready to make good that of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their hand for the removing of cuſtomes truely burdenſome to the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus you have very poorly vindicated the firſt part of your Anſwer concerning <hi>Liturgie,</hi> having made good nothing which you have undertaken, diſproved nothing which I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and if (as you profeſſe) your deſire was a ſincere purſuit of truth, you are the more to be pitied, that you miſſed it; it is not yet too late for you to recover it; bee but ingenuous, in confeſsing what you cannot but ſee, and wee cannot differ: And if you doe heartily

joyne with me in lamenting the breaches, and miſerable diſtractions of the Church, why ſhould you not joyne with me in the effectuall indeavours to make them up? Why do you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your hands to widen that, which your tongues would ſeeme to cloſe? If peace bee the thing you deſire, who is it that hath broken it? Wee are where we were; the change is on your parts: and if there have beene ſome particular incroachments, and innovations in ſome few hands; what is that to the whole Church of <hi>England?</hi> what is that to thoſe, whoſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings have beene ſquare and innocent? Wee hope then that the Worthies of that High Court, the great Patrons of peace and truth, will ſoone ſee, and ſeriouſly conſider where the grief of the Church lyes, and by their wiſdoms put a ſeaſonable end to theſe miſerable, and dangerous diſtempers.</p>

whoſe ſake, I ſhall cut you up ſhort; making it apparent, that my affection to my cauſe, (however you are pleaſed to ſcandalize my diſcourſe) hath no whit tranſported me to any over-reaching expreſsions, in lifting up the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> and extolling the <hi>univerſality</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopall government</hi> beyond truth.

               <p>What I ſaid, concerning the derivation of <hi>Epiſcopall government</hi> from the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, without the contradiction of any one Congregation in the Chriſtian world, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make good againſt all your frivolous cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; Purpoſely to lay the ground of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, you interſert, <hi>Dioceſan;</hi> which came not within the termes of my propoſition; and to confute your owne addition, tell us how late <hi>Dioceſes</hi> came into the Church, and now will needs inforce me to maintaine what your ſo

What can you make of theſe Allegations? There is no one line in them, which I am not ready to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; what one word is here liable to exception? Will it follow from hence, that I affirme <hi>Biſhops to have beene alwayes every where?</hi> You ſee firſt it is limited to the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> not the Pagan, and in that, not to every Parochiall Church, but a <hi>nationall;</hi> and not to every nationall Church, which is <hi>in fieri,</hi> and <hi>inchoatè;</hi> (ſuch as that of <hi>Scotland</hi> in thoſe firſt times was) but a <hi>ſetled Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church;</hi> and to make yet more ſure, leſt

any ſchiſmaticall company might put in for a ſhare, it is ſuper-added, <hi>a well-allowed, ſetled, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church.</hi> I ſhould have acknowledged you brave vindicators, indeed, if now, in the height of your learned valour, you could have choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me with direct and particular inſtances of any <hi>well-allowed, ſetled, national Churches in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> before this preſent age, that were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe governed.</p>
               <p>IN ſtead of this you tell me a tale of a ſorry <note place="margin">Para. 2.</note> quarrell taken up againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona</hi> by ſome barbarous <hi>Biſcainers;</hi> whoſe rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when I proved to you by their Savage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to their King, you give a very civill and charitable conſtruction of my Marginall, as intimating it no leſſe crime to offer an affront to a Prelate, then to a King; Thus love creepes where it cannot goe. But to mend the matter, you inſtance in the Reformed Churches; they have made contradiction to Epiſcopal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; True, but not till this preſent age; That period was ſet before in my aſſertion, whence now ariſes your ſuddaine paſſion; <hi>Sir bethinke you, take up your Remonſtrance, reade your own words, mark the Parentheſis:</hi> Sir, I have done all this,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93954:56"/>
and wonder what it is that you would have me to ſee, or to ſay? The words are plaine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either welt, or gard; ſay what you would inferre upon them. <hi>The limitation of time here</hi> (you ſay) <hi>hath reference to the continuance of Epiſcopacy, not the contradiction of Epiſcopacy;</hi> Certainly, in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Readers eye, to both: neither doth the verie ſcope of the place evince any leſſe; for could you ſuppoſe any man ſo utterly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate, as to ſay; <hi>By the joynt confeſsion of Reformed Divines, the Reformed Churches of this age have never contradicted Epiſcopacy?</hi> This were indeed a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox fit for none but a <hi>ſelf-confounded</hi> man: faſten it upon thoſe that are fit for dark roomes and Ellebore. <hi>Iuſt ſuch another is the next,</hi> you ſay; Such another indeed, as truly affirmed, and as unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted to: <hi>That Epiſcopall government hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this Iland, ſince the firſt plantation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to this preſent day, without contradiction:</hi> what talke you of <hi>taking in the manner,</hi> and <hi>ſalving of credit?</hi> as if you had your adverſarie at a great advantage: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as the Greek proverb is, and as we are wont to ſay; <hi>Here is great cry, and little wooll.</hi> For, whereas, the propoſition may beare this double ſenſe; <hi>The continuance of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in this Iland, hath had no contradiction;</hi> or, <hi>There
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93954:57"/>
hath been no contradiction to the right of the continuance of it in this Iland;</hi> at the choice of the propounder, I am ready to make it good in both ſenſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you able juſtly to oppoſe it in either; I am ſure thoſe inſtances which you bring, out of <hi>Wickliffe, Lambert, Richardus de Mediavilla, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, Walter Mapes, Robert Langland,</hi> in your next Section, will ſhrink in the wetting, and come farre ſhort of your undertaking.</p>
               <p>BUt brethren, I muſt ſadly tell you, that in <note place="margin">Para. 2.</note> your next, and laſt exception, you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded your ſelves in malice; what loud and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous out cries have you made againſt me, both in your <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and <hi>Vindication,</hi> for a ſafe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent paſſage in my <hi>Remonſtrance?</hi> Speaking of the continuance and derivation of Epiſcopacy from the Primitive times, I had ſaid; <hi>Certainly, except all Hiſtories, all Authors fayle us, nothing can be more plaine then this truth:</hi> Now comes your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable veracity, and, in your <hi>Anſwer</hi> (ſeconded now againe by your <hi>Vindication)</hi> reports the words thus; <hi>Except all Hiſtories, all Authors fayle us, nothing can be more certaine then this truth;</hi> and thereupon cry out, <hi>Os durum!</hi> and deſcant fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon the word, <hi>Nothing more certain? What
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93954:57"/>
Is it not more certaine that there is a God? Is it not more certaine that Chriſt is God and man? Muſt this bee an Article of our Creed, &amp;c. Nothing more certaine? Oh that men ſhould not onely forget themſelves, but God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and in their zeale for their own honour utter words bordering upon Blaſphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you; whether like ſober, and honeſt men, let the Reader judge; who caſting back his eye upon that paſſage of my <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> ſhall <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> well finde that I have uſed no ſuch word at all, as you have thus inſolently and injuriouſly plaid upon: My phraſe was onely, <hi>Nothing can be more plaine,</hi> you falſifie it, <hi>Nothing more certaine;</hi> and run ſtrange, and uncharitable deſcant upon it; ſuch as whereof I think your friends will be aſhamed; And when I, not urging the great difference of this expreſſion, was willing to paſs it over, with intimating onely the ordinary uſe of this manner of ſpeech, in our hourely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein we would be loath to be called to an account of our Creed; yet ſtill, as eager and unſatisfied, in this your <hi>Vindication,</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double the charge upon me; <hi>Wee cry out</hi> (you ſay) <hi>of ſuch a ſhameleſneſſe as dares equall this opinion of his, of Epiſcopall government to an Article of our Creed:</hi> When as here was no mention, no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93954:58"/>
thought either of <hi>certainty,</hi> or of <hi>Creed;</hi> but onely an harmeleſs affirmation of the cleare evidence of this truth: But I will not ſtirre this puddle any more; onely beſeeching my Reader, by this one paſſage to judge of the ſpirit of theſe men, ſo ſet upon detraction, and contradiction, that rather then they will want colours of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they will deviſe them out of their owne braines, and faſten them where they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
               <p>Leſt this place ſhould not yeeld you ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of ſo foule a crimination, you flye back to <hi>Epiſcopacy by Divine right,</hi> and thence will <note place="margin">Epiſc. by D. R. p. 2. 127.</note> fetch a clearer conviction; where the Author ſaith, <hi>He for his part is ſo confident of the divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Majority of Biſhops above Presbyters, that he dare boldly ſay, there are weighty points of faith, which have not ſo ſtrong evidence in Scripture;</hi> He ſaid it, and made it good by inſtances in the ſame place: Why do you ſnarle at the ſpeech, and not confute the proofes? Trie your skill in that one particular, <hi>the Baptization of Infants;</hi> which, I am deceived, if the Church holds not a weighty point of faith; Let us, if you pleaſe, enter into a ſerious conteſtation; Shew me more cleare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture for this holy and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93954:58"/>
received poſition, and practiſe, of <hi>Baptizing Infants,</hi> then I can produce for the <hi>Majority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops above Presbyters;</hi> till then give me leave to returne your owne prayer; <hi>God give the men leſſe confidence, or more truth;</hi> and let me adde, <hi>more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> for truly, in whether of theſe two latter you are more defective, it is not eaſie to judge; In the meane time you have as much failed in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your ſelves from thoſe juſt imputations, which are laid upon you, as you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached in the unjuſt beſpattering of your ſtanch and innocent adverſarie.</p>
               <p>ANd now forbeare (if you can) Readers, to <note place="margin">Para. 4.</note> ſmile in the parting, at the grave counſell of our wiſe <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> who after he hath ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Reader with a tedious volume in anſwer to my ſhort <hi>Defence,</hi> adviſeth mee very ſadly, that my words may bee leſſe in number: Yet howſoever his weary loquacitie may, in this cauſeleſſe exprobration, deſerve to move your mirth; I ſhall reſolve to make good uſe of his counſaile. <hi>Eſt olitor ſaepe opportuna locutus.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele, my words (which were never yet taxed for an offenſive ſuperfluitie) ſhall be very few; and ſuch as, to your greater wonder, I ſhall be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93954:59"/>
beholden for, to my kinde adverſaries: The rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my late <hi>Defence</hi> was backed by the ſound teſtimony of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Abraham Scultetus,</hi> the famous profeſſor of <hi>Heydelburgh,</hi> and the great Oracle in his time of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> who in both the Tenets of <hi>Epiſcopacy by Divine right,</hi> and the <hi>unwarrantableneſſe of Lay-presbytery</hi> agrees ſo fully with me, as I doe with my ſelfe, the grounds whereof, I dare confidently ſay, are ſuch as no wit of man can overthrow, or weaken: Now what ſay my <hi>Smectymnuans</hi> to this? <hi>For brevity ſake, we will content our ſelves with what that learned Rivet ſpake, when theſe two Treatiſes of Scultetus were ſhewed to him, by a great Prelate amongst us, and his judgement required; Haec omnia jamdudum ſunt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trita &amp; profligata, All theſe have beene long ſince over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne and beaten out and baffled.</hi> In good time, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; And why ſhould not I take leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the ſame anſwer to you in this your tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous velitation of Epiſcopacie? There is not one new point in this your over-ſwolne, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldie bulk; No hay-cock hath beene oftner ſhaken abroad, and toſſed up and downe in the winde, then every argument of yours hath been agitated by more able pens then mine: <hi>Haec o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnia jamdudum ſunt protrita &amp; profligata;</hi> Why
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93954:59"/>
ſhould I abuſe my good houres; and ſpend my laſt age (devoted to better thoughts) in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable babling? You may perhaps expect to meet with fitter matches, that have more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; The cauſe is not mine alone, but common to this whole Church, to the whole Hierarchy; to all the Fathers of the Church throughout the world; to all the dutifull Sons of thoſe Fathers whereſoever; You may not hope that ſo many learned and eminent Divines, who finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equally intereſſed in this quarrell, can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer either ſo juſt a cauſe unſeconded, or ſo high inſolence unchaſtiſed; For my ſelfe, I remember the ſtory that <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels of the conteſtation <note place="margin">Plutarch in vita Craſſi.</note> betweene <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Deiotarus;</hi> men well-ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in age, and yet attempting ſeverall exploits, not ſo proper for their gray haires: What, ſaid <hi>Craſſus</hi> to <hi>Deiotarus; Doeſt thou begin to build a City, now in the latter end of the day? And truly,</hi> ſaid <hi>Deiota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to him againe, <hi>I think it ſomewhat with the lateſt for you to think of conquering the Parthians:</hi> Some witty lookers on, will perhaps apply both theſe to me; It is the city of God, the Euangelicall <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which ſome factious hands have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably demoliſhed, is it for ſhaking and wrinkled hands to build up againe, now in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93954:60"/>
very ſetting, and ſhutting in of the day?</p>
               <p>They are dangerous and not inexpert <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> who ſhoot out their arrowes, even bitter invectives, againſt the ſacred and Apoſtolicall government of the Church, and ſuch as know how to fight, fleeing; are theſe fit for the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of a decrepit Leader? Shortly then, ſince I ſee that our <hi>Smectymnuans</hi> have vowed, (like as ſome impetuous Scolds are wont to doe) to have the laſt word; and have ſet up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution (by taking advantage of their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) to tyre out their better imployed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with meere length of diſcourſe, and to do that by bulk of body, which by cleane ſtrength they cannot, I have determined to take off my hand from this remayning Controverſie of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy</hi> (wherein I have ſaid enough already, without the returne of anſwer, and indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated all thoſe thred-bare objections which are here againe regeſted to the weary Reader) and to turne off my combined oppoſites to matches more meet for their age and quality: with this profeſſion notwithſtanding, that if I ſhall finde (which I hope I never ſhall) this juſt and holy cauſe (whether out of inſenſibleneſſe, or cautious reſervedneſſe) neglected by more
