            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

subject of those who are Agents for the Establishment of Religion, must not be words but matter.</p>
            <p>Though Philosophy might allow the divided Sects of Nominals and Reals, Divinity owns none but Reals; Men so sincere, and real, and material in their Discourses, That <hi>speak Things</hi>; yet Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are allowed their Shadows, nor doth Divinity disprove a Dress of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Circumstance.

               </note> or to use none at all, are Extremes alike culpable.</p>
            <p>To put upon a small body more clothes than it can bear, is to smoother our Conceptions, and stifle the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we preach with multiplicity of words; yet to put on None at all, were to establish the Heresie of the <hi>Adamites</hi> in the Pulpit, and to dogmatize Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Good matter clad in very thin or ill words, is one of the strangest most
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50084:13"/>
mishapen things that may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> knew not He was naked until he had eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and then his Knowledge made him ashamed of his Nakedness.</p>
            <p>Ignorance may without blushing walk naked; for darkness needs no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and night is Covering to it self.</p>
            <p>But knowing Arguments sent abroad without a decent apparel, like Tapers set up in sluttish Candlesticks, bear Light about them onely to shame the Author.</p>
            <p>Words are the Interpreters, nay, the Robes of Knowledge, without which it will not appear unto the world, and being best clad is most amiable.</p>
            <p>Knowledge in its own disposition is very coy and reserved, like the nice Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian, who never shews Himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd.</p>
            <p>If it be presented naked, not cloathed in fit words, It is so bashful, or so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful, that it hides it self from every Apprehension.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, I never liked him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50084:13"/>
who serv'd up more Sauce than Meat, more Words than Matter, or Wit than Religion. But yet I have ever thought Choise Matter ill dress'd, like good Meat ill Cook'd, which neither credits the Bidder, nor pleases the Guest.</p>
            <p>Truth is the Pulpit's object, Decency the Attire of Truth: yet as I would not speak all truths, so neither apparel the truth I speak in every dress.</p>
            <p>An Egyptian Mantle, or a Babylonish Garment were sin to an Israelite.</p>
            <p>As every Light Tune would not go well with the Grave Dorick Harp, so every Dialect would not fit the Church.</p>
            <p>That Language which commends the Stage would misbecome the Pulpit: Light conceits or flashes of unseason'd wit prophane that holy ground.</p>
            <p>And again, that bitter Style which in a Declamation were an ingenious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, translated into a Sermon might prove a Libel.</p>
            <p>That Rule which St <hi>Paul</hi> gave the Church, must be as well observed in the Pulpit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50084:14"/>If you ask, by what Rule we must measure this Decency; Surely not by Theirs, who condemn or laugh at all the world who are not in their fashion. Decency was never measured by Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity or Affectation.</p>
            <p>Many have been more factiously proud and phantastical, and therefore more ridiculous in an affected Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than others in their studied Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50084:15"/>
Christians onely could make the best use.</p>
            <p>This apprehension caused <hi>Porphyrius</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells) to complain of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>

            <p>How well doth this suit the humor of our late Levites (quite differing from those Elder by me alleged) who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Ignorance a mark of the Spirit, and none so fit for the Ministery as those who never took Degree in the Schools?</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50084:19"/>
is the Plain; A Complete Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Building admits no Stones but what are hewn from the Rock, and Squared; If the Foundation be rugged or uneven, full of pointed Scruples, and craggy Doubts, the Building must needs lean on one side; And if once it leans, it will be an hard matter by any new devised Distinction, to skrew it up, or set it right again.</p>

               </note> And commonly the most solid is still most plain. I know the Knotty piece of Wood is hard, but that Hardness inclines to Brittleness, which doth not prove it <hi>sound,</hi> but hard to work upon.</p>

               </gap>micks to the People, when they might have Edified themselves and their Congregations better by a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism than a Controversie?</p>
            <p>I have lived, and shall die in this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50084:20"/>
Opinion, That there can be no greater danger to a setled Church, than Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to dispute and call in question the Points and Articles of an Established Religion.</p>
            <p>I grant, Disputes amongst the Learn'd are sometimes useful Triturations, which by the Flail of Argument separate Truth from Error;</p>
            <p>But the pressing of those Arguments in the Pulpit, in Popular Congregations, oft-times suspend Religion, and make weak Apprehensions stagger from their first Conclusions.</p>
            <p>The Reason is Evident, for when Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are press'd, and Objections for the Other urged, That which is most plausible sways the Hearer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly carries the Cause.</p>
            <p>Nothing therefore could more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Peace of the Church, and Confirmation of Religion, than the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controversies asleep, and silencing Disputes, which hang so many doubts upon the Cause, that like wrong Biasses, they draw men from the Mark.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50084:21"/>'Tis piety to Believe what were not safe to Question; And besides, men would want cunning to suspect the Truth of their Religion, who never heard Objections fram'd against it.</p>
            <p>Those who are put to wade unto the Articles of their Faith through Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and Logick, sometimes ingulph themselves in Depths which drown, but often strike on Rocks which break them into Irresolution. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore steers us from this Rocky Coast, <hi>Put away vain Questions,</hi>
