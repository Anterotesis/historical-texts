            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A
PANEGYRIC
On our late Sovereign Lady
MARY
QUEEN of ENGLAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN vain the grateful World ſtrives to eternize the
Memory of Heroes, in vain their Names and Titles
are entruſted to Marble and Braſs, which Time
will quickly deface, in vain are all the artful Endeavors
of Painters and Sculptors to give them a ſhadow of Life
in ſpite of Death, by a laſting Repreſentation of that which
is no more, if we do not labour to revive the Spirit that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
them, and to immortalize their Glory by a careful imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Actions.</p>
            <p>Such an Elogy as this is only worthy of MARY, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in whom all the Vertues were united, and yet ſeem'd to
contend, which ſhould moſt embelliſh their lovely Habitation;
a Queen the Examplar of Her Subjects; a Heroin the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of Queens; elevated above Her Rank by Her Vertues,
and even, in ſome meaſure rais'd above Her Vertues by Her
Modeſty, which could not bear Praiſe, and would not ſuffer
us to do juſtice, but in ſecret, during Her Life, to that
Merit which has been celebrated, in ſo glorious a manner,
by the Public Grief after her Death.</p>
            <p>The Sorrow of <hi>England;</hi> the Lamentations of the State;
the Tears of the Church; the early Acknowledgments of
that Auguſt Senate, which, by regulating the Affairs of one
Nation, governs the Fate of all others; the King's ſinking
under a load of Grief, the weakneſs of that Hero, on this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47889:4"/>
occaſion, whoſe Courage was never before ſhock'd by Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or Misfortunes; the ſilence of Envy; and the United
Groans of ſo many Nations, who reſent this Loſs as an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Blow to Mankind, praiſe Her aloud, and leave ſo
much the leſs to be ſaid by me, that, in making the Elogy
either of Her Immortal Vertues, or of the unexampl'd
Wonders of Her Life, I cannot preſerve the likeneſs of
Truth without leſſening the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of Her Glorious Anceſtors, but that
the Luſtre which She reflected back upon them was greater
than that She receiv'd from them; and that She honour'd
Her Birth more than that honour'd Her. And it muſt be
acknowledg'd, that never any Woman could with ſo much
Juſtice be call'd the Ornament of Her Nation, and Glory of
Her Sex.</p>
            <p>I will neither imitate the Malice of ſome, who deſpiſe,
nor the flattering complaiſance of others, who magnifie a
Sex which Nature has made little different from ours; tho'
Education does commonly make a diſtinction between them,
that is wholly to the advantage of the latter. Yet I cannot
but obſerve, that the Greatneſs of the Obſtacles that bar
the Aſcent to the moſt Shining Glory, ſerves only to heighten
the Honour of the Perſon that ſurmounts them; and that
as there is nothing more rare than to find the Character of
a Hero in a Woman, ſo there is nothing that more imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
commands our Admiration.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory, that preſerves the Memory of ſo many famous
Names, has tranſmitted to us but a very ſmall number of
Illuſtrious Women, who deſerv'd to be mention'd with
particular Marks of Honour. Yet every Nation boaſts of
ſome; and it may be ſaid that the Spirits of all thoſe Heroins
were combin'd together to animate our Queen, and that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has engroſs'd the Glories of all other Nations.</p>
            <p>She was Miſtreſs of all the Sublime Characters that enter
the Compoſition of an extraordinary Perſon. Her Beauty,
which might have been the brighteſt Ornament of another,
was always reckon'd the meaneſt of Her Endowments. And
even the perfections of Her Judgment which was naturally
ſteddy, ſolid, and piercing, beſides thoſe Excellent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with which She took care to enrich it, in conjunction
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47889:4"/>
with all the Charms of Her Perſon, were but the leaſt
part of that Merit for which the World admir'd Her.</p>
            <p>Never was ſo much Greatneſs and Majeſty accompany'd
with ſo much Modeſty and Sweetneſs. Never could ſo eaſie
and natural a Carriage command ſo much reſpect,
and ſo admirably well become the ſublimeſt Dignity. How
low ſoever She might condeſcend to ſtoop, and endeavour to
conceal the Heroin under the diſguiſe of an ordinary Woman,
that commanding Air, which was ſpread over all Her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that Mien, and Natural Majeſty, which She could not
hide, diſcover'd Her Greatneſs, and betray'd Her Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Her Soul was inſeparably united to that of Her Auguſt
Husband. She conſider'd His Glory as Her own deareſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
She ſtudied His Sentiments, to follow them, and
His Actions, to imitate them; and ſet His Will before Her,
as the Rule of Her Life.</p>
            <p>Her Love and Admiration of Him made Her Submiſſion
delightful to her. When She enjoy'd His Preſence, She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
His Eyes to know whether She ſhould rejoyce or
grieve. When He left Her, She was not ſenſible of any
Trouble, but what was caus'd by Her ſeparation from Him,
She fear'd nothing but to loſe Him, and Her only Care was
to execute His Orders, and, during the Abſence of His
Perſon, to preſerve at leaſt His Will upon the Throne. She
breath'd not but for Him, and ſeem'd not to live but in
Him.</p>
            <p>She was not capable of the leaſt Weakneſs. Never Wife
lov'd Her Husband more tenderly; and never Princeſs bore
Misfortunes with greater conſtancy.</p>
            <p>Her Courage rais'd Her above had ſucceſs, and Her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
ſet Her above happy Events. Proſperity and Adverſity
were equally unable either to puff Her up, or to caſt Her
down. She was above them both; and it will for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
an undecided controverſie whether She bore with more
Temper the Smiles, or the Frowns of Fortune.</p>
            <p>She had at once the higheſt and moſt regular Merit that ever
was She joyn'd the Courage and Strength that are peculiar to
our Sex, with all the Vertues and Graces of Her own.
Heaven ſeem'd to have endow'd Her with the Perfections
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47889:5"/>
of both Sexes, to inſtruct them both in their ſeveral Duties,
or to correct their Vices by the Oppoſition of ſo many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
as if it deſign'd to propoſe one Perſon for the Standard
and Cenſure of all the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>She was equally admirable, when in Her Council She
vied with the ableſt Stateſmen; and when after the
King's return, She retir'd to the Innocent Pleaſure of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Her Women. She was Wiſe and Courageous in
Her Government, Humble and Modeſt in Her Retirement. Her
Vertue ſet before us, in Her Illuſtrious Life, a continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of Advancement and Humiliation, more wonderful
than the moſt ſtupendous Turns of Fortune.</p>
            <p>She dreaded the return of the Seaſon that oblig'd Her to
aſſume the Government, and, beſides the Glory of the State,
made Her Miſtreſs of the Fate of the People. She would
never have deſir'd to draw upon Her ſelf the Eyes of all
the Univerſe, if She could have ſtill enjoy'd him whom She
lov'd: and gave us a yearly and memorable Inſtance that
Authority may be receiv'd with Tears, and laid aſide with
Raptures of Joy.</p>
            <p>Yet it would have ſeem'd that Authority had been Natural
to Her, ſo well She knew how to uſe it. She was capable
of the greateſt, and exact in the ſmalleſt things. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
the Art of managing the Buſineſs of State by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary'd
Application, She had the dexterity to extend Her
Empire over the Minds of Her People, and reign'd in their
Hearts by Her Clemency. She commanded in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as to make Obedience a Pleaſure; and She obey'd in
Her turn, as if She had never commanded.</p>
            <p>She was always ready to yield to Reaſon and Truth: but
would never be perſwaded to beſtow on Recommendations
the Reward of Merit and Vertue.</p>
            <p>She was prepar'd for all Events by Her Reſolution, and
She provided for them all by Her Wiſdom. She enjoy'd
an undiſturb'd ſerenity of Mind in the midſt of Troubles
and Dangers; She was ſecret in Her Deſigns, ſteady
in Her Maxims, and of an invincible Conſtancy under Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.
And it may be ſaid without Flattery that She
reign'd without a Fault, as Her Life was without a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47889:5"/>
It ſeem'd that the King, by entruſting her with the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Affairs, inſpir'd her with all his Wiſdom; and that
the Queen, for the Heart ſhe gave him, had in exchange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his Judgment.</p>
            <p>'Tis not impoſſible for a common Perſon to live without
Reproach, but we find no faultleſs Heroes. And even the
Greateſt Vertues ſeem to be uſually accompanied with the
greateſt Imperfections; as if that which raiſes us above our
ſelves, was apt to diſorder our Souls, by putting them out of
their Natural Poſture. But here we find an Eminent Merit,
without the leaſt Fault or Weakneſs, in an admirable Perſon,
who was as free from blame, as if ſhe had been ſav'd from it
by the Meanneſs of her Condition. The Greatneſs of her
Fortune might have expos'd her to all the Shafts of Malice, if
her Vertues had not impos'd Silence on Malice it ſelf: And
even her Vertues might have expos'd her to Envy, if they had
been mixt with any Faults. But who could blame ſuch a
compleat Merit, ſuch high Perfection, and ſuch Spotleſs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
without renouncing his Judgment, and expoſing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>But after all it muſt be acknowledg'd, that it was neither
the Dignity of her Rank, nor the Luſtre of her Heroical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
that render'd her Condition worthy of Envy. All that
which made the World admire her could not have hinder'd her
from being an Object of Compaſſion in her own Eyes.</p>
            <p>Heroes are mortal, as well as other men; and neither all
their Glory nor our Tears can preſerve them from that fatal
Neceſſity. We are charm'd with that which is no more to
us than a bare Idea of Perfection: We begin late to admire
a Vertue that has ceas'd to appear, and complain in vain of the
cruelty of Death that has robb'd us of our dear Protectors.
They have taken an eternal Leave of us: Their Great Names
ſerve only to adorn their Epitaphs, and embeliſh their Tombs,
and thoſe Vertues which the World admir'd, are like the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Torches that ſignalize the Pomp of their Obſequies whoſe
Splendour ſerves only to encreaſe our Affliction.</p>
            <p>And who was better acquainted with theſe Truths than the
Queen? She made the Meditation of Death a continual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to her Vertue: She lov'd to diſcourſe on that Subject
with others, and to entertain her ſelf with the Thoughts of it.
Thus, forſaking Vanity long before ſhe was forſaken by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47889:6"/>
and baniſhing the World out of her Mind, even whilſt ſhe
liv'd in the midſt of it, She prevented, by a voluntary Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from it, that forc'd Exile to which all Mankind is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd;
and it may be ſaid, that in this Reſpect, her Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had left little or no Work for Death.</p>
            <p>How rare is that Vertue, and how becoming a Companion
to Greatneſs! Humility is moſt advantagiouſly plac'd in the
Heart of a Soveraign, for there it makes great Reſtitutions to
God; there it oppoſes the Flattery of the People, who are
wont to idolize Grandeur, and teaches the Prince to deſpiſe
himſelf in the midſt of that Croud of flattering Admirers, who
adore his Faults, and proſtrate themſelves before his Fortune.</p>
            <p>But how much more admirable is that Vertue in thoſe Great
Souls, who are more truely elevated above Kings by their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
than Kings are rais'd above other men by their Rank and
Dignity! 'Tis a ſhame to be Proud when ſuch excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as theſe are Humble. 'Tis an Honour to renounce vain-Glory,
when the moſt eminent Heroes are eminent alſo for
their Humility.</p>
            <p>That was the Character of our Queen; Her Life, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
and her Carriage were but one continued expreſſion
of that Vertue. Her Palace was a Temple of Modeſty, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
She was to free it from Vanity and Luxury. She deckt
her ſelf with her own Vertues, and neglected the Ornaments
of Dreſſing; She appear'd rather Neat than Magnificent in her
Train and Furniture. She was an exact Obſerver of the Rules
of Decency, without injuring her Humility; and beſtow'd no
more on the Pomp of a Court, than what the Dignity of her
Rank did abſolutely require. And yet ſhe ſeem'd to grudge
her own neceſſary Expences, as if ſhe had ſtoln them from the
Funds of her Charity.</p>
            <p>Never any hid their Faults with more care than ſhe took to
conceal her Vertues. This is the only Fault that ſhe could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be accus'd of. Wonders are made to be ſeen, and to make
a ſtrong Impreſſion upon us; and how many Wonders did ſhe
hinder us from ſeeing, by hiding from us the Nobleſt parts of
ſo beautiful a Life.</p>
            <p>She lov'd to edify, but not to be admir'd, as if ſhe could have
purchas'd Humility at the rate of her Glory. She condemn'd
Thankfulneſs to ſilence, and made this ſeeming Ingratitude
the Condition of her Favours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47889:6"/>
With one Hand ſhe dry'd the Tears of the Afflicted, and
with the other drew a Veil over their Miſery. She was no
leſs charitable in her way of relieving them, than in the Relief
ſhe gave them. With equal care ſhe ſought Occaſions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
her Vertue, and avoided every Temptation to vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
She always conceal'd the Good that ſhe did, and has been
ſeen to weep for that which ſhe could not do.</p>
            <p>But in vain ſhe impos'd a ſilence, which ſooner or later would
certainly be broken. The whole Univerſe that was a Witneſs
of her Vertues, the World that is fill'd with her Charity,
which ſhe ſcatter'd through all Nations, and all Climates, ſuch
an infinite number of Perſons that felt the comfortable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of her Bounty, cry ſo much the louder after her Death, as
they were forc'd to be ſilent during her Life. Impriſon'd
Gratitude ſhakes off its Fetters and breaks out impetuouſly.
We ſend forth our Complaints and Lamentations, the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Grief and her Glory, becauſe we are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them longer; and tho that bright Soul could, from the
Heavens whither ſhe is aſcended, renew thoſe Orders which
her Modeſty impos'd on Earth, Sorrow and Gratitude would
not ſuffer us to obey them.</p>
            <p>Death, which puts a period to the Glory of others, ſeems on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to begin hers. How vaſt is the difference between her and the
nameleſs Great, thoſe vulgar Princes, who ceaſe to be known
aſſoon as they ceaſe to live! Her Works came out of the
Grave, when ſhe enter'd into it: Her Life hid her from us; and
her Death expoſes her in all her Glory to our raviſh'd Eyes.</p>
            <p>Why cannot we do as much honour to her Memory, as ſhe
was always ready to do to Merit and Vertue? What do I ſay?
She made it her Pleaſure to conſider all ſorts of Perſons; none
were deſpicable in her ſight. She never ſpoke ill of any perſon,
nor ever ſuffer'd any perſon to be ill ſpoken of in her preſence.
She eſteem'd the Reputations of all mankind ſacred; and if ever
the Serenity of her Mind, was diſturb'd by any motion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to which ſhe was almoſt always a Stranger, it was when
any one had the confidence to ſpeak ill of her Enemies in her
preſence.</p>
            <p>She was ſo incredulous of the faults of others, as if humane
Nature had been faultleſs; and ſo univerſally indulgent, as if
all mankind had belong'd to her. What a noble Example has
ſhe ſet before Soveraigns, who being the common Parents of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47889:7"/>
their People, are concern'd in the Reputation of all ſorts of
perſons, and ought no more to encourage Railing againſt their
Subjects, than they would againſt their own Children.</p>
            <p>The Perſons are uſually deſpis'd, whoſe Praiſes and Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are eſteem'd; which is an Effect of Pride. But <hi>MARY</hi>
deſpis'd Praiſe, and had an univerſal Charity for all ſorts of
perſons. This was the peculiar character of her Vertue.</p>
            <p>Her Condeſcenſion and Bounty kept pace with the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Fortune, as if ſhe had intended to comfort others,
and make amends for her ſurpaſſing them in Quality and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
She was eaſy of acceſs to the unhappy, ſhe deſpis'd no
Complaint, and rejected no Requeſt. Her generous and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Temper would not ſuffer her to overcome Hatred and
Envy, any other way than by Kindneſs and good Offices. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
all other Women in Frugality, but ſhe was frugal only
that ſhe might be charitable; and ſhe was even more Charitable
than Frugal, reducing her ſelf often to Poverty by her profuſe
Beneficency.</p>
            <p>This is not an Idea of imaginary perfection. It has been
obſerv'd, that after ſhe had conſum'd the regulated Fund of her
Charity in extraordinary Bounties, ſhe diſtributed that which
was appointed for her own neceſſary Charges, to ſupply the
Wants of the Poor. And ſhe felt a pleaſure in this vertuous
Poverty, which they whoſe minds are addicted to the World,
ſhall never find in all their proud Abundance, and cruel Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Self-love and Intereſt gain'd no ground in
her Heart by her Advancement. Her Greatneſs was for the
benefit of others, rather than for her own good. She rejected
the Pomp of it by her Humility; and of all that Plenty of which
ſhe was Miſtreſs, ſhe reſerv'd nothing to her ſelf, but the
pleaſure of giving it away.</p>
            <p>But what do I ſay? She was alſo oblig'd to her Dignity for
a thouſand occaſions to diſplay her Clemency, at a time when
Severity might have ſeem'd not only pardonable, but neceſſary,
to a Heart leſs heroical than hers.</p>
            <p>Princes that regard their Safety more than their Honour,
content themſelves with being prais'd for their rigorous Juſtice,
by which they ſerve the Intereſts of their own Preſervation.
But Souls of the firſt form are not ſatisfied with the Empire that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear gives them over others, but rather chuſe to maintain their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47889:7"/>
Authority by inſpiring their Subjects with a Veneration for
their Vertues. They judge with reaſon, that 'tis nobler (when
poſſible) to preſerve the public Peace by Mercy, than by
Juſtice; that 'tis more honorable to conquer Hearts, than to
ſubdue Perſons; and that the State is doubly ſav'd, when the
inclinations of its Enemies are diſarm'd, and they become its
Friends and Servants.</p>
            <p>Clemency is a Vertue that deſerves to be more highly
eſteem'd, for the greatneſs of the Dangers to which it expoſes
its Owners. 'Tis even more generous than Charity: for the
charitable man only gives away his Riches; but he that is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
hazards his very Life. 'Tis braver than Valour it ſelf,
for it expoſes it ſelf to ſecret Foes, which are more dangerous
than thoſe open Enemies whom Courage oppoſes. And 'tis
greater than Moderation, which finds its own ſecurity in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
private injuries, whereas Clemency neglects the care of
its own Preſervation by pardoning the Enemies of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</p>
            <p>If Mercy had been to appear in a humane Form, it would
have certainly borrow'd that of the Queen. It was ſufficient
to be unhappy to be eſteem'd innocent by her: She imitated
God, who exhorts Sinners to accept his Favors, and adds Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to the Pardon that he gives them, with a deſign to make
them better; ſhe forc'd her greateſt Enemies to be capable of
Gratitude. Her Clemency, by an admirable Priviledge,
produc'd all the effects of Severity; It deliver'd her every
day from ſome new Enemy, or cruſh'd ſome brooding Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.
The benefits that ſhe beſtow'd were Spies to diſcover the
Plots of her Enemies, and Guards to ſecure her againſt them;
and the Pardons which ſhe granted ſo often, and in ſo obliging
a manner to thoſe that had conſpir'd againſt her Life, furniſh'd
her with means to acquire new Glory, and additional ſecurities
in every Attempt of her Enemies.</p>
            <p>Blaſphemy was the only crime that ſhe would never forgive.
She was ſtill ſtruck with horror at the hearing of an impious
Expreſſion: Yet ſhe would not ſuffer her Indignation to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her, or make her forget that Calmneſs with which ſhe
adminiſtred Juſtice, by depriving inſtantly of all Offices, and
baniſhing from her preſence, thoſe that had dar'd to brave the
Majeſty of that God, whom ſhe ſerv'd with ſo much Fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47889:8"/>
which ſhe clearly ſhow'd, that it was not ſhe that reign'd, but
God that reign'd by her.</p>
            <p>Let the World admire, as much as it pleaſes, thoſe humane
Vertues, which, under great Names and venerable Out-ſides,
hide our moſt real imperfections, or rather thoſe ſacrilegious
Vertues which rob God of our beſt Actions to aſcribe them to
our ſelves, and are in ſome reſpect more criminal than the
groſſeſt Vices, as being more injurious to God. Piety alone
deſerves the name of Vertue, becauſe it ſeeks God in all things,
and refers all things to his Glory. And Piety was the great
buſineſs of the Queen's Life.</p>
            <p>Her public and private Devotions, from which no Trouble
of State, nor Danger that threaten'd her perſon could ever
once divert her; that Commerce of Piety which ſhe held with
God, and the Commerce of Charity between her and her
Brethren; her Meditations and Reading of pious Books em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
all her Mornings, and conſecrated to God the half of
her Life, thoſe firſt Hours of the Day, which ſhe ſometimes
ſtole from her ordinary reſt, and took from Nature to beſtow
them on Grace, which made a far better uſe of them. Her
Devotions were ſucceeded by her Charity, her Contemplations
by Practice, and her Prayers by good Works; ſo that ſhe had
no time left from theſe Holy Occupations that was not devoted
to God, nor almoſt a Thought that did not aſcend up to Heaven.
While ſhe ſuſtain'd the Load of an infinite number of Affairs
and Perſons that depended on her, ſhe ſtill found leiſure to ſerve
God without diſtraction; and in the midſt of ſo many different
Occupations ſhe eſtabliſh'd, in her well-ordered Life, a Laſting
Worſhip, and a perpetual and uninterrupted Courſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>Her days began, as the Days of Glory ſhall begin, with the
Adoration of her Creator; and ended like the Life of man, with
Meditations on the Vanity of the World. Caſting her Eyes
ſometimes on thoſe things which periſh, to wean her Love and
Inclinations from them, and ſometimes on that which periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, to make it the Object of all her Hopes and Affections;
ſhe liv'd like one that knew ſhe ſhould ſhortly die; her
Chriſtian Prudence producing the ſame effect in her, that might
have been expected from a diſtinct Revelation of her End, and
of the Meaſure of her Days.</p>
            <p>Her Piety was Univerſal; ſhe practis'd all the Vertues,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47889:8"/>
becauſe ſhe knew they were all acceptable to God. It had been
impoſſible to determine which of all the Duties of Morality
ſhe obſerv'd moſt carefully, and it might have been doubted
which of her Vertues had the advantage over the reſt; if it
had not been known that they were all happily united and
blended together in her Piety.</p>
            <p>Such was the Foundation of her Vertue, which in other
reſpects, was ſo variouſly diverſified, and ſtill found new occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make it ſelf be eſteem'd, by that happy mixture of Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Humility, Firmneſs and Mercy, Courage and Charity,
Prudence and a holy Reſignation to the Providence of God,
Sweetneſs and Reſolution, that produc'd an Effect on the
Minds of thoſe who heedfully conſider'd her, not unlike to that
Impreſſion which the Flowers of a beautiful Garden, or the
Stars of Heaven, by their Variety and Order, make on the
Eyes of an attentive Beholder.</p>
            <p>The Merit of our Illuſtrious <hi>MARY</hi> was Great; but it
was not greater than her Deſtiny. She ſtood in need of no
leſs Vertue and Perfection to fulfil the Deſign of God and the
Expectations of Men; being call'd by Providence to edifie a
vicious World, to comfort the drooping Church, and to ſave
her ſinking Country.</p>
            <p>Men may celebrate the Virtues of Great Princes, but God
himſelf endites the Praiſes of Great Deliverers. He calls <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his <hi>Anointed,</hi> He proclaims him, He promiſes him to the World
a hundred years before he came inro it; not becauſe he was to
be the Conqueror of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but becauſe he was deſign'd to be the
Reſtorer of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Liberties. Yet how much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
had he been, if at the ſame time that he freed them from
Slavery, he had alſo deliver'd them from Superſtition? And
tho God does not think ſit to ſpeak to us by the Mouth of a
Prophet, does he not declare his Mind ſufficiently by the Voice
of his Providence?</p>
            <p>We have not yet forgot thoſe ſad times, when the State was
divided into two Parties, one of which endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it by introducing Error, and the other to preſerve it by
defending the Truth: When <hi>England,</hi> like a diſconſolate <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi>
felt two Children, an <hi>Eſau</hi> and a <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſtruggling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
together with a Secret, but implacable Animoſity, in her
wretehed Bowels, without being able to foreſee the Succeſs of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47889:9"/>
thoſe Inteſtine Broils that threaten'd to rend her Entrals to pieces?</p>
            <p>Superſtition, that active and ſubtle Miſtreſs; inſpir'd
her Followers with a Zeal that prompted them to carry on
their deſigns, without loſing a minute, even during the life of
the late King. Never were Projects better contriv'd, never
Intrigues deeper laid or more cunningly manag'd, and never
was there more promiſing Hopes than thoſe of that Party. In
what a ſad condition had we been, if God had deliver'd us up
to that Violence, and to that ſo well known and often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
Cruelty, which is ſo much the more dangerous as acting
under a Sacred Diſguiſe, and uſurping the Name of Religion?
Who would not have thought, that <hi>England</hi> was juſt ready to be
made a Prey to remedileſs Diſorders, and to be turn'd to a bloody
Theater of endleſs Diviſions, Revenge, and horrible Maſſacres?</p>
            <p>But theſe Miſchiefs could not be effected without gaining a
Princeſs, on whom, as being the preſumptive Heireſs of the
Crown, they foreſaw that the Fate of the State would in time
depend. And it was on this occaſion, that God exalted the
ſtrength of his Arm above all the power of men.</p>
            <p>This wonderful Princeſs ſeem'd, even almoſt aſſoon as ſhe
was born, to know what ſhe was call'd to by the Providence of
God; ſo firm and well grounded ſhe appear'd in her heavenly
Vocation. And even at that time ſhe was ſo fixt in her Religion,
ſo conſtant to her Duty, and ſo unmoveable under all Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in all other reſpects of ſo ſweet a temper, ſo wiſe,
moderate and reſign'd, that it may be ſaid, that ſhe had already
all thoſe Perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions, that we could have wiſht to ſee her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
adorn'd with, and that the moſt illuſtrious Lives had
ſcarce any advantage over the Beginning of Hers, or could exceed
the glory of ſo heroical an Infancy.</p>
            <p>It was at the ſame time that there aroſe a Difference worthy
of eternal Memory. The State demanded our Princeſs as its
Sure Refuge, and the Source of all its Comforts; and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
courted her for a Support and Foundation of its Hopes.
They contended for her Education with an eagerneſs that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a conteſt, the ſucceſs of which was expected with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that held the World in ſuſpence, that fill'd the Reform'd
part of it with Fears, and <hi>Great Britain,</hi> particularly, with
Anxiety and Diſquiet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47889:9"/>
But, in vain had both Church and State interpos'd in the
Quarrel between Religion and Superſtition, in vain had been
all the Care and Courage of our Magnanimous Prelates,
and in vain had the Parliament, that Council empower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
both by the Crown and by the Nation, that Sage and (by
the Regal Authority) Legiſlative Aſſembly, that perpetual
Guardian of the Rights and Priviledges of the Kingdom,
that honourable and reſpected Mouth of the People, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
both of its Wants and of its Will, in vain, I ſay,
had the Parliament it ſelf reſolv'd to determine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
brought before its Auguſt Tribunal, if Grace had not
already decided the Controverſie in the Heart of that young
Princeſs.</p>
            <p>She believ'd that ſhe ow'd her ſelf to God and to the State;
and that ſhe could not anſwer the Call of Heaven, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
herſelf intirely to her Country and her Religion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only willing to live, and ready to die for them
both; it may be ſaid that from that very time ſhe accepted
the Crown, and Death together; being prepar'd to receive
either Fortune for ſo precious and ſacred an Intereſt.</p>
            <p>In vain to tempt the Piety of that Heroical Soul, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Match to her, able, as they think, to ſhake conſtancy it
ſelf; In vain they ſpeak of uniting her to a Prince, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the amiable qualifications of his Perſon, could boaſt the
Expectation of a Throne, and the Hopes of one of the moſt
glorious Succeſſions of the Univerſe, but whoſe Alliance is
equally oppoſite to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of that Princeſs. She hears the Propoſal with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and rejects it with Indignation, and with a Reſolution
that could not be conquer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d.</p>
            <p>Thus, for her Countries ſake, ſhe deſpiſes a Dignity, which
the Intereſt of that Nation alone ſhall one day make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
and even then ſhe ſhow'd her ſelf uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a Scepter but for the ſame Reaſons, for which ſhe
had already refus'd one. Happy had ſhe been, if ſhe had
not found the Sacrifice of her natural Affections, which ſhe
was afterwards oblig'd to offer up to God, a harder Task
than the Sacrifice of her Ambition which ſhe offer'd then;
and if the Crown that ſhe accepted had not more ſenſibly
afflicted her than that which ſhe rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47889:10"/>
Thus, with an unſhaken Conſtancy, ſhe reſerv'd her ſelf
for that important and neceſſary Marriage, to which the
Church and the State, the Parliament and Council, and God
and the King had appointed her.</p>
            <p>Never was the publick Joy better grounded, than on this
occaſion; and never any Feſtival was more worthy to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd
than this. For, then it was that Providence laid
the Foundations of the Public Liberty: And to this happy
Marriage we owe the ſucceeding Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the general Confederacy of their Allies.</p>
            <p>When the Prince went to <hi>England,</hi> accompanied with the
Prayers and Acclamations of the whole World that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Succeſs of his Voyage, he ſeem'd to ask the
Princeſs in the name of all thoſe Nations that were one day
to owe their liberty to this Bleſſed Match. And (if I might
be allow'd to join the preſent Events with the Occurrences of
thoſe times) I would not ſcruple to affirm, that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage was a Treaty, which God by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
negotiated with all the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> for their
common Defence and Preſervation.</p>
            <p>After her arrival in <hi>Holland,</hi> where Providence detain'd
her ſeveral years, as in a ſafe Retreat, far from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
and Hurry of the World; where she employed
her ſelf in the exerciſe of all thoſe Vertues, that might fit
her to ſerve the Great Deſigns of God. There, ſhe did not
ceaſe to be uſeful to the Country which ſhe had left, by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyng
Popery that diſturb'd its Peace, and by over-awing
even thoſe who ſeem'd not capable of being reſtrain'd by
Fear. In <hi>Holland</hi> ſhe continues to be the Hope of <hi>England.</hi>
Her Life is a dear Pledge of the love of God to that Nation;
and ſo long as that laſts, they fear not that he will forſake
them.</p>
            <p>But ſhe was not only made for the Good of that Country
that had the honour to give her Birth: She was alſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſeful to others, and above all ſhe was the Joy and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that, where Providence was pleas'd to fix her. In
leſs time than ſeems neceſſary to view that happy Climate,
ſhe conform'd her ſelf exactly to its Manners and Cuſtoms.
She became a Pattern to its Women, even in their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Vertues. She gave them an illuſtrious example not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47889:10"/>
only of Modeſty and Chaſtity, but alſo of Frugality and
Moderation. The ſweetneſs of her Temper, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mildneſs of her Deportment took away that haughty
Air from Greatneſs with which it is uſually arm'd. She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffer'd any Perſons to depart unſatisfied from her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
and taught even thoſe to love a Court who before
eſteem'd nothing but Liberty and an Equality of Conditions.
And it may be ſaid that among all the Parties and Diviſions
that diſturb'd the State, the moſt oppoſite Factions were ſtill
united in the love and Admiration of her Vertues.</p>
            <p>It was there that her Judgment, beſides all thoſe great and
early improvements with which it was already adorn'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
larger and more extenſive by the help of a ſecond Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
There, her Mind was poliſh'd and brighten'd by
continual Reading, and the Converſation of Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whom ſhe always honour'd with her Protection. And
there ſhe acquir'd that comprehenſive Knowledge, and thoſe
ſublime Perfections which would have ſhone with greater lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,
if they had not been cover'd with the veil of her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
            <p>There, in pious ſolitudes, ſhe acted the part of a <hi>Moſes</hi>
upon the Mount, while her Illuſtrious Husband performed
the Office of a <hi>Joſhua</hi> at the Head of his Armies, where his
Valour and Conduct were equally admir'd in good and bad
Fortune; and while, by making the beſt uſe of both he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
apace to that Height of Merit and Honour that was
neceſſary to deſerve thoſe glorious Favours that Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to beſtow upon him.</p>
            <p>We may eaſily remember that Time which our lateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
ſhall never forget, for they alſo are concern'd in it.
A Time, in which God ſet bounds to the Oppreſſion of the
people, and to the Affliction of his Church; In which by
one ſudden ſtroke he ſtopt the progreſs of that Power which
threatened to devour all the World; in which he preſerved
the Earth from the over-bearing Inundations of that raging
Sea, by writing on the Sand <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no
further.</hi> We ſaw, and ſtill have before our Eyes that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Juncture of Affairs, when the All-wiſe Governour
of the World, who diſpoſes ſecond Cauſes according to his
pleaſure, thought fit to chain the preſervation of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47889:11"/>
and of ſo many other Countries to the Reſolution of one
Man; when the Laws, Rights, Liberty, and Religion of ſo
many Nations were entruſted by Providence to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of the Waves; when even the Tempeſts ſerv'd in
ſo admirable a manner to advance the Work of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
when unbloody Victories executed the deſigns of the
God of Mercy; when the Armies of the wicked were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by the Harmony and Union of our Minds; when the
Deliverer appear'd, and the Terrors of God ſeiz'd on our
Enemies; and when by the miraculous Bleſſing of God on
the nobleſt and moſt neceſſary undertaking of our Age, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is ſtill ſuffer'd to enjoy her Laws, the Church to ſerve
God, and we to live and breath.</p>
            <p>'Twas then that <hi>England</hi> became the Field of Battle, where
that ſurprizing Conteſt was decided, between God who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
us ſo viſibly, and Men that oppoſed the deſigns of his
Wiſdom. But could the Almighty be defeated by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or could his Providence be reſiſted by his Enemies?
At at the ſame time the heart of the Princeſs was made the
Scene of a no leſs extraordinary but more ſecret Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between Nature and Grace: and here alſo God obtain'd
the Victory by his ſpirit. Both theſe Victories were juſtifi'd,
and made unqueſtionable, one by its Conſequences, and the
other by its Effects. The Victory of Providence, by the
Events which follow'd it; and that of Grace by the Vertues
with which it was accompanied.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a numerous Train of the Conſequences of that
Event, which are either ſo neceſſary for our Preſervation, or
ſo honourable to <hi>England,</hi> the progreſs of Popery ſtop't,
our holy Religion ſupported, our Laws reſtor'd, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Order of the Church ſecur'd, the Univerſities
thoſe Eyes of the Church and State happily preſerv'd, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power for ever baniſh'd, the Right of our Elections
re-eſtabliſh'd, our Eſtates aſſur'd to us, our Priviledges made
henceforth inviolable, <hi>Ireland</hi> freed from Pillage, from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and Burning, our Allies defended by our Arms;
a formidable and potent Enemy, that has threatened ſo long
to rob us of our Liberty, now ſcarce able to defend himſelf,
his Ships coop'd up in a Harbour, and his Coaſts expos'd to
the terrible effects of our juſt Vengeance; the Conqueror of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47889:11"/>
               <hi>Europe</hi> ready to be confin'd within his proper and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
Bounds; and all the World oblig'd to <hi>England</hi> for
its Quiet and Liberty. If, I ſay all theſe Glorious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of our Deliverance do not ſpeak loud enough to
convince us that Providence conſulted our happineſs when
it ſent the Deliverer to <hi>England;</hi> let us be perſwaded by
the vertues of <hi>MARY,</hi> who was her ſelf an Apology for the
Revolution.</p>
            <p>Let us not look for any other Mark of the Approbation
of Heaven, than the rare Piety of that Princeſs. Let the
vertue of our two Illuſtrious Soveraigns magnifie the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the People that call'd them to the Throne; and let
the Proſperity of the people diſplay the wonderful Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God.</p>
            <p>With how much luſter did their vertue ſhine forth on that
Glorious Day, when they accepted a Crown that they had
never ſued for; a Crown that was offer'd them by a Nation
that loves Liberty too well, that is too jealous of its Rights,
too powerful and magnanimous to ſuffer it ſelf to be forc'd
on an occaſion of ſo great importance for its Preſervation
and Safety; and fill'd a Throne to which it may be more
properly ſaid that they were carri'd by the people, than
that they willingly mounted it?</p>
            <p>The united Intereſt of God and the People augmented the
Union of their Generous Souls. After their arrival in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
they ſeemed to have contracted a new Alliance which
was both ſtronger and more ſacred than the firſt. The
King did nothing without the Queens conſent: and the
Queen never attempted any thing, even during the time of
her Adminiſtration, but by the inſpiration of her abſent
Lord. 'Tis impoſſible to praiſe either of them, without
giving the Elogies of both. The Abſence of their Perſons,
could never break the Union of their Souls: and that piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Death which has ſeparated them for ever, is not able to
divide their Glories.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs impoſſible to ſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tears for one of them,
without mourning at the ſame time for the other. All, the
ſplendor that ſurrounds the Throne of <hi>WILLIAM</hi> ſerves
equally to Illuſtrate the Tomb of <hi>MARY;</hi> and the Groans
that are heard in all places for the Death of that <hi>Auguſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47889:12"/>
are as ſo many Illuſtrious Commendations and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Elogies of her Glorious Half, whom God continues
ſtill to preſerve to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some affectionate Spouſes and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Lovers have wiſhed that their Duſt might be mingled
in their Tombs: but how much greater is the Happineſs of
our Royal Pair, who are ſure that their vertues ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
united, and that they ſhall poſſeſs the ſame place, if
not in the Grave, yet at leaſt in the Temple of Memory.</p>
            <p>Our grateful Poſterity will read with delight the Annals
of our Age, which ſhall for ever preſerve the memory of
thoſe immortal Obligations that <hi>England</hi> receiv'd from both
her Defenders. How raviſh'd will the future Readers of
our Hiſtory be to learn that our admrable Princes ſo ſoon
after their Acceſſion to the Throne began to divide the
Cares of the Government between them, that while one
conquer'd his Enemies, the other defended her Subjects;
that <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Conqueror and <hi>MARY</hi> the Deliverer
reſembled ſo perfectly the two bright Stars that govern our
Nights and Days; and that while the former bleſt <hi>Ireland</hi> with
glorious and happy Days, the latter comforted and ſupported
<hi>England</hi> during the gloomy Night of Trouble and Adverſity.</p>
            <p>Her ſecond Regency was ſignaliz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by the entire Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the firſt was, by Victories
that will certainly ſeem incredible to thoſe that ſhall hear
'em related with all their Circumſtances. A Great River
paſs'd in the Sight of the Enemy, a Conſiderably City car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
by Storm, tho' attack'd on a ſide where the Water that
ſurrounded it, ſeem'd to render it impregnable; The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army brav'd by that famous paſſage of our Troops,
and by ſo important a Conqueſt, which they beheld but could
not hinder, are Events, that have ſometimes been ſeen to
happen ſeverally and at a great diſtance, but were then all
united in one amazing Action; while the aſtoniſh'd World,
beheld both Men and Elements ſubdu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d before us, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which of our Victories was moſt glorious. And then,
<hi>Agrim</hi> dy'd with the Blood of our routed Enemies whom we
aſſaulted in their Entrenchments, and in the midſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible
Bogs where they were poſted; and ſo many Cities,
the Retreats of Rebellion, reduc'd either by the Force or
Terror of our Arms; ſo many glorious Advantages which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47889:12"/>
we ow'd not ſo much to the Conduct of our Generals and the
invincible Valour of our Soldiers, as to the Care and Piety of
<hi>MARY,</hi> whom God took pleaſure to favor, and Men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
it their honor to obey; All theſe I ſay were Miracles
of Providence, that were indeed rare and ſurprizing, but
would have been much more ſo, if they had been wrought
for any other than Her.</p>
            <p>It would be hard for us to divert our Thoughts from the
Contemplation of theſe wonderful Subjects, if a greater Event
did not command our Attention, in which the Queen was
more nearly concern'd, and had a more immediate Title to
the Glory with which it Crown'd Her. <hi>France,</hi> having learn'd
by an experience of many years, how neceſſary it was for
the Advancement of her ambitious Grandeur, to enſlave that
Nation, which alone could prevent the execution of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Deſigns upon the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> took the advantage of a
ſpecious pretext of re-inthroning a King that was her Allie,
to ſet forth a Fleet and an Army, which were indeed deſign'd
for the Conqueſt of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Number of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that were imploy'd on this Expedition, while our Troops
were engag'd abroad in a foreign War, the ſecret Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of our Enemies at home, the Diſaffection of ſome
Members of the State, and the Surpriſal and Aſtoniſhment
of the Loyal Party, the cunning and cloſeneſs of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Counſels which they had not forgot on this occaſion,
and above all the King's Abſence who was hazarding his Life
in the Defence of his Neighbours, and for our common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
I ſay, The Conjunction of ſo many threatning
Circumſtances fill'd all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> with the ſame
Apprehenſions for us, that we were wont to be ſenſible of
for them.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not ignorant of theſe Dangers; ſhe ſaw
them ſuch as they were in themſelves and even greater than
they appeared to others. But her Great Soul was not
daunted: And while ſhe was ready to expoſe her Sacred
Perſon to thoſe Dangers that threatned her Countrey; ſhe
appear'd to her Subjects with her wonted Tranquillity; and
ſhow'd them that ſerene Countenance, and that unconcern'd
and Majeſtic Air which commanded Reſpect from all that ſaw
her, and at the ſame time inſpir'd them with Courage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47889:13"/>
She forgot nothing that the moſt active exact Prudence could
ſuggeſt, as ſit to be done in ſuch a juncture, without noiſe or
a too viſible Concern. She ſecur'd the Peace of the Nation,
by ſeizing on thoſe that might have diſturb'd it. She took
care to put the <hi>Militia</hi> in a Condition to ſecond the Army,
and at the ſame time ſhe put the Army in a condition to
reſiſt the Enemy. She entertained Eyes and Ears thro all
the parts of the Kingdom, to obſerve all that occur'd. The
moſt ſecret Cabals of the diſaffected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arty, nor their beſt
conceal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d Magazines could eſcape her diligence. She ſeem'd
to be the univerſal <hi>Genius</hi> of the Kingdom, which encouraged
the Soldiers, animated the Officers, enliven'd the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and filled them all with a noble Reſolution to ſpend
their Blood in the defence of their Country. But her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Care was to engage the Officers of the Fleet to a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
performance of their Duty: She bound them to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with the Ties of Gratitude and Vertue; She entruſted
the ſafety of the Nation to their Honour: And they receiv'd
both her Meſſages and Letters with Tranſports of Zeal and
Affection that they could not hide. They we were filled
with a brave Emulation to out-ſtrip one another in Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Courage; and their Loyalty was quickly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with immortal Lawrels that were dy'd with Blood, and
crowned their Valour.</p>
            <p>How delightful is the Remembrance of thoſe glorious and
happy Days, when the dreaded news of our Enemies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
was prevented by the welcome Account of their Defeat;
when they found a Kingdom, which they expected would
have yielded it ſelf up to their ambition, guarded by floating
Forts, from whoſe brazen mouths they receiv'd a terrible ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
by thoſe fiery Meſſengers of Death that were ſent
to bid them welcome. We have not forgot the time when our
Enemies who, at their ſetting out to invade us, expected with
ſo much impatience the appointed ſignal of their Departure,
were forc'd to content themſelves with the light of their
own burning Ships inſtead of a Signal of Retreat; when
they who had already diſpos'd of <hi>England</hi> and of all its
Riches, its Fleets and its Armies, by whoſe aſſiſtance they
they hoped to haſten the Deſtruction of <hi>Europe,</hi> found their
own Funeral Piles and the end of all their hopes in their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47889:13"/>
flaming Veſſels; when being environ'd by two hoſtile Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they knew not to which of them they ſhould ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
themſelves, or whether to chuſe Burning or Ship
wrack, and at laſt died uncertain whether they periſh'd by
Fire or by Water.</p>
            <p>This ſingle ſucceſs was deſign'd by Providence to uſher in
a ſucceeding Courſe of Victories, and to make way for the
Glories of the laſt Campaign, in which we ſaw a potent
Enemy that was wont to preſcribe Laws to others, yield
without reſiſtance the Empire of the Sea to <hi>England,</hi> whoſe
commanding Flags fly over all the World, and ſecure the
Trade of our Merchants, the Power and Credit of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Provinces of our Allies, and the Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Arms.</p>
            <p>There was a time when <hi>England</hi> felt the miſeries of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
War in her own Bowels, while her Neighbours were in
peace: now ſhe enjoys all the Bleſſings of a profound peace
in the midſt of a War that fills other Nations with Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Ruine. We enjoy without diſturbance the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of our Fields, and of our labours; The Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
flouriſh among us without Interruption. No man is
exempted by the Law of the Sword from yielding Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Laws of the State. Every man is Maſter at home,
and fears not to be puniſh'd by military Execution for his
honeſt Deſire to preſerve what belongs to him.</p>
            <p>Who could have believ'd, and yet who can deny, that the
ſame Perſon whoſe Mind was raviſh'd with an attentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of that Great Spectacle of our Deliverance and
Preſervation, which were alſo the continual Objects of her
Care, who was continually occupied in that glorious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
under the Orders of that providence that protected her,
could at the ſame time be a pattern to all other Women in
the Simplicity of Domeſtic Affairs?</p>
            <p>She order'd the Affairs of her Houſhold with as much Care
and Exactneſs, as if ſhe had not been entruſted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of ſo many Nations; and ſhe manag'd the Affairs
of the Crown with ſo much Application and Succeſs as if ſhe
had never thought on any thing elſe. Nothing was either too
great, or too little for a mind like Hers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47889:14"/>
She ſeem'd to be the Mother as well as the Miſtreſs of all
thoſe Women that Serv'd her: She rewarded the Services
that ſhe receiv'd from them by the Care that ſhe took of them,
and by the Examples of Vertue that ſhe ſet before them. They
that enter'd into her Service were Conſecrated to God; and
in oppoſition to the Cuſtom of almoſt all Ages and Nations,
they that deſir'd to become Courtiers were oblig'd in ſome
ſenſe to renounce the World.</p>
            <p>By the luſtre of her merit, ſhe appear'd worthy of the
Empire of the World: And by the Extenſiveneſs of her
Bounty, ſhe ſeem'd to be the Mother of all the Families in the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>She labour'd earneſtly to make <hi>England</hi> a Divine Monarchy,
or the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and to imprint the Image of Heaven
on theſe <hi>Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> where nothing can be wanting, if
they be not deſtitute of Piety and Truth.</p>
            <p>The Laws which ſhe made, and the Examples which ſhe
gave, ſeem'd to contend which of them ſhould moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
recommend Vertue. But why ſhould we make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between them; ſince the Orders that ſhe eſtabliſh'd to
promote the Service of God are Examples worthy to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by all Soveraigns; and the Examples which ſhe gave
have the force of Laws to all thoſe that have any ſenſe of Piety
or Vertue.</p>
            <p>Princes may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to command every thing
that they do, and to forbid every thing that they do not.
Their Example has an attractive Power to draw others after
them. Both their Vices and their Vertues ſpread themſelves
over all their Dominions; and are in ſome meaſure eterniz'd
by Imitation. The leaſt Crime that they commit renders
them guilty of a thouſand others; and all the Vertues with
which they are adorn'd are inceſſantly reproduced in the
Hearts of an infinite number of perſons that are ambitious of
reſembling them.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly a great Bleſſing to a Nation to have a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
that never gives a bad Example; but this was but the
leaſt Advantage of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that had the happineſs to ſee
the priviledges of Chaſtity and Vertue reſtor'd together with
her Liberty, and the Laws of Honour and Decency re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
as well as thoſe of the State and of Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47889:14"/>
               <hi>MARY</hi> ſcatter'd the Seeds of Almſgiving by her diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Charity, and of all other Vertues by her edifying Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
She reform'd her Subjects by the care which ſhe took to
regulate her own Life, and enur'd even thoſe to honeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
who look upon Idleneſs and Sloth as an Appendix of
their Greatneſs. She allur'd a thouſand Benefactors to the
Poor by an ever-active Charity, which more induſtrious than
Intereſt it ſelf invented new Methods for their Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
She perform'd by the Miniſtry of thoſe who
imitated her Vertue, what God did by hers. The Poor
were oblig'd to her for the Good they receiv'd from
others, as they ow'd to God the Good that ſhe did and
caus'd to be done.</p>
            <p>By her Care Piety was reſtor'd if not to all its Priviledges,
yet at leaſt to a new degree of Reputation. Devotion was
no longer eſteem'd a Weakneſs, and the World was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to pay ſome Reſpect to Religion.</p>
            <p>Religion was her peculiar care. She was no ſooner ſeated
on the Throne, but ſhe began to make it her Buſineſs and her
Pleaſure to defend it, and to preſerve it in its purity. How
careful was ſhe to beſtow the Dignities of the Church on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Perſons? When were theſe Sacred Sources of the
Edification and Inſtruction of the People more pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defil'd?
Never did a tender and loving Mother employ
greater care and circumſpection in the choice of fit Perſons
to be entruſted with the Education of her Children, than ſhe
us'd in the Choice of the Spiritual Fathers of her People;
and never Soveraign conſecrated his Subjects to God with a
purer and more Holy Intention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I appeal to the Teſtimony of
all the World and of almoſt all Ages, whoſe unacquainted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with this vertue is a clear proof of its Worth. How
many Princes are there, who, on ſuch occaſions, are ſway'd
by Unjuſt and Sacrilegious Motives, and favour Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to the prejudice of Vertue, who recompenſe Secular
Services without regard to the Edification of Souls, and
make the Salvation of Mankind and the Glory of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the meaneſt Intereſts, and even ſometimes on the
moſt guilty Paſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47889:15"/>
't would have been eſteem'd the Glory of any other Prince,
to have been able to avoid ſo general a Fault, as that of a
criminal Complaiſance in the choice of the Miniſters of the
Altar; but this was not enough for <hi>MARY.</hi> She recall'd thoſe
bleſſed Times, thoſe happy Ages of the Church, when Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
courted Merit, when Humility and Modeſty were drawn
out of their Retirements, and compell'd to accept thoſe great
Charges which they refus'd; and when <hi>Vertue</hi> thus forcibly
recompens'd had a Right to preach Diſintereſtedneſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
to others.</p>
            <p>By advancing every one according to his Merit, his Gifts
and his <hi>Vertue,</hi> and the Advantage which the People might
receive from him; and by ranking thoſe ſhining Lights in the
Myſtical Heaven of the Church, ſhe imitated that Order and
variety, that pleaſant and uſeful Subordination, with which
an Omniſcient and Eternal Hand has plac'd the Stars in the
Firmament.</p>
            <p>With how much delight and ſatisfaction did good Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that happy Turn of Affairs in <hi>England.</hi> How did they
rejoyce to ſee thoſe whom Perſecution had mark'd out for the
Objects of its Fury, honour'd with the nobleſt Recompences
of their Merit and <hi>Vertue?</hi> To ſee our moſt Illuſtrious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
made our chief Prelates, and to contemplate in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Change, as in a lively Figure, the future Happineſs of the
Univerſal Church, when it ſhall be advanc'd from a State of
Warfare to a State of Glory and Triumph?</p>
            <p>But why do we ſpeak of Triumph and Glory? Have we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that <hi>MARY</hi> is in her Grave. A fatal and cruel Diſeaſe,
and more cruel to us than to her, has forc'd her away from
the Prayers and Deſires of her Subjects, from the Hopes of
the whole World, from the Boſom of a paſſionately lov'd
and loving Husband, and, above all, from the Great Deſigns
of her Piety and Beneficence.</p>
            <p>She was prepar'd to leave us, but we were not prepar'd to
loſe her. The Diſmal Tidings of her Sickneſs fill'd every
Heart with Woe, and every Mouth with Lamentations: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one begs God to ſhorten his Days and to add them to
ſo precious a Life. An Univerſal Cry was heard thro' the
whole Nation, or rather thro' all thoſe Nations who depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her by the deareſt and moſt Sacred Ties of Religion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47889:15"/>
and Gratitude, a Cry of Mourning and of Supplication, which
doubtleſs would have reach'd to the Throne of God, if our
Sins had not been ſtronger than our Prayers.</p>
            <p>Yet all endeavor to flatter themſelves with ſome hopes.
None are willing to deny themſelves the pleaſure of believing
what they deſire; and even, after all hopes were taken
away, we durſt not think of her Death.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it approach'd, that inexorable Death, which
by one Blow pierc'd the Hearts of an infinite number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
It was the Terror of all the World; but <hi>MARY</hi>
was prepared to receive it.</p>
            <p>Already her tender Heart had bore the ſhock of a ſharp
Conflict between Nature and Grace; and the firſt triumph'd
over the latter, tho it was forc'd to ſtruggle hard for the
<hi>Victory,</hi> when ſhe beheld her dear and deſpairing Lord ready
to expire before her, and juſt ſinking under the weight of
his Sorrow. Forgive, great God, this laſt Effort of her
Tenderneſs, theſe Remainders of a Paſſion that will be quickly
extinguiſh'd. Thou know'ſt the cloſeneſs of the Union that
link'd theſe two Illuſtrious Hearts, nor could they poſſibly
conſent without pain to ſo killing a ſeparation.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had offer'd up to God this laſt Sacrifice of her
Love, which was the hardeſt but a neceſſary part of her dying
Task, ſhe hears without diſturbance the fatal <hi>Meſſage,</hi> which
they who brought it could not deliver without trembling.</p>
            <p>She thanks the Author of her Salvation that ſhe was not
now to prepare for her end; ſhe gives the Glory to God
that had inſpir'd her with a ſenſe of better things; ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
with joy that her Religion had taught her not to
truſt her Great Intereſt to the Uncertainties of a late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and can cheerfully cry, with the great Exemplar of
Submiſſion, <hi>Lo I come to thy Will O God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She fears to loſe the remaining Moments of her Life; ſhe
employs them in hearkening to ſeaſonable Inſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her God, and approaching Paſſage to Glory, and takes
care that the continual Reading of pious Books may ſupply
the place of an uninterrupted Exhortation.</p>
            <p>She expreſſes her Piety more by Actions than by Words;
but thoſe few Words that ſhe uſes are full of the Spirit of
Chriſtianity and Holineſs. She does nothing out of Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and omits nothing that may ſerve for the public
Edification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47889:16"/>
Twice ſhe communicated with Chriſt, at the beginning of
her Sickneſs by Works of Charity, and towards the end of
it in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: Firſt, with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt, by a chearful diſtribution of Alms, and then,
with Chriſt himſelf, who repaid in Grace and ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations,
what he had receiv'd from her in temporal Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and after he had comforted on her Death-bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
her into the Manſions of his Glory.</p>
            <p>Thus ended that Life which was ſo uſeful to the World,
and ſo dear to the Church of God; which ſhe, or we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
loſt, in the Height of its Glory, in a flouriſhing Age,
and at a time when her Affairs were in a very proſperous
ſtate. Thus were thoſe charitable Eyes forever ſhut, that
were always wont to be Meſſengers of Good Tidings to the
Poor, thoſe Ears that were always attentive to their Cry,
and that Mouth which ſeem'd never to open but to do them
good, to promiſe them relief, or to interceed for them.
<hi>MARY</hi> ſhall hear no more the Groans of the afflicted, that
were wont to pierce her tender Soul; and they ſhall ſee her
no more, who was always ready to aſſiſt and comfort them:
She is now in a place where there are no Objects of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<hi>MARY</hi> is dead to live again; ſhe has left her Throne
here to aſcend to one above the Stars: She is now raiſing the
Joys of Heaven, and has fill'd the Earth with Mourning
and Deſolation.</p>
            <p>Scarce had ſhe vaniſh'd from our ſight, when her Merit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in all its ſplender to the Eyes of the Univerſe, was
celebrated by the Tears or Praiſes of all ſorts of Perſons,
and publickly extoll'd in all languages, becauſe ſhe was a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs
to all Nations. She has left no man the liberty to
ſpeak or be ſilent: Every one praiſes her according to his
ability; and they who relate her Words and Actions with
the greateſt ſimplicity give the higheſt Idea of her Vertue.</p>
            <p>A thouſand Eloquent Mouths praiſe her, or are ſilent only
becauſe they are conſcious to themſelves that they cannot
praiſe her worthily. Others having begun to write her
Character, are interrupted by Sighs and Tears, which will
not ſuffer them to finiſh their Undertaking. Orators, ſcarce
able to follow at a diſtance the ſublime Flights of her Vertues,
ſeem to have recourſe to Fiction in their deſcriptions of them;
and Poets, to paint forth ſo real and ſacred a merit, are forc'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47889:16"/>
for the firſt time, to borrow the natural and unaffected Language
of Truth. The Poet without Fiction, and the Orator without
Diſguiſe, in their ordinary diſcourſe, ſpeak things of her now
at her Death which they neither durſt, nor could without
Flattery have prefag'd at her Birth.</p>
            <p>How vain, yet commendable are all our Endeavours to adorn
her Tomb? In vain Crouds of her Subjects, grateful to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſt
Benefactreſs, and juſt to her Memory, run to ſee, and to
augment by their Preſence the Pomp of her Funeral.</p>
            <p>There are no Obſequies worthy of <hi>MARY,</hi> or if there are;
they moſt only conſiſt in the Works of her Piety, and in Sghts
that we owe to her Vertue: the Poor watering her Tomb with
their Tears, the Vertues weeping round her Monument, our
reſtor'd Laws ſupplying the place of her Titles and of the marks
of her Dignity, the numerous and magnificent Train of all thoſe
that were either reliev'd by her Bounty, protected by her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or defended by her Wiſdom, the great Examples of
her Life expos'd to the Eyes of the World, her Country and
Religion following their dear Preſerver, and Liberty carri'd as
in triumph, in a Chariot, without the wretched Attendance of
miſerable Captives, or oppreſt Nations. What can there be
in all this Pomp, that ſtrikes the Eyes of a wondring Nation
with a more agreeable ſplendor, than the Nation it ſelf freed
from the Yoke that was to be impos'd upon it? Is there any thing
more Glorious in the Funeral Oration which the Chief Miniſter
of our Religion pronounc'd before his liſtening Auditory, than
the Liberty that he has to ſpeak, and we to hear him, in that
place. And among all that Aſſembly of mourning Sages, who ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

light of the World, and the Benefactreſs of Mankind, till the
final Conſummation of all Things. But the Grief that is occaſion'd
by her Death ſhall not be eternal: She that is a ſource of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to us, ſhall be the Joy of ſucceeding Ages, who will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that ſhe died to remember only that ſhe was born: and will
change the Cypreſs of her Funeral into Noſegays and Garlands,
which they will ſtrew upon her Tomb.</p>
            <p>But whether are we carried by a Zeal that loſes it ſelf equally
both in Joy and Grief. Can we forget that <hi>MARY</hi> rejected thoſe
vain Applauſes during her Life, and condemns them yet more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
Death; that on the Throne ſhe gave us Leſſons of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in her Tomb preaches to us the vanity of the World;
that in the dark apartments of the Grave ſhe impoſes ſilence one
Pride, and reigning with God in the Heavens commands our
Grief to be ſilent; and that pointing ſometimes to her Tomb, and
ſometimes to the Throne where ſhe is ſeated, ſhe does by turns
comfort us, and exhort us to Humility.</p>

of humane Grandeur with a mightier voice than ever yet ſtruck
our Ears: She exhorts us to approach and behold thoſe who
govern'd this Kingdom and her who preſerv'd it, that we may
may ſee the poor remainders of all their ancient ſplendor, and
of the vain Applauſe of Men. But ſhe is ſtill more humbl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d in

the diſmal Pomp of Death; ſhe ſurrenders all the Glories of her
Life and the Honours that ſhe receiv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d at her Death, to that
God to whom all Honor and Glory belongs.</p>
            <p>GOD, ſhe cries, is your only Benefactor, the only Deliverer
