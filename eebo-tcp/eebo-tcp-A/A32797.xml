            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> was given them by reaſon of their Addreſs and Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in penetrating even in the moſt difficult and dangerous places ſuch as the mouth of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes,</hi> whereby they made War with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars. Coſa</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Poliſh, a Goat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48502:8"/>Long agoe from the time of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the I. there were Voluntiers from the frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia, Wolhinia, Podolia,</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>Poland,</hi> which met together to practiſe their Pyracies upon the <hi>Black Sea</hi> where they ordinarily met with conſiderable advantages, and brought away rich booty both from the Turkiſh Galleys and from the places where they often landed in <hi>Natolia,</hi> where they pillaged and ſacked whole Towns, as that of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> and <hi>Synopa,</hi> having the boldneſs ſometimes to come within two Leagues of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and carry away priſoners and plunder: at the latter end of the year theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers retired home, appointing firſt their Rendezvous where they were to meet in the Spring in ſome of the Iſlands or Rocks of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> from thence again to make their excurſions.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Stephen Batory,</hi> to whom <hi>Poland</hi> is beholden for many good Rules, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſervice which he might draw from theſe Rovers, towards the defence of the frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48502:8"/>
               <hi>Podolia,</hi> which lay always expoſed to the incurſions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> formed a Militia out of them, and gave them the Town of <hi>Trethymirow</hi> upon the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes</hi> for a Garriſon, made a General over them, and gave him power to make under-Officers, granting them beſides their pay, divers priviledges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and joyned to this Infantry of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> two thouſand Horſe, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of which he deſigned the fourth part of his Crown-Lands whence they were called <hi>Quartani,</hi> and by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Quartiani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe forces thus eſtabliſhed for the guard of the frontiers, did ſo ſecure it againſt the irruptions of the <hi>Tartars</hi> that all the deſart Countrey, beyond the Towns of <hi>Bracklaw, Bar,</hi> and <hi>Kiovia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be peopled, and many Towns and Fortreſſes were built there, every one bringing in Colonies from the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces.</p>
            <p>This Militia thus regulated; ſuſtained it ſelf and rendred good ſervice to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48502:9"/>
Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> without compariſon, more profitably then before, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſed and ſcattered about, they could not act together in company. Yet as this union was ſo advantagious for the making head againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and for defending of the Frontiers, ſo in ſhort time it became prejudicial and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the <hi>Poles,</hi> againſt whom they many times rebelled; for the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> finding themſelves to be of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, would ſcarce receive any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from their Superiors, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Maſters upon whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. Their firſt Rebellion was in 1587. under <hi>John Podkowa,</hi> their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who was overthrown, and in the end loſt his head.</p>
            <p>In the year 1596. King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the III. having prohibited their Pyracies on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> upon the complaints which he received from the Grand Signior; they did indeed give them over, but it was, that they might fall upon <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania</hi> with the greater force, where they committed unheard of violences
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48502:9"/>
under the Conduct of <hi>Naleuaiko</hi> their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. In vain were Orders ſent for their diſarming and returning home, they deſpiſed all, and united themſelves more ſtrictly under their head, to reſiſt the Poliſh Army, which General <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiewski</hi> was forced to bring againſt them, him therefore they expected with a firm reſolution near the City of <hi>Bialicerkiew</hi> and fought the Polanders, and at firſt got the better, but <hi>Zolkiewski,</hi> who was a great Warrier, having at length ſhut them in, and forced them into diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious ſtations, obliged them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up <hi>Nalevaiko,</hi> who had the ſame end with his Predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>In 1637. the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> revolted again, but with as bad ſucceſs as before, the cauſe of their Revolt was, That divers of the Poliſh Nobility having obtained by gift ſome Lands upon thoſe fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and in thoſe places deſigned for the quartering of this Militia, the more to augment their Revenues they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bring their new Subjects to the ſame days works as thoſe of the other

built onely upon a bottom of Willow or Limetree, ſided or raiſed with plancks, which they pin one into another; the better to ſteer them when they are forced to flye, they have two Oars or Skulls on purpoſe, their ſides are ſtrengthened with Roaps of Reeds, as thick as a Barrel, to ſuſtain theſe Boats againſt the fury of the waves, they have ordinarily ten or twelve Oars on each ſide, and rowe ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys; they have but a bad ſail, and make uſe of it onely in fair weather, and chooſe rather to rowe when the wind is high; for their proviſions in their voyage they take with them Biſcuit, put up in a Tunn, and as they have uſe for it, take it out at the bung: beſides this, they have a Barrel of boiled Millet, and another of Paſte mingled with water which they eat with the Millet, and it ſerves them both for meat and drink, and is counted by them a delitious diſh; they carry no <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> nor other Strong-waters, for although they be as ſubject to drunkenneſs as any other Northern Nation, yet they are wonderfully ſober in War.</p>

            <p>When they meet with any Galley or Veſſel (which they diſcover better, and at a greater diſtance then they can be diſcovered) their Boats being but two foot and an half above water) they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards them till night, keeping at about a Leagues diſtance, and then well obſerving the place where they ſaw the veſſel, they begin to rowe about midnight with all their force, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing it about, take it at unawares, it being impoſſible for a Veſſel beſet with ſuch a number of Boats all at once, to diſingage or defend itſelf; they take out the Money, Guns, and all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe which they can conveniently carry away, and afterwards ſink the ſhip, they being not dextrous enough to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her off, but as they have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by night over ſhips and Galleys,

either upon what is under the Snow, or upon the Branches or ſprouts of Trees, Pine tops, Straw, or any thing they can find; the chief of the <hi>Tartars</hi> have <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſes, and their <hi>Cham</hi> very good Race-horſes.</p>
            <p>The travelling <hi>Tartars</hi> ſcarce eat any bread coming ſeldom into places, where it is to be had, but they make uſe of <hi>Millet,</hi> which is very common amongſt them, with which they make their Drink and Pottage; and eat ordinarily Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh which they boil when they are at leiſure, either alone or with their Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, but when they goe to war and are upon their March, they make it ready, or rather mortify, or juſt heat it, under their Saddles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eat it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in this condition without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſauce then the froth upon the Fleſh, made by the ſweating of the Horſe; neither doe they chooſe the moſt fat or the moſt ſound and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Horſes to make their Proviſion of, but they take ſuch as are ſpent with their long marches, or are ſick and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48502:30"/>
lame, and I have ſeen at my being in <hi>Poland,</hi> divers <hi>Tartar</hi> priſoners come and take away dead Horſes out of the Stables to feaſt one another with, ſo that there is no fear in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys that the carcaſſes of dead Beaſts ſhould infect the Air, they will take an order for that, and not fail to carry them away, aſſoon as they know where they are; the uſe of Wine being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them by the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> their drink is ordinarily clear water, and in winter ſnow, when the Brooks and Rivers are frozen over, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the broth made with their Horſefleſh, and the Skumme, or elſe <hi>Breha,</hi> which is a drink made with boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Millet, but thoſe who are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, and more delicate, drink Mares milk, Mead, and Strong waters, and eat Lamb, Kid, Fowls, and all ſort of Game which they take; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting much in Hunting and Fowling; but all abſtain from Swines-fleſh, and one may ſay this of them in general, that they are ſober and continent; as for the <hi>Cham</hi> himſelf he keeps a

            <p>Their Language is much like the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> both of them having the ſame original, onely the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> is more mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> words; their Religion is the <hi>Mahumetan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to their Morals, there are very few Nations to be found leſs viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for beſides their continence, they are extremely ſincere, and faithful, they have no Thieves or falſe witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, little injuſtice or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and live in Union and great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility; as to their haraſing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Countreys, they doe not think they commit any fault or injuſtice in doing it, ſeeing that they are eſteemed by them as people that are Infidels and abominable.</p>
            <p>The marvellous fidelity of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Tartars</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> is every day to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48502:31"/>
obſerved, who never fail to return at the time appointed, when they are let looſe upon their word to goe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Liberties by the exchange of <hi>Poliſh</hi> priſoners, which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute punctually, or return themſelves not failing a minute; and I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt the young <hi>Tartars,</hi> which are in their ſervice, with the keys of their Money and Jewels, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Houſhold.</p>

no other <hi>Code</hi> but the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and no other interpreter of that but their own common Senſe; the parties plead their own Caſes, which are briefly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſpatched; the <hi>Cham</hi> himſelf doth Juſtice, and determines Controverſies, eſpecially when he goeth forth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, without acception of perſons, hearing the poor as well as the rich.

            <p>The forces of this Prince are very numerous, for gathering together all the hords, of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who doe either obey him or are his Allies, he is able to bring into the field many thouſand Horſe; they have no Foot but ſome <hi>Janiſaries</hi> which they receive from the <hi>Turk</hi> upon any expedition which they make by his Order or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; there are ſome few Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

            </p>
            <p>The wars which the <hi>Tartars</hi> ordinarily make, are rather an inroad then any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>How ſtrict peace ſoever they have with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> their neighbors, they doe not fail to viſit them often, either upon their inclination, or upon the Command of the <hi>Cham,</hi> who always pretends to a Tribute from the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> which they have paid ſometimes when neceſſity hath forced them, and refuſed at others, as not being willing to ſubject themſelves to theſe acknowledgements towards

               <hi>Infidels,</hi> and thoſe whom they diſpiſe.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Tartars</hi> would make any great inroad either into <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>; they chooſe ordinarily the full Moon of <hi>January,</hi> all the Rivers, Lakes and Marſhes, being then frozen, and the Earth, eſpecially in the plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts covered with Snow, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commodious for their Horſes which are not ſhod; every <hi>Tartar</hi> carrieth two with him, either for change, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his booty and proviſion; neither is his proviſion very weighty, conſiſting onely of a little <hi>Millet,</hi> dried Fleſh powdered after the manner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſome Garlick, which they hold ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to digeſt ſo many crude Meats as they eat, and many times they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing, feeding onely upon the fleſh of their Horſes which periſh in their march; they take their way through the Valleys and moſt obſcure paſſages, that they may not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who always keep Centry and Watch, and are out upon parties to hear news of them, and ſo to allarm the Countrey. That which is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48502:33"/>
moſt ſurpriſing is, That in the middle of winter they incamp without fire, for fear of being diſcovered, and eat lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but Horſefleſh ſtewed under their Saddles; when they are arrived at thoſe places where they intended, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain</hi> or elſewhere, their Generals let looſe one third part of their Army, which is divided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Troops, and theſe over-run and pillage all the Countrey five or ſix Leagues about the wings of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; their main body in the mean time keeping cloſe together, to be in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to fight their Enemies, if their ſhould be occaſion; afterwards this party being returned, they let looſe another in its turn, obſerving always this Order, That all their Troops which run up and down, may in a few hours return to the body of their Army: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have pillaged and harraſed the Countrey five or ſix days, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as faſt as they can, that they may not be ſet upon in their retreat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regained the open deſart Plains, where their Body conſiſting of Horſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48502:34"/>
they have great advantage in fight; they make a halt to refreſh themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and to ſhare the Booty and Priſoners. They make their incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo in Summer, but not in ſuch great numbers, ſeldom ſo many as ten thouſand together, and theſe are the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Budziak,</hi> who at that ſeaſon lead their Horſes and Cattel into the Plains to feed, and ſo getting ground, they of a ſuddain run out and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all they meet; nor is it eaſie to ſtop them but with a thouſand men, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always in <hi>Tabor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> fight not but in great Troops of two, three, or four thouſand Horſe, and ſeldom give battle but when they are much the ſtronger, and when their Army is forced and broken up by the enemy, they ſcatter and diſperſe themſelves into ſo many little Troops, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> who march cloſe and by ſquadrons, know not which to ſet upon in their retreat; they ſhoot their Arrows from behind them, with ſuch exactneſs as to hit
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48502:34"/>
thoſe who purſue them at two hundred paces diſtance, and at a quarter of a League from thence rally their forces again and return preſently to charge; this they repeat often, it being their manner of fighting, but it is onely thus, when they are the greateſt number, for otherwiſe when they once run, it is full ſpeed, and not to return again, and it is difficult to ſurpriſe them, they keeping ſtrict watch all night, not eaſie to defeat them, unleſs it be in ſome ſtreight, or upon ſome paſs of a River.</p>
            <p>The priſoners which they take, they make Slaves and ſell them to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Caffa,</hi> and other places of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who either keep them to wait upon themſelves, or to look after their Cattle, or till the Ground, entertaining with the ſame face as we have formerly ſpoken of, as divers <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Officers have related unto me; amongſt others, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Collonel <hi>Nicolai,</hi> and Captain <hi>Crouſtade,</hi> who moſt unfortunately fell into their hands; but the <hi>Poles</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

in the year 1621. to <hi>Choczin</hi> upon the <hi>Nieſtre</hi> with an Army of four hundred thouſand men, and ſeemed to ſwallow up the Kingdom, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the ſame time the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> entred into <hi>Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a conſiderable force, yet have the <hi>Poles</hi> made head againſt all theſe Enemies, though never ſo redoubtable, and thoſe Wars never appeared ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them, as that which inſued upon the defection of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in the year 1648. almoſt at the very moment of the death of their King, for theſe Rebels did not onely ingage all thoſe of <hi>Black Ruſſia</hi> to riſe with them, but at once laying off all that mortal and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable hatred which they have always had for the <hi>Tartars,</hi> they made a League with them, and did proceed further to implore the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Turk</hi> towards the total ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having therefore joyned their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with thoſe of the Infidels, they made in leſs then four years time, four great

irruptions into this Kingdom with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of two or three hundred thouſand fighting men, who were the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, by reaſon that their Infantry, hardned to all labor and injuries of the weather, and ſufficiently warlike by their frequent incountring the <hi>Tartars</hi> invaſions, were now ſuſtained and backed by the <hi>Tartar</hi> Cavalry, which without contradiction would be the beſt in the world if it were exerciſed with the ſame Martial Diſcipline as that of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

died in the field. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managing this advantage, had the Glory which ordinarily accompanies the firſt victory, made head againſt the reſt of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of about five thouſand men, and whoſe Commanders having long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the news of their firſt Troops ordered towards the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> and now being certainly informed of their defeat, as that alſo the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them, and that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were joyned with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to retreat, for the preſervation of the forces of the Kingdom, but it was now too late, for the <hi>Bacmates</hi>

            <p>This misfortune which happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Korſun,</hi> became more ſenſible to <hi>Poland</hi> by reaſon of the death of King <hi>

            <p>The Kings death was not preſently known to <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> who, if he had been informed of it, would not have failed to have ſhown more fierceneſs then he did after the defeat of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Army; upon which he wrote a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubmiſſive Letter to the King, in which he laid all that was paſſed upon the inſolence of the Governors, and upon the Rapines and inſupportable Exactions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who for Farmers of the Kings Land, and of many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Eſtates, he asked pardon for what he was conſtrained to doe in his own defencc, promiſed to ſend back the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and to live in obedience to his Majeſty, if he would be pleaſed to maintain him and his <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in their liberty and priviledges granted them by the former Kings his predeceſſors, but a while after he underſtood the King was dead, by a Letter ſent him
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48502:41"/>
from <hi>Adam Kiſiel</hi> Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi> by the hands of a <hi>Greek</hi> Monk: this Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine who was alſo a <hi>Greek,</hi> uſed very milde and obliging expreſſions to bring back the head of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſetting forth to him the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient fidelity of the <hi>Zaporowski Coſſacks,</hi> who though they were very jealous of their Liberty, were always very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and lived in a State where all perſons, but chiefly Men of War, had always free acceſs to make good their intereſts, and to complain of their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they received; that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely Senator of the <hi>Greek</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Protector of their Rites and Churches, which he did always moſt heartily defend: did conjure him by the Saintity of the ſame Religion, and the Honour of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Nation, that he would ſend home the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and lead the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> back into their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtations, and that in the mean time he would depute ſome perſons to make known the injuries which they and he in particular had received, and to deſire ſome redreſs, offering his own care
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48502:41"/>
and ſervices to help them to all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they could pretend to, and withal, he was a perſon of that rank and quality in the State, that no Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations or Orders could be given either for peace or war, without his being advertiſed of it; but he aſſured them, he ſhould always be inclined to have theſe diſorders terminated in a peaceable way, rather then to have them entertained by the continuation of a Civil war; and that their Arms at preſent imployed in their mutual Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, might be more profitably, and gloriouſly made uſe of againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtendome. The <hi>Tartars</hi> were apt upon the leaſt occaſion to take up Arms, but their firſt heat and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler being paſt, they returned of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and were reconciled without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mediation, they ſhould therefore take their leaves of them, and retain nothing but this laudable cuſtom of theirs. The Monk who carried this Letter was in great danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with much difficulty, he arrived
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48502:42"/>
at the Camp of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> which he found confuſed enough; the General called the ſoldiery together in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous way, had the Letter read before them, and was the firſt himſelf who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Council of the Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi>; and being backed by the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of voices, it was determined that all acts of hoſtility ſhould ceaſe, and that they ſhould wait for an anſwer from the Court of <hi>Poland</hi>; that the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſhould be ſent back into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Plains, with Orders there to keep themſelves ready upon all occaſions, and that the Palatine ſhould be invited to come to the Camp. This moderation of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> when his affairs were at that heighth, ſurprized all the world, although it were not void of artifice, for as on one ſide it appeared that he had put a ſtop to the courſe of his victories, to hinder any further blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and to obtain pardon more eaſily, ſo on the other, he made this oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his power to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> to extort from them, what he could not perhaps have obtained onely by his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48502:42"/>
ſubmiſſion. Retiring therefore into the Town of <hi>Bialacerkiew,</hi> he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quiet, while that <hi>Crzivonos,</hi> another Commander of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> a perſon of little worth, but bold and horribly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, harraſſed <hi>Black Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Podolia, Kmielniski</hi> pretended to diſallow of theſe violences, and promiſed to put this <hi>Crzivonos</hi> and five other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Peaſants in Rebellion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> but this was all to amuſe them, that he might at the ſame time the better ſeize upon the fortreſs of <hi>Bar.</hi>

               <hi>Jeremiah Michael</hi> Duke of <hi>Wiſnowitz</hi> arriving on the borders of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> with ſome Troops, to whom were joyned thoſe of <hi>Janus Tiskewitz,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Kiovia,</hi> and the Kings Regiment of Guards, Commanded by <hi>Oſſinski,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> oppoſed theſe incurſions of <hi>Crzivonos,</hi> and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his progreſs who would otherwiſe have overrun the Kingdom with thoſe great numbers with him. Many other Troops and the Rear made up of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48502:43"/>
Nobility of the Frontiers, making a new Army, they marched againſt the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and the rebellious Peaſants, after they had endeavoured a ſecond time, but all in vain, to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>The State of <hi>Poland</hi> was made more ſenſible upon this occaſion then ever before of the greatneſs of that loſs which it ſuſtained by the death of their King; there being now no perſon of Authority enough to Command ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Great men as were at that time in the Army, who would by no means give place to one another and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and diſorders at length grew ſo high, that the moſt judicious, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what condition affairs were, thought it abſolutely neceſſary to avoid fighting; in purſuance of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, it was reſolved that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in good order in the middle of their <hi>Tabor</hi> towards <hi>Conſtantinow</hi>; but theſe Orders were ſo ill underſtood then, when ſome Troops about <hi>Pilaucze</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48502:43"/>
began to move; others not waiting their times, marched away before the reſt, and began a confuſion, which being increaſed by the obſcurity of the night, and communicated to all that followed, it ſtruck ſuch a panick fear into the whole Army, that even the moſt brave were not exempt from it, who could not be ſo ſoon informed of the cauſe of this general flight and conſternation: This would have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an intire victory to <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> if he had not been involved in the ſame ignorance, but he knew ſo little of what paſſed, that he took this flight of the <hi>Polanders</hi> for a ſtratagem, nor could he beleeve the truth of the report, and inſtead of purſuing them with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he contented himſelf to follow them ſlowly, and with all circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till at length being undeceived, with a ſad heart he turned his forces againſt <hi>Leopold,</hi> a Town very conſiderable for its Trade, eſpecially into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and indifferently ſtrong, but at that time not furniſhed with Forces or Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fit for its defence. <hi>Arciſſenski</hi> an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48502:44"/>
old Officer who had a long time ſerved abroad, and been a Commander under the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Braſil,</hi> was left therein, and put in hopes of being ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the <hi>Leſſer Poland.</hi> The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants Commanded by this Officer made a ſtrong reſiſtance for ſome days, but the Caſtle forſaken by thoſe who defended it, being taken by the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and there being little hope left of holding out long againſt ſo numerous an Army as lay before the Town, and the want of Proviſions being afflicting already, they redeemed themſelves and bought off the Enemy from the Walls with a conſiderable ſum.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> having quitted <hi>Leopold,</hi> came before <hi>Zamoſcie,</hi> a Town forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied after the modern way by <hi>John Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moski,</hi> Great General, and Great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Poland</hi> in the time of King <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund,</hi> Father to the two laſt Kings.</p>
            <p>This place was at that time the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſylum for the Nobility of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who had been driven from their Eſtates by the revolted Peaſants, and there
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48502:44"/>
being a good party in the Town from the Palatinates of <hi>Belz,</hi> and <hi>Sendomir,</hi> and fifteen hundred men which <hi>Louis Weiher</hi> Palatine of <hi>Pomerania</hi> had brought thither out of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>; all the attempts which the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Peaſants made for a months time, were all in vain, ſo that after they had loſt many men, they retreated to the bottom of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt not paſs over in ſilence the aſſiſtance which the <hi>Poles</hi> received from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fire of Civil war began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be kindled in <hi>France,</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the eight hundred Auxiliaries raiſed at his expence by Colonel <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Przemski,</hi> who Commanded a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Regiment in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould be joyned to the <hi>Poles</hi> Army under the ſame Colonel, who out of this recruit form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one good Regiment. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired with his Forces into their Winter Quarters; ſome great perſons on the behalf of <hi>Poland</hi> begun to treat with him of Peace, but they received
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48502:45"/>
very haughty anſwers, all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the laſt Campagne having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him more inſolent then before, ſo that it was as much as they could doe to prevail with him to conſent to a truce for ſome moneths.</p>
            <p>The Praeludes of a new war began on both ſides before the time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; the Rebels forces provoked the <hi>Poliſh</hi> in divers places, but bore away the marks of their fool-hardineſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been worſted almoſt every where by <hi>Andrew Firley,</hi> Governor of <hi>Belz,</hi> and <hi>Staniſlaus Landskoroniski,</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>Camieneche,</hi> between whom the new King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> preſently after his election, divided the Command of his forces, they received amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very notable ſhocks at <hi>Zwiehal, Oſtropol, Bar,</hi> and other places, which were retaken, with great deſtruction of the Rebels, and rich booty to the <hi>Polanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> ſeeing that the Spring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, which he expected with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48502:45"/>
after that he had called in the <hi>Tartars</hi> again, took the field to make a new inroad into <hi>Poland</hi>: the <hi>Poles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gathered together to croſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and their Commanders having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated in what place they ought to ſtay, till the reſt of the Forces of the Kingdom were come up to them; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many advices, of which, one amongſt others was to lodge under the Cannon of <hi>Camieneſche,</hi> the importance of which Fortreſs being a bar againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> was ſuch, that the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it deſerved that it ſhould be preferred before any other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever; the advice of <hi>Firley</hi> prevailed, who judging it not fit to draw off the Army from the frontiers, leſt they ſhould be expoſed to the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Enemy, made choice of the Town of <hi>Zbaras,</hi> belonging to the Duke <hi>Wiſnowitski,</hi> as a place moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for his deſign, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of thoſe recruits which they expected, he had no more then nine thouſand men with him, taking in thoſe Troops which ſome Noble-men had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48502:46"/>
raiſed at their own expences, he had with him amongſt other Commanders, <hi>Landskoronski,</hi> the Count of <hi>Oſtorog,</hi> Great Cup-bearer to the Crown, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him as Colleagues; Duke <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, Jeremiah Michael Wiſnowitski,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Konieſpolski,</hi> Great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to the Crown, Son of the defunct Great General of the ſame name. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Firley</hi> foreſeeing that he ſhould ſoon be environed with an Army almoſt innumerable, did preſently furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with proviſions, and repaired the old Fortifications as well of the Town as of the Caſtle of <hi>Zbaras,</hi> and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Camp by a good intrenchment flancked with Forts and Redoubts, and taking a particular care of a certain Lake which furniſhed him abundantly with water, that it might by no means be turned away by the enemy. He was no ſooner intrenched, but the Army of the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks</hi> came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed them in on all ſides in ſuch numbers, that there have been ſeldom ſeen the like forces together, ſince thoſe of <hi>Attila</hi> and <hi>Tamberlan</hi>; and that which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48502:46"/>
was never known before, the Cham himſelf was there in perſon, thinking to ſwallow up the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> as a prey, which could not eſcape him, and which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> did not fail to make him believe infallibly his own; ſo that he made ſo little eſteem of this handful of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Soldiers, which were the onely forces which appeared then to defend the Frontiers; that he reſolved not to take them by Famine, but to force their Camp, which he thought he might ſo much the more eaſily execute by reaſon that the number of his Army was ſuch, that he had no need to be ſparing of his Men.</p>
            <p>He made a General Aſſault upon the 13 of <hi>July,</hi> 1649. which was very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he himſelf at the Head of his Forces; who not underſtanding well the danger, and unacquainted with the <hi>Poliſh</hi> valor, ruſhed on deſperately to this Attack; the cheif aſſault was made upon the Quarters of General <hi>Firley,</hi> as moſt of all expoſed. Thoſe that aſſaulted them, were under covert by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48502:47"/>
the convenience of a Neighboring Valley: So that ſome of them, who had already forced the intrenchment, were beaten off with great difficulty. <hi>Firley</hi> and Prince <hi>Wiſnowitski</hi> defended themſelves valiantly; the latter ſeeing his Men begin to give way. prohibited them by his command ſhooting any longer againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom he gave out to have promiſed Peace and Friendſhip to their Generals; and by this Artifice, encouraged and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Soldiers ſo far, that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing now they had onely the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to deal withal, had new vigor infuſed into them, and after having ſlain a great number, repulſed the reſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at their deſperate bravery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now ſuſtained that ſame day ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen aſſaults.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> renewed them again the following days, but ſtill with leſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, although they joyned ſtratagems to force, for to make the <hi>Polanders</hi> think that they had received new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the <hi>Turks,</hi> they habited divers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48502:47"/>
of their own after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, who conducted a Party of Horſe the ſame way habited, but were really onely <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſts ſtuffed with Straw, and ſet on Horsback. But the manner of this deceit was eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the <hi>Polanders</hi> by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Glaſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> ſent in Letters often, in ſome of which he exhorted <hi>Firley</hi> to an accommodation; in others, he ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the <hi>German</hi> Troops to deſert them; but finding that he prevailed nothing, either by force or art, he thought upon attacking the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp by approaches, and imployed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Peaſants who were in great number in his Army, to work in them day and night; ſo that in few days he advanced them to the very foot of their Intrenchment.</p>
            <p>This new attempt of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> troubled the <hi>Poles</hi> more then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſeeing that they were now ſhut up cloſer, and that it would be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48502:48"/>
difficult for them to maintain their firſt intrenchment, they made others nearer to the Town: Into which, they retired themſelves as ſoon as they were perfected, and divers, even of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers themſelves, were of opinion, that they ſhould quit all that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſhut themſelves up into the place; but this advice appearing very dangerous, was not followed. But beſides the extremity they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, in having ſcarce any ſpace left them to ſtir in, their Proviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſcarce, and their Provender for their Horſes; So that they dying every day in heaps, cauſed an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable ſtink in the Camp. A morſel of Bread was ſold for Ten Poltoracks, and a Tun of Beer for Fifty Florins<note place="margin">Polto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks is about Two-pence Engliſh. A Florin Twenty Polto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks.</note>. The Soldiers lived upon no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, then the Fleſh of Dogs and Horſes. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> knowing in what condition the beſieged were, became more inſolent, and would grant them no terms but what were very hard. The Cham ſhewed himſelf more courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet having demanded that <hi>Wiſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witski</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48502:48"/>
and <hi>Konieſpolski</hi> ſhould come and confer with him. And the <hi>Poland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> refuſing that theſe great perſons ſhould put themſelves into his hands, he was very much offended. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Generals might well ſend Meſſengers to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to let him know in what extremity they were, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a ſpeedy relief; for moſt of them fell into the hands of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi>; and if any one eſcaped in their going out, yet they received no anſwer, they being either killed or taken priſoners in their return. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Generals pretended, that from time to time they received news from His Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi>; and that he would ſpeedily come to relieve them; and that it might be the more firmly believed, they affixed the Kings Seal to the Letters which they feigned, having taken it off from other Letters which they had formerly received. Thus they encouraged the beſieged Army, and induced them to have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, both by the artifice and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Diſcourſe.</p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48502:49"/>Some, even of the Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who had proviſions ſufficient for themſelves, left their good Meals which they might have made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to eat ſtinking Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh and Dogs-fleſh, to make theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory Diſhes be better reliſhed by their Soldiers. <hi>Firley,</hi> although he were infirm, by reaſon of his years and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would have made uſe of the ſame fare, had he not been often hindred by thoſe who were about him. <hi>Wiſnowitski</hi> and <hi>Konieſpolski</hi> neglected not in the mean time, frequently to ſally out upon the beſiegers, to put them out of hopes of any ſpeedy victory over people, who ſtill preſerved ſo much vigor and reſolution, in the middle of thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they ſuffered; but beſides, the ſcarcity of Victuals, their want of Ammunition hindred them from ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo frequently as before. And the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were no ways negligent on their part; for beſides their continual ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp, and their frequent aſſaults, they made approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48502:49"/>
againſt the Town; and attempted to cut off the Water from the beſieged. But theſe deſigns not ſucceeding, they contrived to ſet the Town of <hi>Zbaras</hi> on fire, and cheifly one of its Gates, which did very much incommodate them, it being higher then the reſt, and the beſt marks-men of the <hi>Poles</hi> ſhot from thence without ceaſing; amongſt whom Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Butler</hi> did marvellous execution, and Father <hi>Muchaveski,</hi> a Jeſuite, no leſs; who from the Gate of the Caſtle killed no leſs then two hundred <hi>Coſſacks</hi> for his part.</p>
            <p>A great company of the Rebels came up to the Gate with Firebrands in their Hands, ready to ſet it on fire: Having obtained which, it was very probable they would gain the reſt; but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged being advertiſed of their deſign, prepared themſelves to render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, received them briskly, and made a great ſlaughter. Things were in this poſture, when an Arrow ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, brought with it moſt fortunately a Letter tied to it; by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48502:50"/>
which he who wrote it, although his name were never known, gave them to underſtand he was a Gentleman; and firſt excuſed himſelf, for ſerving under the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>; to which he was induced by the outrages which he had received from a certain great perſon; and by the turn of the Fortune of the <hi>Poles</hi> the year before, but yet that he had not for all that, loſt his love and zeal for his Countrey, as he had teſtified to them in three other Letters, which he had ſent to them in the ſame manner; and did now give them notice, that the King was certainly coming to their relief, and already arrived at <hi>Zborow,</hi> that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> being informed of his coming, would not fail to redouble their aſſaults againſt them; but for the ſame reaſon they ought to redouble their courage, and prepare themſelves to repulſe them with their utmoſt vigor.</p>
            <p>The moſt part of the beſieged could not put any confidence in this Letter, ſuppoſing it to be a new invention of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48502:50"/>
the Generals: But ſoon after it was found to be true, and that the King was advanced as far as <hi>Zborow</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his beſieged Forces, having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all thoſe obſtacles which might retard his preparations, and his march. True it is, that his Army was thought by the moſt intelligent, not onely inſufficient to confront that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible number of enemies which he went againſt, but even to ſuſtain the leaſt Onſet from them, it conſiſting in all, but of Fifteen thouſand Soldiers in pay, and Five thouſand others raiſed by the Nobility at their own charge, the reſt not being able to come ſo ſoon, having been too ſlow in their Levies; notwithſtanding the continual inſtances of the King, and his earneſt diligence in this affair.</p>

               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and the Cham underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the march of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> divided their Forces, and leaving For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi>; with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and revolted Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants before <hi>Zbaras</hi>; with the reſt of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48502:51"/>
their forces marched towards <hi>Zborow,</hi> and were not diſcovered by the Kings forces, either by reaſon that the King had ſent none out to inform himſelf, or that the Countrymen thereabouts, more inclined to favor the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> as being of the ſame Religion with them, had not faithfully reported what they knew of it; inſomuch, that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> arrived at the Kings Camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being any ways diſcovered, being aſſiſted therein by the Woods, the thick Miſts, and the negligence of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

upon the back of the Kings Forces, having croſſed a Water; where the Peaſants by a remarkable Treachery, had broken down a Cauſey which kept it up, and ſo rendred it fordable to the Infidels. The Nobility of <hi>Premiſlie,</hi> and the Cavalry of the Duke of <hi>Oſtrog</hi> ſuſtained the firſt Onſet; but being not able to reſiſt the great numbers of their enemies, many of that Nobility were loſt, and all their Baggage.</p>

In which, <hi>Oſſolinski</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Ruſsia</hi> were ſlain; while this paſſed in the Rear and Flanks of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, <hi>Kmielniski</hi> with his <hi>Coſſacks,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48502:52"/>
and a Party of <hi>Tartars</hi> attacked the Front. The King who at the firſt noiſe, of their arrival, had put his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Batalia,</hi> gave the Leading of the Right Wing to the Great Chancellor <hi>Oſſolinski.</hi> This Wing was compoſed of the Cavalry of the King; and of that of the <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Podolia, Beltz,</hi> and <hi>Enhoff Scarroſte</hi> of <hi>Sokal,</hi> and other Regiments: And ordered the Left Wing to be commanded by <hi>George Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirski, starroſte</hi> of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Coreski</hi>; where beſides the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe were divers Companies of Voluntiers.</p>
            <p>The Main Battel made up of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and where the King himſelf was in Perſon, was commanded by Major General <hi>Hubald</hi> of <hi>Miſnia,</hi> who had ſerved a long time in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, and had afterwards commanded the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi>; and by one <hi>Wolff</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Liefland,</hi> Governor of <hi>Cracovia</hi>; both which had their <hi>German</hi> Regiments with them.</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48502:52"/>The <hi>Tartars</hi> extending themſelves wide before the Vant-guard, as if they came onely to obſerve them, after they had cloſed of a ſuddain after their manner of fighting, threw themſelves upon the right wing, where they were received bravely, and finding that the Foot were defended with their Pikes, and not in a condition to be broken up, they paſſed to the left wing, which they were able to ſhake more then the other, <hi>Coreski</hi> who was at the head of them, had his Horſe ſhot from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. <hi>Ruzouski</hi> was wounded with an Arrow through the Cheeks, yet did not neglect with the Arrow ſticking ſtill in the wound, to goe and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the King of the danger wherein the left wing was, his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> not regarding the Dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ran in all haſte to encourage his ſoldiers by his preſence, bringing them on again which were flying away, and complaining that he had no more Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to Command them; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he himſelf would take their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48502:53"/>
place, and he had been inſenbly ingaged in the hotteſt of the battel, if thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him had not detained him. The preſence of the King who expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this manner for their ſafety, did reanimate his ſoldiers as much as the dreadful number of their enemies had diſcouraged and aſtoniſhed them, and afterwards they fought with more heat, nor would be forced to give ground.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Tartars</hi> having broken in on one ſide were repulſed again by the diſcharge of their Cannon, and by two Companies of Foot Commanded by <hi>Ghiza,</hi> Captain in the Kings Guards, and in the end the Enemy not being able to get any advantage over them anſwerable to thoſe great endeavors againſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, the night co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on, terminated that days engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which in all likelihood they were to have been cut in pieces; moſt of the night was ſpent in conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving Order how to receive the Enemy the next day, they made ſome intrenchments in haſte to defend
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48502:53"/>
themſelves by, and in others they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Baggage, but while the King was conſulting with the principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Nobility, a report was ſpread through the Camp, that his Majeſty had a deſign to retreat that night with moſt part of his.</p>
            <p>The extream danger into which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were brought, rendered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Retreat more probable, and it wanted little, but the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation had happened there as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at <hi>Pilaucze.</hi> The King who was juſt retired to repoſe himſelf a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of it, got preſently on horſeback, and riding up and down through the Camp, undeceived them, and by his preſence ſhewed how vain the impreſſion was, they had received of his retreat, of which he did declare he never ſo much as thought of, but was reſolved to ſtand it out againſt the Enemy, putting them in hopes of a favourable ſucceſs in the next days undertaking. Amongſt the propoſals at the Council of War upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48502:54"/>
conjuncture of affairs, that of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to diſingage <hi>Kmielniski</hi> from the Cham, was moſt approved of, and therefore a <hi>Tartar</hi> priſoner was ſent with a Letter from his Majeſty, in which he gave him to underſtand, that he could not beleeve that he had loſt all ſenſe and memory of thoſe favours which he had received from King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus,</hi> from whom when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken priſoner in <hi>Poland,</hi> he had received ſo favourable an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and his liberty, and to whoſe bounty he was beholden for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dignity, and that after this it was ſtrange he ſhould aſſociate himſelf with Rebels and Slaves, but that he ought not to promiſe himſelf any great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from ſo unjuſt a confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Since God would give no bleſſing on ſuch deſigns; in the mean time his Majeſty thought it convenient to put him in mind of the obligation which he had to the King his predeceſſor, and withal to offer him his own friendſhip, if ſo be that he eſteemed that more then an Alliance with Rebels; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48502:54"/>
of this Letter was not ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and the next day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo ſoon as it was day, the Army of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> appeared in Batalia, the firſt againſt the City of <hi>Zborow,</hi> and the latter fell upon the Baggage.</p>
            <p>Four hundred light Horſe were able for ſome time to amuſe the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> with divers skirmiſhes. and afterwards being ſuſtained by a greater number, they drove them off beyond the Town, and thoſe who did attend the baggage having taken Arms, preſerved it againſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enemies afterwards divided themſelves into three bodies, and at as many places attacked the Kings Camp, after having firſt of all ſeized upon a Church which did Command it, where having planted a Battery by their continual ſhooting from which they had forced many who defended it to retire; they had almoſt made themſelves Maſters of it, and one of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48502:55"/>
their moſt reſolute ſoldiers had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy planted Colours upon the Works, when that a great body of the Kings party running together, made ſo brave a reſiſtance, that the enemy did not onely give over the aſſault but the fight, the ſervants ſallied out to purſue them, and ſhewed ſuch courage upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that ſome propoſed they ſhould have Horſes given them, and be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into Troops to increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their forces, and being reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with this ſupply drawn from the Army it ſelf, they might then hazard a Battel, others were of the opinion, that it could not be expedient to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo far, ſeeing that after a defeat they would neceſſarily be reduced to the ſame extremity as thoſe at <hi>Zbaras,</hi> out of this diverſity and incertainty of Council, wherein the <hi>Poles</hi> then float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, knowing not which way to ſteer, it pleaſed providence to conduct them happily to their Port. The Cham who before all theſe aſſaults upon both the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Armies, had promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſpeedy and certain victory, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48502:55"/>
now finding to the contrary, ſo much fearleſs reſolution among them, began to be weary of this war, and to ſhew himſelf more inclined towards an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, wrote a civil anſwer to the Kings Letter, in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged himſelf obliged to the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi>; and that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty after his Election had applied himſelf to him, he would have ſet a greater value on his friendſhip, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it ſooner then the intereſt of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> but they had neglected it ſo much, that they ſcarce conſidered him as an ordinary man, although they might well perceive how advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious his friendſhip might be, and now ſeeing there was an occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their antient Alliance, he would not be backward on his ſide, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to oblige the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to lay down their Arms and to return to their obedience, provided that the Articles of the former Treaties were obſerved; and that if his Majeſty deſired to name a place to confer in, and ſend his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor thither, he would ſend his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48502:56"/>
This Letter was alſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with one from <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> full of reſpect, and in which he aſſured the King of his fidelity and future ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

            <p>Thoſe Forces intrenched at <hi>Zbaras,</hi> reduced to thoſe extremities which you have already heard of, maintained themſelves all along, rather by rage and deſpair, then any hope of help.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of that Town, not being able to ſuffer the utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Famine, were ready either to burn the Town, or deliver it up to the enemy; but the vigilance of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> having hindred the execution of this tragick deſign, they much ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to be let out, which was onely granted to their Wives and Children; neither were they able to keep their retreat undiſcovered, but fell firſt into the hands of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Soldiers, who abuſed them as they pleaſed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who led this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Troop into captivity toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome Servants of the Army who had followed them.</p>

In the end, a more faithful and joyful Meſſage was brought them, with a Letter by Colonel <hi>Minor</hi> from the King, to aſſure them of their Liberties

without any conditions, together with the diſpoſal of the Palatinate of <hi>Seu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domire,</hi> vacant by the Death of the Duke of <hi>Zaſlaw,</hi> with which his Majeſty would gratifie the ſervices of General <hi>Firley.</hi> The Prince <hi>Wiſnowitskie</hi> was preſented with the <hi>Starroſty</hi> of <hi>Premiſli,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Oſtrog</hi> with that of <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſewitz, Landskoronski</hi> with that of <hi>Stob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz,</hi> and the Palatinate of <hi>Braclaw.</hi>

            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> returning from the Election of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſeaſon of the year was very unfit for War; after that he had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced onely by the fame of his approach, the Towns of <hi>Turow</hi> and <hi>Grodek,</hi> went and laid down before <hi>Mozyr,</hi> which

            <p>From thence he marched with his Forces towards the River <hi>Berezina,</hi> where he attacked <hi>Bobroisko</hi>; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were received into grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, That they would deliver up their Arms; and thoſe among them, who had been the Authors of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or who had made a League with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>; which coming to the knowledge of thoſe who were to be delivered up, they retreated into a Tower, and ſet it on fire, preferring this voluntary death, before that with which the Conqueror threatned them. <hi>Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitz</hi> who commanded them, received with the reſt the puniſhment of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>

            <p>This Commander had procured <hi>Kmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elniski</hi> liberty, when he had been taken by the <hi>Poles,</hi> and had received the ſame favor from him again; the laſt year, after the defeat of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Carſun,</hi> and the favorable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment he received, together with the fortunate poſture of <hi>Kmielniski</hi>'s affairs, engaged him in his ſervice.

            <p>In the mean time, ſome Squadrons, which the heat of the engagement had drawn out too far, were incompaſſed in by the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and ready to be cut in pieces, if that <hi>Komorouski,</hi> whom Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> had ſent before with a thouſand Men to diſcover and take pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, had not happily come in and diſingaged them.

So that beſides Three or four hundred which ſaved themſelves by ſwimming, Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred of them were either killed or drowned.

            <p>THe King of <hi>Poland</hi> returning to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> in the midſt of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of his People, who could not ſufficiently expreſs their joy and acknowledgments to him, for what he had done for the preſervation of the Kingdom; applied himſelf with all diligence in the Diet, which he held towards the end of the year, to the eſtabliſhment of the Peace lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks.</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48502:65"/>
The reſult of this Diet, which ended the Twelfth of <hi>January,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty, was, That all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Soldiers ſhould be immediately ſatisfied: That the Army which had been ſhut up at <hi>Zbaras,</hi> in conſideration of their great ſervices, ſhould receive three payments extraordinary, there ſhould be Twelve thouſand Men in continual pay for the Guard of the Frontiers: That the Articles concluded on, between the King, and the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> at <hi>Zborow,</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: That three of the <hi>Coſſackian</hi> Gentlemen ſhould be admitted to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices: And that for the ſupply of theſe great expences, there ſhould be a new Impoſt laid upon all <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania</hi>; and Cuſtoms upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes granted to his Majeſty, for his Signal Exploits in the laſt Campagnia.</p>
            <p>It was alſo thought fit to eſtabliſh a Senator at <hi>Kiovia,</hi> to be vigilant, near at hand, over the Actions of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and to decide the differences which might ariſe in performance of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <hi>Adam Kiſiel,</hi> appointed a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be Governor of that Town, was thought to be a perſon moſt able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf worthily in that charge, and to regiſter the Forty thouſand Men, of which the <hi>Coſſackian</hi> Army was to conſiſt, according to the laſt Treaty, and to give them their neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> obſerved this Peace almoſt a year, and teſtified in all appearance his good intentions; but apprehending leaſt the <hi>Polanders</hi> whom he had forced, in the unhappy conjuncture of their affairs, to grant him extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſhould now repent of it, and ſearch out ways to elude the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them; he thought that he could not do better then by powerful Alliances, to ſecure to himſelf theſe advantages which had been conceded.</p>
            <p>And to this intent, he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Grand Signior, and the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the firſt, by whoſe favor he hoped
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48502:66"/>
to render himſelf conſiderable to all the World. He pretended alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Friendſhip of the <hi>Hoſpodar</hi> or Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi>; but it was onely to amuſe him, that he might the better ſurpriſe him, and force his Countrey: For in the mean time he made an ill impreſſion of him upon the mindes of the Grand Signiors Officers, to whom he repreſented him as a ſecret enemy to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and an intimate Friend of the <hi>Polanders</hi>; and that by his means, the <hi>Poles</hi> had hitherto received continual intelligence of theirs, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> deſigns. They aſſured therefore <hi>Kmiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niski</hi> of the Protection of the Grand Signior, and that he ſhould be inveſted with <hi>Black Ruſſia,</hi> to hold it in Fee of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; they received the acknowledgments of his depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them, and his promiſes of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their ſervice, and permitted him to execute his deſigns againſt the Prince of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> which he did with great diſſimulation, and made uſe of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in it; to whom he joyned onely Four thouſand <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48502:66"/>
better to keep ſecret his intentions. The Cham ſent to him to thank him for his aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired further, that he would lend him his Forces to go againſt <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Great Duke: So that while the Neighboring Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded themſelves, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were going to War in <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> the <hi>Hoſpodar</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> who was one of this number, and lived in the ordinary careleſs ſecurity of a high Peace, found himſelf encompaſſed in with a numerous Army of <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Auxiliary <hi>Coſſacks.</hi> All that could be done upon ſo ſudden and unexpected an accident, was to run into the Woods near <hi>Jaſz,</hi> his principal City. In the thickeſt of which, the <hi>Hoſpodar,</hi> with his family, and as many as he could get together in haſte, intrenched themſelves with Trees cut down; and afterwards drew himſelf out of this danger, upon the payment of Twenty thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the promiſe of his Daughter in marriage to <hi>Timotheus

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Peace with the <hi>Poles</hi> was every day violated by the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>; their numerous Army was extended much beyond their quarters. The Peaſants who were not inrolled, ſuſtained by them, would not receive thoſe Gentlemen, their Landlords, who were to enter upon poſſeſſion of their Eſtates again, but treated them ill, and maſſacred divers. This deportment of theirs, and the expedition againſt <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi> obliged <hi>Potoski,</hi> the Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, who was newly returned out of his priſon in <hi>Tartary,</hi> to march with the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, and incamp near <hi>Camie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> was much ſurpriſed at the firſt news of this march; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him at that time divers who were deputed from the Nobility, to complain of the Rebellion, in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48502:67"/>
which the Peaſants perſiſted, and their refuſal to acknowledge them; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that all thoſe who were ſent to him, ſhould be drowned the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. But theſe Orders being given when he was in drink, filled with Wine and Strong-waters, after he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted his debauch, and been informed by his Wife of what he had done, he preſently revoked his ſentence juſt when they who had the charge of it, were ready to execute it. Afterwards he ſent <hi>Craucenski,</hi> one of his Officers, to the General <hi>Potoski,</hi> to give him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That he could not but be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the approach of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces, in ſuch a time, when they had Peace with all the World, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> at their diſpoſal for the ſecurity of the Frontiers.</p>
            <p>The General in anſwer reproached him for their daily breach of Peace, and the ill Treatment which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility received from their Subjects; and for the War which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken without their knowledge
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48502:68"/>
againſt the Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi>; and that although he were Great General to the States of <hi>Poland,</hi> yet he ought to have advertiſed them of it; he added, that he could not leave that ſtation wherein he was by the Kings Order, without expreſs command from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer was no way pleaſing to the Envoy from <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how much his Maſter would be ill ſatisfied with it, and mingled threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of War with his diſcourſe; but proceeded not to breach of Peace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the nearneſs of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, and the Great General, whoſe admired deſert or redoubted courage, might turn him from it; or becauſe, that the deſigns he laid of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Principality for himſelf, were not yet mature enough to diſcloſe this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious project; or, that he was willing to ſet down contented with his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and with having made a new Alliance, although by force of Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48502:68"/>In the mean time the Nobility in <hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kraine</hi> were as ill treated, as if it had been in time of War; ſo that many were obliged every day to retire.

            <p>This Letter was received with great reſpect in appearance, but he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much ſlowneſs, to execute what the King required of him; and on the contrary, was very induſtrious at the ſame time, to make a ſtrict League with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and Great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> whoſe friendſhip he deſired with the

            <p>The great ſucceſs which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> had had againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> made him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem them as a defeated and depreſſed people, and to begin a cauſleſs quarrel with them, in hopes to obtain from them, during the bad condition of their affairs, a revocation of the Treaty, which he had been forced to make with King <hi>

in the preſence of the King, and the Senators, That he, of his own head, had prepared thoſe Propoſitions which he had delivered, and the Peace was confirmed between the <hi>Poles,</hi> and the Great Duke.</p>
            <p>The continual correſpondence which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> held with the <hi>Turks,</hi> of which, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Neighboring Princes, and his inſolent carriage towards the State, obliged his Majeſty to call a General Diet of the Kingdom, in the end of the year One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty; in which, this Prince repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inſupportable behavior of the General of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>; the contempt he had both of the King and State; the injuries which many of the Nobility had received; the loſs of their Eſtates, and their not being able to be reſtored againſt <hi>Kmielniski</hi> his great forces, which he ſtrove to increaſe by the addition of <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi>; ſo that he was in a condition to gather together on the ſuddain, an Army of more then Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48502:70"/>
thouſand Men, every <hi>Coſſack</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, of which, the number by the laſt Treaty, amounted to Forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; had a ſervant on Horsback, and another on Foot, beſides a Laborer to Till the Grounds; that their deſign was to ſhake off utterly all obedience, and to ſet up a new Government under the Protection of the Grand Signior: So that they would be capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, if that they did not ſoon put a ſtop to the courſe of their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſigns.</p>
            <p>There were ſome in the Aſſembly, who calling to minde the evils, cauſed by the laſt VVar, were of opinion, That Peace at any rate was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it; and alledged, that the Forces of the Kingdom were now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably decreaſed, whereas thoſe of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were very powerful, both of themſelves, and by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> family which protected them; ſo that it would be much better to keep cloſe to the Treaty of <hi>Zborow:</hi> But the greater number making reflections upon what was paſſed, and what was to be

expected, conſidered that there were but two ways to be taken; the one to ruine the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> or, the other to let the Kingdom periſh miſerably; that the King had onely a title and precarious authority over them, no more then they pleaſed themſelves; that they were now upon the deſign of forming a Principality, from whence they were to expect moſt diſmal events, if they gave them time to increaſe and eſtabliſh themſelves; that they interpreted the Treaty after their own manner, and gave it what ſence they pleaſed; that the State had yet conſiderable Forces, if they were well imployed; and that as affairs then ſtood, they were better able to give a ſtop to their new and riſing power, then they could afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, when they were raiſed, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and eſtabliſhed by time; that the King was brave and active, and with ſmall Armies having done great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, he would obtain more ſignal advantages over his enemies, when the States ſhould proceed to a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and powerful undertaking.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> Demands were theſe, That according to the Articles of the Peace at <hi>Zborow,</hi> the Union of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks ſhould be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> ſhould remain Soveraign beyond the <hi>Boristhenes</hi>; that none of the Nobility or Gentry of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould for the future, have any power over the Peaſants of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; that if the Gentlemen would live there, they ſhould be obliged to work as well as the Peaſants; that Nine Biſhops ſhould ſwear in full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to ſee all this obſerved; that for Hoſtages they ſhould give up four Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines to <hi>Kmielniski</hi> which he ſhould chuſe, in conſideration of which Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he promiſed to pay to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> yearly a Million of Florins, and afterwards they reduced their Demands to Four.</p>

            <p>But all there Demands being very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, and no body willing to truſt to the Faith of a Man, who was not contented with the promiſe which the King and State had given him, by their Confirmation of the Treaty of <hi>Zborow,</hi> at the laſt Diet; they had no other thoughts but of making VVar. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form which the more advantagiouſly, they reſolved to raiſe Fifty thouſand Soldiers, to whom were to be joyned the Auxiliaries of the Noblemen and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48502:72"/>
their Attendants, in caſe of need; and many thought it fit, that the Auxiliaries ſhould be ſpared, as a party reſerved againſt the laſt extremities; and that it were better to augment the number of the Soldiers to be raiſed. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed alſo, that the War ſhould be begun before the Spring, to hinder the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> from making their due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and to come at them with the more facility, while the Rivers and Marſhes were yet frozen; in which, they ordinarily ſecure themſelves in their Marches, and in their Incampings. Beſides which, they could not, but with great difficulty be aſſiſted either by the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi>; the former not being accuſtomed to ſo rigorous a cold, and the latter would ſcarce finde Forrage in this ſeaſon for their Horſes. But this project could not immediately be put in execution, the Forces which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Diet, could not ſo ſoon be raiſed; ſo that the King ſent onely the Field Marſhal <hi>Calinouski</hi> to cover and defend the Frontiers from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

upon War, rather then Peace; which was alſo to be once again offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, upon the ſame terms as at the Treaty of <hi>Zborow.</hi> The intentions of <hi>Kmielniski</hi> quite contrary to Peace, were ſoon made known by the Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he began to commit upon the Frontiers. <hi>Nieczai,</hi> one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generals, put all the Countrey to Fire and Sword, and maſſacred thoſe who were deputed to him from the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of <hi>Braclaw,</hi> in the preſence of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Envoy; but by the Forces of the ſame Palatine, and thoſe of <hi>Kali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouski,</hi> he was driven into the City of <hi>Craſna</hi>; and part of his Men were cut in pieces in their retreat, after they had forſaken the Caſtle, which they could no longer hold; and amongſt others, <hi>Nieczai</hi> himſelf, whom a Gentleman named <hi>Baibuza,</hi> killed with his own hand, the reſt were driven into a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage where they were together with it, either plundred or reduced to Aſhes. <hi>Bohun,</hi> another General of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> in the place of <hi>Nieczai,</hi> made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> and ſeiſed upon the

City of <hi>Winnicza</hi> ſeated upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Bog</hi>; but the <hi>Poles</hi> having croſſed the River, with great pains took the Caſtle by aſſault, in which they ſlew a number of their enemies, who had been aſſiſted by <hi>Gluki,</hi> one of their Colonels. At laſt <hi>Bohun</hi> being reinforced by the <hi>Coſſackian</hi> Regiments of <hi>Czherin, Prziluka, Lubiecz,</hi> and <hi>Braclaw,</hi> each conſiſting of Two thouſand Men, <hi>Kali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouski</hi> was obliged to go out of the Town, after that he had left a Guard therein of Foot, and ſome Servants with the Baggage belonging to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to draw up his Forces in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglia in the Fields adjoyning, but ſome ſudden fear poſſeſſing thoſe who were left in <hi>Winnicza,</hi> they forſook the Town, and the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces, conſtrained them to retreat in diſorder under the Cannon of <hi>Bar,</hi> with the loſs of Four thouſand five hundred Footmen and their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</p>
            <p>This ſhock obliged the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who was gone on Pilgrimage to

to attack <hi>Kamienecz,</hi> without the order or knowledge of their General. And having taken the Caſtle of <hi>Panocze</hi> near to it, by compoſition, where they got conſiderable booty. They made many aſſaults upon this Fortreſs, but all in vain, being continually repulſed with ſo great a loſs, that they were ready to cut their Officers in pieces, who had expoſed them to ſo dangerous an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, without acquainting <hi>Kmielniski</hi> with it; who ſo ſoon as he knew it, ſent them orders to remove. Thoſe who were bent upon the purſuit of the Forces of <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> had not much better ſucceſs in ſetting upon them, ſometimes in the Front, ſometimes in the Flank, and ſometimes in the Rear; being always repulſed with great valor by the General, although with the loſs of many of his own. Upon the Fourteenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1651. they ſet upon <hi>Zobieski</hi> his Regiment, but were ſo received, that they left many behinde them; and amongſt others <hi>Canowiecz,</hi> one of their Colonels, and a <hi>Tartarian Murza.</hi> At length <hi>Kalinouski</hi> was conſtrained by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48502:75"/>
reaſon of the difficult Paſſages, and the bad ways, to leave his Carriages. To repair which loſs, and to make his Army appear more numerous to the enemy, he ſet the Servants upon thoſe Horſes which drew the Baggage; and after having ſuſtained many aſſaults, and eſcaped the many difficulties and inconveniences of the March, he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt fortunately at the Camp Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in the end of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Forces raiſed at the expence of the States, and by the Noblemen came in daily from all parts, there were reckoned Ten thouſand of theſe latter; and the whole Army, together with the Nobility, made up an Hundred thouſand fighting Men, beſides the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were very numerous, and moſt of them furniſhed with Horſe and Arms. This great Army not being able to ſubſiſt long in one place, without ſuffering the want of Proviſions; after that all care poſſible was taken to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, it was reſolved, they ſhould be employed as ſoon as could be. In a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48502:75"/>
great Council of War, which was held thereupon, and laſted a whole night; ſome propoſed to divide the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Bodies, and to ſend the firſt, conſiſting of the Common Soldiers, againſt the enemies, while his Majeſty might attend the ſucceſs of the War at <hi>Sokallo,</hi> with the Voluntiers and Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries, for a reſerve againſt the greateſt extremity: But this adviſe was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the King, nor by many of the Principal Officers, who remonſtrated that if the Army were thus divided, it might be more eaſily encountred and defeated by the enemies; but being all in one Body, they would not onely be in a condition to oppoſe, but alſo to overcome them. They concluded therefore to march directly towards them, by the moſt ſhort and eaſie way, which was, that by <hi>Bereſtesko.</hi> The King ſet forward with all his Forces upon the Fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi> and ſent out divers parties to hear news of the <hi>Coſſacks.</hi> The Marſhy, Mooriſh places which he was to travel through, and the great number of Carriages cauſed his Forces
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48502:76"/>
to march ſcatteringly. So that he thought it neceſſary to divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ten Brigades, if we may ſo name a Body of Ten or twelve thouſand men, of which number each was compoſed; he reſerved the firſt for himſelf, gave the command of the ſecond to the great General <hi>Potoski</hi>; the third to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Campagne <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of <hi>Czernihovia</hi>; the fourth to <hi>John Simon Szcavinski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Breſtch</hi>; the fifth to the Duke of <hi>Wiſnowitz,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia</hi>; the ſixth to <hi>Staniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Potoski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Podolia</hi>; the ſeventh to the Grand Marſhal of the Kingdom <hi>Lubomirski</hi>; the eighth to <hi>Staniſlaus Landskoronski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi>; the nineth to the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Lithuania, Sapieha</hi>; the tenth to <hi>Konieſpolski,</hi> the Great Enſign to the Crown. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army came the next day, being the Sixteenth, to <hi>Wygnanka,</hi> a place abounding in Water, and good Paſture Grounds; where they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a Soldier, who had left the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> Army, that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> was gone from his Camp, which lay between

               <hi>Zbaras</hi> and <hi>Wiſnowitz,</hi> to go meet the Cham, whom he expected with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; having called for his aſſiſtance, not truſting enough in his own Forces, although he had a prodigious multitude of revolted Peaſants joyned with his <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> but had as yet but Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Tartars</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>The King arriving at <hi>Bereſtesko,</hi> of which Town, the Count of <hi>Leſno,</hi> under Chamberlain of <hi>Brzeſtia</hi> is Lord; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near it, all along the River of <hi>Ster,</hi> which waſhes this place on all ſides, and then ſent out Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe under the command of <hi>Stemkouski</hi> and <hi>Czarneski,</hi> to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed of the enemies march, and underſtood by ſome priſoners whom they took, that the Cham was come to <hi>Kmielniski</hi> with a numerous Army, and that he had ſent out parties to learn in what place and condition the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was.

And the Grand General underſtanding by a Peaſant, that the enemies promiſed themſelves aſſured victory, if they could fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, intangled in the way, reſolved to ſtay at <hi>Bereſtesko,</hi> and the Baggage was ordered to be brought back, which was upon the way. Scarce were they returned into the Camp, but the Scouts brought word, that the whole Army of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were near to <hi>Pereatin,</hi> a Village within five hundred paces; ſo that the Generals preſently drew up the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, left the River <hi>Ster</hi> on one ſide of them, and lined all the Wooded places near, with divers Companies of Foot, for fear of an Ambuſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48502:77"/>The Twenty ſeventh of <hi>June,</hi> about night, Ten thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> drawn out from the reſt, came near to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, to take a view of it, making, as if they came to provoke them to fight. The Grand Marſhal, and Grand Enſign, not being able to ſuffer their inſolence, went out with their Regiments, by the permiſſion of the Great General, and the aſſiſtance alſo of <hi>Wiſnowitski</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and ingaged them a long while, repulſed them, and drove them back half a League. Upon the Eight and twentieth, there was another more fierce skirmiſh; the Cham placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his whole Army upon certain Eminencies in ſight of the <hi>Poles,</hi> ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſome of the choice Forces of the <hi>Coſſacks.</hi> The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drawn up in order, the Regiments of the Palatine of <hi>Brzeſtia</hi> and <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> of the Duke <hi>Bogiſlaus Radzevil,</hi> and the Palatine of <hi>Witebsko</hi> with the Horſe of <hi>Przemiſlia</hi> and <hi>Volhynia,</hi> went to ſet upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who to revenge the defeat they received the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

ſeeing that the Horſe was backed but with a ſmall number of Foot, they poured in upon them great numbers of Men. <hi>Landskoronski</hi> was the firſt who could put a ſtop to this torrent, neither was it done without the loſs of many of his own Men, and of his Brother; and he himſelf was ſo incompaſſed by a great number of thoſe Infidels, that to diſingage him, there were ſent out the Regiments of the Great General, of the General of the Campagne, of the Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> of the Grand Marſhal and of <hi>Sapieha.</hi> The fight grew hot upon the arrival of this reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many were ſlain on both ſides; the <hi>Tartars</hi> loſt about a Thouſand Men, and divers priſoners of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able note were taken, amongſt others, the Secretary to the Cham.

The Conduct of the Left Wing was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Kalinouski</hi> General of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, to the Dukes of <hi>Oſtrog</hi> and <hi>Zaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,</hi> to the Palatine of <hi>Brzeſtya,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wiſnowitz</hi> Palatine of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> to <hi>Staniſlaus Potoski</hi> Palatine of <hi>Podolia,</hi> to <hi>John Zamoiski,</hi> and to Colonel <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoff</hi> of <hi>Liefland</hi>; many of which had joyned the Forces which they had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their own Countreys to thoſe of the States. The King took charge of the main Body of the Army, compoſed of the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Poliſh</hi> Foot; at the Head of which, ſtood the Artillery, commanded by <hi>Sigiſmond Priemski,</hi> who was General of it, and had been a long time Major General under the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Second Line, in the middle of which, his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> took his place, conſiſted of Horſe, and was commanded amongſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48502:79"/>
other Officers, by <hi>Tyskewitz,</hi> Great Cup-bearer of <hi>Lithuania.</hi> The Body of Reſerve, was commanded by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Meydel,</hi> Great Maſter of the Game, and by Colonel <hi>Enhoff, Starroſte</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal,</hi> and was compoſed of the Horſe of <hi>Grudzinski</hi> and <hi>Rozraceuski</hi>; and of the Foot of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Brother to the King, and of <hi>Konieſpolski</hi>'s, and Colonel <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> a Frenchman. The Baggage and Ammunition was left in the Camp, which was intrenched on one ſide, and defended on the other by the Town and the River. The King had left ſome Companies of Foot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for a Guard, who appeared afar of much more numerous then they were, by reaſon of their Lances, which by the Kings Orders, the <hi>Huzzars</hi> had left to them; every one of which had a Red Penon or Little Streamer at the end; and when they were all drawn up in order, made a very fair ſhow. The Sun diſperſing the Miſt, which till that time, had covered the Army, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Enemy like a beautiful perſpective on a Theatre, when the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48502:80"/>
Curtain is drawing up, who were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at their number and good order; notwithſtanding their Army was more numerous, and covered all the Countrey as far as could be ſeen. The <hi>Tartars</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of divers little Hills, from whence there was an eaſie deſcent, and filled up all the ſpace in form of an Half-Moon: They had the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> on their Right Hand, oppoſite to the Left Wing of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, with whom were alſo joyned ſome Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of <hi>Tartars</hi>; and near to them was the Tabor of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> compoſed of divers Ranks of Chariots; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which, were part of their Forces able to ſuſtain all aſſaults whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being thus placed all the morning was ſpent in light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, but the King doubting leſt that the intention of the enemies was to amuſe them with theſe ſmall combats and to ſet upon them the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when by reaſon of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they might the better ſurprize
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48502:80"/>
them, he prohibited all his Soldiers upon pain of death from ſtirring out of their places without order, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Bridges to be broken down which were built over the <hi>Ster,</hi> that they might not be ſet upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and by this means to ingage his own Soldiers to perform their utmoſt, all hopes of eſcaping being cut off, and that the reſt of the day might not be ſpent unprofitably, which was ſcarce ſufficient for a general Battel between two ſuch numerous Armies, he began to ſalute the Enemies with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non at the head of his Army, and ſo from time to time to diſcharge againſt them as they drew nearer to thoſe Eminencies whereon the <hi>Tartars</hi> were placed. Divers ſeeing the day ſo far ſpent, were of opinion that the Fight ſhould be deferred till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but others inſiſted much upon the contrary, fearing leſt the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> might fall upon the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army in the night with their Tabor, which they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily reinforced, and might therewithal conſtrain them to quit
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48502:81"/>
their Camp. His Majeſty therefore cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of <hi>Wiſnowitz</hi> to begin the charge with twelve Troops of old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, backed by the Palatine of <hi>Podo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> with the Auxiliaries of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinates of <hi>Cracovia, Sendomir, Lencicia,</hi> and <hi>Przemiſtia,</hi> the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> received them briskly, and the conflict laſted near an hour, all which time the ſmoak and duſt made them inviſible to the reſt of the Army; and as the <hi>Poles</hi> began to give way, they were timely aſſiſted by freſh Forces, which the King ſent them; upon whoſe arrival, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were driven into their Tabor, together with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ingaged them upon a riſing Ground. In the mean time, the King marched againſt the great Body of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Right Wing ſtaying near a Wood ſide, to hinder the deſign of many of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who were in Ambuſh, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to compaſs in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army in the heat of the Battel. The King kept the Artillery ſtill before him, which <hi>Priemski</hi> cauſed to be diſcharged very opportunely, and with great ſucceſs.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48502:81"/>
So that they obliged the <hi>Tartars</hi> to leave the foot of the Hill, and by degrees made themſelves maſters alſo of the top; after they had ſuſtained the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of the <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> Carbines, who accompanied them.</p>
            <p>In this place His Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> was in great danger of his life, having four Bullets ſhot from ſome pieces which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had by a Wood ſide, paſſing very near him, and one of them falling at his feet; but the <hi>Poles</hi> ſoon returned them the like: For <hi>Otuinouski,</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> Languages aſſuring them, that the Cham was there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon where they ſaw the great White Standard. The King ordered a piece of Cannon to be ſo levelled, that the firſt ſhot took one of the Principal Officers, who ſtood near the Cham; which diſturbed and frighted him ſo much, that he thought not farther of any thing but retreating; that part of his Army which had been driven from the Hill, followed him alſo, having left
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48502:82"/>
ſome Squadrons behind to diſguiſe his retreat, and amuſe the <hi>Polanders</hi> for ſome time: But they were ſoon put to their ſhifts, and the <hi>Poles</hi> purſued them a League and a half, till the Night and the ſwiftneſs of their <hi>Bacmates</hi> or <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> Horſes ſecured them; yet they left many in their retreat, wounded and ſlain, which they were uſed to carry off, and to burn in their march when they had leiſure; eſteeming it abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to leave the dead Bodies of their Friends in the hands of Chriſtians: They left alſo much of their equipage, as Veſtes, Saddles, Cimitars, Chariots, and the Tent and Standard of their Cham, and his little Silver Drum, guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and covered with a Skin, which ſerves him for a Bell.</p>
            <p>Divers <hi>Polanders</hi> who had been Slaves to thoſe Infidels, did here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Liberty, but many others were killed by them, when they ſaw they could not carry them away with them in their retreat, which was ſo haſty, that they travelled Ten French
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48502:82"/>
Leagues the ſame day. The King after he had ſent out divers Troops of Horſe in purſuit of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> went with the reſt of his Army againſt the Tabor of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> where they were ſtill in great numbers, and had Forty pieces of Ordnance which played continually. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> was retreated with the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> in hopes to engage them again to fight, but he could by no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to it; but on the contrary, was very ill treated by the Cham, and reproached as one that had cheated him, and not made known the true ſtate of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, but had made him believe they were not above Twenty thouſand; and therefore he threatned to ſend him to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> in exchange for thoſe <hi>Murza</hi>'s which were Priſoners there, and would not let him go free, till he had ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Czeherin</hi> to deliver up a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum of Money, and part of the Booty which he had formerly taken in <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48502:83"/>The night following the King order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there ſhould be a Publick Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in the Camp, for this Victory, which coſt him but Twelve hundred Men, his enemies having loſt Six times as many; he paſſed the night in his Coach: And although it was very Rainy, he neglected not to cauſe the Cannon to be mounted upon the Hill, which was forſaken by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the more conveniently to beat the Tabor of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in pieces; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Rain, they had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a broad deep Ditch, and lined with Muskettiers in thoſe places where it was moſt weak and open, and had a Marſh behind them, which did ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them. By reaſon of <hi>Kmielniski</hi> his abſence, they conferred the command of their Army upon one of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, called <hi>Dziadziali,</hi> a perſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable cruelty. They had recourſe to all remedies probable to give them help, they wrote to the King, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his clemency, and to teſtifie to him the extream deſire which they had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48502:83"/>
for Peace; but ſeeing their Arms and Pens were both together in their hands, their Prince thought of no other way, but of reducing them by force; which appeared alſo not difficult to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, by reaſon they began already to fall into diviſions amongſt themſelves. Some of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Commanders were of opinion, that they ſhould drown the Camp of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> by making a dam and ſtopping the Courſe of the Water; but the advice to batter it down, was followed , and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they brought great Cannon from <hi>Brody,</hi> a Fortreſs built by the deceaſed Grand General <hi>Konieſpolski:</hi> They made alſo Bridges above and below their Camp, for the better communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces, and raiſed many Forts and Redoubts in the moſt eminent places, from whence they might make their Batteries.</p>
            <p>The Fourth of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed one of theſe Forts, wherein were two pieces of Ordnance and Fourſcore <hi>Polanders,</hi> whoſe Heads they ſtruck off
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48502:84"/>
with their Sythes, Arms, which their Foot ordinarily make uſe of inſtead of Pikes. But General <hi>Hubald</hi> ran upon them, and drove them from it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to leave the Cannon which they were carrying away into their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. The ſame day the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of a Hill, by which means they could the more eaſily ſeek out Forrage; but the Grand Enſign diſlodged them, and brought away Five hundred of their Horſes.</p>
            <p>The fifth they came out of their Camp, in great number, in appearance as if they would give the <hi>Poles</hi> battel again, but they were driven back into their Intrenchments after a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and the loſs of Four hundred of their Men. <hi>Sokol</hi> and <hi>Piaſcozin,</hi> of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> ſide, were wounded in this conflict, which was attended with a continual diſcharge of the Artillery on both ſides, and great deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſeeing themſelves thus ill handled, betook themſelves to ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48502:84"/>
and in the night following at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army with all their Force; but their deſign was prevented firſt by the fall of the Rain, and then by the vigilance of the King and his Generals, who doubled their Guards. At this time <hi>Mehemet Czelebey,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Tartar,</hi> who had been a long while in the ſervice of the Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and had been made a Captain by him, having been ſent out with a party to purſue the <hi>Tartars,</hi> returned into the Camp, bringing back priſoner with him, a <hi>Tartar</hi> of quality, named <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſa Aga,</hi> one of the Cham's Kinred, who had been wounded at the Battel of <hi>Bereſtesko,</hi> and was not able to follow the reſt, and had offered Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rixdollars to <hi>Czelebey</hi> for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; but this <hi>Poloniſed Tartar,</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Faith and Promiſe which he had many years ſince ingaged to the Great General his Maſter, before all the Money and other conſiderable advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which this great perſon of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> offered him, if he would return with him into his Countrey. He report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48502:85"/>
alſo, that he had found by the way, more then Ten thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> either ſlain or wounded, which they had left behind them: An extraordinary mark of their precipitous flight, their cuſtom being to burn them, rather then leave them in the power of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> whoſe laſt deſign took no effect, were now more and more backed in and incommodated; their onely refuge was the paſſage which they kept through the Marſh; by which they went out to Forrage, and by which they might retreat. But Colonel <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> who was placed with Ten thouſand Men on the other ſide of the Water, began to conſtrain the Liberty of the Excurſions; and it was determined, that more Forces ſhould be ſent on that ſide to hinder them altogether.</p>
            <p>At length the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Artillery thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering againſt their Tabor, with more execution then ever, they ſent out three Deputies, <hi>Kreſa,</hi> Colonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Czeherin, Hladki,</hi> and <hi>Percaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauski,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48502:85"/>
to deſire Peace; they applied themſelves firſt to the Great General, who ſeverely reproaching them for their cruelty and perfidiouſneſs, told them, That they had rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of the favor of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of <hi>Poland</hi>; and that they did not deſerve to be uſed as Chriſtians, after that infamous Alliance which they had made with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King notwithſtanding, by the advice of the Senators, admitted them to Audience under a Pavillion ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hill, from whence the <hi>Tartars</hi> had been driven; where they fell down upon their faces, and preſented a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of all the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and often begged for <hi>Mercy, Mercy,</hi> repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word at all the requeſts they made; and upon all occaſions, kiſſing the Hands and Garments of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who were there preſent. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> having called his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, anſwered them by the Biſhop of <hi>Culm,</hi> his Great Chancellor, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their crimes were ſuch, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48502:86"/>
they ought to have made them looſe all hopes of Pardon; yet his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be conformable to the Divine Goodneſs and Mercy, did impart his; and if they would give ſufficient proofs of their true Repentance, and perfect Submiſſion, he would pardon all what was paſſed, upon thoſe conditions which they ſhould receive in writing the next day about Eleven of the Clock. Till which time, a Ceſſation of Arms was granted as they deſired. <hi>Creſa,</hi> their Principal Deputy, remained as an Hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the other Deputies returned upon the Seventh at the hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to receive the Articles, upon which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would grant his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Abolition of their Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
            <p>It was demanded by theſe Articles, That they ſhould firſt put Twelve of their Principal Commanders in Hoſtage, till they could deliver up unto the King their General <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> and <hi>Wihouski</hi> his Secretary.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48502:86"/>2. That they ſhould reſtore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and the Enſigns which they had taken in the War.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they ſhould give up the Standard belonging to the General of their <hi>Militia,</hi> to be diſpoſed of to whom his Majeſty pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if they were not contented, that their number ſhould be reduced to Twelve thouſand for the Guard of the Frontiers, this Article ſhould be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the next Diet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That as to their Priviledges which they might pretend to, thoſe onely ſhould be continued to them which were granted by the deceaſed General <hi>Konieſpolski</hi> in the year One thouſand ſix hundred and twenty eight.</p>
            <p>The Deputies returning to their Camp, and making known theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, brought back the next day this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>That as to the firſt Article they would promiſe, to do their utmoſt, to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48502:87"/>
put <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and his Secretary into the Kings hands, and would yield to the Second and third; but as for more, they could never agree to, nor hold to any other Articles, then thoſe of the Treaty of <hi>Zborow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King much offended at this Anſwer, redoubled his Batteries and reſolved abſolutely to exterminate them, as they on the contrary would chuſe rather to die, then to recede from that Treaty.</p>
            <p>They anſwered to the diſcharges of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Artillery, but not ſo often; which gave ſuſpition that their Powder was ſpent: Some were ſo bold as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo near to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp, that they heard the orders which were given to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Soldiers; which being known, they were obliged to change their orders; as alſo, the deſign they had formed of giving a general aſſault to their Tabor: And ſo ſtrongly did the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> reſiſt all the attempts of the <hi>Polanders</hi> againſt them, that their valor had merited extraordinary Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if it had not been accompanied
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48502:87"/>
with many deteſtable cruelties, as Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, burning by degrees; and doing a thouſand other miſcheifs to the <hi>Polanders</hi> who fell into their hands. So much did the propoſing of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wherewith they were to buy their Peace, inſpire them with Rage and Fury, in which they were kept on by their <hi>Popes</hi> (for ſo they call their <hi>Prieſts</hi>) who ceaſed not to encourage them with the hopes of the quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their General, and the <hi>Tartars.</hi> But the inconveniences which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the long abſence of <hi>Kmiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niski</hi> undeceiving them from the falſe hopes they ſuſtained of a ſpeedy aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they began to deſire Peace very earneſtly; their Commanders who ſaw that it could not be effected, but to their prejudice, reſiſted with all their power: And ſeeing that <hi>Dziadziali,</hi> whom they had ſubſtituted in the room of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> did lend an Ear towards an accommodation, they forſook him, and ſet up <hi>Bohun</hi> in his place; who to ſignalize the beginning of his new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip, upon the information he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48502:88"/>
that the Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi> had paſſed the River with ſome Forces, to ſhut up thoſe Paſſages which the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> made uſe of to go out to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and by which, they might at laſt retreat; he went out with a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Old Coſſackin Militia,</hi> and two pieces of Cannon, to drive them back, and to reinforce the Guards which they had placed in the Forts, made for the preſervation of the Paſſage: But ſcarce was he out of the Camp, when as the jealouſie and ſuſpition which they had a long time harbored, That the old Soldiers and Officers had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to retreat and leave the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to break out, and a new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Coſſack,</hi> having publiſhed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, That <hi>Bohun</hi> was gone out to this intent. The noiſe of it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpred it ſelf throughout the Camp, and cauſed ſuch a conſternation, that every one began to flie in the greateſt diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48502:88"/>The Ways and Cauſeys which they had made in the Marſhes near their Camp were too ſtraight, and many fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, ſtuck faſt in the Mire, although they laid their Veſts, Cloaks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther garments to draw them out. <hi>Bohun</hi> perceiving this confuſion, came with his old ſoldiers to remedy it, but could not, and the Torrent drawing them in alſo along with it, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to follow the example of the reſt. The Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi> ſeeing the enemies Army come out of their <hi>Tabor</hi> ſo precipitouſly, could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what it meant, and thinking at firſt that they came to fall upon him, he placed himſelf with the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men which he had onely then with him, in a poſture the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to hinder his being encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in, but taking more notice of the enemy a while after, he was better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and began to purſue them, but was ſtopped by the force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the rout as they ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet he ſet upon them as ſoon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48502:89"/>
as he could, being ſeconded by the Auxiliaries of the Palatine of <hi>Plosko,</hi> who making a review at the ſame time when the flight of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> began, was the neareſt to purſue them; The reſt of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army which did not expect that their enemies ſhould be ſo ſodainly routed, and conſequently were not on horſeback, except thoſe who guarded the Camp, ran ſtreight to the <hi>Tabor</hi> of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> where finding ſufficient booty, they imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves about it, inſtead of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their enemies; the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> loſt no leſs in this flight then twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, either killed by the <hi>Poland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or loſt in the Woods, Briers, Marſhes, and Boggs; two thouſand of them retreating to a little hill within their <hi>Tabor,</hi> not in hopes of any relief, but as men reſolved to ſell their lives as dear as they could; when they ſaw themſelves conſtrained to yield to the multitude of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> ſome caſt themſelves into the River, others into the Boggs, and in one place three hundred of them were in a body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

and defended themſelves vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly againſt the great number of thoſe who aſſaulted them, and ſet upon them on all ſides; yet that theſe alſo might not deſpair, and ſet too little value upon their lives, the <hi>Poles</hi> offered them both that and any thing elſe they had of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue about them, but this rather incenſed them the more; and immediately they took out of their Pockets and Girdles, all their Money: or whatſoever they had conſiderable, and threw it into the water, and after that, fought till the laſt man, every one as it were reſolving to fight ſingly againſt the force of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and what was very remarkable, one of them held out three hours againſt all aſſaults whatſoever, for having got a little Boat in a Pond in the Marſhes, and covered himſelf with the ſides of it, he avoided all the ſhot which they made at him, and in anſwer, ſhot away all the Powder he had at them; and with his Sithe repulſed all thoſe who attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.

the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> with about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Rixdollars, which were deſigned for the <hi>Tartars</hi>; Veſts lined with rich Furrs, Arms in great number, and Proviſion in abundance; and even the Pots and Spits at the fire, a ſigne that their flight was not at all preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated.</p>
            <p>This defeat coſt the <hi>Poles</hi> not many men, and but one Captain of <hi>Radzevil</hi> his Regiment of Foot, who was ſlain at the attacquing of the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Coſſacks</hi> who retired into the Marſh.

the Auxiliaries at <hi>Bereſtesko,</hi> marched alſo in purſuit of them towards <hi>Krzmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enecz</hi>; but found in all that journey no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſpectacles of horror, the ways being ſtrewed with dead bodies, and the Woods filled with thoſe miſerable perſons, who after their defeat, fled into the thickeſt part of them, where they found no other ſuſtenance for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days, than the Barks of Trees, and moſt of them were ſo weak, that their Legs were not able to ſerve them in their flight; the indignation of the <hi>Polanders</hi> at length was changed into pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the ſight of theſe Skeletons, and inſtead of purſuing them to deſtroy them, they did it to give them their lives, and to perſwade them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48502:92"/>
whereby he muſt have neceſſarily depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated one of the principal Provinces of his Kingdom, which ſerved for a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the reſt, and muſt conſequently have ruined a number of Gentlemen, and chief of the Nobility, who having great Eſtates there, could not have received their Rents, if the Countrey had been unpeopled. The Peaſants in <hi>Poland</hi> being a part of the Gentlemens inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and by this means they being deprived of their Tenants, it would have been very difficult for them to find others to ſerve them in the Tenure of Villenage, and this is the true Motive which then and at other times hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the utter ruine of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> without which conſideration, it would not have been difficult to have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
            <p>The King judging his preſence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to terminate this War, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Reduction of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> made account to march with his whole Army to <hi>Kiovia,</hi> and from thence to ſend his Forces and Orders neceſſary
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48502:92"/>
for the accompliſhing of this deſign. But the Nobility oppoſed it, alledging, That the neceſſity of his Affairs did oblige him to return; and that part of the Army, would be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what remained, That the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were ſcattered, and in no condition to rally after this defeat; that if any of them ſhould take up Arms again, the raiſed Troops would be ſufficient to hinder and render uſeleſs all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts whatſoever, and in one word, that there could be no pretence of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nobility into a Countrey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and laid waſte by the continual violencies of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and where they might be famiſhed; ſo that upon a general Council held at <hi>Orla,</hi> of all the Commanders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, it was determined, that thoſe who would return ſhould be ſatisfied, which were the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> after he had left his Inſtructions with the Great General <hi>Potoski,</hi> for the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that which he had ſo happily undertaken, took his journey towards

               <hi>Warſaw,</hi> having firſt had a promiſe from the Nobility of a new ſupply of Men and Money. The King before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture alſo received an account, how that the Cham being informed of the defeat of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> had haſtened his retreat towards <hi>Crim,</hi> and that the four thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> who came to their aſſiſtance, having alſo intelligence of it, had paſſed the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: This news was accompanied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with that of the defeat of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> in <hi>Lythuania</hi> by Prince <hi>Radzevil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to the number of twelve thouſand, Commanded by <hi>Niebaba</hi> one of their Generals, had placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves near to <hi>Loiowogrod,</hi> at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the River <hi>Seſz</hi> into the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes,</hi> where after they had made Works to ſecure to themſelves the paſſage over thoſe Rivers, their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral left Forces to guard them. Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> General of <hi>Lythuania,</hi> hearing of this, reſolved to ſet upon them, and to this effect, ſent before him Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Mirski</hi> with three thouſand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen

men, with Orders to paſs the <hi>Boriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi>; and he himſelf embarked with the reſt of his Foot and his Artillery, while his Horſe marched by Land, at his arrival he ſet upon their intrenchments on one ſide, while that <hi>Mirski</hi> to whom he had given the ſignal by the diſcharge of ſome of his Cannon, was to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other; the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> defended themſelves bravely for an hour and half, after which they were overthrown and cut in pieces. <hi>Niebaba</hi> coming with his Army to the relief of his.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> although that <hi>Mirski</hi> were not yet joyned with him, as having not paſſed the River which parted them, neglected not to incounter him, and after a ſharp conflict, in which three of the principal Colonels of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Niebaba</hi> their General was ſlain, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew their Army, killed three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, took many priſoners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt the Nephew of <hi>Niebaba,</hi> the reſt ſaved themſelves in their Camp, which was not far from the place of Battel, which they alſo ſodainly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as alſo the City of <hi>Lubiecz,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48502:94"/>
and <hi>Czernobel</hi> near to it, who yielded up themſelves without making any great reſiſtance to <hi>Gonſieuski,</hi> General of the Artillery of <hi>Lythuania</hi>; after which Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> took his way towards <hi>Kiovia,</hi> to put an end to the remainder of the Rebellion in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Potoski</hi> imployed himſelf to the ſame purpoſe in <hi>Volhynia,</hi> where the difficulty of getting Proviſions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forced him to divide his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many parts, he appointed their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous to be at <hi>Lubertowa,</hi> a Town which in the heat of all the war had preſerved it ſelf by the convenience of its ſcituation, and number of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and from thence to goe and make an attempt upon <hi>Pawolocz</hi> and <hi>Bialacierkiew,</hi> giving a ſtrict Command, that the Officers ſhould order it, that their Soldiers ſhould ſo behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that manner, that the Peaſants might by no means be conſtrained to quit their Houſes, or to deſtroy what Proviſions were left. The Gentlemen alſo took all care to bring the Peaſants
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48502:94"/>
to their former duty, promiſing them by Letters and Meſſages, that they ſhould be moſt favourably dealt withal, if they would return to their obedience.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Kmielniski</hi> having with a ſumme of Money, appeaſed the Cham and freed himſelf, returned into <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain</hi> to ſtrengthen and confirme the minds of thoſe people, which the laſt defeat and his abſence had very much ſhaken; and taking the ſame courſe as formerly, in thoſe places where he could not be in perſon, by his Letters and Emiſſaries, he gave new heat to their courage, which was very much abated, exhorting them to maintain the cauſe of the Publick, and putting them in mind how fortune was momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and changeable, and if of late ſhe had declared her ſelf in favour of the <hi>Poles,</hi> yet ſhe had left the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> Strength and forces ſufficient to renew the war and recover their loſſes, and to feed their hopes, he gave out that one <hi>Ragoci</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> was revolted, and thereby had obliged the King to draw
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48502:95"/>
back the greateſt part of his Army to ſtop his progreſs, that the Flower of the old <hi>Coſſackian</hi> Militia was gathering together, and that in few days the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> would come and joyn with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to revenge their laſt defeat, and to keep up the hopes of this people ſtill more high, from time to time he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched ſeveral Embaſſies to the Cham, which he accompanied with magnificent promiſes to induce him to afford him new ſupplies, remonſtrating to him that the ſecurity of both their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes depended upon it, and that the ruine of the one would infallibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the other to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> power; he ſent alſo three Envoyes to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, to repreſent to them, that if the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were aſſiſted by the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, they might be in a condition to make head againſt all the Forces of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but if they were abandoned, they muſt be neceſſitated to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the end to make war againſt himſelf.</p>

The Inhabitants ſeeing they were deprived of their Garriſon, and all other means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves, ſent their Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> General by their Archbiſhop, and their Archimandrit or Abbot of their chief <hi>Greek</hi> Monaſtery, requeſting of him that he would ſpare

that City which the King had always the goodneſs to preſerve, and which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt wars, had ſerved for a place of refuge to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, which requeſt was granted by Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> who onely diſarmed them, to take away from them for the future the opportunity of doing ill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> hearing of the loſs of <hi>Kio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> doubled his diligence, and ſought out all means imaginable to bring a new Army into the Field, able to ſtop the progreſs of his enemies, and the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate poſture of his affairs ſuggeſted counſel to him full of fury and deſpair: in the middle of which, he found not only his <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> but a great part of the Peaſants alſo inclined to try again the fortune of the war, and among theſe latter, there were ſome who openly declared, that it was diſgraceful to them to be dejected for the ill ſucceſs of one Battel, and that thoſe who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame them now, they had formerly overcome, and the ſame might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed again; but if that Fortune
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48502:96"/>
ſhould obſtinately declare her ſelf for the <hi>Poles,</hi> there was ſtill a place left them to retreat into, the Countrey of the <hi>Turks,</hi> where they might live with more freedom then in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> to which intent they had already wrote to the Baſſa of <hi>Siliſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that many of the Peaſants went e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to joyn with <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> and the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> began their incurſions and violencies in many places, particularly thoſe who inhabit near the <hi>Nieſter</hi> and <hi>Wallachia</hi> who are more accuſtomed to theſe Robberies then the other.

withal by two thouſand <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and five hundred <hi>Tartars</hi> not far from thence, who ſet upon them, and drove them to the Gates of that Town, took away all their booty, and had utterly defeated them, had not the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Wiſnowitz</hi> arrived in time to their aſſiſtance, by whoſe help they made head againſt thoſe who purſued them, and drove part of them into their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and part into <hi>Bialacerkiew,</hi> it was known by ſome <hi>Tartar</hi> priſoners, taken upon this occaſion, that there were but two thouſand of them with <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> but that in a few days four thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were expected, and that the reſt of thoſe Infidels were gone to refreſh their Horſes in the Paſtures of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Plains, and had received Orders to be in readineſs to return upon the firſt occaſion into <hi>Poland.</hi> This news made General <hi>Potoski</hi> to delay his march, till the arrival of his Foot and Baggage; when deliberating in Council, with his Officers what was to be done; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſeize upon <hi>Chzaſtowa,</hi> a Town on the way to <hi>Kiovia,</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate

their communication with it and their joyning with Prince <hi>Radze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; while they lay expecting the Foot at <hi>Pawolocz,</hi> which marched but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Plague took away in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his age <hi>Michael Koributh,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wiſniwitz,</hi> who had given ſufficient proof of his Valor and ſingular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in all this War, by which he was deprived of the Revenue of a great Eſtate in <hi>

            <p>After that the Army had ſpent the five and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring their laſt Devoirs to this great perſon, they marched the next day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tryliſicz,</hi> a place well fortified; this Garriſon having ſent a fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſummons of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to ſurrender themſelves, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Priemski</hi>-General of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and Commiſſary of the Army, and <hi>Berg,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel to the Regiment of Prince <hi>Bogiſlaus Radzevil,</hi> with ſeven hundred <hi>German</hi> Foot to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque them; they loſt threeſcore or fourſcore men in the approaches,

The Governor of the place, a <hi>Coſſack,</hi> was hanged in the heat of blood; the Town was plundered, and what could not be carried away, was with it reduced to Aſhes, and this ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wrought better effects then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Clemency could have done, for the Flames being perceived by thoſe of <hi>Chwaſtowa,</hi> the three hundred <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> which guarded that Town, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook it, and the Inhabitants alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their example, although they might well have reſiſted the <hi>Poles,</hi> and put them to the expenſe of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> expecting the Kings Orders, and that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army ſhould
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48502:98"/>

Upon the ſixteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Colonel <hi>Nold</hi> being ſent out by this Prince, diſcovered by the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil near to the Gate of <hi>Kiovia,</hi> called the <hi>Gilded Gate,</hi> a great body of <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> mingled with <hi>Tartars,</hi> which ſoon allarmed the Camp, and a party of Light Horſe ſet upon them with ſuch courage, that after they had taken a Bridge which the enemies put much truſt in for the ſecuring themſelves, they killed a thouſand of them upon the place; ſome of the priſoners confeſſed that this body of three thouſand men was to have joyned with a thouſand more, with deſigne of falling upon the <hi>Lythuanian</hi> Army in their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> after this advantage, ſet forward to joyn with the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, after that he had left a ſufficient Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

but to gain time and leiſure to eſtabliſh his affairs; he reſolved without delay to terminate this controverſie by force of Arms. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army being now conſiderably reinforced, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the <hi>Lythuanians,</hi> conſiſting of nine thouſand choſen men; <hi>Kmiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niski</hi> although he had received a freſh ſupply of ſix thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> did not neglect to make another attempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an accommodation, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine of <hi>Kiovia</hi> endeavoured with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers arguments to induce the Generals to put an end to this War, rather by a general Pardon, then by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of ſo many cruelties; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them that the many troubles which the ſoldiers had undergone in this Campagnia, and the Diſeaſes reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them, had diminiſhed, and did diminiſh daily a great number of them, ſo that the Generals <hi>Potoski</hi> and <hi>Radzevil,</hi> condeſcended to receive the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> deputed to come and deſire peace. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> deſiring that ſome one might be diſpatched to him, to conferre with <hi>Vihouski</hi> his Secretary,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48502:100"/>
and intimate Friend, they ſent to him <hi>Makouski,</hi> a Captain of Horſe, with a Letter to him from the General <hi>Potos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> but becauſe he gave him not the Title of General of the <hi>Zaporovian</hi> Army, this omiſſion was taken for a great injury, and made a diſturbance among the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>; but <hi>Makouski</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appeaſed them by giving them ſufficient reaſons for what was done; the conference began, in which the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Deputy propoſed, that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> ſhould ſend away the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and come himſelf to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp and pay his reſpects to their Generals; he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt of theſe propoſitions for a long time, whatſoever his Secretary could doe to draw from him his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but in the end he agreed to one as well as the other, although his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Peaſants expreſſed a great deal of repugnancy for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But finding it not convenient to continue this conference in the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> Camp, leſt that the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſuſpecting what they Treated of might attempt ſomething againſt the perſons of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48502:100"/>
Commiſſioners, <hi>Vihouski</hi> did very much inſtance that it might be removed to <hi>Bialacierkiew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Makouski</hi> giving an account to the Generals of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation with the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> it was thought expedient to ſend Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to <hi>Bialacierkiew</hi> as they deſired, to this intent were deputed the Palatines of <hi>Kiovia</hi> and <hi>Smolensko. Zowzieuski,</hi> High Steward of <hi>Lythuania</hi> and <hi>Coſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couski,</hi> ſecond Judge of <hi>Braclaw,</hi> whom they guarded with a great Convoy, of which five hundred Horſe onely were permitted to enter the Town. Theſe Commiſſioners Treating with thoſe of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> agreed of all the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace, excepting ſome few points which were afterwards to be decided in the two Camps, but were in great danger of their lives, firſt in the Army of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> where <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and his Officers had enough to doe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from the violencies of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the Peaſants, who could not endure any propoſitions of Peace,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48502:101"/>
ſuſpecting always that one of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles would be to reduce them to their former ſervitude. The <hi>Tartars</hi> alſo ſet upon them in their return, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered part of their Baggage.</p>
            <p>In the mean time General <hi>Potoski</hi> and Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> ſeeing that the Treaty was almoſt concluded, removed from <hi>Hermanowka</hi> to <hi>Bialacerkiew,</hi> the place where <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Commanders of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were to renew their Oath of Allegiance to the King and State, at the approach of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſeemed to be very much ſurprized, but they being certified that it was upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſigne then to oppoſe the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> new Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſent on both ſides to conclude of what was left undecided at the laſt conference.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> inſtead of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented new propoſitions, as if they had forgot what had been ſo lately determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, demanding the performance of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48502:101"/>
Treaty at <hi>Zborow</hi>; that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army ſhould leave the frontiers, and give them liberty to maintain their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the true defenders of their priviledges; ſo that after the <hi>Poles</hi> had reproached them of their lightneſs and infidelity, which muſt needs proceed from the news of ſome new ſupply from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or the falſe report of the Grand Signior his ſending ſome conſiderable Forces; they drew up their Army, and committed the right wing to Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> with his <hi>Lythuanians,</hi> the left to <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> and reſerved the main body for Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Potoski.</hi> The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> came alſo out of their Camp, as if they had no other deſigne but to obſerve the poſture of the <hi>Poles</hi>; there paſſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers skirmiſhes between them for three days, and divers Companies of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hid themſelves in Thickets and cloſe places, making frequent attempts upon the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, annoying them ſometimes in the Flanck, and ſometimes in the Reer, which it is thought they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48502:102"/>
did to make the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Generals more tractable, and to obtain more advanta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gious conditions of peace. In the mean time they being wearied with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> who pretended to diſallow of all theſe attempts and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes; and being earneſt with him to declare his mind, he ſent them upon the 26 of <hi>September,</hi> three Deputies to endeavor ſeriouſly the concluſion of the Treaty; theſe were much more moderate in their demands, although they were very different alſo from thoſe agreed upon at <hi>Bialacerkiew</hi>; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had concluded that the number of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> inrolled, ſhould amount to twenty thouſand, they demanded alſo that they might have their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Palatinates of <hi>Braclaw</hi> and <hi>Czernihow,</hi> and this being refuſed, they inſiſted, that at leaſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces ſhould not be quartered there during the time that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> was employed in inrolling the <hi>Coſſackian</hi> Militia; and that they ſhould give him for his own maintenance, the Territories of <hi>Czir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſy</hi> and <hi>Borowitza. Potoski</hi> gave them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48502:102"/>
to underſtand, that this latter demand could not be granted without expreſs Orders from the King and State, but condeſcended to the other, after that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> had ſecretly informed him that he inſiſted upon it only to content the revolted Peaſants, whom he thought not fit to irritate ſo long as they kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made ſo conſiderable a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that there remained nothing but that he and his chief Officers ſhould come and make their ſubmiſſions to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Generals, which he was inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to do, after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Hoſtages for his ſecurity, though divers of his Officers with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty were brought to conſent to it. Upon the 28 of <hi>September,</hi> he and the principal Commanders of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> came to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp, where with much Humility, and the Tears in his Eyes (which he had always ready to ſhed, when the neceſſity of his affairs required) he asked Pardon of the Great General <hi>Potoski,</hi> and ſaluted Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> and the reſt of the Nobility with all reſpect. In his preſence were
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48502:103"/>
