            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>King <hi>Stephen Batory,</hi> to whom <hi>Poland</hi> is beholden for many good Rules, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering the Å¿ervice which he might draw from theÅ¿e Rovers, towards the defence of the frontiers of <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ia</hi> and

               <hi>Podolia,</hi> which lay always expoÅ¿ed to the incurÅ¿ions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> formed a Militia out of them, and gave them the Town of <hi>Trethymirow</hi> upon the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿thenes</hi> for a GarriÅ¿on, made a General over them, and gave him power to make under-Officers, granting them beÅ¿ides their pay, divers priviledges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and joyned to this Infantry of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> two thouÅ¿and HorÅ¿e, for the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tance of which he deÅ¿igned the fourth part of his Crown-Lands whence they were called <hi>Quartani,</hi> and by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Quartiani.</hi>

thoÅ¿e who purÅ¿ue them at two hundred paces diÅ¿tance, and at a quarter of a League from thence rally their forces again and return preÅ¿ently to charge; this they repeat often, it being their manner of fighting, but it is onely thus, when they are the greateÅ¿t number, for otherwiÅ¿e when they once run, it is full Å¿peed, and not to return again, and it is difficult to Å¿urpriÅ¿e them, they keeping Å¿trict watch all night, not eaÅ¿ie to defeat them, unleÅ¿s it be in Å¿ome Å¿treight, or upon Å¿ome paÅ¿s of a River.</p>

from <hi>Adam KiÅ¿iel</hi> Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi> by the hands of a <hi>Greek</hi> Monk: this Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine who was alÅ¿o a <hi>Greek,</hi> uÅ¿ed very milde and obliging expreÅ¿Å¿ions to bring back the head of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Å¿etting forth to him the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient fidelity of the <hi>Zaporowski CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> who though they were very jealous of their Liberty, were always very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant, and lived in a State where all perÅ¿ons, but chiefly Men of War, had always free acceÅ¿s to make good their intereÅ¿ts, and to complain of their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they received; that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely Senator of the <hi>Greek</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Protector of their Rites and Churches, which he did always moÅ¿t heartily defend: did conjure him by the Saintity of the Å¿ame Religion, and the Honour of the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ian</hi> Nation, that he would Å¿end home the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and lead the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> back into their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿tations, and that in the mean time he would depute Å¿ome perÅ¿ons to make known the injuries which they and he in particular had received, and to deÅ¿ire Å¿ome redreÅ¿s, offering his own care

and Å¿ervices to help them to all the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they could pretend to, and withal, he was a perÅ¿on of that rank and quality in the State, that no Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations or Orders could be given either for peace or war, without his being advertiÅ¿ed of it; but he aÅ¿Å¿ured them, he Å¿hould always be inclined to have theÅ¿e diÅ¿orders terminated in a peaceable way, rather then to have them entertained by the continuation of a Civil war; and that their Arms at preÅ¿ent imployed in their mutual Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, might be more profitably, and gloriouÅ¿ly made uÅ¿e of againÅ¿t the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ChriÅ¿tendome.

He was no Å¿ooner intrenched, but the Army of the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaÅ¿Å¿ed them in on all Å¿ides in Å¿uch numbers, that there have been Å¿eldom Å¿een the like forces together, Å¿ince thoÅ¿e of <hi>Attila</hi> and <hi>Tamberlan</hi>; and that which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48502:46"/>
was never known before, the Cham himÅ¿elf was there in perÅ¿on, thinking to Å¿wallow up the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> as a prey, which could not eÅ¿cape him, and which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> did not fail to make him believe infallibly his own; Å¿o that he made Å¿o little eÅ¿teem of this handful of <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Soldiers, which were the onely forces which appeared then to defend the Frontiers; that he reÅ¿olved not to take them by Famine, but to force their Camp, which he thought he might Å¿o much the more eaÅ¿ily execute by reaÅ¿on that the number of his Army was Å¿uch, that he had no need to be Å¿paring of his Men.</p>
            <p>He made a General AÅ¿Å¿ault upon the 13 of <hi>July,</hi> 1649. which was very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he himÅ¿elf at the Head of his Forces; who not underÅ¿tanding well the danger, and unacquainted with the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> valor, ruÅ¿hed on deÅ¿perately to this Attack; the cheif aÅ¿Å¿ault was made upon the Quarters of General <hi>Firley,</hi> as moÅ¿t of all expoÅ¿ed. ThoÅ¿e that aÅ¿Å¿aulted them, were under covert by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48502:47"/>
the convenience of a Neighboring Valley: So that Å¿ome of them, who had already forced the intrenchment, were beaten off with great difficulty. <hi>Firley</hi> and Prince <hi>WiÅ¿nowitski</hi> defended themÅ¿elves valiantly; the latter Å¿eeing his Men begin to give way. prohibited them by his command Å¿hooting any longer againÅ¿t the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom he gave out to have promiÅ¿ed Peace and FriendÅ¿hip to their Generals; and by this Artifice, encouraged and perÅ¿wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Soldiers Å¿o far, that they Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing now they had onely the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> to deal withal, had new vigor infuÅ¿ed into them, and after having Å¿lain a great number, repulÅ¿ed the reÅ¿t aÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed at their deÅ¿perate bravery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now Å¿uÅ¿tained that Å¿ame day Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen aÅ¿Å¿aults.</p>
            <p>The <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> renewed them again the following days, but Å¿till with leÅ¿s Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s, although they joyned Å¿tratagems to force, for to make the <hi>Polanders</hi> think that they had received new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the <hi>Turks,</hi> they habited divers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48502:47"/>
of their own after the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> manner, who conducted a Party of HorÅ¿e the Å¿ame way habited, but were really onely <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> VeÅ¿ts Å¿tuffed with Straw, and Å¿et on Horsback. But the manner of this deceit was eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the <hi>Polanders</hi> by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pective GlaÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> Å¿ent in Letters often, in Å¿ome of which he exhorted <hi>Firley</hi> to an accommodation; in others, he Å¿olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the <hi>German</hi> Troops to deÅ¿ert them; but finding that he prevailed nothing, either by force or art, he thought upon attacking the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Camp by approaches, and imployed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted PeaÅ¿ants who were in great number in his Army, to work in them day and night; Å¿o that in few days he advanced them to the very foot of their Intrenchment.</p>
            <p>This new attempt of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> troubled the <hi>Poles</hi> more then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and Å¿eeing that they were now Å¿hut up cloÅ¿er, and that it would be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48502:48"/>
difficult for them to maintain their firÅ¿t intrenchment, they made others nearer to the Town: Into which, they retired themÅ¿elves as Å¿oon as they were perfected, and divers, even of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers themÅ¿elves, were of opinion, that they Å¿hould quit all that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and Å¿hut themÅ¿elves up into the place; but this advice appearing very dangerous, was not followed. But beÅ¿ides the extremity they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, in having Å¿carce any Å¿pace left them to Å¿tir in, their ProviÅ¿ion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be Å¿carce, and their Provender for their HorÅ¿es; So that they dying every day in heaps, cauÅ¿ed an unÅ¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Å¿tink in the Camp. A morÅ¿el of Bread was Å¿old for Ten Poltoracks, and a Tun of Beer for Fifty Florins<note place="margin">Polto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks is about Two-pence EngliÅ¿h. A Florin Twenty Polto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks.</note>. The Soldiers lived upon no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion, then the FleÅ¿h of Dogs and HorÅ¿es. <hi>Kmielniski</hi> knowing in what condition the beÅ¿ieged were, became more inÅ¿olent, and would grant them no terms but what were very hard. The Cham Å¿hewed himÅ¿elf more courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet having demanded that <hi>WiÅ¿no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witski</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48502:48"/>
and <hi>KonieÅ¿polski</hi> Å¿hould come and confer with him. And the <hi>Poland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> refuÅ¿ing that theÅ¿e great perÅ¿ons Å¿hould put themÅ¿elves into his hands, he was very much offended. The <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Generals might well Å¿end MeÅ¿Å¿engers to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to let him know in what extremity they were, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire a Å¿peedy relief; for moÅ¿t of them fell into the hands of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi>; and if any one eÅ¿caped in their going out, yet they received no anÅ¿wer, they being either killed or taken priÅ¿oners in their return. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever the Generals pretended, that from time to time they received news from His MajeÅ¿ty of <hi>Poland</hi>; and that he would Å¿peedily come to relieve them; and that it might be the more firmly believed, they affixed the Kings Seal to the Letters which they feigned, having taken it off from other Letters which they had formerly received. Thus they encouraged the beÅ¿ieged Army, and induced them to have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, both by the artifice and Å¿weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of their DiÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48502:49"/>Some, even of the Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who had proviÅ¿ions Å¿ufficient for themÅ¿elves, left their good Meals which they might have made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themÅ¿elves to eat Å¿tinking HorÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleÅ¿h and Dogs-fleÅ¿h, to make theÅ¿e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿avory DiÅ¿hes be better reliÅ¿hed by their Soldiers. <hi>Firley,</hi> although he were infirm, by reaÅ¿on of his years and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would have made uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame fare, had he not been often hindred by thoÅ¿e who were about him. <hi>WiÅ¿nowitski</hi> and <hi>KonieÅ¿polski</hi> neglected not in the mean time, frequently to Å¿ally out upon the beÅ¿iegers, to put them out of hopes of any Å¿peedy victory over people, who Å¿till preÅ¿erved Å¿o much vigor and reÅ¿olution, in the middle of thoÅ¿e miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they Å¿uffered; but beÅ¿ides, the Å¿carcity of Victuals, their want of Ammunition hindred them from Å¿hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿o frequently as before. And the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> were no ways negligent on their part; for beÅ¿ides their continual Å¿hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againÅ¿t the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Camp, and their frequent aÅ¿Å¿aults, they made approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48502:49"/>
againÅ¿t the Town; and attempted to cut off the Water from the beÅ¿ieged. But theÅ¿e deÅ¿igns not Å¿ucceeding, they contrived to Å¿et the Town of <hi>Zbaras</hi> on fire, and cheifly one of its Gates, which did very much incommodate them, it being higher then the reÅ¿t, and the beÅ¿t marks-men of the <hi>Poles</hi> Å¿hot from thence without ceaÅ¿ing; amongÅ¿t whom Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Butler</hi> did marvellous execution, and Father <hi>Muchaveski,</hi> a JeÅ¿uite, no leÅ¿s; who from the Gate of the CaÅ¿tle killed no leÅ¿s then two hundred <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> for his part.</p>
            <p>A great company of the Rebels came up to the Gate with Firebrands in their Hands, ready to Å¿et it on fire: Having obtained which, it was very probable they would gain the reÅ¿t; but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ieged being advertiÅ¿ed of their deÅ¿ign, prepared themÅ¿elves to render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, received them briskly, and made a great Å¿laughter. Things were in this poÅ¿ture, when an Arrow Å¿hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, brought with it moÅ¿t fortunately a Letter tied to it; by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48502:50"/>
which he who wrote it, although his name were never known, gave them to underÅ¿tand he was a Gentleman; and firÅ¿t excuÅ¿ed himÅ¿elf, for Å¿erving under the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi>; to which he was induced by the outrages which he had received from a certain great perÅ¿on; and by the turn of the Fortune of the <hi>Poles</hi> the year before, but yet that he had not for all that, loÅ¿t his love and zeal for his Countrey, as he had teÅ¿tified to them in three other Letters, which he had Å¿ent to them in the Å¿ame manner; and did now give them notice, that the King was certainly coming to their relief, and already arrived at <hi>Zborow,</hi> that the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> being informed of his coming, would not fail to redouble their aÅ¿Å¿aults againÅ¿t them; but for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on they ought to redouble their courage, and prepare themÅ¿elves to repulÅ¿e them with their utmoÅ¿t vigor.</p>
            <p>The moÅ¿t part of the beÅ¿ieged could not put any confidence in this Letter, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing it to be a new invention of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48502:50"/>
the Generals: But Å¿oon after it was found to be true, and that the King was advanced as far as <hi>Zborow</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his beÅ¿ieged Forces, having Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all thoÅ¿e obÅ¿tacles which might retard his preparations, and his march. True it is, that his Army was thought by the moÅ¿t intelligent, not onely inÅ¿ufficient to confront that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible number of enemies which he went againÅ¿t, but even to Å¿uÅ¿tain the leaÅ¿t OnÅ¿et from them, it conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in all, but of Fifteen thouÅ¿and Soldiers in pay, and Five thouÅ¿and others raiÅ¿ed by the Nobility at their own charge, the reÅ¿t not being able to come Å¿o Å¿oon, having been too Å¿low in their Levies; notwithÅ¿tanding the continual inÅ¿tances of the King, and his earneÅ¿t diligence in this affair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and the Cham underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the march of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> divided their Forces, and leaving For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouÅ¿and <hi>Tartars</hi>; with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> and revolted Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ants before <hi>Zbaras</hi>; with the reÅ¿t of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48502:51"/>
their forces marched towards <hi>Zborow,</hi> and were not diÅ¿covered by the Kings forces, either by reaÅ¿on that the King had Å¿ent none out to inform himÅ¿elf, or that the Countrymen thereabouts, more inclined to favor the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> as being of the Å¿ame Religion with them, had not faithfully reported what they knew of it; inÅ¿omuch, that the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> arrived at the Kings Camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being any ways diÅ¿covered, being aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted therein by the Woods, the thick MiÅ¿ts, and the negligence of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

            </p>
            <p>The fight began about the Baggage, the <hi>Tartars</hi> came Å¿oon after and fell

upon the back of the Kings Forces, having croÅ¿Å¿ed a Water; where the PeaÅ¿ants by a remarkable Treachery, had broken down a CauÅ¿ey which kept it up, and Å¿o rendred it fordable to the Infidels. The Nobility of <hi>PremiÅ¿lie,</hi> and the Cavalry of the Duke of <hi>OÅ¿trog</hi> Å¿uÅ¿tained the firÅ¿t OnÅ¿et; but being not able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the great numbers of their enemies, many of that Nobility were loÅ¿t, and all their Baggage.</p>

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48502:52"/>
and a Party of <hi>Tartars</hi> attacked the Front. The King who at the firÅ¿t noiÅ¿e, of their arrival, had put his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Batalia,</hi> gave the Leading of the Right Wing to the Great Chancellor <hi>OÅ¿Å¿olinski.</hi> This Wing was compoÅ¿ed of the Cavalry of the King; and of that of the <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Podolia, Beltz,</hi> and <hi>Enhoff ScarroÅ¿te</hi> of <hi>Sokal,</hi> and other Regiments: And ordered the Left Wing to be commanded by <hi>George Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirski, starroÅ¿te</hi> of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Coreski</hi>; where beÅ¿ides the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of HorÅ¿e were divers Companies of Voluntiers.</p>
            <p>The Main Battel made up of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and where the King himÅ¿elf was in PerÅ¿on, was commanded by Major General <hi>Hubald</hi> of <hi>MiÅ¿nia,</hi> who had Å¿erved a long time in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, and had afterwards commanded the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi>; and by one <hi>Wolff</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Liefland,</hi> Governor of <hi>Cracovia</hi>; both which had their <hi>German</hi> Regiments with them.</p>

            <p>Some <hi>Tartars</hi> having broken in on one Å¿ide were repulÅ¿ed again by the diÅ¿charge of their Cannon, and by two Companies of Foot Commanded by <hi>Ghiza,</hi> Captain in the Kings Guards, and in the end the Enemy not being able to get any advantage over them anÅ¿werable to thoÅ¿e great endeavors againÅ¿t the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, the night co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on, terminated that days engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which in all likelihood they were to have been cut in pieces; moÅ¿t of the night was Å¿pent in conÅ¿ult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving Order how to receive the Enemy the next day, they made Å¿ome intrenchments in haÅ¿te to defend

            <p>The enemies afterwards divided themÅ¿elves into three bodies, and at as many places attacked the Kings Camp, after having firÅ¿t of all Å¿eized upon a Church which did Command it, where having planted a Battery by their continual Å¿hooting from which they had forced many who defended it to retire; they had almoÅ¿t made themÅ¿elves MaÅ¿ters of it, and one of

The reÅ¿ult of this Diet, which ended the Twelfth of <hi>January,</hi> One thouÅ¿and Å¿ix hundred and fifty, was, That all the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Soldiers Å¿hould be immediately Å¿atisfied: That the Army which had been Å¿hut up at <hi>Zbaras,</hi> in conÅ¿ideration of their great Å¿ervices, Å¿hould receive three payments extraordinary, there Å¿hould be Twelve thouÅ¿and Men in continual pay for the Guard of the Frontiers: That the Articles concluded on, between the King, and the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> at <hi>Zborow,</hi> Å¿hould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: That three of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿ackian</hi> Gentlemen Å¿hould be admitted to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices: And that for the Å¿upply of theÅ¿e great expences, there Å¿hould be a new ImpoÅ¿t laid upon all <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania</hi>; and CuÅ¿toms upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿es granted to his MajeÅ¿ty, for his Signal Exploits in the laÅ¿t Campagnia.</p>

               <hi>Adam KiÅ¿iel,</hi> appointed a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be Governor of that Town, was thought to be a perÅ¿on moÅ¿t able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himÅ¿elf worthily in that charge, and to regiÅ¿ter the Forty thouÅ¿and Men, of which the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿ackian</hi> Army was to conÅ¿iÅ¿t, according to the laÅ¿t Treaty, and to give them their neceÅ¿Å¿ary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kmielniski</hi> obÅ¿erved this Peace almoÅ¿t a year, and teÅ¿tified in all appearance his good intentions; but apprehending leaÅ¿t the <hi>Polanders</hi> whom he had forced, in the unhappy conjuncture of their affairs, to grant him extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Å¿hould now repent of it, and Å¿earch out ways to elude the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them; he thought that he could not do better then by powerful Alliances, to Å¿ecure to himÅ¿elf theÅ¿e advantages which had been conceded.</p>
            <p>And to this intent, he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to the Grand Signior, and the Great Duke of <hi>MuÅ¿covy</hi>; but eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the firÅ¿t, by whoÅ¿e favor he hoped

In the thickeÅ¿t of which, the <hi>HoÅ¿podar,</hi> with his family, and as many as he could get together in haÅ¿te, intrenched themÅ¿elves with Trees cut down; and afterwards drew himÅ¿elf out of this danger, upon the payment of Twenty thouÅ¿and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the promiÅ¿e of his Daughter in marriage to <hi>Timotheus

            <p>In the mean time, the Peace with the <hi>Poles</hi> was every day violated by the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi>; their numerous Army was extended much beyond their quarters. The PeaÅ¿ants who were not inrolled, Å¿uÅ¿tained by them, would not receive thoÅ¿e Gentlemen, their Landlords, who were to enter upon poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of their EÅ¿tates again, but treated them ill, and maÅ¿Å¿acred divers.

            <p>The General in anÅ¿wer reproached him for their daily breach of Peace, and the ill Treatment which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility received from their Subjects; and for the War which <hi>Kmielniski</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken without their knowledge

            <p>This AnÅ¿wer was no way pleaÅ¿ing to the Envoy from <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how much his MaÅ¿ter would be ill Å¿atisfied with it, and mingled threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of War with his diÅ¿courÅ¿e; but proceeded not to breach of Peace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaÅ¿on of the nearneÅ¿s of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, and the Great General, whoÅ¿e admired deÅ¿ert or redoubted courage, might turn him from it; or becauÅ¿e, that the deÅ¿igns he laid of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing a Principality for himÅ¿elf, were not yet mature enough to diÅ¿cloÅ¿e this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious project; or, that he was willing to Å¿et down contented with his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and with having made a new Alliance, although by force of Arms.</p>

            <p>This Letter was received with great reÅ¿pect in appearance, but he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much Å¿lowneÅ¿s, to execute what the King required of him; and on the contrary, was very induÅ¿trious at the Å¿ame time, to make a Å¿trict League with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and Great Duke of <hi>MoÅ¿covy,</hi> whoÅ¿e friendÅ¿hip he deÅ¿ired with the

expected, conÅ¿idered that there were but two ways to be taken; the one to ruine the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> or, the other to let the Kingdom periÅ¿h miÅ¿erably; that the King had onely a title and precarious authority over them, no more then they pleaÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves; that they were now upon the deÅ¿ign of forming a Principality, from whence they were to expect moÅ¿t diÅ¿mal events, if they gave them time to increaÅ¿e and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h themÅ¿elves; that they interpreted the Treaty after their own manner, and gave it what Å¿ence they pleaÅ¿ed; that the State had yet conÅ¿iderable Forces, if they were well imployed; and that as affairs then Å¿tood, they were better able to give a Å¿top to their new and riÅ¿ing power, then they could afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t them, when they were raiÅ¿ed, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by time; that the King was brave and active, and with Å¿mall Armies having done great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, he would obtain more Å¿ignal advantages over his enemies, when the States Å¿hould proceed to a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and powerful undertaking.</p>

            <p>The <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> Demands were theÅ¿e, That according to the Articles of the Peace at <hi>Zborow,</hi> the Union of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks Å¿hould be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed; that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> Å¿hould remain Soveraign beyond the <hi>Boristhenes</hi>; that none of the Nobility or Gentry of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Å¿hould for the future, have any power over the PeaÅ¿ants of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; that if the Gentlemen would live there, they Å¿hould be obliged to work as well as the PeaÅ¿ants; that Nine BiÅ¿hops Å¿hould Å¿wear in full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Å¿ee all this obÅ¿erved; that for HoÅ¿tages they Å¿hould give up four Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines to <hi>Kmielniski</hi> which he Å¿hould chuÅ¿e, in conÅ¿ideration of which Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he promiÅ¿ed to pay to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> yearly a Million of Florins, and afterwards they reduced their Demands to Four.</p>

their Attendants, in caÅ¿e of need; and many thought it fit, that the Auxiliaries Å¿hould be Å¿pared, as a party reÅ¿erved againÅ¿t the laÅ¿t extremities; and that it were better to augment the number of the Soldiers to be raiÅ¿ed. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed alÅ¿o, that the War Å¿hould be begun before the Spring, to hinder the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> from making their due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and to come at them with the more facility, while the Rivers and MarÅ¿hes were yet frozen; in which, they ordinarily Å¿ecure themÅ¿elves in their Marches, and in their Incampings.

to attack <hi>Kamienecz,</hi> without the order or knowledge of their General. And having taken the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Panocze</hi> near to it, by compoÅ¿ition, where they got conÅ¿iderable booty. They made many aÅ¿Å¿aults upon this FortreÅ¿s, but all in vain, being continually repulÅ¿ed with Å¿o great a loÅ¿s, that they were ready to cut their Officers in pieces, who had expoÅ¿ed them to Å¿o dangerous an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿e, without acquainting <hi>Kmielniski</hi> with it; who Å¿o Å¿oon as he knew it, Å¿ent them orders to remove.

reaÅ¿on of the difficult PaÅ¿Å¿ages, and the bad ways, to leave his Carriages.

            </p>
            <p>The Forces raiÅ¿ed at the expence of the States, and by the Noblemen came in daily from all parts, there were reckoned Ten thouÅ¿and of theÅ¿e latter; and the whole Army, together with the Nobility, made up an Hundred thouÅ¿and fighting Men, beÅ¿ides the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were very numerous, and moÅ¿t of them furniÅ¿hed with HorÅ¿e and Arms. This great Army not being able to Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t long in one place, without Å¿uffering the want of ProviÅ¿ions; after that all care poÅ¿Å¿ible was taken to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h them, it was reÅ¿olved, they Å¿hould be employed as Å¿oon as could be. In a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48502:75"/>
great Council of War, which was held thereupon, and laÅ¿ted a whole night; Å¿ome propoÅ¿ed to divide the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Bodies, and to Å¿end the firÅ¿t, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of the Common Soldiers, againÅ¿t the enemies, while his MajeÅ¿ty might attend the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of the War at <hi>Sokallo,</hi> with the Voluntiers and Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries, for a reÅ¿erve againÅ¿t the greateÅ¿t extremity: But this adviÅ¿e was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the King, nor by many of the Principal Officers, who remonÅ¿trated that if the Army were thus divided, it might be more eaÅ¿ily encountred and defeated by the enemies; but being all in one Body, they would not onely be in a condition to oppoÅ¿e, but alÅ¿o to overcome them. They concluded therefore to march directly towards them, by the moÅ¿t Å¿hort and eaÅ¿ie way, which was, that by <hi>BereÅ¿tesko.</hi> The King Å¿et forward with all his Forces upon the Fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi> and Å¿ent out divers parties to hear news of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks.</hi> The MarÅ¿hy, MooriÅ¿h places which he was to travel through, and the great number of Carriages cauÅ¿ed his Forces

to march Å¿catteringly. So that he thought it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ten Brigades, if we may Å¿o name a Body of Ten or twelve thouÅ¿and men, of which number each was compoÅ¿ed; he reÅ¿erved the firÅ¿t for himÅ¿elf, gave the command of the Å¿econd to the great General <hi>Potoski</hi>; the third to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Campagne <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of <hi>Czernihovia</hi>; the fourth to <hi>John Simon Szcavinski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>BreÅ¿tch</hi>; the fifth to the Duke of <hi>WiÅ¿nowitz,</hi> Palatine of <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ia</hi>; the Å¿ixth to <hi>StaniÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Potoski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Podolia</hi>; the Å¿eventh to the Grand MarÅ¿hal of the Kingdom <hi>Lubomirski</hi>; the eighth to <hi>StaniÅ¿laus Landskoronski,</hi> Palatine of <hi>Braclaw</hi>; the nineth to the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Lithuania, Sapieha</hi>; the tenth to <hi>KonieÅ¿polski,</hi> the Great EnÅ¿ign to the Crown.

Scarce were they returned into the Camp, but the Scouts brought word, that the whole Army of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were near to <hi>Pereatin,</hi> a Village within five hundred paces; Å¿o that the Generals preÅ¿ently drew up the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, left the River <hi>Ster</hi> on one Å¿ide of them, and lined all the Wooded places near, with divers Companies of Foot, for fear of an AmbuÅ¿h.</p>

The Baggage and Ammunition was left in the Camp, which was intrenched on one Å¿ide, and defended on the other by the Town and the River. The King had left Å¿ome Companies of Foot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for a Guard, who appeared afar of much more numerous then they were, by reaÅ¿on of their Lances, which by the Kings Orders, the <hi>Huzzars</hi> had left to them; every one of which had a Red Penon or Little Streamer at the end; and when they were all drawn up in order, made a very fair Å¿how. The Sun diÅ¿perÅ¿ing the MiÅ¿t, which till that time, had covered the Army, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Enemy like a beautiful perÅ¿pective on a Theatre, when the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48502:80"/>
Curtain is drawing up, who were Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿ed at their number and good order; notwithÅ¿tanding their Army was more numerous, and covered all the Countrey as far as could be Å¿een. The <hi>Tartars</hi> poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed themÅ¿elves of divers little Hills, from whence there was an eaÅ¿ie deÅ¿cent, and filled up all the Å¿pace in form of an Half-Moon: They had the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> on their Right Hand, oppoÅ¿ite to the Left Wing of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, with whom were alÅ¿o joyned Å¿ome Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of <hi>Tartars</hi>; and near to them was the Tabor of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> compoÅ¿ed of divers Ranks of Chariots; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which, were part of their Forces able to Å¿uÅ¿tain all aÅ¿Å¿aults whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being thus placed all the morning was Å¿pent in light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿hes, but the King doubting leÅ¿t that the intention of the enemies was to amuÅ¿e them with theÅ¿e Å¿mall combats and to Å¿et upon them the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when by reaÅ¿on of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s they might the better Å¿urprize

them, he prohibited all his Soldiers upon pain of death from Å¿tirring out of their places without order, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Bridges to be broken down which were built over the <hi>Ster,</hi> that they might not be Å¿et upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and by this means to ingage his own Soldiers to perform their utmoÅ¿t, all hopes of eÅ¿caping being cut off, and that the reÅ¿t of the day might not be Å¿pent unprofitably, which was Å¿carce Å¿ufficient for a general Battel between two Å¿uch numerous Armies, he began to Å¿alute the Enemies with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non at the head of his Army, and Å¿o from time to time to diÅ¿charge againÅ¿t them as they drew nearer to thoÅ¿e Eminencies whereon the <hi>Tartars</hi> were placed. Divers Å¿eeing the day Å¿o far Å¿pent, were of opinion that the Fight Å¿hould be deferred till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but others inÅ¿iÅ¿ted much upon the contrary, fearing leÅ¿t the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> might fall upon the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army in the night with their Tabor, which they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily reinforced, and might therewithal conÅ¿train them to quit
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48502:81"/>
their Camp. His MajeÅ¿ty therefore cauÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of <hi>WiÅ¿nowitz</hi> to begin the charge with twelve Troops of old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, backed by the Palatine of <hi>Podo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> with the Auxiliaries of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinates of <hi>Cracovia, Sendomir, Lencicia,</hi> and <hi>PrzemiÅ¿tia,</hi> the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> received them briskly, and the conflict laÅ¿ted near an hour, all which time the Å¿moak and duÅ¿t made them inviÅ¿ible to the reÅ¿t of the Army; and as the <hi>Poles</hi> began to give way, they were timely aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by freÅ¿h Forces, which the King Å¿ent them; upon whoÅ¿e arrival, the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> were driven into their Tabor, together with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ingaged them upon a riÅ¿ing Ground. In the mean time, the King marched againÅ¿t the great Body of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Right Wing Å¿taying near a Wood Å¿ide, to hinder the deÅ¿ign of many of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who were in AmbuÅ¿h, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to compaÅ¿s in the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army in the heat of the Battel. The King kept the Artillery Å¿till before him, which <hi>Priemski</hi> cauÅ¿ed to be diÅ¿charged very opportunely, and with great Å¿ucceÅ¿s.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48502:81"/>
So that they obliged the <hi>Tartars</hi> to leave the foot of the Hill, and by degrees made themÅ¿elves maÅ¿ters alÅ¿o of the top; after they had Å¿uÅ¿tained the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of the <hi>JaniÅ¿Å¿aries</hi> Carbines, who accompanied them.</p>
            <p>In this place His MajeÅ¿ty of <hi>Poland</hi> was in great danger of his life, having four Bullets Å¿hot from Å¿ome pieces which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had by a Wood Å¿ide, paÅ¿Å¿ing very near him, and one of them falling at his feet; but the <hi>Poles</hi> Å¿oon returned them the like: For <hi>Otuinouski,</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his MajeÅ¿ty of <hi>Poland</hi> for the <hi>TurkiÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> Languages aÅ¿Å¿uring them, that the Cham was there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on where they Å¿aw the great White Standard. The King ordered a piece of Cannon to be Å¿o levelled, that the firÅ¿t Å¿hot took one of the Principal Officers, who Å¿tood near the Cham; which diÅ¿turbed and frighted him Å¿o much, that he thought not farther of any thing but retreating; that part of his Army which had been driven from the Hill, followed him alÅ¿o, having left
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48502:82"/>
Å¿ome Squadrons behind to diÅ¿guiÅ¿e his retreat, and amuÅ¿e the <hi>Polanders</hi> for Å¿ome time: But they were Å¿oon put to their Å¿hifts, and the <hi>Poles</hi> purÅ¿ued them a League and a half, till the Night and the Å¿wiftneÅ¿s of their <hi>Bacmates</hi> or <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> HorÅ¿es Å¿ecured them; yet they left many in their retreat, wounded and Å¿lain, which they were uÅ¿ed to carry off, and to burn in their march when they had leiÅ¿ure; eÅ¿teeming it abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to leave the dead Bodies of their Friends in the hands of ChriÅ¿tians: They left alÅ¿o much of their equipage, as VeÅ¿tes, Saddles, Cimitars, Chariots, and the Tent and Standard of their Cham, and his little Silver Drum, guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and covered with a Skin, which Å¿erves him for a Bell.</p>
            <p>Divers <hi>Polanders</hi> who had been Slaves to thoÅ¿e Infidels, did here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Liberty, but many others were killed by them, when they Å¿aw they could not carry them away with them in their retreat, which was Å¿o haÅ¿ty, that they travelled Ten French

By reaÅ¿on of <hi>Kmielniski</hi> his abÅ¿ence, they conferred the command of their Army upon one of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, called <hi>Dziadziali,</hi> a perÅ¿on of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable cruelty. They had recourÅ¿e to all remedies probable to give them help, they wrote to the King, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his clemency, and to teÅ¿tifie to him the extream deÅ¿ire which they had

for Peace; but Å¿eeing their Arms and Pens were both together in their hands, their Prince thought of no other way, but of reducing them by force; which appeared alÅ¿o not difficult to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿h, by reaÅ¿on they began already to fall into diviÅ¿ions amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves. Some of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Commanders were of opinion, that they Å¿hould drown the Camp of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> by making a dam and Å¿topping the CourÅ¿e of the Water; but the advice to batter it down, was followed , and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e they brought great Cannon from <hi>Brody,</hi> a FortreÅ¿s built by the deceaÅ¿ed Grand General <hi>KonieÅ¿polski:</hi> They made alÅ¿o Bridges above and below their Camp, for the better communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Forces, and raiÅ¿ed many Forts and Redoubts in the moÅ¿t eminent places, from whence they might make their Batteries.</p>
            <p>The Fourth of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿ed one of theÅ¿e Forts, wherein were two pieces of Ordnance and FourÅ¿core <hi>Polanders,</hi> whoÅ¿e Heads they Å¿truck off

with their Sythes, Arms, which their Foot ordinarily make uÅ¿e of inÅ¿tead of Pikes. But General <hi>Hubald</hi> ran upon them, and drove them from it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to leave the Cannon which they were carrying away into their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. The Å¿ame day the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed themÅ¿elves of a Hill, by which means they could the more eaÅ¿ily Å¿eek out Forrage; but the Grand EnÅ¿ign diÅ¿lodged them, and brought away Five hundred of their HorÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>The fifth they came out of their Camp, in great number, in appearance as if they would give the <hi>Poles</hi> battel again, but they were driven back into their Intrenchments after a Å¿trong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and the loÅ¿s of Four hundred of their Men. <hi>Sokol</hi> and <hi>PiaÅ¿cozin,</hi> of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Å¿ide, were wounded in this conflict, which was attended with a continual diÅ¿charge of the Artillery on both Å¿ides, and great deÅ¿truction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> Å¿eeing themÅ¿elves thus ill handled, betook themÅ¿elves to Å¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48502:84"/>
and in the night following at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army with all their Force; but their deÅ¿ign was prevented firÅ¿t by the fall of the Rain, and then by the vigilance of the King and his Generals, who doubled their Guards. At this time <hi>Mehemet Czelebey,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Tartar,</hi> who had been a long while in the Å¿ervice of the Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and had been made a Captain by him, having been Å¿ent out with a party to purÅ¿ue the <hi>Tartars,</hi> returned into the Camp, bringing back priÅ¿oner with him, a <hi>Tartar</hi> of quality, named <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taÅ¿a Aga,</hi> one of the Cham's Kinred, who had been wounded at the Battel of <hi>BereÅ¿tesko,</hi> and was not able to follow the reÅ¿t, and had offered Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and Rixdollars to <hi>Czelebey</hi> for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿om; but this <hi>PoloniÅ¿ed Tartar,</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Faith and PromiÅ¿e which he had many years Å¿ince ingaged to the Great General his MaÅ¿ter, before all the Money and other conÅ¿iderable advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which this great perÅ¿on of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> offered him, if he would return with him into his Countrey.

alÅ¿o, that he had found by the way, more then Ten thouÅ¿and <hi>Tartars,</hi> either Å¿lain or wounded, which they had left behind them: An extraordinary mark of their precipitous flight, their cuÅ¿tom being to burn them, rather then leave them in the power of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> whoÅ¿e laÅ¿t deÅ¿ign took no effect, were now more and more backed in and incommodated; their onely refuge was the paÅ¿Å¿age which they kept through the MarÅ¿h; by which they went out to Forrage, and by which they might retreat. But Colonel <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> who was placed with Ten thouÅ¿and Men on the other Å¿ide of the Water, began to conÅ¿train the Liberty of the ExcurÅ¿ions; and it was determined, that more Forces Å¿hould be Å¿ent on that Å¿ide to hinder them altogether.</p>
            <p>At length the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Artillery thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering againÅ¿t their Tabor, with more execution then ever, they Å¿ent out three Deputies, <hi>KreÅ¿a,</hi> Colonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Czeherin, Hladki,</hi> and <hi>PercaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauski,</hi>

to deÅ¿ire Peace; they applied themÅ¿elves firÅ¿t to the Great General, who Å¿everely reproaching them for their cruelty and perfidiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, told them, That they had rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves unworthy of the favor of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty of <hi>Poland</hi>; and that they did not deÅ¿erve to be uÅ¿ed as ChriÅ¿tians, after that infamous Alliance which they had made with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King notwithÅ¿tanding, by the advice of the Senators, admitted them to Audience under a Pavillion Å¿et up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hill, from whence the <hi>Tartars</hi> had been driven; where they fell down upon their faces, and preÅ¿ented a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of all the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> and often begged for <hi>Mercy, Mercy,</hi> repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word at all the requeÅ¿ts they made; and upon all occaÅ¿ions, kiÅ¿Å¿ing the Hands and Garments of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who were there preÅ¿ent. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty of <hi>Poland</hi> having called his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el, anÅ¿wered them by the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Culm,</hi> his Great Chancellor, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their crimes were Å¿uch, that

they ought to have made them looÅ¿e all hopes of Pardon; yet his MajeÅ¿ty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iring to be conformable to the Divine GoodneÅ¿s and Mercy, did impart his; and if they would give Å¿ufficient proofs of their true Repentance, and perfect SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, he would pardon all what was paÅ¿Å¿ed, upon thoÅ¿e conditions which they Å¿hould receive in writing the next day about Eleven of the Clock. Till which time, a CeÅ¿Å¿ation of Arms was granted as they deÅ¿ired. <hi>CreÅ¿a,</hi> their Principal Deputy, remained as an HoÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the other Deputies returned upon the Seventh at the hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to receive the Articles, upon which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would grant his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Abolition of their MiÅ¿demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
            <p>It was demanded by theÅ¿e Articles, That they Å¿hould firÅ¿t put Twelve of their Principal Commanders in HoÅ¿tage, till they could deliver up unto the King their General <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> and <hi>Wihouski</hi> his Secretary.</p>
            <p n="2">

            <p n="5">5. That as to their Priviledges which they might pretend to, thoÅ¿e onely Å¿hould be continued to them which were granted by the deceaÅ¿ed General <hi>KonieÅ¿polski</hi> in the year One thouÅ¿and Å¿ix hundred and twenty eight.</p>
            <p>The Deputies returning to their Camp, and making known theÅ¿e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, brought back the next day this AnÅ¿wer.</p>
            <p>That as to the firÅ¿t Article they would promiÅ¿e, to do their utmoÅ¿t, to

put <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and his Secretary into the Kings hands, and would yield to the Second and third; but as for more, they could never agree to, nor hold to any other Articles, then thoÅ¿e of the Treaty of <hi>Zborow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King much offended at this AnÅ¿wer, redoubled his Batteries and reÅ¿olved abÅ¿olutely to exterminate them, as they on the contrary would chuÅ¿e rather to die, then to recede from that Treaty.</p>
            <p>They anÅ¿wered to the diÅ¿charges of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Artillery, but not Å¿o often; which gave Å¿uÅ¿pition that their Powder was Å¿pent: Some were Å¿o bold as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Å¿o near to the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Camp, that they heard the orders which were given to the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Soldiers; which being known, they were obliged to change their orders; as alÅ¿o, the deÅ¿ign they had formed of giving a general aÅ¿Å¿ault to their Tabor: And Å¿o Å¿trongly did the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> reÅ¿iÅ¿t all the attempts of the <hi>Polanders</hi> againÅ¿t them, that their valor had merited extraordinary Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if it had not been accompanied

with many deteÅ¿table cruelties, as Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, burning by degrees; and doing a thouÅ¿and other miÅ¿cheifs to the <hi>Polanders</hi> who fell into their hands. So much did the propoÅ¿ing of thoÅ¿e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wherewith they were to buy their Peace, inÅ¿pire them with Rage and Fury, in which they were kept on by their <hi>Popes</hi> (for Å¿o they call their <hi>PrieÅ¿ts</hi>) who ceaÅ¿ed not to encourage them with the hopes of the quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their General, and the <hi>Tartars.</hi> But the inconveniences which they Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the long abÅ¿ence of <hi>Kmiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niski</hi> undeceiving them from the falÅ¿e hopes they Å¿uÅ¿tained of a Å¿peedy aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they began to deÅ¿ire Peace very earneÅ¿tly; their Commanders who Å¿aw that it could not be effected, but to their prejudice, reÅ¿iÅ¿ted with all their power: And Å¿eeing that <hi>Dziadziali,</hi> whom they had Å¿ubÅ¿tituted in the room of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> did lend an Ear towards an accommodation, they forÅ¿ook him, and Å¿et up <hi>Bohun</hi> in his place; who to Å¿ignalize the beginning of his new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralÅ¿hip, upon the information he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

            <p>The King judging his preÅ¿ence neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to terminate this War, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Reduction of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> made account to march with his whole Army to <hi>Kiovia,</hi> and from thence to Å¿end his Forces and Orders neceÅ¿Å¿ary

with Captain <hi>StrayÅ¿e,</hi> and Captain <hi>Wahl,</hi> but being relieved with the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Foot, in two hours time they made themÅ¿elves MaÅ¿ters of the Town and CaÅ¿tle, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the obÅ¿tinate reÅ¿iÅ¿tance of the beÅ¿ieged, among whom, even the Women did good Å¿ervice, and fought with their Sithes; all here were put to the Å¿word without diÅ¿tinction of Sex or Age. The Governor of the place, a <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿ack,</hi> was hanged in the heat of blood; the Town was plundered, and what could not be carried away, was with it reduced to AÅ¿hes, and this Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wrought better effects then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Clemency could have done, for the Flames being perceived by thoÅ¿e of <hi>ChwaÅ¿towa,</hi> the three hundred <hi>CoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿acks</hi> which guarded that Town, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ook it, and the Inhabitants alÅ¿o follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their example, although they might well have reÅ¿iÅ¿ted the <hi>Poles,</hi> and put them to the expenÅ¿e of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> expecting the Kings Orders, and that the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army Å¿hould

come to him, kept himÅ¿elf always near to <hi>Kiovia,</hi> not without Å¿ome danger; the Enemy endeavouring by all means poÅ¿Å¿ible to Å¿urprize him, or at leaÅ¿t to hinder the General <hi>Potoski</hi> from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. Upon the Å¿ixteenth of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> Colonel <hi>Nold</hi> being Å¿ent out by this Prince, diÅ¿covered by the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil near to the Gate of <hi>Kiovia,</hi> called the <hi>Gilded Gate,</hi> a great body of <hi>CoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿acks</hi> mingled with <hi>Tartars,</hi> which Å¿oon allarmed the Camp, and a party of Light HorÅ¿e Å¿et upon them with Å¿uch courage, that after they had taken a Bridge which the enemies put much truÅ¿t in for the Å¿ecuring themÅ¿elves, they killed a thouÅ¿and of them upon the place; Å¿ome of the priÅ¿oners confeÅ¿Å¿ed that this body of three thouÅ¿and men was to have joyned with a thouÅ¿and more, with deÅ¿igne of falling upon the <hi>Lythuanian</hi> Army in their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> after this advantage, Å¿et forward to joyn with the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, after that he had left a Å¿ufficient Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48502:99"/>
but to gain time and leiÅ¿ure to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h his affairs; he reÅ¿olved without delay to terminate this controverÅ¿ie by force of Arms.

and intimate Friend, they Å¿ent to him <hi>Makouski,</hi> a Captain of HorÅ¿e, with a Letter to him from the General <hi>Potos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> but becauÅ¿e he gave him not the Title of General of the <hi>Zaporovian</hi> Army, this omiÅ¿Å¿ion was taken for a great injury, and made a diÅ¿turbance among the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi>; but <hi>Makouski</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appeaÅ¿ed them by giving them Å¿ufficient reaÅ¿ons for what was done; the conference began, in which the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Deputy propoÅ¿ed, that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> Å¿hould Å¿end away the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and come himÅ¿elf to the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Camp and pay his reÅ¿pects to their Generals; he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e propoÅ¿itions for a long time, whatÅ¿oever his Secretary could doe to draw from him his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, but in the end he agreed to one as well as the other, although his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ian</hi> PeaÅ¿ants expreÅ¿Å¿ed a great deal of repugnancy for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But finding it not convenient to continue this conference in the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> Camp, leÅ¿t that the <hi>Tartars</hi> Å¿uÅ¿pecting what they Treated of might attempt Å¿omething againÅ¿t the perÅ¿ons of the

TheÅ¿e CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners Treating with thoÅ¿e of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> agreed of all the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace, excepting Å¿ome few points which were afterwards to be decided in the two Camps, but were in great danger of their lives, firÅ¿t in the Army of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks,</hi> where <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and his Officers had enough to doe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from the violencies of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the PeaÅ¿ants, who could not endure any propoÅ¿itions of Peace,

Å¿uÅ¿pecting always that one of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles would be to reduce them to their former Å¿ervitude. The <hi>Tartars</hi> alÅ¿o Å¿et upon them in their return, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered part of their Baggage.</p>
            <p>In the mean time General <hi>Potoski</hi> and Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> Å¿eeing that the Treaty was almoÅ¿t concluded, removed from <hi>Hermanowka</hi> to <hi>Bialacerkiew,</hi> the place where <hi>Kmielniski</hi> and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Commanders of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> were to renew their Oath of Allegiance to the King and State, at the approach of the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> Å¿eemed to be very much Å¿urprized, but they being certified that it was upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deÅ¿igne then to oppoÅ¿e the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> new CommiÅ¿Å¿ion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were Å¿ent on both Å¿ides to conclude of what was left undecided at the laÅ¿t conference.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> inÅ¿tead of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented new propoÅ¿itions, as if they had forgot what had been Å¿o lately determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, demanding the performance of the

Treaty at <hi>Zborow</hi>; that the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army Å¿hould leave the frontiers, and give them liberty to maintain their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the true defenders of their priviledges; Å¿o that after the <hi>Poles</hi> had reproached them of their lightneÅ¿s and infidelity, which muÅ¿t needs proceed from the news of Å¿ome new Å¿upply from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or the falÅ¿e report of the Grand Signior his Å¿ending Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable Forces; they drew up their Army, and committed the right wing to Prince <hi>Radzevil</hi> with his <hi>Lythuanians,</hi> the left to <hi>Kalinouski,</hi> and reÅ¿erved the main body for Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Potoski.</hi> The <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> came alÅ¿o out of their Camp, as if they had no other deÅ¿igne but to obÅ¿erve the poÅ¿ture of the <hi>Poles</hi>; there paÅ¿Å¿ed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers skirmiÅ¿hes between them for three days, and divers Companies of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hid themÅ¿elves in Thickets and cloÅ¿e places, making frequent attempts upon the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Army, annoying them Å¿ometimes in the Flanck, and Å¿ometimes in the Reer, which it is thought they

did to make the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Generals more tractable, and to obtain more advanta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gious conditions of peace. In the mean time they being wearied with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of <hi>Kmielniski,</hi> who pretended to diÅ¿allow of all theÅ¿e attempts and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿hes; and being earneÅ¿t with him to declare his mind, he Å¿ent them upon the 26 of <hi>September,</hi> three Deputies to endeavor Å¿eriouÅ¿ly the concluÅ¿ion of the Treaty; theÅ¿e were much more moderate in their demands, although they were very different alÅ¿o from thoÅ¿e agreed upon at <hi>Bialacerkiew</hi>; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had concluded that the number of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> inrolled, Å¿hould amount to twenty thouÅ¿and, they demanded alÅ¿o that they might have their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Palatinates of <hi>Braclaw</hi> and <hi>Czernihow,</hi> and this being refuÅ¿ed, they inÅ¿iÅ¿ted, that at leaÅ¿t the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Forces Å¿hould not be quartered there during the time that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> was employed in inrolling the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿ackian</hi> Militia; and that they Å¿hould give him for his own maintenance, the Territories of <hi>Czir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿Å¿y</hi> and <hi>Borowitza. Potoski</hi> gave them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48502:102"/>
to underÅ¿tand, that this latter demand could not be granted without expreÅ¿s Orders from the King and State, but condeÅ¿cended to the other, after that <hi>Kmielniski</hi> had Å¿ecretly informed him that he inÅ¿iÅ¿ted upon it only to content the revolted PeaÅ¿ants, whom he thought not fit to irritate Å¿o long as they kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made Å¿o conÅ¿iderable a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Å¿o that there remained nothing but that he and his chief Officers Å¿hould come and make their Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ions to the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Generals, which he was inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to do, after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved HoÅ¿tages for his Å¿ecurity, though divers of his Officers with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty were brought to conÅ¿ent to it. Upon the 28 of <hi>September,</hi> he and the principal Commanders of the <hi>CoÅ¿Å¿acks</hi> came to the <hi>PoliÅ¿h</hi> Camp, where with much Humility, and the Tears in his Eyes (which he had always ready to Å¿hed, when the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of his affairs required) he asked Pardon of the Great General <hi>Potoski,</hi> and Å¿aluted Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> and the reÅ¿t of the Nobility with all reÅ¿pect.
