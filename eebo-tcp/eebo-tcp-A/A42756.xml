            <title>A warning and visitation to the inhabitants of Godalming All you that read this, be not rash, but weigh it right with the true weight, and the even ballance, the ballance of the sanctuary, and then you will not judge amiss of it; for it is not in hatred or reproach to any, but in love to all souls, in plainness and truth. And you inhabitants of Godalming, be warned, and seriously consider of this visitation; for the spirit of the Lord yet strives with you as with the old world, but they not taking warning, were drowned: therefore prise your time, and despise not the reproof of instruction, for such are brutish; but reprove or instruct a wise man, and he will love thee; reprove a scorner, and he will hate thee; but the reproof of instruction is the way of life to the wise; and a wise man will hear and increase in wisdom: be calm therefore, and learn of the light which is the way and the truth.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Sanctuary, and then you will not judge a miſs of it;
for it is not in hatred or reproach to any, but in love to
all Souls, in plainneſs and truth. And you Inhabitants
of <hi>Godalming,</hi> be warned, and ſeriouſly conſider of this
Viſitation; for the Spirit of the Lord yet ſtrives with
you as with the old World, but they not taking war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
were drowned: Therefore priſe your time, and
deſpiſe not the Reproof of Inſtruction, for ſuch are
brutiſh; but reprove or inſtruct a wiſe man, and he will
love thee; reprove a ſcorner, and he will hate thee; but
the Reproof of Inſtruction is the way of life to the Wiſe;
and a wiſe man will hear and increaſe in Wiſdom: Be
calm therefore, and learn of the Light which is the Way
and the Truth. <hi>T. P.</hi>

            <head>A Warning and Viſitation to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Godalming.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL ye Inhabitants of <hi>Godalming</hi> which
have any deſire after the Lord, read this
Paper with moderation, and I ſhall ſhew
you how you are deceived by him you
call your Miniſter, who hath deceived the
hearts of the ſimple by ſeeing falſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for you; who hath called the drunkard, and
ſwearer, and lyar, the proud, and covetous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and them that are in wrath and ſtrife, whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and idolaters, and ſuch like unclean perſons hath he
called Chriſtians, and his beloved, and tells you, that you
will be deceived if you go from him; but how can you be
more deceived then you are already? for there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thing can enter into the Kingdom of God: Then
what will ye do in the dreadful day of the Lord, when all
hearts ſhall be made manifeſt, and every ſecret thing
brought to light? Then what will your being called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
avail you, ſo long as ye are out of Chriſt? For in
him there is no ſin; For he that commits ſin, is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
therefore if you commit ſin, are you not of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and do his work? Conſider in the fear of God what
you are doing, for it is not his calling you, Beloved, will
ſtand you in any ſtead in the day of the Lord. Therefore
examine your ſelves; Are your works wrought in God? Or
do ye believe that there is ſin wrought in God? Or is not
ſin the work of the Devil? Are the works of the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
in you, yea or nay? If nay, then Chriſt is not
come to you, to work in you, and for you; for he came and
comes for this very purpoſe, to deſtroy the works of the
Devil; but they are not deſtroyed in you who continue in
doing them; and Chriſt the Saviour you do not witneſs:
Therefore what good doth your falſe prophet do you? Is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35780:2"/>
not the Scripture fulfilled on him &amp; you, which ſaith, <hi>They
ſhall not profit the people at all, becauſe they ſtood not in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;</hi>
and you may ſee you are not profited at all; therefore
why will ye ſpend your money for that which profits you
not? ſeeing the Lord hath ſaid ſo by the mouth of his
Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. Ye may read and ſearch Scripture, and
ſee whether ye follow the Miniſters of Chriſt, or of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;
for Chriſt ſaith, By their fruits they may be known;
Is this the fruit of a Miniſter of Chriſt, to caſt into priſon
for treſpaſſing againſt him, as he ſaith I have done? And
doth not he ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as, we forgive them
that treſpaſs against us?</hi> Doth not he pray to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and ye with him, who do not forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their treſpaſſes, but ſue them at Law? So like Prieſt,
like people; ſo is it at this day, they make people light,
vain, and wicked, as the Scripture ſaith, and the Scripture
cannot be broken; and as the wicked prieſts did, ſo they
do now; ſearch theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa. 56. Jer. 5. 31. Hoſ.</hi> 6. 9.
<hi>Mic. 3. Tit.</hi> 2. So may you ſee that yours is not unlike
the falſe prophets of old, but in their ſteps, preaching for
hire and filthy lucre, and putting into priſon, as they did
of old; and therefore I cry againſt them, as they did in
former dayes, ſuch who was in the ſame practiſes, having
the good words and fair ſpeeches to deceive the hearts of
the ſimple: O that you would conſider theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be too late! for what will ye do when the body
comes to dye? Then will ye wiſh ye had kept the Law and
the Light, which is the School-Maſter to bring to Chriſt;
for then ſhall ye know that God hath not left himſelf
without a witneſs in you, which did teſtifie againſt evil,
and would have led you out of evil if you had turned
your minds to it, and gave up freely to be guided by that
in your conſciences, which teſtifieth againſt all evil before
it be acted: So if you love your own ſouls, turn your minds
in to the light which checks and reproves, and no longer
rebel againſt the Lord which reproves you, and come out
of iniquity, for why will ye dye? your blood will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your own heads, and I ſhall be clear when ye are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35780:3"/>
for do ye believe that it ſhall be well with the wicked,
that you harden your hearts againſt the Lord? Nay, the
wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and their prayers he will
not regard: Do ye think God will be mocked any longer
with your vain oblations? Or do ye think that ye may
join with the wicked, and not partake of their ſins? Or do
the Drunkards or Lyars worſhip God? If you ſay, Nay,
then come out from the Steeplehouſe, and leave the Prieſt
and Drunkards alone together, and be no longer deceived
by him you call your Miniſter, becauſe he hath the good
words and fair ſpeeches to betray the ſimplicity in you; but
he hath made himſelf manifeſt, for every tree is known by
his fruit; therefore if he bring forth evil fruit, he muſt be
an evil Tree: Conſider, his fruit is covetouſneſs, lying,
and caſting into priſon, this is manifeſt wickedneſs, ſuch
as no true Prophet or Apoſtle did; &amp; no Miniſter of Chriſt
ever did caſt any into priſon for their bellies; nor ſuch did
not cry peace to the wicked, as yours doth; neither did
they tell people that they could not be free from ſin here,
as Prieſts now do; for they that the Son made (and
makes) free, are free indeed, <hi>John</hi> 8. 36. Then they are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
that ſay none can be free from ſin here; for if not here
in this life, then I ſay never ſhall; for there is no cleanſing
after death, but as the tree falls, ſo it lies; and as death
leaves, ſo iudgement finds. Therefore conſider in the fear
of God what ye are doing; Or do ye think that I am your
enemy becauſe I tell you the truth? Did ye once love me?
And now do ye hate me becauſe I bear teſtimony againſt
your evil deeds in love to your ſouls? Or the more I love
you, the leſs I am beloved of you? <hi>For greater love hath no
man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friend:</hi> So for
your ſakes I bear all things, if by any means I may gain
ſome; for my bowels yearns over the Seed of God which
lyeth in captivity, and longs to ſee his deliverance from
under the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſons of God: For this is the mighty day of the
Lord, wherein all ſhall be left without excuſe, and your
deſtruction ſhall be of your ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35780:3"/>
O! that ye did but know how the Lord doth wait to be
gracious, and how often he knocks at the door of your
hearts, and ye will not let Chriſt into your hearts, but lets
ſin dwel there; ye have no room for Chriſt, for your hearts
are taken up with other gueſts, and Chriſt in the manger,
trampled upon with every unclean thing which dwells in
your hearts, though he check you often vvhen you do evil:
Is there none that is tender-hearted amongſt you? Are you
altogether turned out of the way? And is your own ways
beſt? Is your pleaſure better then Chriſt, and more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by you then eternal life, that ye refuſe him that makes
an end of ſin, that ye will not turn at his reproof? Will
ye alwayes kick againſt that which pricks you in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
for ſin? Conſider what will be the end of ſin, for
it brings death; then what aſſurance of life have ye? But
if ye find that the witneſſe of God in your hearts or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
give you not aſſurance of life, then return to it
your hearts and minds to believe in it, and obey it, ſo may
you become the ſons of God; but if you refuſe to obey the
light which manifeſts ſin within, then the wrath of God
you cannot eſcape. Therefore be warned, and repent, and
come down from your high thoughts, or imagining that
God accepts of you, or your performances, for he accepts
onely of his Son, and ſo thoſe that are in his Son, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of them and their performances; for he is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and ſerved in ſpirit and in truth; but none can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
there, that live in ſin, as ye do who are after the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houſe
worſhip, which is fleſhly and carnal worſhip; but
they that worſhip God in ſpirit, have no confidence in
the fleſh, but from it are redeemed. Therefore I ſay, truſt
not in your Steeplehouſe-worſhip, for God abhors it, and
all your worſhip, who are not turned from ſwearing and
lying, and evil-ſpeaking, and ſuch like wickedneſs, which
is common amongſt you; therefore fear the Lord God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and turn your minds in to feel after him, that
ye may find him who is a ſpirit, the inviſible God, onely
known in, and by the ſpirit revealed, and now is the day
that he will be found of thoſe that ſeek him in truth, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35780:4"/>
in ſincerity; but he hides himſelf from the wicked and
covetous prieſts and people, for that is not to be named
among Saints, it is Idolatry; ſuch is your Steeple-houſe
Worſhip, and all the wicked that know not God.</p>
            <p>Therefore be awakened to righteouſneſs; that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
which calls and cryes againſt ſin in your hearts, and
that will guide you to God if you obey it; but if that ye
diſobey it, it wil be your condemnation: Therefore priſe
your time, and while you have time, fear God, and the
fear of God is to depart from ſin; and ſlight not the day
of your viſitation, but take warning before it be too late:
From him who is witneſſed by that of God in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to be a lover of your ſouls, who is known to you
by the Name of</p>

the true Prophets words, but out of their life; and ſuch
would keep people alway under the condemning power
of the Law; but the power of the Goſpel which ſaves from
ſin, they come not to believe in, and ſo are not ſaved by it,
but ſtill they ſin, and are condemned by that of God in
them, which is the Law, which is Light; and here are all
Steeple-houſe-people, and prieſts, and all profeſſors, mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the dark, and cannot get out becauſe they own not
the light to lead through condemnation, to peace; but I
ſay to thee, Be of good chear, though wrath be heavy on
thee, and the way hard and narrow, the tranſgreſſor muſt
feel Judgement; for through Judgement is redemption
witneſſed: So conſult not with fleſh and blood, but keep
in thy mind, and the day wil dawn, and the day-ſtar will
ariſe, and peace and refreſhment to the Seed wil be known
to refreſh, &amp; power thou wilt receive to rule in thy heart;
but take heed of being diſobedient to the light which
reproves, for then barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs, and the
anger of God, and his rebukes in flames of fire; but join
with the pure that moves againſt ſin, and the birth immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
thou wilt know in thee brought forth. O how am I
pained till this be accompliſhed! leaſt thou ſhouldſt faint
in the Wilderneſs where (other Profeſſors and Steeple-houſe-people

are) there is no Water to refreſh the plant
of my Fathers renown, but their Waters fails, and the
Rock they know not: But ſeeing the Lord is bringing
forth his Seed, take heed of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> nature that muſt be
plagued and drowned, that the Seed may ſerve the Lord;
ſo take heed that thou murmure not in the Wilderneſs,
but wait on the Lord patiently; ſo my love in tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

but they are now ſcattered and confounded, for the
Lord is come down; but ſeek not thou (with them) for an
eaſier way then through the Judgement, by that which
judges all evil; and looke not at the greatneſs of thy ſin,
but priſe that which ſaves thee from any one, and power
thou wilt feel increaſe, as thou art obedient. So the Lord
