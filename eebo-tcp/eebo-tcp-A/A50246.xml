            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He publique Catechizing of Children by way of familiar Dialogue in short and plaine Questions &amp; Answers, though it be scrupled by some, as if it wanted Scripture warrant: yet such as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge children to be members of Christs Kingdome and Church, (as all but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptists doe) <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 14. they cannot deny, that (being members of Christs house) the Stewards of his house must (in faithfulnesse to Christ, and them) dispence a portion of Spirituall food to them in due season, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42. And evident it is by daily experience
<pb facs="tcp:110138:3"/>
that long Discourses (Sermon-wise) runne over Childrens heads (like water over a Mill, that grinds no meale at all) and passe their capacity. No way of instruction is so proper for them, as that which the Prophet describeth as most suitable to the understanding of children, line upon line, here a little and there a little <hi>(Isai</hi> 28. 9, 10.) which can no way so conveniently be dispensed, as in briefe and familiar questions and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers put into their mouthes.</p>
            <p>But as this way of short and familiar catechizing is the fittest portion of young childrens bread: so there is a larger Doctrine of Catechisme, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole body of Divinity, which being solidly compacted together, and evidently confirmed from Scripture light, and familiarly delivered to the apprehensions of Gods people, it will be a seasonable portion for children of riper age: not only for their further building up in the faith and obedience of the doctrine of the Gospel: but also for their establishment in the truth, that
<pb facs="tcp:110138:3"/>
they be not pluckt away with the error of the wicked. Hence <hi>Luther</hi> had his <hi>major</hi> as well as his <hi>minor Catechismus:</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> his larger confession of the Faith as well as his shorter. Yea the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (whose example was now precedentiall, as being indeed Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and binding to imitation) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Timothy</hi> a platform of sound and wholsome words, in Faith and love: which he commanded and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, not onely to hold fast himself, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. but likewise to commit the same to faithfull men, who might be able to teach others also, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. This charge, as it then was (and alwaies will be) weighty, and seasonable: So never more important and necessary, then in this capritious and fastidious age, when men will nor suffer whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine, but having itching eares and wits, doe turn away their hearts from the truth, and are given up to such empty and windy notions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is hard to judge whether Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy or ignorance be the more predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent:
<pb facs="tcp:110138:4"/>
arrogance of higher attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Christ, or ignorance of the true Christ, and of life in him.</p>
            <p>Now for casting in some helpe, (by the grace of Christ) to prevent the spreading of such a gangrene of vanity and apostacy; and to establish the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in the truth of the Doctrine which is according to godlinesse: Our reverend brother (according to the precious Talent of wisdom, and found judgement given unto him, &amp;c. out of his faithfull love to the flock of Christ) he hath compiled this ensuing plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of wholsome Doctrine, in way of a larger Catechisme: wherein you shall finde the summe of the Doctrine of Christian Religion, with pithy solidity and orderly dexterity digested toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and with clear evidence of truth confirmed from the holy Scriptures: and both with such familiar plainnesse of savory language, as (by the blessing of Christ) the simple-honest-hearted Reader may be informed and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the highest truths, and the most
<pb facs="tcp:110138:4"/>
intelligent may be refreshed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, in revising and recounting the treasures of wisdome and knowledge which they have received and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the grounds upon which they have believed; and all may be led on in the constant profession and practice of the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>So we commend this ensuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to the diligent perusall of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader; and both it and thee to the rich blessing of the grace of Christ, and rest</p>

A. This also is another testimony that there is a God, before whose judgment seate a man must answer for his deedes; for otherwise why should a man be afraid where no feare is? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 5. &amp; 53. 5.</p>

                  <p>A.
