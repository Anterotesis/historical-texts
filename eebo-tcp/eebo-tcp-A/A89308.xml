            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving received a command from
the honourable Committee of
both Kingdomes to take charge
of a Brigade of horſe and foot,
drawn out of the Gariſons of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
Hereford</hi> &amp; <hi>Eveſham,</hi> to prevent the Lord
<hi>Aſhleys</hi> conjunction with the Kings forces at

and Warwick, notwithſtanding the Lord <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
endeavoured by all wayes to get by me,
which much foiled my Brigade to prevent in
marching from place to place to ſecure the
Fords upon the river <hi>Avon:</hi> yet after ſome

conſiderations perceived that he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to paſſe over ſo long as I lay near the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
reſolved upon Thurſday laſt to draw off
and to quarter at Cambdin, the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place whereſoever he made his paſſage,
and that night had intelligence of his march
from Droitwich near Worceſter, towards
Bitford, three miles from Eveſham; whereof
I preſently advertiſed Colonel <hi>Walley</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and ſent poſt to Sir <hi>William
Brereton,</hi> to deſire the aſsiſtance of his Horſe,
which was accordingly granted. But upon
Friday the Lord <hi>Aſhley</hi> ſtill continuing his
march (and Sir <hi>William Breretons</hi> horſe not
come up) was forced to hold him in action for
the ſpace of four hours, skirmiſhing with him
by parties, and keeping my Body drawn up
in a moſt advantagious place for purſuit, in
caſe he ſhould paſſe by me (before Sir <hi>William
Brereton</hi> came up) which about nine a clock
that night he did: whereupon I reſolved to
purſue, thinking it more advantagious to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon his rear, then at that time to draw
out to meet him in the field; and in my purſuit
Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> came up with 800 horſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159612:3"/>
(of whom I deſired to receive orders, but he
referred the whole command of the field to
me) then being equall in number to the Lord
<hi>Aſhleys</hi> forces conſiſting of 3000, I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
400 horſe and 200 firelocks to charge
home his Rear guard, to put him to a ſtand
before he ſhould paſſe through Stow upon the
Wold (and as my intelligence informed me,
the King was to have joyned with him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſeven miles of that place) where he made
choice of his ground and had the wind with
him: yet truſting in God I drew up and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him home (halfe an hour before day upon
Saturday morning) put him to a totall rout,
killed many Gentlemen and Officers of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
took priſoners the Lord <hi>Aſhley,</hi> and all his
Foot officers, whoſe names are in the incloſed
Liſt, beſides 1600 common Souldiers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
many of them being wounded, I gave them
liberty to go to their own homes, (taking the
oath of the 5 of <hi>April)</hi> the reſt are now ſent
to Gloceſter. I took alſo 2000 armes and all
their ammunition. Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Lord <hi>Aſhley</hi> might be his priſoner,
which I willingly condeſcended unto; not

doubting but he will give a good account of
him to the Parliament. This good ſucceſſe,
(the glory whereof I deſire may be given unto
God) will prevent the King from drawing an
army into the field which he expected, and am
now marched towards Worceſter; where <hi>I</hi>
ſhall obſerve ſuch orders as ſhall come from
the honourable houſe of Parliament, or the
Committee of both Kingdomes; and in the

advance the publick ſervice. The honourable
