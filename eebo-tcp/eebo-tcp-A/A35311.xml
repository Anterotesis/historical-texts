            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
The Most Illustrious
PRINCE GEORGE,
Only Brother to
His MAJESTY, the
Present King of Denmark.</head>

            </opener>
            <p>AS true History transmits
to posterity the good and
bad Counsels not only,
but also the most Famous Actions
of Great Men; so Princes, and
Men of the first Rank, seem more
particularly concern'd in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:57496:3"/>
its Sacred Laws against such as
prompted either by their Vanity or
Malice, endeavour too frequently
to pervert the same. I having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
in this present Treatise, to
vindicate in some measure the
KINGDOM of DENMARK, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a nameless Author, who,
(as much as in him lays) has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to misrepresent the State
of your R. H's Native Country,
and the most antient Rights of your
Royal Family in <hi>Denmark:</hi> I thought
I should appear to the World to
be wanting in my Duty to your
R. Highness, and to deviate from
that profound Veneration, which I
have always paid to your R. H's
most eminent Vertues of Valour,
Moderation and Love of Truth; it if
I should have committed this Work
to the protection of another, which
I was sensible ought to implore no
other, but that of your Royal
<pb facs="tcp:57496:3"/>
Highnesses. My chief aim in this
Undertaking has been to undeceive
such, as being not acquainted with
the true State of <hi>Denmark,</hi> might
be apt to mistake fair shining ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
for the Truth it self;
wherein, as I have soughtmore for the
Satisfaction of being approved of by
the most understanding sort, than
the multitude (whose applauses <hi>I</hi>
never sought, nor valued.) So,
if <hi>I</hi> have been able to contribute any
thing in this Matter, which may
meet with the least Approbation
from a PRINCE, who by his
BIRTH, and exquisite KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDG
of the Constitutions of his
Native Country, and the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of his Royal Ancestors, is the
most unquestionable judge of this
Vindication: I shall always esteem
it as the greatest honour, which
<hi>I</hi> could pretend to in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
<hi>Pompous</hi> words (the
<pb facs="tcp:57496:4"/>
common ingredient of our new-fashion'd
Dedications) being the
Scorn of great Souls, ought not to
be brought into your R. H's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
But instead of these, <hi>I</hi> will
offer my fervent Prayers to Heaven
for the Prosperity of your R. H. and
your most illustrious Family, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
intreating your R. H. graciously
to accept of this as an unfeigned Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of my constant Zeal for
your R. H's Service, and begging
leave to call my self,</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
FROM A
GENTLEMAN in the Country,
TO HIS
FRIEND in LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NExt to the most acceptable News of your
health, nothing could at this time
have been more welcome to me in my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than the Book you sent me concerning
<hi>the present State of Denmark;</hi> which,
as it has, with pleasure revived in me the
remembrance of such Matters, as forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly <hi>I</hi>
had observed in those Northern Countries; so
the reading of it at such intervals as were
free from the usual jollities of the <hi>Christmas</hi>
Holy-Days, has afforded no small variety
<pb facs="tcp:57496:5"/>
to me, when tir'd with the diversions, this
Season particularly allows us in the Country.
I had some days before I received yours, heard
a most advantageous Character of the said
<hi>Book,</hi> from some Gentlemen, who being Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
if not the Heads of a State-Reforming
Society in <hi>London,</hi> were come, partly to pass
the Holy-Days in the Country, partly to
communicate to their Friends here, the Results
of their grave Debates in their several <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Clubs, and had among other State Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
Pamphlets (as I understood) recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
this Treatise as a singular piece, fit
to improve the Knowledge of all such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be instructed in <hi>State Affairs.</hi> The
Truth is, knowing these Gentlemen to be of a
Society, the Members whereof I know not by
what antient Title, which they deduce even
from the times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> claim a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Censuring not only foreign States,
but also our own in particular, as often as
Matters do not fully answer the ends of their
wise Consultations: I had a more than common
Curiosity, to peruse a Treatise, which they
<pb facs="tcp:57496:5"/>
seemed to be so fond of, even to admiration.
But, as soon as I found the Title Page not only
without the Author's Name (which seems so
requisite to give an Authority to Historical
Treatises, that I do not see how any body can
challenge a belief from his judicious Reader
without it) but also the <hi>Printer</hi>'s omitted;
the work seem'd to me at the very first sight,
to carry with it a shrewd suspicion, if not of
downright falshood, at least of an unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
partiality. And to speak freely, when
immediately after in the <hi>Preface,</hi> so dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
both to the nature and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igness of
the Treatise, there appeared to me every
where the foot-steps of a conceited Home-breeding,
and every Leaf almost stuft up with
the Praise of This, and the Diminution and
Undervaluing of other Countries, confirmed
with far fetch'd Arguments, devised on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
rather to amuse and ensnare, than impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
to instruct the Reader<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I did conclude,
that our unknown Author's inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion was to
give us a Novel, such as the <hi>Turkish
Spy,</hi> or the like (wherein of late years some
<pb facs="tcp:57496:6"/>
have taken a priviledge to intermingle Truth
with their own Inventions, accommodating
the whole more to their own Fancies, or else
to the Humors of such as they seek to please,
than to the sacred Laws of History) but not
a true and impartial Account <hi>of the present
State of Denmark.</hi> When soon after my
Curiosity did lead me to make a true compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
betwixt the most remarkable passages
related in this Treatise, and such Matters as
either my memory or observations, which I
had made some years ago, when conversant
in those Countries, as also the correspondence
of my Friends from thence had furnished me
withal; I was sufficiently convinced, that
in the most concerns of Moment our Author
had endeavoured, by an affected Stile, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to adapt the whole to his Conceits in the
<hi>Preface,</hi> than the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Work.</hi>
The gross and unaccountable Comparison espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
made betwixt the Northern parts of
the World and the <hi>Turkish</hi> Government,
nay, even the preferring the latter before the
others may. I think, serve, as an undeniable
<pb facs="tcp:57496:6"/>
Argument to all unbyass'd Persons, That the
Author did not intend to give us a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those Countries, but under a Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Cover of Arbitrary Power, to represent
Tyranny in its worst shape to the <hi>English</hi>
Nation. And as this is plainly apparent
out of several passages of the said Book, so it
seems to be the only excuse that can be made
for these extravagancies and groundless As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions,
so little suitable to the rules of true
History, wherewith it is filled up from the
beginning of the Preface, to the very conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Certainly, if this Author's Intention
had been to give a warrantable Account of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> it would have been much more
glorious and consonant to the practice of all
civilized Nations, to have imitated the
frankness and integrity of the antient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
whom he seems so much to
admire, and more particularly, that of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in his Book, which he writ concerning the
<hi>Germans</hi> in his Time. Those, who see this
Author quoted, not only in the Title page, but
also in several places afterwards, will scarce
believe that any other, but the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb facs="tcp:57496:7"/>
Reason could induce our Author, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
so far from the Method of an approved
Historian; and the so much applauded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of him, whom he himself praises as
the greatest of Politicians of his Time. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the difference which some pretend to
have found out betwixt those Times and our
Age, be a sufficient excuse for this new-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
way of writing; since, if our Author
had been more taken with an Ambition to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Modern than antient Writers in this
kind, there are not wanting Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them of undeniable Sincerity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.
The Memoirs of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and the
Letters of Cardinal <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ossat</hi> have deserved
such praises from the most unbyassed, and
eminent Politicians, that he need not have
been ashamed to tread in their footsteps.
Even the Northern parts, where our Author
falsly imagines all Learning to be extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
can furnish him with a Pattern of this
Kind in their imcomparable <hi>Monzam bano,</hi>
of the State of the <hi>German</hi> Empire; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, if he had regulated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he would not have scattered such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb facs="tcp:57496:7"/>
of ill grounded Reflections against many
Illustrious Persons, and had better deserved
the Name of a true Historian. But, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Foreign Vertue could be charming
enough to our Author, the living Examples
either of Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> or of the so
much celebrated Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> now Bishop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> in his Observations especially made,
concerning his Travels, and published some
years ago, ought to have excited him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same Character; except our Author
has an in born Aversion to any thing that has
the least relation to the North. To conclude;
this Author seems to be a great Admirer, and
to have adapted the whole Work to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of some political Doctors among us; who
having gathered their phantastical Notions
of a Platonick Government without Faults,
out of such antient Philosophers, as used to
fight Battels in their Studies, and with florid
Speeches infuse their Conceits of Governing
into their Auditors, do very industriously
labour to spread their vain Opinion, to the great
disadvantage of the State. And I think,
<pb facs="tcp:57496:8"/>
the whole Work may serve as a convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
to shew the World how difficult it is to
shake off such Prejudices, as are implanted
in our tender Age, and have in process of
time taken root with us; so that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that (notwithstanding our Author's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in his Preface) Travelling too late proves
sometimes as ineffectual, as going abroad too
young. This being, what in general may
justly be said of this Treatise, I have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to you with the same freedom, as I
thought was becoming our Friendship, and the
satisfaction I always take in contributing any
thing to your Curiosity.</p>

            <head>REMARKS
UPON THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BOOKS without their Author's
Names, being like Bastards,
who cannot claim the least Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
from their Parentage,
ought questionless to challenge no other
Authority but what is derived from their
own Deserts. And tho' it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
but that sometimes the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of time and place may be a good
Plea to some Authors, who have disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselves under fictitious Names;
or else set none at all to their judicious
Pieces. Yet it must also be owned, That
whenever they have transgressed the
Rules of true Sincerity and Modesty, and
endeavoured rather to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Reader by their pompous
Words, than approved Truth, they have
deservedly incurred the Censures of all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57496:9"/>
Judicious and Unbyassed Persons. If
the Author of the Treatise, called, <hi>An
Account of Denmark,</hi> had made the least
Reflection (as he ought to have done)
upon this, certainly he would not have
been so much pre-possessed with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his own Inventions, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That the same, tho' never so gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
dress'd up with fine Words, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with fair Suppositions, could be
received as a Truth among the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
part of Mankind. But to come to
the Matter it self; <hi>Health and Liberty
are, without dispute, the greatest natural
Blessings Mankind is capable of enjoying,</hi>
says our Author at the very beginning of
his Preface. That Health and Liberty,
duly considered, are Two precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
scarce sufficiently to be valued, has
never been questioned in this part of the
World, But since Physicians themselves
do not agree in the true nature of the
First, as admitting of several Degrees,
and being scarce ever to be found in its
due Perfection; and the Degrees of the
Second, being by all Judicious Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
adapted to the several Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those Countries, and Inhabitants
where the same is to be exercised, our
Author would have done very prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57496:9"/>
to have have given us a more clear
and satisfactory Notion of the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of both. So do we see Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
Ladies, tho' (according to their
natural Constitution in good Health)
affect sometimes to be leaner, sometimes
fatter; sometimes to nauseate a small
Pimple, or even their natural Colour;
sometimes imagining (tho' falsely) I know
not what Indisposition in their Body;
and by Vomits, repelling Medicines,
and other destructive Methods, bring
upon themselves dangerous Diseases.
And how often the mistaken Rules of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
have proved not only troublesome,
but also fatal, the Histories of all Ages
do abundantly testifie. It had therefore, in
my Judgment, been more suitable to the
nature of an Historical Treatise, and the
Circumstances also of our present Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sufficient Liberty, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a Wise and Just King, to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a true Scheme of moderate Liberty,
than to represent to us at this time a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Notion of the same, by fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Italian</hi> out of his own Country,
and transferring of him into <hi>Greenland;</hi>
for these are his Words: <hi>But as an</hi> Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>that passes a Winter in</hi> Greenland, <hi>will
soon be convinced how much Misery he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57496:10"/>
in comparison of those who dwell in
his native Country; so he that knows by
Experience the Trouble of a languishing
Sickness, or the loss of Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. He
need not have sent him so far, since the
Highlands in <hi>Scotland</hi> would have made
him sensible enough of the Difference;
and yet I have known <hi>Italians,</hi> who
would not change their Habitations
which they had in the Northern Parts,
with the fruitful Champaign of the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarese,</hi>
and other the Pope's Dominions.
From hence he falls abruptly upon the
Two different ways of profiting, either
by our own, or other Peoples Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and recommending the latter,
(and certainly no body who has common
Sense would do otherwise) returns qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to his beloved Panegyrick of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Thus he says: <hi>Want of Liberty is a
Disease in any Society, or Body Politick,
like want of Health in any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>

This Passage I could not forbear
smiling at, when I considered with what
Caution our Author had avoided to give
the least Limitation of Liberty; tho' it
is evident, that a proper Epithete would
have taken away all occasion of a sinister
Interpretation. Surely he that seems so
well versed in the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57496:10"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> History, cannot but remember, that
it was the immoderate Liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi>
the famous Nursery of his so much
admired Philosophers; which was the
chief Cause of the Ruin of so flourishing
a Country. I speak this upon the Credit
of one, who living in a free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and being the greatest Admirer
and Maintainer of a lawful Liberty, is an
unquestionable Judge in this Case; I
mean <hi>Cicero;</hi> his Words are these:

temeritate administrantur. Ita<expan>

Graeciam, quae jam diu suis consiliis perculsae

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> licentia concionum.</hi> And that excess
of Liberty is the same in the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
what excess of Blood (tho' else the
Treasure of Life) is in a particular
Person; which if not timely taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
causes Inflammations, Exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Phrensies, and other dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
besides what is befallen the <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers,</hi>
by their too much nicety of
Liberty, in refusing an Imperial Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
those Civil Commotions and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
Wars which happened in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Memory in the Kingdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57496:11"/>
have been convincing Instances,
and that too much Liberty is frequently
the Spring of fatal Diseases in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And when even to this Day
we hear of their bloody Debates, where
the Cimmetar often is the chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their Consultations at the Diet;
I will scarce believe, but that this may
instruct any true thinking <hi>Englishmen,</hi>
how much more desirable it is to enjoy an
Equitable Portion of Liberty, than gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to follow the Footsteps of such as
too often transgress the Bounds of the
same. <hi>Travel,</hi> says our Author, <hi>seems
as necessary to one, who desires to be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to his Country, as practising upon other
Men's Distempers, is to make an able Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician:
For, though a Man may too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
see the Misery of such, as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of Health, without quitting his
own Country; yet, (thanks to Providence)
he must go out of these Kingdoms, who
would know experim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntally the Want of
publick Liberty.</hi> And since next to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
our present happy Enjoyment
of our legal Liberty, is owing to the
Valour and Conduct of His Majesty;
Why then all this stir for Liberty?
Could not an impartial Account have
been given of the Present State of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57496:11"/>
without a Romantick Preface
fill'd up with Chimerical Notions? Such
a Piece as this would have been very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
some Years ago, when we were
in apparent Danger of losing both our
Religion and Liberty; And yet at that
very time it has been observed, that those
very Gentlemen who generally make
the greatest Clamour for Liberty, and
pretend to be the true Proselytes of the
Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> were
not the most forward of maintaining,
and publickly asserting it. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Usefulness of Travelling, it
was, I think, never denied among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Men: and if in representing
the same, this Gentleman had avoided
the nauseous Praises of this, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of other Countries, I am
certain, it would have had a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Influence upon unbyass'd Persons,
than can be expected from such hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Comparisons. But let us observe
his Words: <hi>And this can be done by no
Nation in the World so commodiously a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the</hi> English; <hi>The Affluence of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and Easiness in their private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
are evidently greater, than those of
other People of</hi> Europe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after; <hi>In other Countries some
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57496:12"/>
Princes and Men of the first Quality may
have Purses strong enough to bear the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
but few of the midling Sort venture
upon it,</hi> &amp;c. This is so manifestly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the Experience of all Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that I cannot sufficiently admire
how our Author could pretend to put it
upon us. The Panegyrick of his Native
Country, might have been interpreted
as a pardonable Imitation of his so much
beloved Ancient Philosophers; But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he, who can affirm this for a
Truth, must never have travelled any
where, but by a direct Sea-voyage from
<hi>England</hi> to <hi>Denmark:</hi> For if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Way thither through <hi>Holland,</hi>
even some of the meanest Capacities in
those Countries in his Journey would
have informed him to the contrary. I
appeal to all in this Case, who have made
any Observation iu their Travels, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>France,</hi> and I am sure I can
affirm it upon my own Experience, what
a Concourse of Foreigners there used to
be some Years before this War in <hi>Paris,</hi>
whereof so few were in Comparison of
the rest, <hi>English,</hi> that I have often been
admiring at it. And I remember very
well, that when my Curiosity after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
did lead me thither a second time,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57496:12"/>
I made as strict an Enquiry as possibly I
could, about the Number of Foreigners
in <hi>Paris,</hi> (besides those in the Country)
where I was informed by such as in all
probability were the most likely to give
a true Judgment of this Matter, That they
did esteem the Number of Foreigners
there, to amount of late Years to betwixt
sixteen and twenty Thousand; whereof
one half were supposed to be <hi>Germans.</hi>
I have often afterwards heard the same
confirmed since, by such as came from
thence: and, as I have seen my self; the
most of those live up to the Port of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in a Place, where every thing is
very dear to Strangers; we must either
conclude, that all those were either
<hi>Princes, or Men of the first Quality,</hi> or
that he had his Supposition, <hi>That few of
the midling Sort venture at travelling,</hi>
from no Authentick Hand. And though
this be more conspicuous in <hi>France,</hi> aud
especially in <hi>Paris;</hi> yet the same may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
enough also be observed in other
Countries, as in <hi>England, Italy, Holland,</hi>
and the most Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> I have
been in the latter of those Countries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
for a good many Years, and at
several times; and as I always took no
small delight in the Gravity of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57496:13"/>
Tongue, so I was very careful in
making the most exact Observations I
possibly could; and I must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that scarce any Nation in
the World bestows more Labour, and
Money upon the Breeding, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
qualifying their Male-Children,
than the <hi>Germans.</hi> Not to speak now
of the first Degrees of Education (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I shall say more of that by and by)
they reckon Travelling so necessary and
requisite towards the accomplishing of
a Gentleman, that those who have not
had the Opportunity of seeing other
Countries but their own, must be of
Eminent Quality, if they are preferred to
any Place of Moment.</p>
            <p>They used formerly to send their Sons
especially into <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Italians</hi> being not found so
convenient towards the obtaining the
Ends of Travelling, the frankness of the
<hi>French,</hi> and the Necessity there was,
in the most Courts of <hi>Germany,</hi> to be
nearer acquainted with the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue and Affairs, have drawn the
<hi>Germans</hi> more into <hi>France</hi> of late Years,
than into any other part of the World;
though I verily believe, That if a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
could be made of Foreigners tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57496:13"/>
in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> nay, even
in this Country, (not Merchants) it
would be found that near one Half of
them are out of that Country. I appeal
to such <hi>English</hi> as have been in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and especially at <hi>Leiden,</hi> whether this
Assertion be not manifestly true there,
and those that have duly observed, what
great Numbers of Foreigners, pass only
from the Northern parts (so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by our Author) by the way of
<hi>Hamborough</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and from
thence over <hi>Brussels</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
scarce question what I said before,
concerning the Number of Foreigners
in <hi>France.</hi> I very well remember, that
during the time of some Years, I was at
<hi>Leiden,</hi> I have often with great delight
observed, how they used to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the most remote Parts, as
<hi>Prussia, Courland, Livonia, Sweden</hi> and
<hi>Denmark,</hi> (though most of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have their own Universities) and
with great Expence endeavour to correct
the Remnants of their home-breeding
so common and mischievous to most
Countries. If our Author had followed
their laudable Example, and made his
own Observations, instead of writing by
hear-say (as he needs must have done)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57496:14"/>
he would not so easily have undertaken
to assert such a notorious Untruth. As
that in other Countries, perhaps Princes
and Men of the first Quality, but few of
the midling Sort (for want of Means)
venture upon it. He that will believe
this, must be very little acquainted with
the Affluence of the Fortunes of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,
Genueses</hi> and <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the
Dutch are so near us, that no body, but
who is purblind may see the Effects of
their Wealth. And though is is not to
be denied, but that the <hi>German</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by that Civil War which lasted twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, and was not ended till with
the Peace of <hi>Munster,</hi> and by other foreign
Wars since, has been miserably afflicted
in their Fortunes: Yet the Patricians and
Inhabitants of so great a Number of large
and populous Cities, as are to be found
on the most famous Rivers, the <hi>Rhine,
Danube, Elbe, Weser,</hi> and others, have
fared much better, and the Damages su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
have been sooner repaired in that
Country, than in most others, by the great
Plenty there is of every thing. Even the
Pomp and Multitude of their Courts,
and numerousness of their Armies, for
which the <hi>Germans</hi> have been blamed
long since, are the constant Nurseries of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57496:14"/>
a great many Noble Families, who raise
themselves great Estates, and put out
generally their ready Money in the
neighbouring great Cities, from whence
the Citizens draw as great Advantage in
their Trade; and the Nobility is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
enabled in time of Want, either to
uphold or to restore the Grandeur of
their Families. I know my self, that
about twenty Years ago, a certain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of State to the Duke of <hi>Holstein
Gottorp,</hi> (who is none of the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in those Parts) was esteemed to
leave in real and personal Estate to the
Value of 500000 <hi>l. viz.</hi> to three Sons,
who have laid the Foundation to so
many Rich and Noble Families. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, we may without
detracting from other Countries say,
That the <hi>English</hi> in general enjoy as great
Conveniencies for travelling, as any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatsoever. Our Situation in the
Middle of the most flourishing and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Correspondence we have by our
Trade in those parts, is, (besides the
Affluence of our Fortunes) no small
Encouragement to an <hi>English</hi> Traveller.
But the Goodness of our Money, which
exceeds much the currant Money of a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57496:15"/>
great many other Nations, is an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which a great many Foreigners
who live remote from us, and are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to lose by their Bills from 20 to
30 <hi>per cent.</hi> would be very glad of.</p>
            <p>But that we may not travel beyond
out reach, let us see what he farther says
concerning Travelling. <hi>The Method
which has been generally followed by us, in
sending young Gentlemen to travel, can
hardly answer any of these Ends,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We
send them abroad Children, and bring them
home great Boys; and the Returns they
make for the Expences laid out by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
are suitable to their Age,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Travelling here recommended is that of
Men, who set out so well stock'd with the
knowledge of their own Country, as to be
able to compare it with others,</hi> &amp;c. Here
Here our Author pretends to instruct us
how to travel with Profit; but in such
general Terms, that I am sure he that
does not know it without it, will scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever learn it from those Rules. He
would have done very well to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
what he meant by <hi>Children,
great Boys,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> since the first are
the most improper for travelling, and
very seldom either in this or other
Countries sent abroad; and with the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57496:15"/>
latter, if over-grown with Home-Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it proves very often near as inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
as the first. But tho' I cannot
well guess what he means by his <hi>great
Boys;</hi> if he understands those of a middle
Age, betwixt Childhood and Manhood,
I think they are the most fit to answer
in general the Ends of Travelling. The
practice of those Countries beyond Sea,
where Travelling is most in fashion, has
sufficiently confirmed, That the Age of
Twenty, or thereabouts, is the most suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the first sending abroad of young
People, it being the Age when young
Men, first well instructed at home in the
Principles of such several Professions as
they intend to apply themselves to, may
well prepared, and yet not too much
pre-possessed with the knowledge of the
Constitution and Manners of their own
Country, gradually improve themselves
by Travelling. This Rule I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be generally followed in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and especially in <hi>Germany;</hi> where, as
they travel most, so they may serve as a
Pattern to such as intend to travel with
any Benefit. After they have well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their Children in publick Schools,
(which are to be found in every City
there,) in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57496:16"/>
of Philosophy, till coming to the
Age of 18. or 19. Years, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
send them to some neighbouring
University, as well to be further instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in several Sciences, and in such
Profession as they intend to embrace;
as also to begin to improve themselves in
bodily Exercises, as Fencing, Dancing,
Riding the Great Horse, and in Foreign
Languages, especially the <hi>French,</hi> and
<hi>Italian</hi> Tongues. Thus prepared, they
leave <hi>Germany,</hi> and for the most part
making some stay, either in the several
Universities of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> at
<hi>Leiden, Utrecht,</hi> or <hi>Groningen;</hi> or else
in the chiefest Cities, they endeavour to
perfect their Knowledge of such several
things as they were instructed in before.
From hence the common Road used to
be to <hi>France;</hi> (some taking a small Turn
into <hi>England,</hi>) where having staid a
considerable time, sufficient fully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
themselves in the said Tongue,
and in such Exercises as are taught there
in great Perfection, they either go strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
from thence; or else passing
thro' <hi>Italy,</hi> return into <hi>Germany;</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in their way the chiefest Courts
of the Empire, are then, if they have not
wilfully neglected themselves, esteemed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57496:16"/>
duly qualified to make a true Comparison
betwixt the Excellencies and Deficiencies
of their own and other Countries. <hi>So
that all we pretended to,</hi> says the Author,
<hi>by the late Revolution, bought with so great
Expences, (yet not too dearly paid for) was
to be as we were, and that every one should
have his own again; the effecting of which
may be called a piece of good Luck; and
that is the best can be said of it.</hi> That in
our late happy Revolution, Providence
seemed to have a particular Share, is
what every body that loves his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and this Government, does wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
own: But that at the best, it
should only be a piece of good Luck, I
am to learn yet. As I am well assured that
the most sensible Men agree in this Point,
That Providence in our Days acts by
Human Means, and not by Miracles;
That what is commonly called good
Luck, is generally the Product of such
Counsels and Designs, as are often not
so evident to vulgar Eyes: So I cannot
sufficiently admire, that this Gentleman,
who has taken upon him the Office of
a Censor of Foreign, and a Reformer of
these Nations, should either be ignorant,
or so soon forgetful of the unparallelled
Valour, and uncommon Wisdom of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57496:17"/>
present Majesty, which was so apparent
to all <hi>Europe,</hi> that I think he might
have with Justice, and a due Respect,
mentioned it here. Truly, if by his
Majesty's particular Wisdom, those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Preparations, as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
for such an Enterprise, had not been
carried on with that Vigour and Silence,
in a Country where it seemed most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be effected, that even the
quick-sighted <hi>French</hi> were deceived; if
by his indefatigable Care, the number of
such Forces as were designed for this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
had not been timely supplied
by the <hi>German</hi> Auxiliaries: If at last
by his incomparable Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
he had not surmounted the very
Obstacles of a far advanced Season, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Winds, and Tempests, which would
have with-held any Body but Him: I
believe we would before now have
been in despair of <hi>good Luck</hi> in that kind;
and our Gentleman would have had no
great Encouragement for such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
And it is Riddle to me, since <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body has his own again,</hi> and enjoys it
under the Legal Government of a Wise
and Brave King, with the Assistance of
the great Council of the Nation, why
some among us should be so busie to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57496:17"/>
vent their State-reforming Speculations,
except they labour on purpose to entail
upon us that Sarcasm which our Author
mentions, of the most inconstant Nation
in the World. These are his Words:
<hi>But must frequent Blood-letting be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensibly
necessary to preserve our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Is it not possible for us to render
vain and untrue, that Sarcasm of Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who object to us, That our</hi> English
<hi>Kings have either too much Power, or too
little, and that therefore we must expect
no settled or lasting Peace? Shall we for
ever retain the ill Character they give us,
of the most mutable and inconstant Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World, which however we do not
deserve, no more than</hi> England <hi>does that
of</hi> Regnum Diabolorum, <hi>so common in
unconsidering Foreigners Mouths. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
a Method to preserve our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
in its legal State of Freedom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the necessity of a Civil War once or

searching for, tho' we went to the furthest
Corners of the World in quest of it.</hi> No
Question that such a Method would not
only be worth sear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> But
what Method may be the most proper
to effect it is the Difficulty. This I am
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57496:18"/>
sure, the Methods which some of our
Tavern or Coffee-house Politicians have
taken of late, will not answer the Ends
of such a Settlement. As I frequently
converse among Foreigners, so it has
often vexed me to the Soul, to hear what
Judgment they will make of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
here; not but that I often have
found it too true: yet it could not but
grieve me, that the whole Nation should
bear the blame of a certain Gang of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
among us, who being infected with
the Vanity of their own Conceits, (like
to those afflicted with the Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
to whom Objects are represented
under the same Colour as their Eyes are
infected withal) spread their corrupted
Opinions abroad, to the great Dishonour
and Detriment of the whole Nation.
The Character of <hi>Regnum Diabolorum</hi> I
have very seldom heard, and never, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
from such as were very unconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed; but as for that of <hi>inconstant
and most mutable;</hi> I must confess, it is
common among Foreigners, even of the
best Sence. And for the Love of God,
what milder Construction can any Body
make of the Behaviour of such, as, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be the Champions of our
Government, revive (in their Pamphlets)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57496:18"/>
the almost forgotten Names of <hi>Whig</hi> and
<hi>Tory,</hi> on purpose to renew at the same
time those Jealousies, which within
these few Years had brought this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the very Brink of Destruction.
How can we expect, but that not only
Foreigners, but also all understanding
Men among us, should look upon such
as worse than <hi>inconstant, and mutable,</hi>
who can so soon forget the past Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and neglect their present Happiness?</p>

not only the Actions of Ministers of
State, but also of His Majesty himself,
and the Parliament also, sometimes, if
every thing does not exactly agree with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57496:19"/>
their conceited Rules of governing; and
that at a time when both King, and the
grand Council of the Nation are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
labouring for the Repose, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of those Kingdoms. I would ask
any body of common Sense, if one, who
has perhaps from others only learned the
Rules of Navigation, and peept a little
into the Sea-cards, should pretend to
instruct old Commanders of Ships (how
to steer with Advantage, how to avoid
such hidden Banks as lay scattered up
and down near several Coasts, and how
to manage a Ship in case of Tempests:
would not he deservedly be laught at by
every body, and whether those, who
should trust a Ship to his Management,
would not be esteemed to be out of their
wits? Yet these C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Admirers here, and are vain enough
to imagine, that they could manage the

those to whom the same by our Laws is

And here I cannot forbear to insert
what is related of that great General of
the <hi>Carthaginians Hannibal,</hi> because it
seems to agree in most of its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
with what I have said before.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57496:19"/>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the time of his Banishment
from <hi>Carthage,</hi> came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where
at that time was a Famous Philosopher
<hi>Phormio,</hi> much admired, especially by
the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Among other diversions
wherewith they entertained <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
they would by all means invite him to
hear their so much beloved Philosopher.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> at last over-perswaded by the
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> went to be entertained with
his Discourse, where the Philosopher
with abundance of Rhetorick, begun to
make a long and tedious Sermon of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Affairs, and the Duty of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to the great content of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi>
The Oration at last being ended, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
was asked by them, what he thought
of their Philosopher, to whom he replied
very freely, that he had in his Life-time
seen a great many old Dottrels, but had
never met with one that was so raving-mad
as this old Fellow; which Answer
coming from so great a Man, it's said,
put them a little out of Countenance,
but not out of conceit of their Doctor.
But to return to our Author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attributed our not travelling of late
Years to the management of the two last
Reigns, says further thus: <hi>'Tis not very
long ago, since nothing was more generally
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57496:20"/>
believed (even by Men of the best Sense) than
that the Power of</hi> England <hi>was so unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
established at Sea, that no force could
possibly shake it. That the</hi> English <hi>Valour
and Manner of fighting was so far beyond all
others, that nothing was more desirable,
than a</hi> French <hi>War. Should any one have
been so regardless of his Reputation, as at
that time to have represented the</hi> French
<hi>an over-match for the united Forces of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>or have said, that
we should live to see our selves insulted on
our own Coasts, and our Trades endangered
by them; That we should be in apprehension
every Year of an Invasion, and</hi> French
<hi>Conquest: Such a venturesome Man must
have expected to have pass'd for a very
Travellour, or at least for an ill-natur'd
or unthinking Person, who little considered
what the irresistible Force of an</hi> English
<hi>Arm was; but our late Experience has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
us from these Mistakes.</hi> It were
to be wish'd, that our late Experience,
though never so dearly bought, had qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
rooted out so vulgar an Errour among
us, which had almost proved fatal to
these Kingdoms. But the ignorance of
foreign Affairs, the fondness of our own
irresistible Strength, and the want of
duly comparing the same with that of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57496:20"/>
our Enemies, seems not by late Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it self quite extinguish'd among
some, who fancy themselves no small
Politicians. How many are to be found
to this Day, who vainly boast, that we
are not so near concerned in this War,
as the rest of the Allies; that the
Sea is a sufficient Bulwark against any
Attempts from <hi>France</hi> upon us; nay
that upon all occasions we are able alone
to beat the <hi>French</hi> by Sea and Land,
without the Assistance of our Allies.
This vain Belief of our own Strength,
was the Trap which the <hi>French</hi> twenty
Years ago, when first they began to bid
fair for the universal Monarchy, knew
how to make good use of, to catch us
withall at their own time. I remember
very well, that coming some time before
the Peace at <hi>Nimuegen,</hi> out of <hi>France:</hi> and
having had an opportunity to pass along
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and afterwards through <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
where the Seat of the War then lay:
I at my Return hither, would often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to my Friends what I thought, and
had as an Eye witness, observed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Strength of <hi>France;</hi> who, (tho'
else no Favourers of the Court at that
time) were so far from making any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon that matter, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57496:21"/>
look'd upon it as a false Notion, and
the vain Effect of Travelling; so deeply
had this flattering Fancy taken root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Generality of our Nation here.
At those times it must be confess'd, this
Opinion might be perhaps excusable, but
I cannot see, under what Colour some,
who have seen so formidable a <hi>French</hi>
Fleet a few Years ago in our Chanel,
and the Armies of <hi>France</hi> out number
us almost every where last Year, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to scatter their Pamphlets at this
time, full of vain Suppositions of this
Nature. But we must return to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who by the Example of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks,
encourages us to Travelling in
these words. <hi>The Jesuits have brought
several Maxims, as well as Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from as far off as</hi> China, <hi>or</hi> Japan,
<hi>thereby improving their Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>These Men, (whose firm Adherence to the
most exquisite Tyranny is manifest, by their
indefatigable Endeavours, in behalf of the</hi>
French <hi>King's Interests, as formerly of
the House of</hi> Austria, <hi>whilst it was in its
Height) have by these Arts ingrossed to
themselves, the Education of the Youth,
in all Popish Countries. The</hi> Lutheran
<hi>Priests (who have an entire Dependance
on their Kings and Princes) are entrusted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57496:21"/>
with the like, in those Countries, which
observe the Confession of</hi> Ausburg. <hi>They
also send abroad some of their hopefullest
young Students, several of which may be
met with at</hi> Oxford, Cambridge <hi>and</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:
<hi>The use they make of Travel, being
not only to improve their Knowledge in
Sciences, but to learn fit Methods to please
their Sovereigns, at the Expence of the
Peoples Liberties,</hi> &amp;c. And a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>But the same Travel will afford the
best Antidote against this Poyson, and
teach a Gentleman, who makes right use of
it, by what S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eps slavery has within these
last</hi> 200 <hi>Years crept upon</hi> Europe; <hi>most of
the Protestant, as well as Popish Countries,
having in a manner quite lost the precious
Jewel, Liberty. This cannot be attributed
to any more probable Cause, than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving
the Spirits of the People, as a
Preparative to that of their Bodies. For
since these Princes think it their Interest,
that Subjects should obey without Reserve,
and all Priests who depend upon the Prince,
are, for their own sakes, obliged to promote
what he esteems his own Interest, 'tis plain,
the Education of Youth, on which is laid
the very Foundation Stone of publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
has been of late Years committed to
the sole management of such as make it</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57496:22"/>
their business to undermine it; and must
needs do so, unless they will be false to
their Fortunes, and make the Character of
Priest give place to that of true Patriot, &amp;c.
Indeed they do not forget to recommend to
them frequently, what they call the Queen
of all Vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> Submission to Superiors,
and an entire blind Obedience to Authority,
without instructing them in the due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of it; rather teaching them, that 'tis
without all Bounds. <hi>And in the Conclusion
of the Treatise he hath these Words,
which we will insert here, because they
are of the same Stamp.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 258, 260, 261, 262.</note> It has been a
great Mistake among us, That the Popish
Religion is the only one of all the Christian
Sects, proper to introduce and establish
Slavery in a Nation; in so much that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Slavery have been thought insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Not to derogate from the Merit of
the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Perswasion, which
has been the Darling of so many Monarchs
upon that Account, I shall make bold to
say, That other Religions, and particularly
the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> has succeeded as effectually in
this Design as ever Popery did. 'Tis confess'd
indeed, That Popery would certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Slavery; but it is denyed, That the
last cannot come in without the assistance of
the former, &amp;c. In <hi>Denmark,</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57496:22"/>
Protestant Countries in the <hi>North,</hi>
through the entire and sole dependance of
the Clergy upon the Prince, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering
of the Authority of any Spiritual
Superiour, such as that of the Pope among
the <hi>Romanists,</hi> through their Principles
and Doctrines, which are those of unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Obedience; through the Authority they
have with the common People, Slavery
seems to be more absolutely established
than it is in <hi>France,</hi> as in effect it is more
practised; for that King's Subjects are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
treated. <hi>And a little after:</hi> But in
the Countries I have spoken of, all is
swallowed up in the King, Temporals and
Spirituals, Soul, Body, Estate, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
The Army and the Priests are Two
sure Cards; the Prince that has one of
them at his side can hardly fail; but he
that has both depending on him, need
fear nothing from his own Subjects, let
him use them never so ill. Here is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Charge against the whole Body of
the Clergy (except the <hi>Calvinists</hi> and
their Proselytes, because the <hi>English</hi> have
their Share by and by) concerning the
Miseries that have befallen <hi>Europe</hi> these
Two hundred Years: These (he says)
by the abuse they make of Travelling,
corrupt the Youth, of whom <hi>they have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57496:23"/>
sole Management;</hi> these, <hi>by their entire
dependance</hi> they have <hi>from their Princes;</hi>
and, <hi>by their Doctrine and Principles, sow
the Seeds of Slavery among the People.</hi>
Thus runs the Stream of our Author's
Eloquence.</p>
            <p>But what if we should endeavour to
stop the Current? What if the Doctrine
of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and especially
the Principles of the Jesuites, should
prove rather dangerous than advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to absolute Monarchy? If we should
prove, that <hi>the entire and sole dependance
of the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Priests from their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
is a Chimera of his own? That they
neither have in general, the <hi>Education of
their Youth;</hi> neither that <hi>their Principles
and Doctrine are for a blind unlimited
Obedience:</hi> That as it is against the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Ecclesiasticks in those Parts
where that Religion flourishes, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Liberties, and undermine the
Welfare of the People, so it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, That <hi>Spirituals and Temporals
are swallowed up</hi> by their Help or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence:
And if this Foundation falls,
will not his Doctrine seem to be built
upon a very slippery or sandy Ground?
This Gentleman must surely have been
very little acquainted with the History
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57496:23"/>
of the Reformation in those Parts, and
the Constitutions of the Empire; as also
how often the Protestant Religion there,
together with the Government, hath been
asserted by Arms against the Emperor,
and all other Aggressors, with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> both <hi>Priests</hi> and
<hi>Lawyers.</hi> If this had not been convincing
enough to our Author, he would have
done well to have look'd a little into their
and Writings before he undertook to put
Books such Falsities upon the world. But
since this Gentleman has taken upon him
the Authority of a Judge, let us see by
what Laws he hath condemned the poor
<hi>Lutherans.</hi> And since it is certain that he
ought to condemn them by none but
their own, we must look a little back
into their Monuments, to see how they
do agree with our Author's Assertion. It
is evident, that at the beginning of the
Reformation, <hi>Luther</hi> and his Associates,
had all the Reason in the World to be
cautious in the Doctrine of Obedience,
as well to avoid the Slanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> but
espeeially not to open a Gare to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness
of some, who they foresaw
would take an opportunity to abolish, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Religion, the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57496:24"/>
and Order of Government. And
the several Sects of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
that cruel Rebellion in <hi>Germany,</hi>
(commonly called, <hi>The Peasants War</hi>)
were evident Proofs, that their fore-sight
had not been ill grounded. But let us but
cast but one Eye upon some of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and we may easily see, that they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not so much of <hi>blind and unlimited
Obedience,</hi> as our Author would make us
believe. And to begin with the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those very Divines who lived
partly at the same time, partly succeeded
in the same place where <hi>Luther</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the Reformation, and ever since

<hi>Martin Luther, Justus Jonas, Martin
Bucer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 94</note> and <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> with
joint Consent, did answer: That it
was an unquestionable Truth, which
ought to be confess'd at the last Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
even till Death; that it is not
only permitted, but also truly and
strictly commanded, that all in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
owe to God Almighty this
Service, to repel all Violence from
themselves, and defend their Subjects
against such, as either intended to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Idolatry, or a false Religion upon
them, or pretended to exercise an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power over them. And, as the
Gospel doth confirm (say they) the
Authority of Magistrates; so it does
no less confirm the Laws of Nature,
and Constitutions of Governments.
There is no question, every Father is
obliged to the utmost of his Power to
preserve his Wife, and Children from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57496:25"/>
publick Murther, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a common Murtherer
and the Emperour, if he, out of the
way of his Office, notoriously exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
an illegal Power; because open
violence takes away all obligation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Subject, and the superiour
Magistrate, <hi>jure naturae</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is the same case if a Superiour

and Idolatry: so did <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

he would not desist from his Tyranny,
though he exercised the same in his

to the Rules of Christianity,
which we ought to profess at all times
of Danger, and Death it self. Yet is
this not to be understood, but in the

not reject the outward Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but rather confirms, and
praises the same: From whence does
follow, That the Gospel does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
any natural and just Defence, such
as is suitable either to the Laws of
Nature, or Constitutions of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence it is evident,
that every Magistrate is obliged to
defend his Subjects against others of
the same Degree, or any private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But here arises another question,
<hi>Viz.</hi> What is the Duty of a Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Superiour Lord, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
in such a Case? To which we
give the same Answer: Because the
Gospel confirms Temporal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
therefore every Prince ought
to behave himself towards his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Lord, or the Emperour, according
to the natural Right, and temporal
Constitutions of the Government. If
the Emperour is not a proper Judge,
and yet will, as <hi>pendente appellatione,</hi>
undertake to punish; such his violent
Attempt is, <hi>injuria notoria.</hi> Now is by
a natural Constitution of Governments,
Self-defence, and Resistance against
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57496:26"/>
                  <hi>injuriam notoriam</hi> is allowable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Emperor should act violently,
<hi>pendente appellatione,</hi> concerning Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, or the Peace promised;
he is to be esteemed as a private Person,
and the <hi>injuria</hi> undertaken against
the Right of the Appeal, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Peace, is a publick and <hi>notoria in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria.</hi>
But what if the Appeal is pass'd
the Council? What if Judgment is
given according to the imperial Laws,
and we are cast? Can we then with a
safe Conscience openly resist our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Lord? Answer, After we have
in a decent, and Christian like manner
declared, that we are willing this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should be examined and adjusted,
and have clearly proved the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon which we have built our
Doctrine; and yet the Council goes
on in its illegal way of proceeding,
contrary to the very Foundation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Equity, and the Ordinances set
down in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That not
the contrary Side, but the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church is the sole Judge, all the
Proceedings are void; and as it is
not to be esteemed a Council, so the
Appeal remains in its due Force. And
whatsoever is violently undertaken,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57496:26"/>
by virtue of such Proceedings, is in
truth a publick Violence, and <hi>notoria
injuria.</hi> And suppose, the Pope should
seem not to be so violent in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
yet by virtue of his Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
endeavour to establish Idolatry,
and commit publick Injuries; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it is the Prince's Right to
oppose, and defend themselves against
the same.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And to clear this point the better, it
will, I think, not be amiss to insert here
also the Answer, which was given
by <hi>Martin Luther, Justus Jonas, Philip
Melanc thon, George Spalatin,</hi> and other
Divines, to the Instructions of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
at <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> concerning Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
These are their words:
<q>
                  <p>A Paper has been delivered to us,
out of which we see, what the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is of the Doctors in the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the question: In what cases
it is allowable to resist the Magistracy.
Now because these cases are determin'd
by the Doctors, and others skill'd in
the Laws; and we certainly are at
this time under such Circumstances,
as will allow us (as they prove) to
resist our Superiour Powers; and we
having always taught, that temporal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57496:27"/>
Rights should remain in their due
Force and Vigour, we cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it out of the Scripture, but that
we may defend our selves, if it were
against the Emperour's own Person
or whoever else should act under his
Authority. And because we are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
present in great danger, which seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
to encrease every Day, whereby may
happen a sudden Necessity of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
it will not be amiss not only
for our Laws, but also for Conscience
sake, to prepare and arm our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any Attempts, which may be
made upon us; as it seems very likely
that according to all Circumstances
the like may easily befall us. For
what we have hitherto taught concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
not resisting the higher Powers;
we were not sufficiently instructed,
that the Laws did allow it, to whom
we also have always taught, that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
ought to be given.</p>

the War against the Emperour,
this following Answer:
<q>
                  <p>When we are once certain that the
Emperour intends to attack the States,
by reason of their Religion, there is no
doubt, the States have a Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves, and their Adherents,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a Defence is the same, as if
you defended your self against so many
Murtherers, whether they be headed by
the Emperour or any body else; because
the Act is a publick Tyranny, and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria
violentia.</hi> And what we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the <hi>Spaniards, Italians,</hi> and
<hi>Burgundians;</hi> the Country of <hi>Juliers,</hi>
can and may serve us as an Example.
Wherefore every Inhabitant ought to
venture his Life to resist such Tyranny.
And in this case it is also true, that the
Prevention it self is just and allowable,
provided we are certain, the Emperor
has resolved to invade the States.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I could have translated a great many
more the like Cases; but as the rest have
all follow'd the Footsteps of those above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Divines, who were the first and
chiefest in the Work of Reformation; so I
thought these sufficient to show, how far
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57496:28"/>
different <hi>the Principles and Doctrine of the
Lutherans,</hi> were from <hi>a blind and unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Obedience,</hi> wherewith our Author so
boldly charges them. But that it may
not be objected that our Age has perhaps
altered the Opinion of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;

in the above-mentioned Book) give you
the Opinion of one of the most famous
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines of our Age, Dr. <hi>John
Gerhard,</hi> in his own Words:
<q>
                  <p>Distinguunt, <hi>says he,</hi> Politici Scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
(1) inter Principes Majestatis integrae
&amp; potestatis absolutae, qui absolutum
Imperium in subditos obtinent, nec te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur

respondet ea, quae statuitur inter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditos

&amp; defensionem. Principibus,
quorum potestas est limitata, ab illis,
qui non sunt mere subditi, ab ordini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
scilicet regni, resisti, ac violentiam
eorum armata manu repelli posse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57496:28"/>
id quod sequentibus confirmari
posset argumentis. 1. A Magistratus
officio: Magistratui incumbit, subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos
contra injustam oppressionem tueri,
ut superius fuit demonstratum. Jam
vero ordines regni in regno electivo,
ad quod non nisi certis conditionibus
caput est evectum, sunt loco Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.
Non enim sunt mere subditi, sed
partem potestatis in electione summi
capitis sibi reservarunt. 2. A Juris na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis
praescripto. Defensio sui omni
jure Divino, scilicet naturali &amp; civili
est concessa; Ergo licet ordinibus
regni contra injustam oppressionem se
&amp; subditos defendere. 3. Ex mutuae
obligationis modo. Ex contractibus
nascitur mutua &amp; reciproca obligatio.
Jam vero inter Principem potestatis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictae,
&amp; Ordines regni electivi talis
contractus fuit initus, ut Princeps in
leges regni fundamentales prius jurave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
antequam Ordines, regni nomine,
omnium subditorum fidem ipsi darent.
Quod si ergo Princeps ab hoc contractu
discedit, Ordines regni ab obedientiae
promissione ipso jure absolvuntur. 4.
Ex axiomate Theologico, quod Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium

ad statuta &amp; jura politica hoc ipsum

            <p>I could not avoid inserting those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
here, that thereby the Judicious
Reader might the better be able to judge
of the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Obedience; and how much
the same differs from what our Author
has laid to their Charge; That <hi>both their
Principles and Doctrine are for a blind
and unlimited Obedience, without instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Auditors in the due Measures of
it: And that they send some of their
hopefullest young Students abroad, to learn
fit Methods to please their Sovereigns at
the Expence of the Peoples Liberty.</hi> It
may perhaps be objected, That some of
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have tied the Subjects to a
much stricter sort of Obedience towards
their Sovereigns. But to this may be
answered, That it is very unjust to charge
a whole Body with the Opinions of a
few; besides, to those who have perused
the Writings of the most zealous <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57496:31"/>
Champions for Obedience to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,
it will be evident enough, that
even these have put Bounds to the same,
and always submitted their Judgment in
this Case to the Laws and Constitutions
of the Government. I could give a
great many Instances of this kind; but
not to be too tedious in a matter already
sufficiently proved, I will only add a few
Passages out of an Author, who living

            <p>I am not ignorant that these latter
words may bear a double Interpretation;
yet he that will duly compare the former
Passages with the last, will easily find out
the Author's meaning to be, That the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
Priests, as Priests, have no entire
dependance from their Magistrates,</hi> but that
in <hi>Denmark</hi> the Welfare of the Monarchy
is inseparable from the maintaining of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57496:34"/>
               <hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confession. And I admire
how our Author, during his stay in
<hi>Denmark,</hi> could be so overseen, as no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to enquire more strictly into this Point,
before he undertook to assert a thing of
that nature with so much Confidence. As
for the <hi>Lutheran Priests</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi>
where that Religion chiefly flourishes,
it is certain, they have in the most places,
<hi>much less dependance from their Princes;</hi>
since in the most Cities and Corporations
there the Rights of Patronage are either in
the Magistrates, or else in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
sometimes joyntly in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Elders of the Parishes. In
the Country some of them perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Nobility, some to the Prince;
and so do some Cathedrals; tho' a great
many Ministers in these latter are chosen
by the Canons; and all their yearly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries,
Houses, and other Benefices, are
ascertained to them out of such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
or Lands as do properly belong and
depend, not from the Prince, but the
several Cathedrals and Parish-Churches.
Their Perquisites, which especially in the
Cities, commonly amount to more than
their Salaries, and in some places are very
considerable, come from Buryings, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57496:34"/>
Confessions, Prayers in the
Churches, and with the sick at their
Houses, Marrying and New-years-Gifts;
all which as in those Parts they
most absolutely depend on the Peoples
Liberality and Inclination, being rather
established by Custom than any Laws,
I cannot see what Colour our Author
could have for his Assertion, that, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they will resign the Character of Priest
to that of true Patriot, and be false to
their Fortunes, they are obliged to assist
their Princes in their Arbitrary way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning;</hi>
it being manifest, that their
Vocation (generally speaking) and their
Subsistence as <hi>Priests,</hi> depend from the
People, rather <hi>than their Princes;</hi> and
they having also their Consistories where
Ecclesiastical Affairs are determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Constitutions of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries; and in a great many
Places Prelates, as Abbots, Priors, and
Deans, who are among the States in
their several Countries, it is evident, that
our Author's supposed <hi>dependance, without
the interfering of a Superiour, such as the
Pope among the</hi> Romanists, <hi>betwixt the</hi>
Lutheran <hi>Clergy and their Princes,</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
so dangerous either to the Priests or
People, as our Author would fain p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57496:35"/>
us, on purpose to lay all the
blame upon the Clergy. To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this the better, he tells us with
a singular Confidence, That also
<hi>the sole Management of the Youth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Priests
in those Countries, which observe the
Confession of</hi> Augsburgh; tho, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
nothing is more contrary to the
Truth. I will appeal to those who, as
well as I, have made an enquiry into this
Matter, Whether in the publick Schools
of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> they have not found
Schoolmasters of other Professions as well
as Divines; and tho' they are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that Function, whether they
ever were preferred before others, as
being Professors or Students of Divinity?
The Nobility in the Country, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
in the Cities, generally have their
Tutors or Domestick Preceptors, for the
Education of their Children (Boarding-Schools
being rarely to be found there;)
in the choice of whom they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so far from preferring Divines before
others, that they seldom admit of them
in that Station. And when their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
come to the Age of Travelling, or
going to the Universities, it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Maxime among them, not to put the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57496:35"/>
Tuition of their young Men into the
Hands of Divines, whose Profession
obliging them to a sedentary Life, and
least of all others being accustomed to
travel, they do not reckon these so proper
Instruments for the perfecting their Sons,
and obtaining the full ends of Travelling,
as those of other Professions, who more
frequently apply themselves to it in those
Parts. I am apt to believe that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
may be fallen partly into this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
from the necessity and custom
which formerly had obtained in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
when the Nobility having in
their Hands all Places of Profit and
Trust; and their Constitution not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
many Lawyers, Divinity was
the only Profession, out of which they
were obliged to choose persons for the
Education of their Youth. But besides
that Matters are much altered since in
<hi>Denmark,</hi> as to this Particular, it would
have been but prudence to have enquir'd
more strictly into this Point, as to the
Customs of other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Countries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made it the Foundation Stone of
his Doctrine of Slavery.</p>
            <p>If this Gentleman would have taken
into due Consideration the Protestant
League made immediately after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57496:36"/>
at <hi>Smalkald;</hi> the ensuing War
with <hi>Charles</hi> the V. the Transactions at
<hi>Passaw;</hi> That long and most cruel War
which was for 30 Years together carried
on in <hi>Germany,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Protestants</hi>
and the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Party, and the
Peace thereupon concluded at <hi>Munster,</hi>
and <hi>Osnabrugge;</hi> besides what not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years ago happened in <hi>Hungary,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of the Counts <hi>Serini,
Nadasti</hi> and <hi>Franquepani,</hi> and is to this
Day continued by <hi>Teckely,</hi> (the Heads
of which League were chiefly <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
and their Pretensions both for <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Liberty</hi>) he could not have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so gross an Error, as to impute an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
blind Obedience both in</hi> their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices to the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to clear this Point the better, I
cannot but relate some Passages which
happened in our Memory, in the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> betwixt his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Highness, and some <hi>Lutheran</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
out of which it will easily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
whether the Northern parts of
<hi>Germany</hi> are so much infected with
<hi>blind Obedience,</hi> as this Gentleman ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
The Business happened thus:
<hi>Frederick William</hi> the present Elector of
<hi>Brandenburgh's</hi> Father, being of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57496:36"/>
Religion, which they call com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the <hi>Calvinian,</hi> was for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Agreement betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
and <hi>Calvinists.</hi> There were at that time
two Factions among the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> The
first of such, as were strictly, and with
some austerity adhering to the first Rules
of the Reformation, were called the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburgh</hi>
Faction, or sometimes <hi>Calovians,</hi>
from one Dr. <hi>Calow</hi> in the said Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Professor of Divinity, who was a
fierce and implacable Enemy to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of one Dr. <hi>Calixtus,</hi> and others in
the University of <hi>Helmstadt,</hi> who were
for moderating and reconciling the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
differences in <hi>Germany.</hi> The former
had for a considerable time, both in their
Sermons and Writings, been very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> the later had
dealt with them more mildly, for which
reason they also had undergone the rigid
Censures of the <hi>Wittenburgh</hi> Divines in
the Country of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtines</hi>
therefore, and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> with
the Assistance of some of the States of
<hi>Brandenburgh</hi> were very desirous to bring
the former to a more pliable Temper;
and the Elector being willing to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a better Understanding, took an
opportunity by his several Proclamations
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57496:37"/>
to order, that both Parties should abstain
from injurious Words: Such as <hi>Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Sacramentarians, Ubiquitists, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites,</hi>
and the like; That they should
not put any Consequences deduced out
of their several Hypotheses upon one
another, which either Party did deny;
And thirdly, that all Priests should be
obliged to baptize the Children of such
Parents, as were averse to the Exorcism,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Formal, Exorcism,</hi> Leave this Child, thou unclean Spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost!</note>
(which the most <hi>Lutherans,</hi> together
with the Sign of the Cross, use in the
Baptism) without the same. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in no ways
complying with his Mandates; he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certain Formulars to be subscribed
by them, and commanded his confistorial
Judges, to see that every thing were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed according to his Mandates.
It would be too long to dispute here
concerning the Merit of the Cause upon
either Side; it will be sufficient to shew,
how the <hi>Lutherans</hi> behav'd themselves in
this Case, which I think will fully clear
them as to the Point of <hi>blind Obedience.</hi>
They were then so far from obeying the
Electoral Proclamations, and subscribing
the Formulars, that they on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
together with such of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
as adhered to them, did by several
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57496:37"/>
Petitions under the Name of the true
and pure <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, and their
Confessors, tell the Elector,<note place="margin">1674. 2. Supplicat.</note>
               <hi>That he had
quite surrendred himself like a Prisoner to
his Privy Counsellors, who pretended to
a religious Peace, by suppressing that of</hi> Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabrugge,
<hi>and quite abolishing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Constitutions and Agreements. And
whenever they objected to the Courtiers,
that their proceedings were against the
Rights of Patronage, and Contracts; the
common Answer was, that these were out
of date; Because the Eighth Commandment
was not to be found in the States Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
but in lieu of the same, was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,

               <hi>That at the Peace
made at</hi> Osnabrugge <hi>it was
agreed, that no body should
be permitted to alter the free
Exercise of Religion, or the
Laws and Constitutions that
were established. Neither
that under pretext of Rights
of Patronage, Episcopal or
Territorialor any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Ministers should be
forced upon the Subjects of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Religion, or any thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57496:38"/>
to be either directly or indirectly done,
which might prove prejudicial to another
Religion.</hi> They say further: <hi>That these
Rules were taken out of the States Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
to perswade Magistrates, that as in
Temporal, so in Ecclesiastical Affairs, they
have alone absolute Power to determine and
punish, which is an unheard of Doctrine in
both Religions. That some Examples out
of the Old Testament and Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
ill applied, the Prerogative of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Rights of Patronages, were
political Pretences, from whence it might
be evident, that the former Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were nothing else than the Tokens of
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the political Antichrist;
since in setting Magistrates above all what
belongs to God,</hi> viz. <hi>his Word, Sacraments,
Denominations, Church-Ceremonies, and
Ministers; the Design was to invade the
Throne of Christ.</hi> And in another Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they object to the Elector a Coin
which was coined 1548, by <hi>George</hi> Duke
of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> which had on one Side this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription:
<hi>Plus odi Conciliatores istos, quam
apertos Religionis Hostes.</hi> And further
say: <hi>That the Elector's Proclamations were
against the Peace of the Empire, Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Land, and Contracts made</hi>
Anno 1653, <hi>where it was concluded, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57496:38"/>
no Proclamations should be issued forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to that Contract, or contrary to
both Religions.</hi> I could have inserted
more of this kind, but I will only add so
much, that these Petitions having been
delivered to the Elector, after he had
upon the Request of the Representatives
of the Prelates, Earls, Nobility and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
abrogated the Formular proposed
to the Clergy before, and explained
himself very favourably as to the point
of arguing in their Sermons, may serve
as lively Instances, that the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Priests, though they represent Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as the <hi>Queen of all Vertues,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
rather with Modesty, than armed
with Dagger and Poyson, yet they have
neither blinded, neither tongue-tied her.
The Disturbances arisen some time ago,
&amp; continuing to this Day in a<note n="*" place="margin">Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</note> Northern
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Commonwealth, betwixt two
Clergymen, who have drawn not only
the rest of the Clergy, but also all the
Inhabitants (notwithstanding the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
Authority and Endeavours to the
contrary) into two Parties, are so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that those alone sufficiently contradict
our Author's Assertion concerning their
<hi>blind Obedience.</hi> But it is time to leave the
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> and to see why the <hi>Roman
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57496:39"/>
Catholick</hi> Religion has been the <hi>darling
of Princes</hi> upon the Account of blind
Obedience, according to this Gentleman's
Opinion. Truly those that will a little
consider, that pernicious Doctrine of the
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> of deposing, nay even
murthering of Princes; the many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this kind, which have veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their Principles in this point; the
Bulls of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> VIII, <hi>Innocent</hi> III,
<hi>Clement</hi> V, and other Popes, who have
asserted the same as a legal Power, will,
I believe, easily be convinced that an
Arbitrary Prince, who understands his
own Interest, has but little reason to
make those <hi>his darlings,</hi> who think it
not only lawful, but also meritorious
to cut his Throat, when not submitting
himself to their Rules. And how can
any Prince who affects an Arbitrary
Power, suppose himself absolute Master
of his Subjects, as long as there are in
his Dominions those, and that in great
Numbers, who being potent both by their
vast Possessions, and the Influence they
have over the rest, acknowledge another
Head, besides himself, and profess open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that both in Spirituals and Temporals
they owe more Obedience to the Pope
than the Prince? It would be superva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57496:39"/>
to prove this, it being, besides the
Bulls of <hi>Gregory</hi> IX, <hi>Innocent</hi> IV, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
VII, and a great many others, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
certified by Histories, and
their practices in all Ages; that no body
who has any insight in History, can be
ignorant of it. I know some will object
to this, that these have been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
in former Ages among the <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> when Simplicity was more
predominant; but that since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
the Jesuits have known so to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
this point, as that nothing is to
be fear'd from thence, which seems to
be also our Author's Opinion; when he
says, that the <hi>firm Adherency</hi> to <hi>Tyranny
is</hi> manifest in the Jesuits, by their <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
now <hi>to the French interest, as they did</hi>
formerly to the <hi>House of Austria.</hi> That
the Jesuits who are the Supporters of the
above-mentioned Doctrine so destructive
to all Governments, should have in the
least receded from the same, is as vain
to imagine, as that the same do now less
adhere to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
It is not to be denied, some of
that Gang have had cunning enough to
insinuate themselves into the most secret
Affairs of the <hi>French</hi> King; but what is
that towards their having shaken off
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57496:40"/>
off their old Principles of <hi>Self-Interest,</hi>
and maintaining the Pope's Prerogative;
or their adhering now more to <hi>France.</hi>
than the House of <hi>Austria?</hi> Their
seeming Compliance, is by all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
People in <hi>France</hi> it self,
look'd upon as an effect of their Fear,
rather than good Inclination towards
that Kingdom: For they having seen,
that the <hi>French</hi> Kings have maintained
their Authority with a high Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Pope, and the restless Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
of their Fraternity, they have of late
according to their wonted Custom, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Tune for fear of losing all.
That famous Inscription of <hi>Lewis</hi> XII, that
notable Advice of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perdam Babylonis homen.</note> of
setting up a Patriarch in <hi>France,</hi> and the
vigorous Opposition <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. found
in the present <hi>French</hi> King against all his
Attempts, has frightned these Fathers
into a Complacency, which nothing but
the Consideration of their own Interest
could have extorted from them; to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
which they will at any time adhere,
either to <hi>France,</hi> or to the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> to <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</hi>
And this may be evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to any body who will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their Behaviour in our Age as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57496:40"/>
well as the former. Not to speak of
the Villanies of <hi>Castell, Clement,</hi> and
<hi>Ravaillack,</hi> who are so abominable,
that they ought not to be mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Race of Mankind, and are
lively Instances, how far the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
have laid aside their ancient King-killing
Principle. The Jesuite,<note place="margin">Grammon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And it is remarkable what is related of

Arbitrary, will not be so fond of them, as
to make them their <hi>Darlings upon that

have been cautious enough to clip a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
their Wings in their Dominions: yet
as the great decay of that once flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is an instance, that where ever they get

which may convince all unbyass'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that it is not <hi>any form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
they adhere to, but that they will
flatter either <hi>Arbitrary Power or Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
according as it turns best to their
own Account. But we must go further
and hear what our Author has to say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>English</hi> Clergy. <hi>I do not
hereby mean,</hi> says he, <hi>to reflect on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which generally has the government of
our Youth; we have had the experience of
many among them, who have given proof
of a freer Education and Learning: And
without question the chief posts of the Gown
of both kinds were never better filled than
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57496:42"/>
at present. I only lament the ill contrivance
of their Constitution; for while Interest
draws one way, and Honesty another, when
a Man may make his Fortune by forgetting
his Duty to his Country, but shall always
stick at mark while he serves it; 'tis scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be hoped Men should hold out against
such temptations, unless they be generally
gifted with more Honesty than the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mankind are. And since they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
still upon the same bottom, it must be
expected the same, or other as mischievous
Doctrines will be broached; whereas if
they were once set upon the same foot, the
Philosophers of old were, if honesty and the
duty to their Country, were made their
private interest, and the way to thrive, we
should soon see them shift hands, and the
Spirit of those Philosophers revive in them
again. The Constitution of our Universities
as to Learning, seems as unfortunately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
as it is to Politicks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It seems
as ridiculous to take patterns for the gentile
Learning of this Age, from the old fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Learning of the Times, wherein the
University-Statutes were compiled, as it
would be for one, who would appear well
dress'd at Court, to make his Cloaths after
the Mode in</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> VIII's <hi>Days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57496:43"/>Here is an <hi>Harangue</hi> upon the <hi>English</hi>
Clergy, which if you explain, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to say, but according to their
Institution, if they will be honest they
cannot thrive; and that therefore no
good is to be expected from them. I
must confess, that among all Books that
ever I saw, I never met with one, which
asserted more with an excessive Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and proved less. If this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Resolution was to take upon him
the Office of a Church, and State-Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
General, it would have been but
suitable to so great a Character, to have
been a little more particular, as well in
this as other points, and to have shewed
us the true Faults of such Constitutions,
with their proper Remedies; that from
thence we might have judged, whether
by his Suppositions, those Rules could be
introduced into the Government, which
the best Head-pieces hitherto have not
been able to find out. But to tell us a
random Story of <hi>Interest drawing one, and
Honesty another way,</hi> without explaining
the point, is nothing else than <hi>audacter
loqui</hi> (not to speak worse) and can
scarce be taken by any sensible Man to
have been done with a true Intention
of serving the Publick; Since it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57496:43"/>
that by such vain Rhetorick, neither
the true Nature of the Matter will be
understood, nor proper Remedies be
found out. Neither can any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what he means by saying, <hi>if Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and the Duty to their Country were made
their private Interest,</hi> since it is apparent
enough to all judicious Persons in that
kind, that the Constitutions of the
Clergy, is in all well-constituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
so link'd with that of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the whole, and in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
so inseparately annexed to our true
and fundamental form of Government,
that without great Danger of Ruin, both
Interests cannot be separated; We have
learned this Truth by woful Experience,
within some of our Memory, that as to
us, it needs no further Proof. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that in my Travels I did once in a
certain Commonwealth see the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inscription upon a Door of a great
Church, <hi>Felix Respublica, ubi Moses &amp;
Aaronmanent Fratres;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hambor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> by which as they
seem'd to admire the Wisdom of the
great Legislator, who put the Spiritual
and Temporal Government of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
into the Hands of two Brothers; so they
intimated that from the <hi>Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
of both, depended in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57496:44"/>
the Felicity of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
Surely, our Author, who is altogether
for Antiquity, has forgot, that in the
most Ancient, and so wisely regulated
Government of the <hi>AEgyptians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dicd. l. 1. sect 2.</note> the Priests
(who also were Philosophers) had the

Soldiers, both by the Prince and People.
That besides others, his beloved <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans</hi> followed the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.
The <hi>Athenians</hi> admitted their

Aversion against that Office of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
so troublesome to all lovers of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and that I have received particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Obligations from one of our two
Universities: I will rather leave that
Province to more able Men, than be too
busie and forward in mentioning the
same. What also this Gentleman says,
That the Lawyers have been in most
places favourers of Liberty, I will not
contradict positively; because, to prove
the contrary would exceed the Limits of
Animadversions: though, I believe, if a
proportionable Computation were made
betwixt the Gown of both Kinds; it
would be found that the Lawyers, even
in our latter Times, have in no ways
been behind hand with the Clergy in
that point. But since it would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that the whole Body of either
kind should be charged with the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a few; and a great many of these
also, partly have altered, partly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the same; I reckon it better to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it in oblivion, than by exasperating
to revive the old Animosities. But we
must return to our Author, who after
he has long discoursed concerning the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57496:46"/>
Diseafes in the Body politick, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to come to his Remedies. So have
seen your half-learned Youngsters in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
who having got together a few
Aphorisms and other sayings out of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> apply them with a
very comely Countenance to all sorts of
Sicknesses, and with no less Confidence
promise Cure, speedy and easie, by help of
their Universal never-failing Restaurative
of the whole Body: which though they
generally pretend to be as ancient as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
Trismegist;</hi> yet is upon due enquiry
commonly found to be taken out of
some bragging Chymist or other of our
times: But let us look upon our Author's
Receipt. <hi>The</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans, says
he, <hi>instituted their Academies to quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose; the whole Education of their
Youth tended to make them as useful to the
Society they lived in, as possible; There
they were train'd up to Exercise and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
to accustom them to an active Life:
No Vice was more infamous than Sloth, nor
any Man more contemptible, than him,
that was too lazy to do all the good he
could. The Lectures of their Philosophers
served to quicken them up to this. They
recommended above all things the Duty
to their Country, the Preservation of their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57496:46"/>
Laws and the publick Liberty; subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to which, they preached up Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
such as Fortitude, Temperance, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Contempt of Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they made use of pious Cheats, as</hi>
Elysian <hi>Fields, and an Assurance of future
Happiness, if they died in the Cause of
their Country; And even deceived their
Hearers into Greatness; hence proceeded all
those noble Characters, wherewith their
Histories are so stock'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of our modern Education, have not
been quite so publick-spirited; for it has
been for the most part in the hands of Men,
who have a distinct Interest from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Good Learning as well as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
is a great Antidote against the plague
of Tyranny. The Books that are left us of
the Ancients (from whence, as from Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
we draw all that we are now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of,) are full of Doctrines, Sentences,
and Examples, exhorting to the Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Recovery of the publick Liberty,
which was once valued above Life. The
Hero's there celebrated are, for the most
part, such as had destroyed or expelled Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
and though</hi> Brutus <hi>be generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against by modern School-boys, He
was then esteemed the true Pattern and
Model of exact Vertue. Such was</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57496:47"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Utica, <hi>with others of like Stamp,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>'Twas not to learn Foreign Languages that
the</hi> Greecian <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Youths went for so
long together to the Academics and Lectures
of their Philosophers; 'twas not then, as
now with us, when the Character of a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
is, to be skill'd in Words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This
manner of Education produced Men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stamp than appears now upon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre

            <p>Here is such a Panegyrick upon the
ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> that I much
question whether <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi>
both have said so much of them. But,
since our Author seems to nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
so much all that is new, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to admire Antiquity, it is a great
wonder to me, why he did not go to
the most ancient Fountain it self, from
whence the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and consequently
the <hi>Romans,</hi> had their best Laws and
Constitutions; I mean the <hi>Egyptians:</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57496:47"/>
What the Historians have related of
them,<note place="margin">Diod. lib. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Rules of governing, and kept their
Laws the longest and best in ure of any
other Nation, as having implanted them
into their very Infants by degrees, and
taken effectual care to instruct them
afterwards in Philosophy and Divinity,
deserves credit by all who have had
any insight into those most ancient
times. Besides their most admirable
Institutions, the Invention of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Arithmetick, Geometry and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
are unquestionably attributed to
them; their Magnificent Tombs, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Obelisks, and Pyramids, their
Sculptures, and whole Architecture,
their Labyrinth, and prodigious Chanels,
derived out of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> together
with their stupendious Lake of <hi>Myris,</hi>
were much surpassing any thing the <hi>Greeks</hi>
or <hi>Romans</hi> ever did afterwards. Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Exercises, as Horse and Foot-Races,
besides those with Chariots, were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
things; and, to say all, the <hi>Greeks</hi>
had all from them, but they almost all
from themselves. And since it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
certain, that <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,
Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and the most solid <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Philosophers did fetch their best
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57496:48"/>
Knowledge from thence; and it is even
spoken to the praise of <hi>Moses</hi> himself,
that he was instructed in all sorts of
Wisdom of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> I cannot well
devise what induced our Author not so
much as to mention them; except the
Reason is, That their way of having
Hereditary Princes, to whom they
did pay (though no Slaves) a most
profound Respect, did not agree with
our Author's Romantick Opinion of the
transcendent Vertues of <hi>Brutus.</hi> And
since he pretends to teach us the true
Education of our Youth, the <hi>Persians</hi>
would have furnish'd him with as good
Patterns in their Princes Sons, as any
are to be found among the <hi>Romans</hi> or
<hi>Greeks,</hi> but that I suppose these were
less for his purpose. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
look a little into the ancient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and see whether they are the only
People that, being to be preferred before
all others, ought to prescribe Rules for
Education and Policy. I suppose it will
not be thought a new Objection to say,
That the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not been so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
in describing their own Affairs as
the <hi>Romans;</hi> wherefore we ought not to
wonder, if these latter do not speak in
so high Terms of them as our Author.

That the <hi>Greeks</hi> made no great Account

And since our Author has magnified
their Philosophers so much above ours,
I cannot but put him in mind of the
greatest of Philosophers, who, being
come forth in our Age, has in so much
out-done all the Ancients, both in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
and Natural Principles,<note place="margin">Des Cartes.</note> and
is in no ways behind them in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks;
but especially in his incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Method of Reasoning, that I am
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57496:51"/>
to believe, if he had perused and duly
considered his Philosophy, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have been cured of his vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of the old ones. It is not my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
here to determine whether he has
taken some light as to his natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
out of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as some say he has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as to his Metaphysicks out of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
and other Fathers; this is most
certain, that since his publishing the
same, there has been a more solid
Foundation laid towards the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and advancing the most useful
Sciences, than all the Golden Ages of
his so much admired Philosophers have
been able to produce. But let us not
insist farther upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> since we
must also take a short view of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
That the same have much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the former in true greatness of Mind,
Constancy, Love to their Country, and,
before all, in Martial Discipline, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Laws, nay even in Eloquence
(that most beloved Art of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>)
have been equal to them, is what
scarce any body, who has had a right
insight into both their Histories, will
deny: but that they should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Education of their Youth,
generally speaking, to the chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57496:51"/>
of such Philosophers as were
frequent in <hi>Greece,</hi> I am to learn yet.
As the Foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was their Military Discipline,
and excellent Laws and Customs; so the
same were implanted into their Youth,
by the Instructions and Examples rather
of their Parents, than any publick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers:

of <hi>Rome?</hi> If I should but hint
the particulars of these great actions,
certainly it would make him asham'd of
his vain Conceits. But since these great
and unparallell'd Actions will never be
forgot by all good Men, and my Pen is in
no ways able to find words proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to so extraordinary Merits, I will
only say, that I will defie our Author to
shew me out of all his worm-eaten Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
(whether <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi>) a
Family by a continual Succession of time
so abounding with Champions for their
Country, as his Majesty's, or any one of
the Ancient <hi>Hero</hi>'s surpassing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
in Valour, Prudence and Justice. It
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57496:56"/>
is therefore to be admired, why among
so many <hi>Romans</hi> eminent for their
Vertues, he could not pick
out any others to put as
Examples,<note place="margin">

And here I should say
something concerning our
Author's new broach'd Rules of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as also the Digression he makes
upon the most Antient Constitutions of
Government in <hi>Europe:</hi> but because these
<hi>Remarks</hi> are grown almost as monstrous
in bigness as the <hi>Preface</hi> it self, and we
shall be obliged to treat of these Points
hereafter, when he in the <hi>Treatise</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the form of Government in
<hi>Denmark</hi> and other Countries, we will
supersede it here, as also, what he says
according to his Romantick way, <hi>That
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57496:57"/>
in</hi> Spain, Italy, <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>Slavery is
not so conspicuous, but in the Northern
parts it appears in its true shape;</hi> since
something of that will be said in the
Conclusion of the <hi>Treatise,</hi> where he
speaks to the same purpose. But what
he says, <hi>That it is now or never seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to assert both the Peoples Right and
his Majesty's Title,</hi> is like all the rest of
his Vanity, since God knows he has
not said one word farther of it; and it
would have been but common Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
not to have inserted things of that
high moment in a transitory way among
his fantastical Conceits, especially at a
time when the People enjoy their legal
Liberties under the Reign of a Wise,
Just, and Brave King, whose Title is
so generally approved by the Practice of
all, and especially our Age, and more

of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and all good Men in

            <head>REMARKS
UPON THE
TREATISE,
CALLED
An ACCOUNT
OF
DENMARK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE first Chapter of the</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<hi>it self, having nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in it, besides a general Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical
Description of the Territories
belonging to the King of</hi> Denmark,
<hi>does not require any further Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and if the Author in some other
matters had, (as he has done in this)
rather follow'd the foot-steps of Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Writers, than his</hi> Sensible and Grave
Men <hi>(as he calls them in this Chapter)
who have misled him for the most
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57496:58"/>
part, into a Conceit of his own</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>and an ill-grounded</hi> Experience, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of</hi> Truth, <hi>we might have superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to extend these</hi> Remarks <hi>so far as
we are obliged now to do. We will
therefore go on to the Second Chapter,
where he speaks thus, concerning the
Island of</hi> Zealand: It is almost of
a circular Figure, and contains about <hi>180
English</hi> Miles in circumference: I cannot
commend its Fertility, there being no
Bread Corn growing in any part of it,
except Rye, which indeed is in good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and whereof most of their Bread is
made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It has no Rivers, nor above
half a score Brooks that are able to turn
a Mill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> About one fourth part of it
is Forrest lying open for the King's Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and his Game, such as Stags, Wild
Boars, Roe Buck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things, that no body dares touch
them, tho' they find them in whole Herds
destroying their Corn, to the infinite yearly
damage of the poor Peasants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
Sea-Ports, that most excellent one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> must make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the want of them, not only in
this, but many other of the Islands;
there being few others, that I know of, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of harboring a Vessel of <hi>200</hi> Tuns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57496:58"/>
Neither is this a sensible want, because
there are no Commodities in this Island,
for Exportation. I have been told, that
forty years ago, ten or twelve <hi>Dutch</hi> Fly-Boats
found yearly their Lading at <hi>Kiog,</hi>
a pretty flourishing Town at that time,
within twenty <hi>English</hi> Miles of <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
but of late they seem to be well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
if the Product of the Isle maintains
in this sort of Grain the Inhabitants of it:
Not that the Numbers of these are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but Husbandry is not so much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
now, as when the Taxes of the poor
Country People were less frequent and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The feeding of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
generally throughout all <hi>Denmark,</hi> is
very mean, the Burgers or Citizens su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
themselves with Rye Bread, Sale
Flesh, Stock Fish, Bacon, and very bad
Cheese; insomuch that the Inspecters of
our Markets in <hi>England,</hi> who use to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
or send to the Prisons all such Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
as are not judged wholesom, would
(if they found them no better provided
than at <hi>Copenhagen</hi>) go near to empty
the Markets, and leave little so either
Buyer or Seller; the Peasants live on Roots,
white Meats, and Rye Bread, feldom
tasting fresh Fish, and scarce ever Flesh,
unless on some extraordinary Festivals
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57496:59"/>
as on St. <hi>Martin's Eve,</hi> when each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in <hi>Denmark,</hi> without fail, makes
merry with a roasted Goose at Supper,
Here and in all <hi>Denmark,</hi> are but two
Seasons of the year, Winter and Summer;
those two other more agreeable ones of
Spring and Autumn not being commonly
known; the Spring never, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn
seldom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The principal things
of this Island, and indeed of all <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
are the City of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and
the Passage of the <hi>Sound.</hi> I will begin
with the City, the rather, because when I
have done with that, I have little more to
say of any other in the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi>
Dominions, there being no other belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, much better than our Town
of St. <hi>Albans. Thus far our Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Island of <hi>Zealand</hi> containing
the chief City of all <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
being the place of Residence of its
Kings, and consequently more frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Strangers, than most of the other
parts of this Kingdom, we might have
justly expected a more exact Account
thereof, than of the rest; which, how
it has been performed, will be worth
our taking notice of. The circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Zealand</hi> he makes to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>80
<hi>English</hi> Miles, when I am surre I could
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57496:59"/>
never meet with any body whether <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi>
or other <hi>Foreigner,</hi> that knew this Island,
but all confirmed what I had observed as
near as I could, before, that the length of
this Island were about 20 <hi>Danish</hi> Leagues,
and if you do reckon but a <hi>Danish</hi>
League to consist of four <hi>English</hi> Miles
(as certainly they do at least) the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
which this Gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is pleased to make almost circular,
must by computation, amount to 240
<hi>English</hi> Miles, which is 60 more than is
mentioned in the Author's Description.
And according to this Calculation, you
must give grains of allowance for all the
rest; he cannot (says he) <hi>recommend
its Fertility, there being no Bread Corn
growing there in any part, except Rye:</hi>
but he had forgot that there also grows
Wheat in some parts, and Barley almost
every where in abundance, as also a great
quantity of Oats. He says, <hi>That there
are few Ports in this and many other
of these Islands capable of harbouring a
Vessel of 200 Tuns; neither that this is a
sensible want, because there are no Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in this Island for Exportation.</hi> I
must confess he has been a little more
modest in this Assertion than in any
other before, having added the words
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57496:60"/>
(<hi>that I know of</hi>) yet it is a wonder that
his <hi>Grave and Sensible Men</hi> could not
instruct him better. They must for all
their <hi>Gravity</hi> have been either very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
or else very negligent in not
telling him, that in this very Island of
<hi>Zealand,</hi> were other Cities and Ports
(not to speak in this place of those in the
other Islands, which shall he mentioned
in their proper places) which could, and
did <hi>harbour Ships of above 200 Tuns,</hi> and
that it would be a <hi>considerable want,</hi> if
these places were not in that Island;
since from <hi>Corsoer,</hi> a place well Fortified
with a Castle, and lying on the West
side of this Island on the great Belt
over against <hi>Nyburgh</hi> in <hi>Funen,</hi> a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity of Barley is yearly
Exported to <hi>Holland;</hi> as is done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from <hi>Holbeck,</hi> but more especially
from <hi>Calenburgh;</hi> which being a well
built place, <hi>exceeding</hi> St. <hi>Albans</hi> in
every respect, and having a very good
Port capable of harbouring Ships of a
much greater burden than 200 Tuns,
stands about fifteen or sixteen <hi>English</hi>
Miles North of <hi>Corsoer.</hi> In the South
part of this Island, is also a place called
<hi>Nestwed,</hi> situated on a Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which extends it self much higher
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57496:60"/>
into the Country, (tho' our Author has
been pleased to allow none at all here)
from whence there is a considerable
Trade to <hi>Lubeck.</hi> And if from <hi>Kiog,</hi>
an inconsiderable place in comparison of
these places we have now mentioned,
but particularly remembered by this
Gentleman, when he forgot the rest,
there used formerly to go a few Fly-Boats
to <hi>Holland,</hi> there go more now
from thence to <hi>Norwegen</hi> with Malt. I
will not insist now upon some of less
Note, as <hi>Schelsoer</hi> and <hi>Warburg,</hi> tho'
the last of these has been famous in our
Age, because <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
in his first Expedition against <hi>Denmark,
Anno</hi> 1657. did set first footing there,
as he did afterwards in his second, <hi>Anno</hi>
1658. at <hi>Cursoer.</hi> When I consider
with my self, that this Gentleman has
not as much as made the least mention
of these before-mentioned places, and
how much this contradicts his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
he has set down of this Island of
<hi>Zealand,</hi> as also that not so much as any
places have been named by him, lying
beyond <hi>Elsinore, Cronenburgh &amp; King,</hi> the
most remote of which is within 20 <hi>English</hi>
Miles of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> it seems to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obvious, that both his <hi>own Knowledge</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57496:61"/>
and that of his <hi>Grave and Sensible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
did not reach much farther. And
what may confirm any body in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is, that he tells us a most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Story, <hi>of whole Herds of Stags,
Wild Boars and Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Bucks,</hi> (whom he
calls <hi>Sacred things) destroying the poor
Peasants Corn:</hi> when it is sufficiently
known, that there is scarce any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be found, where there is not
Provision made for preserving the Royal
Game against the rapaciousness of the
Peasants and other Vagabonds. And
tho' there is a considerable quantity of
Forests Royal, and Wild Beasts in this
Island, yet is an effectual care taken,
that they may not be destructive
to the Country; since not only every
Nobleman, (who possess almost all the
Lands not belonging to the King here)
have the Priviledge of Hunting and
Shooting in their own Lordships, or
Territories, but also the Court by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Hunting, kill a great number of
them, and the King keeps in every part
a certain number of Huntsmen, whose
Duty it is to preserve the Country from
receiving damage by these wild Beasts.</p>
            <p>But leaving the wild Beasts, we must
also see what he says concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57496:61"/>
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whose <hi>feeding</hi> (if
this Gentleman is to be believed) <hi>is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mean, and the Burgers and Citizens
sustain themselves with Rye Bread, Salt
Flesh, Stock Fish, Bacon, and very bad
Cheese.</hi> Here you see the Fare of the
<hi>Danes,</hi> and that of those who live in the
Cities, for the poor Peasants fare worse.
I am apt to think that this Gentleman
happened to light into some Black-Smiths
or other their like Mechanicks House in
<hi>Copenhagen,</hi> who (according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of these Northern Countries) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to find their Journey-Men
with Victuals at their Houses, where
they work, make use of such Dishes as
our Author has been pleased to mention
here. But if he had been acquainted in
Burgers or Citizens Houses of an higher
Degree, he would have met also with
another sort of Victuals. It is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
objected as a fault to the Northern
Nations, that they are too Liberal and
Hospitable in their Houses, and that
they mind Eating and Drinking more
than any thing else, that I wonder how
this Gentleman could think upon it,
except he takes a particular Pride to be
singular, and to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll us Miracles, which
were never seen or heard of before his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57496:62"/>
Arrival in <hi>Denmark.</hi> I may say it
without <hi>Vanity,</hi> that the Northern parts
are very well known to me, and perhaps
as well as to this Gentleman, and this I
can affirm for a truh, which may easily
be confirmed by hundreds in this Town,
that the abovesaid Objection of the
Author, is utterly contrary to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all understanding People;
since it has been always confessed by
them, that they rather exceed the true
bounds in this point. For nothing is
more common in those parts, than to see
the Table-Cloath laid thrice a day, and
at every Meal to have hot Victuals, at
Dinner especially you shall seldom find
them without two Dishes; among Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks
the most solid sort of Victuals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
such as are suitable to their Constitutions
and Labour are used, but the better
sort of Citizens generally deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not any thing that the Season
affords, and are extreamly addicted to
Varieties in their Diet. It is true, you
may seldom meet there with such large
Dishes of Meat at the Tables of the
better sort, as are customary here, but
they make that up in the Number; since
even in private Burgers Houses, they
seldom sit down at Dinner or Snpper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57496:62"/>
two Dishes, &amp; a Glass of Wine, which
generally they are furnish'd withall in
their own Houses, Taverns being not to
be found in so excessive anumber there,
as they are with us. When they invite
their Friends, their Tables are always
thrice fill'd up with variety of Victuals, &amp;
Wine is so plentiful among them, that if a
Man does not feel the effects of the Feast
the next day, he does not think himself
well Entertained the day before. I will not
undertake here to make an exact Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
betwixt our and their Markets,
since perhaps this Gentleman and his
Friends have taken more pains in sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
them, than ever I did; but this
is notorious enough, that in <hi>Denmark</hi>
the Beef is exceeding well tasted and
very fat, that Veal is proportionably
good, (tho' not so large as here) and
their Hogs-flesh to be compared to any
in the World, as also Lambs-flesh and
Mutton not to be despised, tho' the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be not so common among them.
Concerning their Poultry we will say
nothing in this place, because we shall
have occasion to speak something of
this hereafter, when we come to our
Author's Remarkable History of the
Green-Geese and other wild and tame
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57496:63"/>
Fowl. What he says concerning that
there are but two Seasons in <hi>Denmark,</hi>
may best be explained by comparing
the North Latitude of these Countries
with some of ours. The North Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
then of <hi>Denmark</hi> being betwixt
the Degrees of 54 and 58 lies parallel
to all that Tract in our Island, laying
betwixt the City of <hi>York</hi> and the further
end of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen</hi>
being situated under the 56
Degrees of Northern Latitude, which
is correspondent to that of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> we may from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
That the <hi>leaping from extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of heat to extremity of cold,</hi> is not
near so fearful as this Gentleman would
make us believe, or at least it is not so
in all parts of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The rest of
this Chapter is taken up with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> which being
the only place this Gentleman has
thought worthy of taking particular
notice of, yet is described by him so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,
that besides what he says of
the Port and its situation, scarce any
thing else has been mentioned of the
same. This Author having already

at his not so much as naming that of
<hi>Copenhagen;</hi> but since he seem'd so fond
in his <hi>Preface,</hi> of the Bodily Exercises
practised in the Antient <hi>Academies,</hi> one
might justly wonder why he has not
mentioned that set up a few years ago at
<hi>Copenhagen,</hi> which as it is greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by his present <hi>Danish</hi> Majesty,
in allowing considerable Sallaries and
Priviledges to the same; so all sorts of
Exercises, (besides Foreign Languages
and Mathematicks) are taught in great
Perfection. The <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Arsenal</hi>
he has just vouchsafed to name, when it is
confess'd by all that have taken a right
view of the last of these two, that it is one
of the finest to be met withall, and is
especially much celebrated for that most
wonderful <hi>Coelestial Globe,</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
six foot of Diameter, was once the
work of that so much renowned <hi>Danish</hi>
Astronomer, <hi>Tycho Brahe;</hi> I will only
say thus much concerning <hi>Copenhagen,</hi>
That as its Situation is one of the most
Commodious in <hi>Europe,</hi> as to the Sea-side;
so on the Land-side, it standing
upon a Flat, and containing near 9000
Houses, it is encompass'd with a pleasant
and delightful Country. The Streets
are broad, clean and neat, wherein are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57496:64"/>
Lights kept in the Night-time, and
what our Author says, <hi>That their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
being Cage-work, the intervals of
the Timber being fill'd up with Brick, and
therefore very mean,</hi> is frivolous; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obvious enough to any considering
Person, that in a Country where Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is very cheap, and consequently not
so sparingly used as here, the Houses so
built, are much exceeding for Beauty,
our antient way of Plaister-work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Timber, and even surpassing our
modern common way of Brick-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which are so much inferior to those
in the Northern parts for strength, that
they generally do not stand half so long,
tho' it cannot be denied, that ours for
Uniformity and Contrivance, excel
theirs. And before we leave this Island
of <hi>Zealand,</hi> I cannot but mention also
a place called <hi>Roshild,</hi> some Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> formerly an Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
See, the Bishops whereof had the
Honour of Crowning the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
and the <hi>Cathedral</hi> here is famous
for the Tombs of a great many <hi>Danish</hi>
Kings, some whereof are very Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Magnificent. And tho' it has
been Celebrated again in our Age, for
the Peace concluded there <hi>Anno</hi> 1658<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

betwixt the Two <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns;
and it also <hi>excels our Town of St.</hi> Albans:
yet the Author has not thought fit to
name it to us. And so I will have done
with this Island, when I have added
this, That besides a great many other
Towns not mentioned, it is computed
to contain near 350 Villages. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Chapter treating of the <hi>Sound,</hi>
but more especially of the Toll there at
<hi>Cronenburgh,</hi> whereof the Author has
given us a large History, we will pass by,
as having nothing much remarkable in it,
besides what is mentioned there: and
come to the Fourth Chapter, where he
treats of the other Islands, and <hi>Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Not to insist here upon some I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands,
which are left out by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
though they are more considerable
than some that he has mentioned, we
will take them in the same Order as he
has set them down in the Treatise; and
thus he speaks concerning <hi>Funen:</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
<hi>is Second to</hi> Zealand, <hi>whether its
bigness, or the goodness of its Soil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
It has plenty of Corn, Hogs,
Lakes, and Woods. The chief Town of it
is</hi> Odensee, <hi>a well-seated, and formerly a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
little City; but at present much fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
to decay. This Island produces nothing for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57496:65"/>
the Merchant to export, except some few
Horses, the Inhabitants generally consuming
their own Commodities,</hi> &amp;c. This is the
whole Description he has given us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Island; which being about
190 <hi>English</hi> Miles in Circumference, and
containing above 250 Villages, is situated
between <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Jutland;</hi> parted
from the first by the <hi>great Belt,</hi> and
from the latter by the <hi>little Belt:</hi> The
chief Town of it was formerly <hi>Odensee,
a flourishing little City,</hi> as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
says; but yet <hi>much better than St.</hi>
Albans; though <hi>Nyburgh</hi> seems now to
be the principal City in this Island:
which lying opposite to <hi>Corsoer</hi> in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
has a capacious and commodious
Port, able to harbour a great many
stout <hi>Ships,</hi> beyond the Burden of 200
Tuns; as have also likewife <hi>Swenburgh,
Kartemunde, Voburgh, Middelfare,</hi> and
other considerable Ports here; from
whence good store of Barley is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into <hi>Holland,</hi> and a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Oxen into other Parts: from
whence may appear the Vanity of this
Author's Assertion in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerning the <hi>Danish</hi> Ports, and
what he has been willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us here, That this Island <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces

what our Author has told us
concerning <hi>Jutland;</hi> which though it
be a Peninsula, yet he has began to treat
of it here in the same Chapter with the
Islands. But let us hear his Words:
Jutland, <hi>part of the ancient</hi> Cimbrica
Chersonesus, <hi>is the biggest part of the
Kingdom of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and may amount
to about Two Thirds of the whole. It is
divided into Four Stiffts-Ampts, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Governments. This is a plentiful
Country, abounding more especially in Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in great quantities. It affords Corn in

People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In short, it is the best Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

Ships of a much greater Burthen

of a very large Bay, called <hi>Limfort.</hi>
This Bay extends it self all along a great

within its compass a good large Island,
called <hi>Mors.</hi> The second District or

place whereof is of the same Name, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
on a small River, which runs
Northward into the above named Bay
of <hi>Limfort.</hi> It is an Episcopal See, and
though but an Inland place, the River
being scarce navigable; yet near as big
as <hi>Aalburg:</hi> South of this lies the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Aalhuis,</hi> likewise so named
from its principal City. This place is
situated to the South-East of <hi>Wiburg,</hi> a
few Miles above the lesser Belt on the
Sea-side, having as commodious a Port
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57496:68"/>
as <hi>Aalburg,</hi> and coming very near to it in
bigness. Opposite to this, <hi>viz.</hi> on the
West-side of the Peninsule near 60 <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Miles distant is <hi>Rinkoping,</hi> a most
famous Sea-port on the <hi>German</hi> Ocean.
This with some other convenient Ports
lying on the West-side of this Peninsule,
do contradict manifestly what this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
has been pleased to tell us in this
Chapter, that it <hi>wants good Sea-ports to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Ocean,</hi> as the above-mentioned
Cities do shew the Vanity of what he
pretended to perswade us in the second
Chapter, concerning the want of Sea-ports
in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that no place here
were <hi>better than our Town of St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</hi>
The fourth and last of these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Dioceses, is called <hi>Ripen,</hi> it is the
largest of these four; its Capital City
is called likewise <hi>Ripen,</hi> being an Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
See, situated on the West-side of the
Peninsule, near the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
defended by a well fortified Castle.
Among other Towns here is a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Fredericks Ode,</hi> deserves to be taken
particular notice of. This though well
fortified to the Land side, and provided
with Pallisado's near the Sea-side; yet
was surprized <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. by the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh</hi>
General <hi>Wrangel,</hi> who, with his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57496:68"/>
Men in the Night-time, beating down
the Pallisado's, and passing through the
Waters, took it by storm; where above
2000 were slain, and 2000 taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
besides Officers, and a great store
of Ammunition and Plunder. A few
Miles from this place is also a good Sea-port
called <hi>Colding,</hi> with a strongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Castle called <hi>Arnsburg,</hi> where is
paid the Toll for the Horses and Oxen,
which pass this way for <hi>Germany</hi> in great
Quantities; so that it is a manifest Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in our Author, when he says, that
only <hi>lean Cows and Oxen are transported</hi>
from this Peninsule to <hi>Holland;</hi> since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these a prodigious Number of fat
Oxen, very good Horses, and the best
Hogs are sent from hence by Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Germany,</hi> and a considerable Quantity
of Corn and Fish, is from the above-mentioned
Ports transported into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and other adjacent Countries.</p>
            <p>The reason this Gentleman has been
pleased to give, why <hi>Jutland</hi> appears least
declining, <hi>because most remote from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi>
as it favours a little of Malice, so
it may perhaps take with some inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Persons. But to the more judicious
it will be evident enough; that, if this
point of its appearing least declining
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57496:69"/>
should be granted; which however it is
not, since near <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> the Country
appears in as good a Condition as here;
yet the difference arises chiefly from
thence, what our Author had said a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before, That <hi>this is a plentiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
abounding more especially with Cattle;</hi>
to which I will add, that it has also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Ports, and abounds with more
Commodities for Exportation. And
that this is the true Cause of its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
least declining, may be gathered
out of the Authors own Words in this
very Chapter; where he says, <hi>The Land
is more fertile near the Seac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oasts, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
being full of Heaths, Lakes and Woods:</hi>
and truly in these places, <hi>Jutland</hi> makes
no better appearance than <hi>Zealand.</hi> I
could also assign this for one reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, that the Peasants in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
here, being not Vassals to the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
as they are in <hi>Zealand,</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
much to this Appearance; but as
the first is most evident, so I think it
may convince all unbyass'd and judicious
Persons, how impartial this Gentleman
has been in his pretended Account of
<hi>Denmark.</hi> In the V. Chapter, which
he entitles, <hi>Of the rest of the King of</hi>
Denmark's <hi>Territories;</hi> he begins with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57496:69"/>
the Dútchy of <hi>Sleswick</hi> thus: <hi>The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of</hi> Sleswick <hi>is in general a very good
Country; Its convenient Situations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Seas, the Ocean and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
rendring it considerable for Trade;
although the natural Commodities fit for
Exportation, are in no great Quantity.
Some Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Cattle, Horses and Wood for
firing, it affords to its Neighbours, over
and above a sufficient store of each for its
own Inhabitants. It is divided between
the King and the Duke of</hi> Holstein. <hi>The
principal Town, which gives name to the
Dutchy, belongs to the Duke of</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein,
<hi>who resides near it in his Pallace of</hi>
Gottorp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is all that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
has thought fit to afford us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Dutchy of <hi>Sleswick;</hi> which
being the South-part of <hi>Jutland,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
a large and fruitful Tract of
ground, adorned with a great many
fair Cities, and commodious Sea ports;
whereas he hath taken up more with the
Description of the Resident place of the
Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp;</hi> which as it
does not belong to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s
Dominions; so it is much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
(though else a very fine Seat) to
some of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s, which
either are not mentioned at all by the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57496:70"/>
Author, or else represented much less
advantageous. It must needs be a great
Wonder to any Body that knows these
Countries, how he should make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
to describe the Residence of
the Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to remember here a goodly Town,
called <hi>Hadersleben,</hi> situated in the same
Dukedom near the Baltick, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the fair Castle of <hi>Hansburg,</hi>
begun to be built by <hi>John</hi> the Eldest Son
of <hi>Christiern</hi> I, and finished by <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
II. this present King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s
great Grandfather. Not to mention here
<hi>Apenrade</hi> and <hi>Tondern;</hi> the first whereof
lies on the Baltick, as the Second is situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
near the <hi>German</hi> Ocean; certainly
the Town of <hi>Flensbourgh</hi> with its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
might have deserved to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
as well as <hi>Gottorp,</hi> except he was
afraid of contradicting what he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concerning the want of Harbours
in <hi>Denmark,</hi> which were capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
a <hi>Ship of</hi> 200 <hi>Tuns;</hi> it being
notorious that this place situated on a
Bay of the Baltick Sea, called <hi>Hever</hi>
Bay, has so deep and commodious a
Port, that it not only receives Ships of a
far greater Burthen; but also the same
lye up close to the Houses almost every
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57496:70"/>
where, as they do at <hi>Wapping,</hi> and other
adjacent parts of the <hi>Thames.</hi> It would,
I think, not have been amiss to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
here, that Tract of Ground,
which lying betwixt <hi>Sleswick</hi> and <hi>Flens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
goes to this Day by the Name of
<hi>Anglen;</hi> and the Inhabitants of it are
called <hi>Engel Saxen;</hi> who being esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Remnants of one of those three
Nations, that setled here, this Kingdom
has particularly derived its Name from
them. The River <hi>Eyder</hi> also, which
divides the Dukedoms of <hi>Sleswick,</hi> and
<hi>Holstein,</hi> ought not to have been forgot,
since it was the ancient Boundary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> And since
this Gentleman is so strangely taken in the
next Chapter with the ancient <hi>Goths,</hi> I
cannot devise why he should not have
remembred a piece of Work of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
extant in this Country, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
resembling that ancient <hi>Roman</hi>
Work in our Island, called <hi>Picts-wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a long Trench and Wall which
was built about the Year 809, in the
Times of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, by <hi>Gotricus,</hi> then King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
to hinder the Incursions of the
<hi>Saxons.</hi> The Tract of this Work is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be seen yet in a great many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57496:71"/>
within a few Miles South of <hi>Sleswick,</hi>
and is by the Inhabitants called <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi>
to this Day, and reported, that it
did reach from the one Sea to the other.
These matters, as also a great many others,
having a near relation to our ancient times,
the Author did either think not worth
mentioning; or else those <hi>grave</hi> Men who
instructed him, were not so <hi>sensible</hi> as he
describes them in his first Chapter. But
it is time also to see what he says con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Holstein,</hi> these are among others
his Words. <hi>The Country,</hi> (meaning
Holstein) <hi>is very fruitful and pleasant,
excellently well seated for Trade, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Seas, and having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Neighbourhood of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
Elbe, <hi>and of</hi> Hamburgh, &amp;c. Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
<hi>and</hi> Ditmarsh, he says, <hi>lie the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to the River</hi> Elbe, <hi>and are for the
most part low and rich Countries; the soil
being fat, and in many places resembling</hi>
Holland, <hi>as well in its fertility, as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of improvement,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is all the Account the Author
gives us of <hi>Holstein,</hi> (besides what he says
of its being divided into several Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
which Country, considering the
ancientness and number of its Nobility,
the variety and fertility of Ground, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57496:71"/>
and consequence of its Cities and
Towns, would have deserved also a more
particular Description: But since he has
told us in the First Chapter, That he did
include <hi>in this Account the Dutchy of</hi> Sles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
<hi>as part of</hi> Denmark, <hi>but not the
Dutchy of</hi> Holstein; <hi>because the former
was a F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ef of that Crown, the latter of
the Empire;</hi> and our Remarks being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by the Account he has given of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> we will only add, That
<hi>Holstein</hi> being divided into Four Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Parts, <hi>viz. Ditmarsen, Holstein,</hi>
properly so called, <hi>Stormar,</hi> and <hi>Wage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi>
the Author has not mentioned the
last of all, though that famous City of
<hi>Lubeck</hi> lies in the same, as that of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
is situated in <hi>Stormaren;</hi> each of
which would deserve a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
if the Nature and Bounds of
these Remarks would permit us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it.</p>
            <p>What he has said concerning the
Country of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> is not much to
be said to, only to remember, that it
is not only that sort of <hi>Cream-coloured.
Coach-Horses</hi> he speaks of, that abound
there; but that there is also in that
Country so excellent a breed of all sorts
of Horses, introduced some Years ago
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57496:72"/>
by <hi>Anthony Gunter,</hi> the last Count of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
that I much question, whether
the like, both in number and quality<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
can be found in <hi>Europe</hi> in so small a spot
of Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning</hi> Norway, <hi>the Author having
given a pretty regular account, we will
say no more of it, but that it is not</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of Corn; <hi>since</hi> Tellemarch, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march,
<hi>and</hi> Gouldbrands Daal, <hi>afford
considerable Quantities of Corn. The like
is also to be found about</hi> Druntheim; <hi>and
when I have once more put him in mind
that the City of</hi> Bergen <hi>in</hi> Norway <hi>is one
of those</hi> which are much better than our
Town of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and is capable of
harbouring Ships of a much greater Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
than <hi>200</hi> Tuns: <hi>I will take my
leave of him as far as he describes the
Territories of</hi> Denmark; <hi>and go on to the
following Chapters, where he treats of
the Form of Government, and other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Yet, before I conclude, I cannot
but mention here, that as, out of what
has been said in these Remarks upon
the foregoing Chapters, it is evident<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that</hi> Denmark <hi>is generally a fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
abounding in Corn, and pasture
grounds for the feeding of Oxen, and
Horses, of both which kind prodigious
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57496:72"/>
quantities are sent yearly into</hi> Germany
<hi>and other parts; that their Forrests and
Woods feed innumerable Herds of
Swine of the best kind, so I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admire with what confidence
this Gentleman can conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with these words; producing (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nmark <hi>in general) but few
Commodities for the Merchant. But
it is time to supersede to say any thing
farther of this point, and to see what
he says in the VI. Chapter, concerning
their Form of Government, his words are
these,</hi> The Antient Form of Government
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere, was the same which the <hi>Goths</hi> and
<hi>Vandals</hi> Established in most, if not all
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> whither they carried
their Conquests, and which in <hi>England</hi> is
retained to this day for the most part. 'Tis
said of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that those Provinces
which they Conquered, were amply recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
for the loss of their Liberty, by being
duced from their Barbarity to Civility;
by the introduction of Arts, Learning,
Commerce &amp; Politness. I know not whether
this way of arguing have not more of
Pomp than Truth in it; but with much
greater reason may it be said, that all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
was beholding to these People for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
or restoring a Constitution of
Government far excelling all others, that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57496:73"/>
we know of in the World. 'Tis to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Inhabitants of these Countries, with
other Neighbouring Provinces, that we owe
the original of Parliaments, formerly so
common, but lost within this last Age, in
all Kingdoms, but those of <hi>Poland, Great
Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland. And in the</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<hi>he speaks to the same purpose;
which we will consider in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it explains what he has said just
now. These are his words,</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi>
was in a manner a free Country till very
lately, in so much that the <hi>Europeans</hi> were,
and still are distinguished in the <hi>Eastern</hi>
parts of the World, by the name of <hi>Franks</hi>
In the beginning small Territories or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations

well and faithfully) were the Originals
of all our Kings and Princes, which at first,
and for a long time, were every where
Elective. According to their own War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
temper, or that of the People which
they Governed, they (upon the score of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
Ambition, or being overthrowing
with multitudes at home) encroached upon
their Neighbours, till from petty Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
their Countries waxed to mighty
Kingdoms. <hi>Spain</hi> alone consisting of twelve
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57496:73"/>
or thirteen till 'tother day, and one part of
our Island of no less than seven: Each of
these was at first, made through an Union
of many petty Lordships. <hi>Italy</hi> from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
small Commonwealths was at length
swallowed up by the Emperors, Popes,
Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> and
other lesser Tyrants. Yet 'tis to be remarked,
that the Antient States of <hi>Europe</hi> is best
preserved in <hi>Italy,</hi> even to this day, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Encroachments which
have been there made on the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
of which one reason may be, that
the Republicks which are more in Number
and Quality in that spot of ground, than
in all <hi>Europe</hi> besides, keep their Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
within their due bounds, and make
use of that Natural Wit which Providence
and a happy Climate has given them, to
curb those, who if they had Power, would
curb all the World. Every one ought to
know how great the Rights of the People
were very lately in the Elective Kingdoms
of <hi>Sweeden</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> how <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
was freer than any other part of <hi>Europe,</hi>
till at length 'twas Lorded by Captains
which in process of time grew Princes and
Electors, and by Bishops with Temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
who may thank <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi>
(a bigotted Prince) for the double Sword of

            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:57496:74"/>In this Passage, the Author pretends
to give us an Account of the Origine,
Growth, and Alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he pretends give us a short Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Germans,
Spaniards, Italians;</hi> nay, even <hi>English,
Sweeds, Danes</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> and all this
in a few Pages, which great Authors
before in whole Volumes, have scarce
been able to effect to the purpose: But
that which is most pleasant, is, that he
having entangled himself among his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and their most
admirable Constitutions, has not given
himself leisure to look rightly into our

When I did read these words to
some Gentlemen, who had Travelled in
those as well as other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
were come to pass a little time in the
Country, they did cry out aloud, <hi>risum
teneatis amici;</hi> and I remember that a
certain <hi>Myn Heer,</hi> who seem'd to be
well vers'd in those Countries, could
not forbear saying, according to his
Native blunt way, That surely this
Gentleman must not have seen much
of <hi>Europe,</hi> or else have slept by day,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57496:74"/>
and never Travell'd but by night; since
if he had but walk'd through the streets
of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the day time, and
considered with what vast Charges that
City had been built, the stupendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and vastness of its Fortifications,
which together with a large Mote all
Brick'd round, comprehended above
1000 Acres of Ground, the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Regularity of the Houses and
Garden; in and about that City; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that prodigious number of Shipping
of all sorts, which was obvious enough
to every Body's Eye, he might from
thence have taken an occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
better into the Power and Wealth
of this Commonwealth, before he had
made this Assertion concerning his <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Republicks. He ought, said the
<hi>Amsterdamer</hi> (for so I understood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he was) have cast his Eyes upon
the two <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
whereof one is far exceeding, not only
those at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> but also all
the rest in <hi>Europe;</hi> he ought to have
look'd upon that famous <hi>Stadthuyse</hi> there,
with the large Magazin of Arms by
it; upon those most excellent Statues a
top of it, especially that of <hi>Atlas</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his Shoulders the Globe which
holds 30 Barrels of Water: He ought
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57496:75"/>
to have view'd the extraordinariness of
the Globes Coelestial and Terrestial, laid
in the Floor of the Great Hall, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the rest of the Rarities of
Pictures, Carved Works and Marble
Statues there: He ought to have made
an exact Observation concerning the
great Number and Splendor of their
Alms Houses in this City, which being
like Princes Palaces, maintain 20000
Poor <hi>per diem;</hi> as also the Multitude,
Largeness, and Magnificense of their
Bridges and Channels, which are to be
found in every street, and fac'd every
where with Brick and Square Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
and other innumerable advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which this City enjoys, and are all
acquired with vast Charges and great
Industry; and then he would easily
have been able to find out, that if <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>

and Bridges which unite their
City; if <hi>Genova</hi> is proud of her Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Buildings, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> surpasses
the first, and is not behind hand with
the latter in either kind; But, said he,
if this Author have made a due enquiry
and have been instructed, that <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
is the Magazeen of <hi>Europe</hi> for Corn
and Spices, the latter of which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
formerly brought by Land through
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57496:75"/>
               <hi>AEgypt,</hi> that it has a inconceivable store
of all manner of Provisions for War,
and more store of saw'd and prepar'd
Timber for Shipping, than can be found
in any one Nation besides in the World;
how it has the vastest Magazeens of
Marbles whereof <hi>Versails</hi> it self has been
built; how it is the Emperor's Staple of
Quick-silver, and that from hence, not
only <hi>Spain,</hi> but also almost whole <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
and the <hi>Indias</hi> are furnished; if he
had been duly informed, what vast
quantities of Wines, Brandies, Hemp,
Pitch and Tar are to be found here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the prodigious Stores for Shipping
which are laid up in the Admiralty and
<hi>East-India</hi> Houses, and are almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
to be related; how great a
share <hi>Amsterdam</hi> bears in the Charges
of such a War as the United Provinces
now wage with the rest of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates
against <hi>France;</hi> and how at last
the Bank of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> is the most
considerable in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the World,
and so much surpassing both these of
<hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> (the only two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
now in <hi>Italy,</hi> worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning)
that these of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> writes
more in one day, than these of <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Genoua</hi> together do in two: He
might from thence have easily been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57496:76"/>
concerning the Vanity of his
Supposition. The whole Company cou'd
not forbear smiling at the eagerness,
wherein this Gentleman had represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the advantages of his Native place,
when it was objected to him by one, who
particularly well seem'd to understand
the <hi>Italian</hi> Commonwealths: That it
was scarce to be deny'd, but that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi>
alone, for Wealth and Trade, did
surpass all the Commonwealths in <hi>Italy,</hi>
yet that he had not consider'd what large
Possessions the <hi>Venetians</hi> had on the <hi>Terra
firma,</hi> and in the <hi>Morea,</hi> besides what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them in <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
and what a considerable Tract of Ground
were in the Possession of the <hi>Genueses,</hi> all
along the Sea side about that City, to all
which <hi>Amsterdam</hi> could not pretend to,
as having very small Territories belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it. The <hi>Amsterdammer</hi> was a little
startled at this unexpected Objection, but
quickly recollecting himself, he answer'd,
That the Wealth of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> was such
as to be able to purchase the Territories
of all the <hi>Italian</hi> Commonwealths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
And said he, since this may seem a
hard saying in the Opinion of some, who
have not been so inquisitive in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I will shew you another Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
within the Commonwealth of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57496:76"/>
the United Provinces, and whose chief
strength is lodged within the City of
<hi>Amsterdam,</hi> which easily may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to exceed all the Commonwealths
of <hi>Italy</hi> together, in Trade, Strength,
and extent of its Territories, and this is
the <hi>East India</hi> Company in <hi>Holland.</hi>
This is easie to be believed by these who
will consider, said he, what vast and
rich Possessions this Company has in
the Island of <hi>Java,</hi> where in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City called <hi>Batava,</hi> Built and
Fortified after the manner of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
the General of the <hi>Indies</hi> lives
like a Prince attended with his Horse
and Foot-Guards, and assisted by his
Councellors; what a vast Trade it has
in <hi>Japan, China,</hi> the <hi>Isles</hi> of <hi>Sumatra</hi>
and <hi>Bengala,</hi> in the two latter of which
the Company has also here Lodges and
vast Store-Houses, as he has likewise on
the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and <hi>Cormandel,</hi>
and in the Countries of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>
and King of <hi>Galcanda.</hi> How in the
<hi>Molucca</hi> and <hi>Banda Islands</hi> she is almost
become Master of all, as in the rich
Island of <hi>Zealon,</hi> she has all the plain
Country under her Jurisdiction, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged the Emperor to live in the
<hi>Mountains,</hi> while she is possessed of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomba</hi>
and other Garisons there. These
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57496:77"/>
places being maintained by 30000 Men
and 200 great Ships, whereof 50 are
Capital ones, which are in constant
Pay of the Commonwealths, of the
<hi>East Indias</hi> and Transport yearly such
prodigious Riches from those parts into
the six Chambers of <hi>Amsterdam, Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Delph, Roterdam, Horne,</hi> and
<hi>Enckhuysen,</hi> from whence they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
again through whole <hi>Europe;</hi>
I will, said the Gentleman, leave it to the
Judgment of Understanding Men in this
matter, whether all the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
of <hi>Italy</hi> put together, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any thing like it. All the Company
was much delighted to hear with what
dexterity this Gentleman pleaded the
Cause of his Native Country, unto
whom I replied, That since it was obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough that the Strength and
Power of all the Republicks that are
now adays in <hi>Italy,</hi> was in no ways to
be compared with <hi>Holland;</hi> I could
not but be of Opinion, that what our
Author had said concerning the <hi>Quality</hi>
of these Republicks, was meant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Policy, and, when the
<hi>Amsterdammer,</hi> interrupting me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That, tho' he saw me willing
to help, as the saying was, <hi>A lame Dog
over the Stile,</hi> yet if I would but look
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57496:77"/>
upon the Author's passage where the
words, <hi>more in Number and Quality</hi> were
joyned together, I might easily find what
his meaning were, and that one was as
extravagant as the other. For, said he,
what is more evident to any judicious
Traveller, than the great difference
there is betwixt the number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks
in <hi>Italy</hi> and betwixt the rest of
<hi>Europe.</hi> Not to speak of the seven
United Provinces, which are each of
them a separate Commonwealth, but
joyned by a mutual Confederacy; are
not the <hi>Switz Cantons</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
sufficiently known to out-number
all the Republicks in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
to possess great Territories? What Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
can be so ignorant as not to have
heard or seen, that considerable number
of Commonwealths, which are remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this day in <hi>Germany</hi> only, is <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
Genoua, Lucca,</hi> and one or two
more not worth mentioning, equal in
number to all these. And if we should
add that <hi>Bologna</hi> which retains somle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its Antient Freedom under the
Jurisdiction of the Pope; and that of
<hi>Vinzenza</hi> under the Government of the
<hi>Venetians;</hi> nay, even the three small
Leagues of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> laying on the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> all these will not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57496:78"/>
amount to the number alone of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
now in being in <hi>Germany.</hi>
This may be easily computed if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
but the chiefest of them; as <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
Bremen, Lubeck, Embden, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
on the <hi>Mayn, Cologne, Worms, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon,
Augsburgh, Eger, Nurenburg, Ulm,
Oppenheimb, Nordlinger,</hi> and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the two Circles of <hi>Suabia,</hi>
and <hi>Franconia,</hi> besides others; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that <hi>Hamborough Nurenburg,
Collen, Frankford</hi> and <hi>Bremen,</hi> come very
near in bigness even to the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
in <hi>Italy;</hi> that the Bank of
<hi>Hamborough</hi> comes next to those of <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Genoua,</hi> and surpasses either of
them in Trade and Shipping; that <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
and others come very to them in
Trade now; and what great Territorie
some of them possess; it is evident enough
that if our Author, instead of <hi>Europe,</hi>
had but said <hi>Germany,</hi> yet it would have
been taken for a <hi>Rodomontado</hi> by all
Travellers, especially those who have
made a due comparison betwixt the
Frontier Places and Garisons of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> and the vast Fortifications and
considerable Forces. which are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by these abovementioned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at last, said the <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57496:78"/>
I should be willing, according to
your opinion, to apply the Author's word
<hi>Quality</hi> to the Policy of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
of <hi>Italy,</hi> in comparison of all the
rest in <hi>Europe,</hi> who is so ignorant, as not
to know that a great many of them enjoy
a much greater share of Liberty (as being
democratical) than any of his <hi>Italian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks;
and tho' some of the <hi>Swiz</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
have modell'd their Government
some what according to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> yet
some in <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; especially the Seven
United Provinces, tho' Aristocratical do
enjoy a so much higher Degree of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before the <hi>Venetian</hi> Subjects, generally
speaking, that if in those parts the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
should be a Vassal to his Baron or
Lord, the Gentlemen should be squeez'd
continually, and oppress'd by one <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desta</hi>
or another; and in general, the
Nobility again in constant fear of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
they would not like to change
theirs with the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and I believe
that all our Author's Rhetorick would
not be sufficient to perswade them; but
that their new way of living free were
much to be preferred before his antient
<hi>Gothick</hi> way of Governing. But it is
time to break off this Dialogue, and to
consider what our Author further says
concerning the antient <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:57496:79"/>
whom he makes the Fundators of that
sort of Government in <hi>Europe,</hi> as is now,
for the most part retained in <hi>England,</hi>
and says, <hi>That we owe the Originals of
Parliaments</hi> to them. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Assertion have not more pomp
than truth in it, (to make use of his
own words, which he has given us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Romans</hi>) since, if we look
rightly into the Matter, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these Nations when they at first
extended their Conquests over <hi>Spain,
Africa</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as the <hi>Franks</hi> did over
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> over <hi>England,</hi>
being wholly adapted to Military Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes;
there was, it's true, commonly
a General chosen by the Army, and the
Heads of the same were admitted to all
Debates; yet was it in no ways to be
compared with what of latter years has
been called a Parliament, If we peruse
what the antient Authors have left us
concerning their way of Government at
home we may conjecture what it was
abroad. Considering then the most antient
way or custom of these People (which
were <hi>Germans</hi>) It is manifest enough,
That they were divided in a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Commonwealths, whereof each
had one whom they called sometimes a
King, sometimes a Duke; These being
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57496:79"/>
again subdivided in Petty

And that some of these Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
retain'd their Liberty and
Constitutions about 150 Years after
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s time; <hi>Tacitus</hi> has left as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Observation concerning some of
them, that lived near the <hi>Rhine.</hi> It
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57496:83"/>
would be too tedious to relate all that
the Ancients have left behind them in
their Monuments concerning this
Point; out of what has been said, I
think, it may easily be seen, that, as the
Constitution of Government among
the ancient <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
composed out of their Kings, the
Nobility and principal Men of the
Cities,) did come a great deal nearer to
the Parliamentary way of consulting
in latter Times, than the irregular
Proceedings of the <hi>Germans</hi> in those
times; So those that will throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
the ancient Histories, will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
convinc'd, that the same Form
of Government was never extinguish'd
in all parts of those Kingdoms, but
preserved even till the time, when the
<hi>Goths, Vandals, Suevians, Franks,</hi> and
others, setled themselves in those parts;
So that it may be said, that we owe
the first Rudiments of Governing by
consent of the Estates to those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
which were Conquered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the <hi>Germans,</hi> but that the same
should have been establish'd by them,
when they were so many hundred
Years before in use there, is, what
scarce any body, who is not prepossessed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57496:84"/>
with the conceit of a <hi>Gothick</hi> and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
sort of Goverment, will assert.
And here, if we should enquire into
the Originals of Princes and Kings,
(which our Author pretends to have
done in a few Lines) at several Times
and Places, we should be obliged to
go much beyond the design of these
Remarks, since to understanding Men
it is apparent enough, that if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
whole Book, had been employed
upon that Point only, it would not
have been sufficient so much as to
touch the chief Heads of so ample a
Subject. I will only say, that I cannot
sufficiently admire, why this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is so mightily taken with these
Times, when <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were
divided, the first into thirteen, and the
latter into seven or more peculiar Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
considering that they were
perhaps the worst of Times ever these
Countries saw; neither could any last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peace be setled, till instead of the
same, one Head had the Management
of the whole Body. But before we
leave this Subject, we must say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Sweden:
For every one ought to know, says he,
how great the Rights of the People were
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57496:84"/>
very lately in the Elective Kingdoms of</hi>
Sweden <hi>and</hi> Denmark: If every one
ought to know, he might have said a
little more of it, since else few will
know it for him. What clear a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Gentleman has concerning Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Kingdoms, will better appear
hereafter, when we shall have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to treat upon the Question, <hi>Whither
the Kingdom of</hi> Denmark <hi>has been He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
or Elective;</hi> But as for the
Rights of the People in <hi>Sweden,</hi> why
they should so much vary from the
same, that they were lately, he would
have done well to have explained a
little. I am not ignorant, that the
Wings of the Nobility, that composed
formerly the Senate there, have been
considerably clipt, and that about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or sixteen Years ago, when that
Kingdom during the Minority of this
present King, was partly through
Mismanagement, partly through the
War with the Empire and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
miserably exhausted; the Estates
then, finding themselves not in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to restore matters without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Subsidies, which could
not easily be levied upon the Subjects,
did then advise the King, to oblige
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57496:85"/>
such of his Subjects as had by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness
of some of his Predecessors, or
other means, acquired to themselves
vast Estates and other Advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crown, to restore the
same, which was executed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
some of the chiefest profering the
same voluntarily, the rest being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to follow their Example. As by
these means the King was enabled to
restore the decayed State of the Militia
and Army; so it is not to be denied,
but that his Revenues were greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
as well as his Power; yet is
from hence not necessarily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the Rights of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are lost, since the four Estates of
the Nobility, Clergy, Citizens and
Peasants, have thereby not surrendred
any thing of their Native Rights, tho
perhaps some particular Persons have
felt the smart of it. <hi>Germany was freer
than any other part of Europe,</hi> says our
Author, but he ought to have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that this was in those days when
every body being his own Master,
there, they liv'd more like the <hi>Tartars</hi>
do now, than like any of the rest of
the <hi>Europeans;</hi> And if they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in that so much admired State of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57496:85"/>
Liberty, I am apt to believe <hi>Germany</hi>
would not have come into that flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Condition it has been in since. If
it was for my purpose here to enlarge
me self upon this matter, I could shew
easie enough, that these, whom our
Author calls <hi>Captains, Princes, Electors,
Bishops, &amp;c.</hi> were the first Restorers
of the Liberty of <hi>Germany;</hi> that they
were the Founders of its Greatness, and
Upholders of the same after this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was Conquered by <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great. I could shew him, that there
were the Bishops in <hi>Germany</hi> before the
times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and that
those instituted by him, for all their
double Sword of Flesh and Spirit, have
not been armed sufficiently so to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the <hi>Germans,</hi> but that in the most
parts the ancient Liberty has been
preserv'd under their Jurisdiction, and
some have been able to find ways to
free themselves quite from it. And
thus much I will only say in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; As he has
laid the Foundation of what <hi>Germany</hi>
is now (whom our Author makes
bold to call bigotted) that as able
Headpieces as this Gentleman, and
these some what better versed in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57496:86"/>
               <hi>German</hi> Constitutions than he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, have so greatly approved of
the Methods that that Great Emperor
took in uniting so vast a Country both
in Laws and Religion, that his vain
and confident Assertions will prove ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to all, who have had any true
insight into the Affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi> I
must add something more concerning
<hi>Poland,</hi> which he says, <hi>is the only King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
besides this Island and</hi> Ireland, <hi>where
Parliaments are not lost,</hi> to shew what
sort of Parliament is to be found there,
that so every body may be able to judge
how far the <hi>Polish</hi> Parliaments do differ
from the <hi>English,</hi> both in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and fundamental Constitutions.
It is therefore to be known, that there
are but two sorts of People (besides the
King) in <hi>Poland,</hi> that can justly be
said to have a Share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility;</hi>
The Citizens and Peasants being totally
excluded from the same, and being
for the most part subjected either to
the Clergy or the Nobility, the fewest
to the King. And though the Cities
in the Regal <hi>Prussia</hi> enjoy a greater
share of Freedom, as having their own
Constitutions, and sending their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57496:86"/>
to the Dyet; yet is their Number
so inconsiderable, in comparison of the
rest, that it scarce comes into Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
The King's chief Advantage
is, That he has a considerable Revenue
allow'd him, and has the choosing of
all the Officers, both Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;
but the Great Officers, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those who by their Places are
Members of the Senate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as also all the Senators, have
their Offices granted them <hi>ad Vitam;</hi>
so that when once put in Possession of
the same, they have not any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
further from the King. The
two Archbishops, and other Bishops,
as they owe their Promotion chiefly to
the Pope, (though they are nominated
by the King) and are exempted from
the King's Jurisdiction; so they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vast Possessions, which depend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from them, have therefore a great,
if not the greatest Sway in the Senate
of the Kingdom. But both the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Lords, as also the rest of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
who compose the Senate, having
the Places of the best Profit in their
Possession, and maintaining in their
Palaces a great many of the poorer
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57496:87"/>
sort of Nobility, become thereby so
powerful, that it may justly be said,
that these are the chief Governours of
the Realm, since the King cannot do
any Publick Matter of Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, as being by their Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his constant Advisers and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
the Deputies of the Provinces
(who are chosen by the Nobility)
being only called together when Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the highest Moment are to be
consulted, or concluded. These were,
in former Times, never to meet, but
in case of agreeing to a new Tax, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
before-hand in the Senate; but
within these Hundred Years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
their Power is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
that they claim a Right to be
consulted with in all Publick Matters
of great Moment.</p>
            <p>The Senate of the Kingdom, which
is the constant Council of the King,
the Members whereof, as I have said,
are constituted by the King <hi>ad Vitam,</hi>
consists first of the two Archbishops of
the Kingdom, of whom the Archbishop
of <hi>Guiesen</hi> is Primate of <hi>Poland,</hi> having
the Power of Administring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Absence or in case of the
Death of the King: After these are the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57496:87"/>
Bishops, and some Abbots, Thirty
Four Governours of Provinces called
Palatines, Eighty Three Governours
of Castles, or Deputy-Lieutenants of
the Palatines called Castellans, and
Ten of the Great Officers of State, who
are in all computed to amount to near
an Hundred and Fifty in Number.
And are always chosen out of
the Nobility; The Clergy among
these, though the least in Number,
yet having more Possessions than both
the King and Nobility, and in no ways
depending on them, has the greatest
Sway; and the two Chancellors and
Vicechancellors also a great Power of
Signing and Dispatching Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King's consent, and refusing also
his Orders, if they do not think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to obey them, Three of these Four
being generally Ecclesiasticks. When
with their Advice, the King has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to call together the Dyet, he
orders a Convention of all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be had in every particular Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese
or Government, at a certain Time
and customary Place; where being
convened, the Palatine, Castellans,
and other Senators, having explained
to them the Reasons why the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57496:88"/>
to call a Dyet, and what Time
the same was to be held, the Nobility
of each Diocese, after Prayers finish'd,
choose their Deputies; to whom they
give Instructions concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
made to them by the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
though sometimes they also allow
them a larger Authority, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
expires with one and the same
Dyet, which is not to last above Six
Weeks, and seldom continued much
longer. These particular Conventions
being over, there are two more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
to be held, which they call
General Conventions, one whereof is
always in <hi>Great Poland,</hi> the other in
<hi>Little Poland;</hi> in which two Places,
all the Deputies, and such of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
as are pleased to come, being
again Convened at a certain Time, they
there confer together concerning the
Propositions made by the King, and
what Instructions they have received
thereupon from their several Provinces.
Thus prepared they come to the Dyet,
where the Senate being seated in a
Theatre, the Deputies and Clerks
standing by, the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor
proposes in the Name of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57496:88"/>
the King such Matters as they are to
consult upon. This done, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
and Bishops, and so all the rest
of the Senate, having given their Votes,
the Deputies ask Leave from the King
to withdraw, and to consult concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Propositions made to them.
Their Consultation being over, they
repair again to the Senate; and having
given their Opinion concerning the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in Agitation, they also propose
such Matters as they think fit to be
consulted about: Which Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreed unto by common Consent
of the Senate and Deputies, the King
gives his Consent last of all; which
done, it has the Force of a Decree of
the Dyet. But if one of the Deputies
makes his Protestation against any
Thing, as done in Prejudice of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Prerogatives of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or the Constitutions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the whole Proceeding becomes
thereby void, and of no Force.</p>
            <p>From hence may be collected, what
Difference there is betwixt the Dyets
in <hi>Poland</hi> and our Meeting of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well in their Fundamental
Constitutions, as Manner of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57496:89"/>
And if we consider how all the
Cities and Commons in <hi>Poland</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the City of <hi>Cracaw,</hi> and a few
more in <hi>Prussia</hi>) are excluded not only
from the Dyet, but also all Places of
Note, nay that even in the most of
them the Magistracy and whole Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
are depending on either
the Clergy or Nobility; and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Prerogatives<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to themselves; as by Example,
That a Noble-man Killing a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
shall pay but a small Fine; but
if a Commoner Kills a Noble-man, it
shall be Capital: That a Malefactor
being a Noble-man, and taken in the
Fact, shall not be judged by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of that City or Corporation
where he is taken: That the Bishops,
as well as other Noble-men, have their
Strong Castles, Garrison'd by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and a great many the like, of
dangerous Consequence: These, I say,
duely considered by an <hi>English-man,</hi>
will, I am apt to believe, put him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much out of Conceit of <hi>Polish</hi>
Parliaments; and both the King, as
also the Cities, Corporations, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>England,</hi> will have but little
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57496:89"/>
Reason to thank this Gentleman for
his comparing the same with ours;
especially since he might have found
out other Countries, and that nearer
at hand, where the Meeting of the
Estates come a great deal nearer to our
Parliaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But leaving to our Author the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of his Ancient</hi> Gothick <hi>and
New</hi> Polish <hi>Parliaments, we must go
on, to see what he says in this same
Chapter concerning the Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in</hi> Denmark <hi>in particular.
These are his Words: Denmark</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was, till within these Thirty Two
Years, govern'd by a King chosen by the
People of all sorts, (even the <hi>Boors</hi> had
their Voices;) which King <hi>Waldemar
the Third</hi> acknowledged in that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Answer of his to the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi>
who pretended to a great Power over him:
<hi>Naturam habemus à Deo, regnum à sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis,
Divitias à parentibus, Religionem
à Romana Ecclesia; quam si nobis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides,
renuntiamus per praesentes.</hi> The
Estates of the Realm being convened to
that Intent, were to Elect for their Prince
such a Person as to them appeared Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
Valiant, Just, Merciful, Affable,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57496:90"/>
a Maintainer of the Laws, a Lover of
the People, Prudent, and adorn'd with
all other Vertues fit for Government, and
requisite for the great Trust reposed in
him; yet with due Regard had to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the preceding Kings. If within
that Line they found a Person thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
or esteem'd to be so, they thought
it but a piece of just Gratitude to prefer
him before any other to this high Dignity,
and were pleased, when they had reason
to choose the Eldest Son of their former
King, rather than any of the Younger;
as well, because they had regard to Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Birth, when all other Vertues were
equal, as because the Greatness of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Estate might put him above the
Reach of Temptations to be Covetous or
Dishonest, and enable him, in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
to support the Dignity of his Office.
But, after such a Choice, if they found
themselves mistaken, and that they had
advanced a Cruel, Vicious, Tyrannical,
Covetous, or Wasteful Person, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Deposed him, oftentimes Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
sometimes Destroyed him, and this
either Formally, by making him Answer
before the Representative Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Or if by ill Practices, such as making
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57496:90"/>
of Parties, Levying of Souldiers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of Alliances to support himself
in Opposition to the Peoples Rights, he was
grown too Powerful to be legally Contended
with, they dispatched him without any
more Ceremony the best way they could, and
Elected presently a better Man in his
Room; sometimes the next of Kin to him,
sometimes the Valiant Man that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himself so far as to undertake the
Expulsion, or the Killing of the Tyrant;
at other times a Private Person of Good
Reputation, who possibly least dream't of
such an Advancement. Frequent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Estates, was a part of the very
Fundamental Constitution: In those meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
all matters relating to Good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were Transacted: Good Laws were
Enacted, all Affairs belonging to Peace or
War, Alliances, disposal of great Offices,
Contracts of Marriages for the Royal
Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were debated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was
the Ancient Form of Goverment in this
Kingdom, which continued with very
little variation (excepting that the Power
of the Nobles encreased too much) till about
32 years ago, when at one instant the
whole Face of Affairs was changed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
It is easie for any considering Person to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57496:91"/>
guess the Consequences of this, which are
Frequent and Arbitrary Taxes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
very Excessive ones, even in times
of Peace; little regard being had to the
occasion of them: So that the value of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
in most parts of the Kingdom is
fallen three fourths. And it is worse
near the Capital City, under the Eye and
Hand of the Government, than in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
Provinces; Poverty in the Gentry,
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecessarily causes extremities of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
in the Peasants, Partiality in the
distribution of Justice, when Favorites
are concerned, with many other mischiefs,
which shall be hereafter more particularly
mentioned; being the constant Effects of
Arbitrary Rule in this and all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
wherein it has prevailed.</p>
            <p>This Description or Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is likely the Author has given
us in imitation of some old Fashion Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
or other, for I am sure out of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
he can bring none that were ever
like it; I must confess that I could
scarce Read without some Indignation,
how he had abused in a most unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
manner, the Laudable Ancient
Constitutions of the <hi>Danes,</hi> not only,
but also by so doing had taken an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57496:91"/>
to put his Fictitious Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the conceits of his own Brains
or some States Mountebanks Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Notions for Truth upon the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Nation.</hi> What he says concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Election of their Princes, How
<hi>the Eldest were preferred before the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
out of Courtesie, <hi>if they were equal in
Vertues,</hi> as also their Adhering to a Line
being at pleasure, might be taken for
a vulgar mistake, such as does arise
from the neglect of true History: The
Qualifications, which he says, were
required in their Princes, might be
look'd upon, as an Effect of a Poetical
fancy; But what he tells of <hi>frequently
Deposing and Banishing, nay even Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Kings, either Formally or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Ceremony, by some Valiant Hand,
who for his Meritorious Act of Killing or
Expelling the Tyrant, used to Succeed in
the Kingdom:</hi> Is so much against the
Practice of the Ancient <hi>Danes</hi> describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in True History, that these Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
cannot be look'd upon by
Judicious Persons, otherwise than self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invented
Notions, fitted to the Humour
of some self-conceited Politicians; but
always esteemed by the more Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57496:92"/>
sort, as most pernicious to
Human Society. To make this appear
the better, what if we should endeavour
to show that the Ancient Government
of the <hi>Danes</hi> was so far from Adhering
to such Barbarous Practices, or
choosing their Kings by Courtesie, that
the Laws of Succession were so Sacred
with them, that that Kingdom ought
rather to be called Hereditary (if any
one ever was, in this Gentleman's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to be esteemed as such in <hi>Europe</hi>)
than Elective. Not to mention here
the times before <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the
History of those Countries before that
time being infected with many Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Relations, we will begin with the
Year 804 <hi>P. C. N.</hi> When <hi>Gotricus</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Predecessor, <hi>Sigifrid</hi> being
declared King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> left that
Crown to his Son <hi>Olaus,</hi> from whom
it always descended in the same Line
to the next Heir, till after the Death of
<hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Denmark, Sweden</hi>
and <hi>Norway,</hi> which was about the Year
1414. Thus the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi>
having been in a perpetual Lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of one Family for above 600
Years, and the said <hi>Margaret</hi> having
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57496:92"/>
no Issue, she had in her Life time
Crowned <hi>Eric</hi> VIII. her Sisters Son,
who having left <hi>Denmark,</hi> and resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Crown, after an Anarchy of
Six Years, in his Place, was Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Christopher</hi> III. <hi>Eric</hi>'s Sister's Son,
who's Mother was also Niece to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
named Queen <hi>Margaret.</hi> This
<hi>Christopher</hi> dying without Heirs, as did
also his Sister before him; the most
Ancient Race of the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings was
then extinguished about the Year 1448.
Only that there was left <hi>Adolph</hi> VIII.
Duke of <hi>Sleswick,</hi> and Count of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein,</hi>
being Son to a Nephew of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar</hi> IV.
to whom the Crown of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
being offered by the States, he
refused the same as having no Children.
The Crown being thus fallen into the
Hands of the States, yet were they so
Religious in observing their Ancient
Right of Succession, that they chose
<hi>Christian</hi> Count of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> for their
King, as being Son of <hi>Hedwig</hi> Sister of
<hi>Adolph,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sleswick,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
being Related to the Family of
the Ancient <hi>Danish</hi> Kings; his Son
<hi>John</hi> Succeeding him, Constituted with
consent of the States, his Son <hi>Christian</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:57496:93"/>
II. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Declared by the States, (who
had now acquired a greater power) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of the Crown, as having
Reigned very Tyrannically over them;
and in his stead <hi>Frederick</hi> I. Brother of
<hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Uncle to
<hi>Christiern,</hi> was made their King. And
I think it is a remarkable Instance, that
even at that time the States of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
did not esteem it belonging to
themselves to alter the Succession of the
Crown, when they did not only choose
<hi>Frederick</hi> I. who was Son of <hi>John</hi> King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but also afterwards, in a
publick Convention of the said Estates,
they did promise to <hi>John,</hi> Son to the
banished King <hi>Christiern,</hi> the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Fathers Kingdoms, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also the immediate Succession
after the Death of <hi>Frederick</hi> I. But <hi>John</hi>
the Son of <hi>Christiern</hi> II. dying about the
same time, when <hi>Frederick</hi> I. dyed, the
Crown came to his Son <hi>Christiern</hi> III.
whom in a direct Line have Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Frederick</hi> II. <hi>Christiern</hi> IV. <hi>Frederick</hi>
III. and <hi>Christiern</hi> V. the present King
of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Out of these Heads, which
I have thought fit to mention here, it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57496:93"/>
may be evident, whether the Succession
of <hi>Denmark</hi> was precarious, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has taken a great deal of pains to
perswade us. And whether this long
and constant Succession in one Family,
were Anciently depending from a free
choice or not, will be worth our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

And truly the Name of Heir of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
is so frequent in the ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> especially before
the Times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, that
it would be infinite to mention them
here, since even in latter Times the
same has not been out of date there.
<hi>Meursius</hi> does not only call <hi>Christiern</hi>
Son to <hi>Christiern</hi> Heir of that Kingdom,
but also bestows the same Title upon
<hi>John</hi> the Son of the deposed <hi>Christiern</hi>
the II. And here I cannot but insert
the Reasons, which were alledged by
the States of <hi>Denmark,</hi> among others
in their Proclamation, for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Frederick</hi> I. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> after
they had renounced all Obedience to
<hi>Christiern</hi> II.; Their Reasons are these,
<hi>Because he was the Heir of</hi> Norway,<note place="margin">Meurs. Lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and
had his Off-spring out of the most glorious
Family of the</hi> Danish <hi>Kings; That He
was born a Kings</hi> (Christiern I's) <hi>Son,
and that therefore this Honour did belong
to him in his own Right before any other
Prince,<note place="margin">Chytr. Saxon.</note> and that he ought to have a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Patrimonial Share out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Kingdom.</hi> From hence I think
may be easily understood, that the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57496:96"/>
States of <hi>Denmark,</hi> even in
latter Times, (did not assume
to themselves the free disposal
of the Crown, and that the
Succession was not precarious,
and as our Author would have
it, according to good Behaviour.
This will appear more clear to

Right of Succession has not

Times, ever since the <hi>Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>

deprived, not only to the next
Male Heirs, though Minors,

but also to the Females and their
Off-spring. Of the Female Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we have Two Instances since the
<hi>Oldenburg</hi> Family came to the Crown.
The first is, That it was agreed by
Marriage Contract betwixt <hi>Christiern</hi>
II. and <hi>Isabel,</hi> Sister to the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> V.<note place="margin">Chytr. in Saxon, ad an. 1522<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That if they should leave no

And when afterwards the same <hi>Isabella</hi>
followed her Husband in his Exile, after
he was deposed, the States did not only
recall her, but also promis'd her Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
nay, they did declare by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Proclamation, That if she would

            <p>Of the Female Succession the <hi>Danish</hi>
ancient History furnishes us with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Example in <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for about Thirty Years, about the

<hi>Denmark,</hi> who came to that Crown by
Right of the Female Succession, there
are several Examples in their Histories.

<hi>Haldan,</hi> who left by his last Will the

by the Estates, is mentioned by

in <hi>Denmark</hi> at that time. As for
the Division of the Kingdom of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
there are several Examples extant
in their Histories. <hi>Canute</hi> I. sirnamed
the great, being King of <hi>England, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
and <hi>Norway,</hi> divided in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,

Kingdoms, without consulting the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
between his three Sons, giving to

and before he died exhorted them to
Unity; alledging that to the best of his
Power, he had equitably divided the
Kingdom among them.<note place="margin">Pontan. l. 6, 7, 8.</note> And the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

There is one remarkable Instance

being divided into three Parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

and <hi>Blekingen,</hi> and that all three
should be called Kings. And even since
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57496:99"/>
that time that the Family of <hi>Oldenburg</hi>
has ruled in <hi>Denmark, Christiern</hi> I, dying
<hi>Anno</hi> 1482. at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> divided the
Kingdom, and that by Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his two Sons <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Frederick;</hi>
giving to the Eldest the Kingdoms, and
to the Youngest the Dukedoms. And
it is remarkable, that when afterwards
both <hi>Frederick</hi> and the <hi>Holsteiners</hi> urged
the Execution of <hi>Christiern</hi> I's Will, it
was alledged for a reason by them,<note place="margin">Meurs de gest. Joh. Reg. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

since <hi>John</hi> the Eldest had for his share
two Kingdoms, it was no more than
reason that the Dukedom should come
to <hi>Frederick,</hi> in recompensation of what
<hi>John</hi> had obtained. Truly, if the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Denmark</hi> had been precarious,
<hi>Sweedland</hi> being then already faln off
from <hi>Denmark,</hi> this would have been a
foolish reason, since, the Dukedoms being
hereditary, and very considerable in
themselves, the Younger would have
had much the better share.<note place="margin">Chytr. Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. lib. 10.</note> And that
the said <hi>Christiern</hi> I, had a right of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the same among his Children,
the States afterwards did confess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their Proclamation, wherein
having published their reasons for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to obey <hi>Christiern</hi> II, and receiving
<hi>Frederick</hi> I. for their King, they alledged
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57496:100"/>
as one main reason for <hi>Frederick,</hi> that
<hi>there was due unto him his patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
share out of his Father's Kingdom.</hi>
As out of what I have related here, it
will easily appear, how ill grounded our
Author's Assertions are concerning the
<hi>Danish</hi> Government; so, he that will be
so curious as to make a thorough search
into the <hi>Danish</hi> History will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
convinced, that the Ancient Kings
enjoyed, and exercised the same Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
which are acknowledged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to other hereditary Kingdoms in
<hi>Europe.</hi> It is not to be denied, that in
this as well as other Kingdoms, either
during the Minority of some Kings, or
else by the Division of the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
several Heirs, and other Accidents,
many Irregularities, Contests, Wars and
Slaughters have happened; but to draw
these into Consequence, and to attribute
the villanous Acts of exasperated Parties
to the whole Government, is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the whole frame of History, and at
once to charge all Governments with the
blackest Villanies that can be imagined,
since none have been free of them: And
I verily believe, if a due Comparison
were made, there would be as few to
be found of this Kind in the <hi>Danish</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57496:100"/>
as in any in <hi>Christendom.</hi> Let but
any Body, who is not byass'd by his own
Opinions,<note place="margin">Pontan. lib. 6.</note> look into the Reign of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar</hi>
I. and consider with what severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he did punish those who had laid
hands on <hi>Canute</hi> his Predecessor;<note place="margin">Pontan. lib. 7.</note> How
afterwards <hi>Eric</hi> VII, in his Minority,
with consent of the Estates of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
pursued the Murtherers of his Father,
and their Adherents, and when fled into
<hi>Norway,</hi> waged War with that King,
partly upon that Score; With how much
reluctancy the Estates received <hi>Abel</hi> for
their King, who had caused his Brother
to be murthered! and I say, let but any
Body consider the Succession of these
Kings, and what severities have been used
in that Kingdom against such as did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the like; he will questionless be
convinced how little their Histories do
agree with what our Author has been
pleased to tell us of the Ancient Form of
Government of the <hi>Danes,</hi> viz. That <hi>if
they found themselves mistaken in their
choice, they used sometimes to destroy him</hi>
(meaning their King) <hi>either formally, or
if he was grown too powerful, by dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him without any more Ceremony, the
best way they could; And to elect presently
a better Man in his room, sometimes the
next of Kin to him, sometimes the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57496:101"/>
Man that had undertaken the killing of
the Tyrant, at other times a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who least dreamt of it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If these were not his own Inventions,
he would have much obliged the Publick
in only naming his Authors, out of whom
he had his secret History of <hi>Denmark</hi> since
the same has been never known before to
the World. What he says, <hi>That all Affairs
belonging to Peace or War, Alliances,
Disposals of great Offices, Contracts of
Marriages,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were debated in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Estates:</hi> I will not absolutely
deny, but that the like instances may be
given in the <hi>Danish</hi> History; but I could
also easily shew, That the most of these
have been frequently debated without
them; as also that the ancient Form of
Government was very much altered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the whole Face of Affairs</hi> (as he
says) <hi>was changed about</hi> 32 <hi>Years ago:</hi>
But that the first would be too long for
these Animadversions; and of the second
we shall be obliged to say something here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
upon the Chapter, <hi>How the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of</hi> Denmark <hi>became Hereditary and
Absolute.</hi> In the mean time we must
not let quite pass by in silence, what he
tells of the <hi>Consequence of this Change,
and their Effects,</hi> viz. <hi>frequent and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Taxes, and commonly very excessive
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57496:101"/>
ones, even in times of Peace; little regard
being had to the occasion of them: The fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng
of the value of Estates, Poverty in the
Gentry, extremity of Misery in the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,</hi>
&amp;c. That the Taxes are now more
frequent in <hi>Denmark</hi> than they used to
be formerly in times of Peace, is what
scarce any body of Sense will deny;
but that the same should be the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the late Change in</hi> Denmark,
<hi>is not so easie to guess for a considering
Person,</hi> as this Gentleman fancies: and
I am apt to think, that those who are
thoroughly acquainted with the State of
<hi>Denmark</hi> will rather say, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has laid the Saddle upon the wrong
Horse, as the Saying is, since these Taxes
are the <hi>Consequences and Effects</hi> of that so
unprosperous War betwixt <hi>Denmark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and
<hi>Sweden,</hi> which did end in the Year 1660.
The chief Calamities of which were
partly occasioned by the mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and miscarriages of these Times,
which preceded this <hi>Change.</hi> For who,
that is not ignorant in Foreign Affairs,
but knows how considerable a Loser
<hi>Denmark</hi> was by this War, as <hi>Swedeland</hi>
got most prodigiously, not only in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
but also in <hi>Germany.</hi> It is then
to this encrease of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and other
neighbouring Princes, whose Territories
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57496:102"/>
surround <hi>Denmark,</hi> that <hi>these</hi> more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Taxes</hi> are to be attributed; since
he that will duly consider the antient
Contest betwixt the Northern Crowns;
what great Power and Strength <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has acquired to it self within
these Fifty Years; and how the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>
Territories joyn to the King of
<hi>Denmark</hi>'s in <hi>Norway;</hi> how they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parted in <hi>Denmark</hi> by that narrow
Streight, called the <hi>Sound;</hi> as the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Bremen</hi> and <hi>Verden</hi> are only
separated from <hi>Holstein</hi> by the River
<hi>Elbe,</hi> may easily be convinced, That
the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> though his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
are considerably diminished, yet
is obliged to keep a much greater Army
constantly on Foot than formerly, if he
will not run the hazard of being supri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and put to the utmost Extremity,
as his Father was in the War with the
<hi>Swedes.</hi> Besides this, the House of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburgh,</hi>
being grown more Potent,
and keeping greater Forces on Foot than
they used to do formerly; as also the
Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> whose Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
in a great many places are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with those of <hi>Denmark,</hi> having
of late Years been in the Interest of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
puts the King of <hi>Demark</hi> to a vast
charge, of keeping a considerable Force
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57496:102"/>
constantly on that side. 'Tis then from the
circumstances of the Affairs of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and their Neighbours that the effects of
these Taxes (now usual in <hi>Denmark</hi>) do
proceed; which in a Kingdom less power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than formerly, and yet forced to
maintain a much greater Force both
by Sea and Land, must needs now much
exceed those in former Times. If the
Author had not forgot what he himself
had remark'd at the end of his first
Chapter, concerning the <hi>Danish</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<hi>That they had this Inconveniency,
that they were disjoyned and separated from
each other, and therefore exposed to many
dangers, and requiring a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
expence to preserve them entire,</hi> he
might from thence alone, considering
the State of Affairs now in <hi>Europe,</hi> have
reasonably concluded, That the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Taxes
levied in the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> were
rather the <hi>Consequences</hi> of their Situation
now, than the <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>late Change;</hi>
and that therefore it could with no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be asserted, what he has told us
here, <hi>That in imposing the same upon the
Subjects, little regard was commonly had</hi>
(in <hi>Denmark</hi> now) <hi>to the occasion of them.</hi>
The Author also ought to have taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Consideration, when he made this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57496:103"/>
malicious Assertion, how this would
agree with what he has endeavoured to
perswade us in several Passages in this
Treatise, about the Meanness of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Court, and the continual want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
there; as also, what a great number
of Fortresses he gives us an Account of;
all which being necessarily to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Garrisons, and otherwise, he
might easily have found out, that these
things contradict one another; since, if
it be true, that the Court has so small a
share for its Use in these Taxes that are
paid in <hi>Denmark,</hi> it is from thence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that a necessity of maintaining so
considerable Forces and Fortresses, but not
<hi>an Arbitrary Will, without having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Occasion,</hi> enforces the paying
of greater Taxes now in <hi>Denmark</hi> than
formerly. As to what he says of the
<hi>Value of the Land being fallen,</hi> of the
<hi>Poverty of the Gentry, and Misery of the
Peasants,</hi> every body can easily guess, That
in this, as in all other Matters of that
Nature some Grains of Allowance
must be given to this Gentleman's
Romantick Expressions, wherewith
he has all along endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
the ignorant sort of People into a
belief of his own Suppositions. Yet is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57496:103"/>
it not to be wondred at, that the value of
the Estates should be less now, when so
considerable Taxes are paid out of them.
than they were formerly, when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
being the sole Possessors of Lands,
and having the chief Sway in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
used to be sure to exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as much as was possible. The same
Reason may be given why the Gentry or
Nobility in <hi>Denmark</hi> in general, do not live
up to that Splendor as they did in former
times; since having in those Days all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecs
of Profit and Trust in their Hands, and
paying very small Taxes, it is evident,
that at this time, when to these Places
others are admitted as well as they, and
are also obliged to bear a proportionable
share in all Taxes, their Revenues cannot
be so great now as they were formerly.
Of the Peasants we shall be obliged to
say something hereafter: wherefore we
will go to the next Chapter, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
<hi>the manner how the Kingdom of</hi>
Denmark <hi>became Hereditary and absolute.
After the Conclusion of the Peace,</hi> saysthe
Author, <hi>between the Two Northern Crowns,</hi>
Anno 1660, <hi>Some considerable care and time
was necessary to redress the Disorders oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by so terrible a War.</hi> Denmark
<hi>had been most violently shaken; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57496:104"/>
the Fury of the Tempest was over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Agitation caused by it still continued:
The Army was not yet disbanded, nor
could be, for want of Money to discharge
Arrears: This caused frequent Insolencies
in the Soldiers, with a further Oppression
of the Burghers and poor Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who had been in a manner already
ruined by the Miseries attendingthe War,
the Nobility, and Gentry, tho' Lords and
Masters were full of Discontents, and
the Clergy not in the condition they wish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
&amp;c. Here the Author gives us some
hints rather than reasons, which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Estates of <hi>Denmark</hi> to make so
remarkable a Change in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But, since from hence does depend
the understanding of the true nature of
this Change, he ought, I think, to have
been a little more circumstantial in this
Point, if he intended to prove to
us what he said in the conclusion of
the last Chapter; <hi>That it was astonishing
to consider how a free and rich People should
be perswaded intirely to part with their
Liberties.</hi> Astonishing indeed; But if
this Gentleman, <hi>by the People</hi> does under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all the Estates of the Kingdom, as
he ought to do, and has done so in other
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57496:104"/>
places, when he alledged that famous
Law of the <hi>Romans, Salus populi supremae
Lex esto,</hi> he has not hit the mark right
in this assertion, since, by his own words
it may be proved, that <hi>the Nobility mere
Lords and Masters,</hi> and all the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on them. It will not be a very
difficult task, to find out by what steps
the Nobility in <hi>Denmark,</hi> did acquire
this Power over all the rest; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how the Nobility first clipt the
Royal Prerogatives, after that Crown
was transferred to the <hi>Oldenburg</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and more especially, after the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Christiern</hi> the II. How after the
Reformation the Power of the Bishops
and Prelates, (who were, chosen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
out of the Citizens) being fall'n
together with their Revenues, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
made thereby the greatest step,
that could be, towards the advancing
their own Power above the Citizens
and Peasants not only, but also the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
who now were no more in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to keep up the ballance, as they
used to do formerly. The King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
being thus brought into narrow
bounds, and the Clergy's Authority and
Power quite abolished, the Citizens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were not able to resist long against
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57496:105"/>
those, who, sitting at the Helm, had the
chief management of all affairs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the Peasants, being most of
them depending from the Nobility, by
being partly their Tenants, partly their
Vassals, were not in a condition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
so much as a shew, of resistance,
against the Power of their Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Thus the name of the four anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Estates of <hi>Denmark,</hi> viz. the <hi>Nobility,
Clergy, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Peasants</hi> remaining,
the Power was effectually lodged in the
first, which from time to time did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to that degree, that not only the
whole Senate of the Kingdom, and all the
great Offices of the Court were in their
possession, but also they did claim a right
to all the rest of any moment, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to be consulted withall in the
disposing of any Office of moment, even
to be given to a Nobleman. They did
claim a Prerogative, and actually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
the same of nominating the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in the Cities, and had so eneroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the rest of the Estates that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Clergyman, Citizen or Peasant
could purchase any Lands; and if by
Mortgaging or other wise any Lands hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to fall into their hands, they were
obliged by a yearly, publick Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57496:105"/>
to proffer the same to sale to the
Nobility, upon the same condition as
they were possessed of it. From hence
came the dependancy of the Citizens
from them, and the entire subjection of
the Peasants to their Will, and by pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
most all the Lands in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and thereby having the Rights of
Patronages, in a great measure, in their
own hands; the Clergy was also, for
the most part, fain to dance after their
Pipe. It is easie, I think, to imagine,
the natural consequence of this to have
been, That they exempting themselves,
as much as could be done, from Taxes,
and other burdens, the same did fall
more heavy upon the rest; and these
not being able alone, to provide suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for the security of the Kingdom,
this was one main reason, why the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was so surprized by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and
did contribute as much as any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Miseries, which these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
endured in this War. There was
another great reason yet, which, as it
contributed greatly to the miseries and
misfortunes this Kingdom was fain to
undergo in this War; so questionless
was it partly the Occasion of the great
Change afterwards made by the States.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57496:106"/>
After the Death of <hi>Christiern</hi> IV. a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Party of the Nobility were for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<hi>Frederick</hi> III. second Son of the
said King <hi>Christiern</hi> IV. after the death of
<hi>Christiern</hi> his elder brother, and for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up <hi>Wolmar</hi> his younger Son by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife, whose Sisters were married
to several noble Men, which, though
they could not effect, yet were (before
<hi>Frederick</hi> III. this present King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s
Father was received by them as
King) the royal prerogatives more
streightned than ever, and thereby the
power of some of the Nobility mightily
increased; which did give occasion to a
great many Dissensions in that Kingdom
afterwards: And it is very remarkable,
that when <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
surprised the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> the
second time, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1658. He
used it for a Pretence, <hi>that he came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Differences arisen betwixt the King
and the Nobility.</hi> Besides this, the
Commons did lay their Calamities, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
in the late Wars, in a great
measure, at the door of the Nobility;
for, that, by having excluded all the
the rest even from military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(so that it was a rarity to find
a Commoner above the station of a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57496:106"/>
Captain) and a great many of these
not having done their Duty in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some Places of the greatest moment,
they had been the cheif Occasion of
these great Progresses which were made
at that time by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Denmark.</hi>
There was a manifest Instance of this in
the Siege of that almost impregnable
Castle of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Fortress of all <hi>Denmark;</hi> as
being built with incredible Charges,
upon Oaken Piles fastend in the very
bottom of the Sea; which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a sufficient Garrison, and
abounding in ammunition and provision,
under the Conduct and Command of
three Governours, was surrendred to
<hi>Wrangel</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> General meerly out
of Fear; he having, by discharging of
his Cannon and other Demonstrations
of Joy, deceived the Governours into
a belief that <hi>Copenhagen</hi> was taken by
the <hi>Swedes.</hi> The woful Experience then
the <hi>Danes</hi> had had of these and such like
Miscarriages were the true Cause of
finding a Necessity of Changing the
Constitution of their Government. With
out which, they saw it was impossible to
avoid the same Dangers and Calamities
which they had so lately undergone. It
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57496:107"/>
would be too tedious to insert here other
Reasons that might be alledg'd for this
Change; as also the whole Narrative of
our Authors concerning the manner of
this Change, wherein he has been more
taken up with the Formalities than the
true Causes; yet, out of what he has said,
it may appear, that he contrdicts here,
what he had said before, <hi>that they were
a free People;</hi> wherefore we must insert
some of them to make the Case the
plainer out of the Treatise it self. Thus
he says; <hi>After some few days Session,</hi>
speaking of that Session when the Change
was made in <hi>Denmark, during which
the Nobility, according to their usual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
debated, how the sums of Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
might with greatest ease and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
be levied upon the Commons
without the least Intention ef bearing any
proportionable Share themselves, several
Disputes arose, and many sharp Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
passed between them and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
The Nobility were for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their ancient Prerogative of paying
nothing by way of Tax, but only by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Contribution; and shewing themselves
too stiff at a time when the Country was
exhausted, and most of the remaining
Riches lodged in their hands: They
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57496:107"/>
seemed to make use of this Occasion, not
only to vindicate, but even to widen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their Privileges above the other two
Estates, by laying Impositions on them at
pleasure, which Weight they themselves
woold not touch with one of their Fingers
any further than as they thought fitting,
On the other hand, the Clergy for their
late adherence to the Interest of their
Country, and the Burghers for the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
defence of their City thought they
might justly pretend to new merit, and be
considered at least as good Subjects in a
State, which they themselves had so valiantly
defended. They remembred the great
Promises made to them when dangerous
Enterprises were to be taken in hand, and
how successfully they had executed them,
thereby saving from a foreign Yoke not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the City of</hi> Copenhagen, <hi>but the whole
Kingdom, the Royal Family, nay those
very Nobles that now dealt so hardly with
them: They judged it therefore reasonable
that the sums of money necessary should be levied
proportionably, and that the Nobility
who enjoyed all the Land, should at least
pay their share of the Taxes, since they
had suffered less in the common Calamity
as well as done less to prevent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of it.</hi> These Words, I think, do
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57496:108"/>
not want any further Observations, since
they are sufficiently explained by what
I have said before concerning the Causes
of this Change of Government, and
mayrather serve as a Confirmation of what
has been alledged there concerning this
point. I wil only add, that passage (also
related by the Author) between <hi>Otto Craeg</hi>
one of the chief Senators then, and <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
the then President of the City of
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> and Speaker of the Commons.
For <hi>Otto Craeg</hi> did not stick to tell the
President, <hi>That the Commons neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
nor considered the Priviledges of
the Nobility, who at all times had been
exempted from Taxes, nor the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of themselves who were no other
than Slaves,</hi> (the Word in the <hi>Danish</hi>
is Unfree) <hi>so that their best way was to
keep within their Bounds,</hi> &amp;c. To which
the President replied, <hi>That the Commons
were no Slaves, nor would from thence forth
called so by the Nobility, which they
should soon prove to their Cost.</hi> These
passages alone are convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
how Free a People the <hi>Danes</hi>
were at that time, and that it is more like
a Romance than a Truth, what he says,
in the Conclusion of this Chapter, <hi>That
the Commons have since experienced, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57496:108"/>
the little Finger of an absolute Prince can be
heavier than the Loins of many Nobles.</hi>
It being apparent enough, out of what
has been said upon this Subject, that
the Estates of <hi>Denmark</hi> were not only
treated by the Nobles as <hi>Slaves,</hi> but
that they also esteemed them as such;
and that things were come to that pass,
that they must either be in continual
<hi>Slavery</hi> to the <hi>Nobility</hi> at home, and in
fear of a <hi>foreign Yoak</hi> from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or else strive, by a <hi>Change</hi> in the
Government, to meliorate in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
their Condition. What he says
concerning the Citizens of <hi>Copenhagen;
that they have only obtained the insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Privilege of wearing Swords,</hi> in this
his, <hi>grav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and sensible men</hi> have grossly
abused him.</p>
            <p>For not to mention here, that this as
well as other Priviledges were granted to
them before the change of Government,
to encourage them to a vigorous Defence
at the time of the Siege of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi>
the some were not so insignificant: For
besides a great many Privileges for the
benefit of Trade, a Vote was allowed
them in all publick Consultations; a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
was given them to purchase
any Lands and Lordships whatsoever,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57496:109"/>
and to enjoy them with the same Right
as the Nobles: They were not to be
burthened with any Impositions, but
such as the Nobles did bear; and not
that, but by publick Consent: They
were to be free from all Contributions
or Inquarterings whatsoever in times of
Peace; and their Children were to be
admitted to all Honours and publick
Offices equally with Noble-Mens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>These were no insignificant Privileges
at that time, when most of the same
were only challenged by the Nobility; and
since the purchasing and enjoying of
Lands, as also their being capable of
publick Offices and Honours, have also
after the Change of the Government
been communicated to the rest of the
Subjects in <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
bear their proportionable Share in
such Taxes as the Necessity of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
obliges them to pay. it is evident
that the Nobility have been the chief
Loosers by that Change, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Estates, by being very near made
equal to them in a great many Respects,
are Gainers and not Losers by it. I
might take here an Opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my self upon some Rules of Policy
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57496:109"/>
which were mentioned by our Authour
upon this Subject in his Preface, <hi>viz.
That no People in their right Wits can
be supposed to confer an absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
That such a Donation ought to
be esteemed of no greater Validity than the
Gift made by a Mad-man, or a Child,
from his lawful Successours. That nothing
which even the representative Body of
the People does, which shall afterward
tend to the detriment of the Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
can then be obligatory,</hi> &amp;c. But that
these are Matters of too nice a Nature to
be transitorily treated of; as also what
might be said considering the manner of
the Proceedings of the Commons of
<hi>Denmark</hi> (related by the Authour at
large) when they obliged the Nobility
to concurr with them in the Change of
the Government. But thus much may
be said according to this Gentleman's
own Suppositions, that if even some
Matters, which the <hi>representative Body
of the People</hi> does, may be <hi>invalid,</hi> I see
no Reason why it should not be justifiable
in the Commons of <hi>Denmark</hi> to have
taken an Opportunity to free themselves
of these Incroachments, which were
made upon them by the Nobility; and
the Matter duely weighed, will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57496:110"/>
to the most Judicious, appear not
so much to be transacted like <hi>Children</hi> or
<hi>Madmen,</hi> but like <hi>People in their right
Wits.</hi> What he has added, <hi>That the
Clergy were the only Gainers,</hi> in the
Point, is, I am sure, what no man that
knows <hi>Denmark</hi> can comprehend, they
having not gained any thing by it, what
they had not before, but what all the
rest also have obtained at the same time.
As to his <hi>Passive Obedience-Principle
riding Triumphant,</hi> there has been so much
said of it in the <hi>Preface,</hi> that it would
be superfluous to repeat it here.</p>
            <p>In the next Chapter being the VIII.
where he speaks concerning the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Customs, and Temper of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
he talks of such appearances of
<hi>Slavery, Laziness, and idle despondency,
of carelessness and insensibility,</hi> all which
he has interwoven with his own Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Inventions, that one would rather
believe the whole to be fitted for a piece
of Tragedy, than History; it would be
ridiculous therefore to answer every
particular Whimsical Conceit, of
which this Chapter is almost as full as
<hi>Hudibras;</hi> it will suffice to hint at two
or three passages, from whence may be
guessed, with what candor he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57496:110"/>
to us the rest. One instance of this
is what he relates, <hi>That there is no buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or selling of Lands here,</hi> and tells it
as a Miracle, That some Lands were sold
to one Monsieur <hi>Taxera</hi> a rich <hi>Jew,</hi> at
<hi>Hamburg,</hi> and one Monsieur <hi>Marseilles</hi> a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, but that <hi>they were fain
to take these Lands for Money owing to
them from the King:</hi> As what concerns
the first, I am apt to believe, I have <hi>it
from as Grave and Sensible Men</hi> as his
could be, and besides of such as were
very understanding and not ignorant in
this matter, who have assured me, that
this Money was not owing to <hi>Texera</hi> from
the King, neither had he his Lands from
him, but being a very considerable Debt
due to him from particulor persons in
<hi>Denmark,</hi> (whom I could name if
I thought it convenient) he took these
Lands for the Payment of the same. The
second, it is true, had his Lands from
the King in lieu of Money owing to
him, but it is also to be observed, that
he having been <hi>Danish</hi> Factor at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi>
and having left a very great
Estate behind him, it is supposed he had
got the greatest part of it by his Factor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
so, that if he paid somewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
for those Lands, he had question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57496:111"/>
got so considerably by the King, that
he might afford to buy it at a better rate
than another would do. And truly a
great many the like instances might be
given in other Countries also, and if
they were represented so maliciously as
these have been, they would perhaps
appear worse than these; since in most
Countries, there are without doubt to
be found, who would take Lands, tho'
at an extraordinary rate, where Money
is not to be had. But, what he says in
this Chapter concerning the <hi>Prodigality
not only of the Gentry, but also of the
Burgers and Peasants, of their expensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Coaches, Retinue, Cloathes,</hi> &amp;c.
we must take a little notice of, and put
him in mind of what he said before,
<hi>That they lived very miserably;</hi> but these
contradictions are with him so common,
that it was impossible to remember them
all; I will only add, that it is to their
too free and expensive way of living, and
the Sumptuousness especially of their
Weddings, Christnings and Burials, that
ought to be ascribed to what has been
observed; <hi>That the People in general, are
not so rich here as in some other places.</hi>
A great many more Observations might
be made upon his malicious way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57496:111"/>
matters in this Chapter, of
which scarce any one is related without
Passion; but we will add but one more
upon what he says concerning the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants:
<hi>In Zealand,</hi> says he, <hi>they are all
as absolute Slaves as the</hi> Negroes <hi>are in</hi>
Barbadoes; <hi>neither they, nor their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
to all Generations, can leave the
Land, to which they belong. There is no
computing there by number of Acres, but
by number of Boors, who with all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them, appertain to the Proprietors
of the Land. Yeamontry, which is the
strength of</hi> England, <hi>is a state not known
or heard of in</hi> Denmark. <hi>If any of these
Wretches prove to be of a diligent and
improving temper, who endeavours to live
a little better than his Fellows, and to that
end has repaired his Farm-House, making
it convenient, neat, or pleasant, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to one, but he is presently transplanted
from thence to a naked and uncomfortable
habitation,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the full and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Peasantry in <hi>Denmark</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he has again been most miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by his <hi>grave and sensible men,</hi> that
instructed him. For that they are as abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luute
slaves as the <hi>Negroes,</hi> in this as well as
in the rest, he has been strangely misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
The Vassals then in the Islands of
<hi>Zealand, Laland, Falster,</hi> and <hi>Moenen,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:57496:112"/>
(for in the other parts of <hi>Denmark</hi> few
of them are to be found) are such as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they themselves, or their Fore-Fathers,
have by paying a certain Fine
to Landlords, purchased to themselves
certain Farm-Houses and Grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
belonging, under Conditions of
paying certain yearly proportions of
the Product of the Land, and doing
some other petty Services to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.
Now it being sufficiently known
to all that understand the Rights of
Vassalage in this and some other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that these yearly Contributions out
of the Product of the Lands, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to be done to the Landlords, are
determined by most antient Laws; I will
give any Man leave to judge, with what
sincerity the Author has described to us
the State of the Peasantry: He might
as well say, that these in <hi>England</hi> and all
their Posterities, who possess Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
cannot leave the Land which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them; since it is all the same Case,
only that here we have power to sell,
and transfer our Right to another, which
cannot be done there, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Landlord; but for the rest
it is rather esteemed among them a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
That they cannot be put out of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57496:112"/>
a Farm at pleasure, which Tye is by the Laws of
these Countries made reciprocal, betwixt the
Landlord and Vassal. And this Tye is so insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
in this Country, that you meet with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Examples, not only of such as for the value
of three pound Sterling, buy their freedom from
their Landlords, but also a great many Peasants
out of <hi>Jutland, Funen</hi> and other Islands, where
they are not Vassals, transplant themselves into
the other parts, and by paying a Fine make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Vassals; they finding it more commodious
to live in that State, than with the Title of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be incontinual fear of being ruin'd by
their Landlords, if they do not pay their yearly
Rent. And since all these Peasants are possess'd of
some Lands, less or more; nothing can be more
more vain than what he endeavours to perswade
us, that there is no <hi>computing there by Acres, but by
Boors.</hi> And as it is not in the Power of any Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
to remove a Peasant from his Farm-house,
without his consent, so he has no propriety in his
Goods; and a Peasant now, that has got any
thing by his Industry, may purchase Lands as well
as the best Nobleman. What he says, that <hi>no
Yeomantry is there,</hi> is also of the same Stamp with
the rest; since in those parts of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where
the Peasants are not Vassals (as it is not in the
most part of that Kingdom) there are to this day
Peasants who possess Lands by right of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the rest are Tenants by paying yearly
Rents, as we do here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Grievance he tells us of <hi>Quartering
of Souldiers;</hi> but, if in a Country where Necessity
obliges to keep a Standing Army, Souldiers should
not be quartered in the houses of the Subjects,
the Souldiers would be in a very bad Case; and
since no body is exempted from that burthen in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57496:113"/>
               <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that by paying a small matter you
may keep the Inmate from your Door, and House,
this is not esteemed so burthensom as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at first Sight. He says that the <hi>Tables of the
better sort are well furnished with Dishes, but he does
not like the Cheer:</hi> Truly it is no new thing that
People used to their own Country Diet, do not
like that of other Countries: Like the <hi>Kentish</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire,
who being treated in <hi>France</hi> with such
Dainties as are frequent there, could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to stay above three days, because he long'd
for such Apple-Dumplings as he used to eat at his
Father's House; and yet the Cheer may be nothing
the worse for it. But I perceive the chief want was
in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that they had no cramm'd Capons:
to this may be answer'd, that in <hi>Denmark</hi> where
Corn is extraordinary cheap, the same are rather
fed in the Houses out of hand as they call it; and it
is also notorious, that the <hi>same, as well in other, as this
Countrey,</hi> are preferred before cramm'd Fowl, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by some that are particularly fond of a large
fat <hi>London</hi> Rump. In the mean time, the <hi>Danes,</hi>
to my Knowledge, loving a dainty Bit as well as
any body, would have been very much obliged to
this Gentleman if he would have vouehsafed to have
set his Name to this Treatise, that, sometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Glass of Wine and fat Capon, they might
have celebrated in after Ages (as they do with
their Geese on <hi>Martin</hi>'s Eve) the Memory of
him in whose days the Mystery of Cramming tame
Fowl was first reveal'd and establish'd at <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi>
The next relation he makes of a Country woman
that would not sell him Green-Geese to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he gives us as an instance of their simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and superstition; for a Week after she brought
four to them, saying, <hi>That she had had no luck with
them, since the Kite had eat Eight of them.</hi> A most
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57496:113"/>
remarkable History to prove the simplicity of a
whole, or at least the greatest part of a Nation;
it being evident that in the most civilized Nations,
some Country People are soon surprized at any
thing that is new to them, and generally addicted
to their little superstitious Fancies.</p>
            <p>And yet, I can affirm it, that I have eat about
the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> in the King of <hi>Denmark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi>
Territories (though not in <hi>Copenhagen</hi>) as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Green Geese at a Gentleman's Seat, as ever
I eat any where else. And I remember a certain
<hi>Frenchman</hi> living in these parts, who having a
particular way of feeding Capons, used to sell
them at 10s. Sterling a piece. But leaving these
Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les; we must return to other more serious
Matters. The two next following Chapters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a particular Recital of the <hi>King's Revenue,
and of the Army, Fleet and Fortresses;</hi> little can
be added to it of any Moment, but only to put
the Reader in mind, that if an equitable Ballance
be made betwixt the said Revenue, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Land and Sea-forces; as also of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses
and their Charge: It will from thence be
evident, how unjustly the Author has dealt with
us, when he endeavoured to perswade us, that the
<hi>Taxes in</hi> Denmark <hi>were the Effects of an absolute
Government, and that little regard was had there in
the occasion of them.</hi> The eleventh Chapter treat,
of the Court, wherein you may meet with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Extravagancies, that it would be endless to
pretend to refute them. He make bold with the
King and Royal Family; he pretends to tell you
what is commendable or not in them: As for the
Ministers of State, he describes their H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mors, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and other Qualifications to a hair; as if
he (like the <hi>Turkish-Spy</hi>) had dived into the most
obstruse Secrets of them. I know, that boldness
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57496:114"/>
(like action in an Orator) takes often-times much
more with the vulgar Sort of People, than true
Sense; but when it transcends all the Rules of
Decency, and Reason it self, it cannot but be
odious to all, who are lovers of Moderation and
Truth.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman must have a very mean Opinion
of the Capacity of the <hi>English</hi> (though question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he has a very calm ordinary one of his own)
to perswade himself, that his vain and confident
Assertions could ensnare the more judicious Sort
into a belief, that a nameless Romantick Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who has committed so many Errors, (and
some of them very obvio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, even to Men of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts and knowledge) in this Treatise, ought
to be taken for a proper Judge of the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Conditions of a whole Court. What
he lays concerning his Majesty, the present King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that <hi>he neither loves, nor has a Genius
for business,</hi> must needs seem the oddest Assertion
that can be to those, who have seen and known,
with what Activity that King appears everywhere,
how seldom he is absent from his Council, when
any matter of Moment is in debate, and how he
in Person assists frequently in the highest Court of
Justice, and there takes particular notice of the
matters in Controversie. Of his Excellency <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinlieu,</hi>
he speaks much to the same purpose, as
that <hi>he loves his Divertisements rather than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
himself deep in the publick Affairs,</hi> when it is
known to all who understand the <hi>Danish</hi> Court; that,
as it cannot be denied, but that this great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
understands the enjoyment of pleasures, so he
never addicts himself to them, so much as to
neglect the publick Business; What he has also
said of his <hi>having burnt his Fingers en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,</hi>
and <hi>that King</hi> Frederick <hi>his Father thought
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57496:114"/>
once of making him King of Norway,</hi> cannot be
look'd upon by unbiass'd Persons, who are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Affairs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> otherwise than
an unanswerable Slander forged by his grave and
sensible Men. If we should take notice of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of this kind, which according to his
whimsical fancies he has related of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State, it would exceed the compass of
these Remarks. One thing I cannot but hint at,
which is the too much <hi>reservedness of Mons: Ehren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shild,</hi>
so much ridiculed by this Gentleman, in
calling him <hi>patrem difficultatum</hi> and alledging his
<hi>celapeut estre,</hi> as a great Infirmity, when by all
refined Politicians <hi>reservedness</hi> has been always
look'd upon in a States Man, much preferable
before a forward Confidence; the first being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the product of a far seeing prudence with
the latter, the effect of a conceited Vanity. There
is another pretty Notion in this Chapter, which
we must not pass by in silence, <hi>viz.</hi> That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the <hi>Court of</hi> Denmark <hi>rather to some of our
Noblemen's in</hi> England <hi>than</hi> White-Hall; and, <hi>that
upon a Sunday an hour before Dinner (being the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Court Time) the number of such as appear in the
Antichambre and Bedchambre seldom amount to above</hi>
20 <hi>or</hi> 30. I will put it to the Judgmnnt of any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Body, that will compute only these Officers of
the Court by him named; (besides others, as Lords
of the Bed-Chamber, Gentlemen of the Privy-Chamber;
The Queens Attendance, and others not
mentioned) the considerable Number of Superiour
Officers in the Army and Fleet; And more
especially. if any one will take the pains so
peruse the Proclamation of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
inserted by the Author, concerning <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
of the several <hi>Officers both Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
as also what this Author ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57496:115"/>
their <hi>Sumptuousness of Apparel and Equipage;</hi>
and compare all this with what he says now
concerning the Court, whether it have as much
as a Probability of Truth in it. Much the same
Allowance must be given to what he says, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that most sumptuous and magnificent Palace
of the K. of <hi>Denmark,</hi> called <hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> which
being computed to have cost at least a Million
Sterl. he says, <hi>falls short of many Noblemens Country
Houses in</hi> England. It is hard, that, to verifie his
Assertion, he would not name one of them; since
all that ever I could meet with, who knew <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericksburg,</hi>
and have also been in a great many
Noblemen's Seats in <hi>England,</hi> do unanimously take
this for a most unaccountable Rodomontado. But
these Remarks having increased in bulk beyond
our Intention, we will not insist upon what he says
in the 12th and 14th Chapters, concerning <hi>the
Inclinations of the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>towards his
Neighbours, as also of his Interests in relation to other
Princes,</hi> since a great deal may easily be said, but
scarce any thing be determined, in matters of this
nature: But in Chap. 13th, where he treats <hi>of the
Differences which some years ago were betwixt</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<hi>and the Duke of</hi> Holstein Gottorp; he has
shown himself very partial in not mentioning the
true Cause of these proceedings. One of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
was (not to mention others) that the Duke
of <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> holding that part of <hi>Sleswick</hi>
which he possesses as a Feef of <hi>Denmark;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, having been assisting to the <hi>Swedes</hi>
in the subduing of the greatest part of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
at the Treaty at <hi>Roschild,</hi> 1658. had forced the
K. of <hi>Denmark</hi> to declare him independent of that
Crown, to maintain which he had ever since been
in the Interest of <hi>Swedeland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:57496:115"/>
I do not therefore see, how the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
with Justice could be blamed to recover his
Just Right. And when he saw a fair Prospect of
being even with <hi>Swedeland,</hi> for what they taken
from his Crown, to begin with drawing out first
that Thorn which stuck so close to him, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being freed from it, he could not have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to himself the same Success as he afterwards
had against the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Fifteenth Chapt. treating of the <hi>Laws and
Courts of Justice,</hi> as things are indifferently well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
so we will go on to the Sixteenth Chapter,
where the <hi>State of Religion, of the Clergy, and
Learning</hi> is represented; the greatest part of this
being taken up with railing against the Clergy;
upon which Point we have said enough in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
we only will only put him in mind, That
Learning is not at so low an Ebb, but that lately
<hi>Denmark</hi> has had its <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> a Man to be
compared to the best of our Age; and that if I had
a mind to speak of the Living, I could name him
some, who would be able to give other Proofs of
their Learning, than our Author has done in this
Treatise, though he pretends to be much beyond
the common Sort: I will add but a few Words
concerning what he says, <hi>That a Popish Chappel, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be built at</hi> Gluckstadt, <hi>has been the first there
since the Reformation;</hi> that to my Knowledge at
least twenty Years ago, not only Popish Chapels,
but also of most other Religions; as of <hi>Calvinists,
Independents, Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. have been erected at
<hi>Altena,</hi> a place near <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sorts of Religions are tolerated; but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
service allow'd them. At <hi>Fredericia</hi> also a
free Exercise of Religion has been allowed a great
many Years ago, which are two convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
that this Gentleman having been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57496:116"/>
by his <hi>grave and sensible Men, has given us a
great</hi> many things for a confessed Truth, which
he had not sufficiently been instructed in.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Conclusion: The Author in
this whole Book having been so abounding every
where with his own Fancies, and new Model'd
Opinions has been the Occasion, that these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
are increased beyond intention; if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing should have been but touched upon, there
would have been matter sufficient for a very large
Book; But to have examined in particular, all his
speculative Assertions, would have required whole
Volumes. 'Tis for this reason that I have been
obliged to let a great many of less moment slip by
untouched; and as to these of more consequence,
I have treated of them with as much brevity as the
nature matter would permit: Since by hinting only
the Heads, and referring my Reader to the true
Ancient History it self. I did not question but
the more curious would take an opportunity
to compare the same, both with the Author's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
and the historical Account it self. What
he has related of such matters as are not extant in
Histories; wherein the sacred Laws of History
have obliged me to contradict his ill-grounded
Relation, I will only say thus much: That as the
Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> is very well known to me,
so I am sure I have related nothing, but what I not
only very well know, but also can easily prove,
by unquestionable Witnesses who are not ashamed
to own their Names. And if this Gentleman's
Friends, who instructed him had had a little less
<hi>Gravity,</hi> but somewhat more <hi>Knowledge</hi> in these
Affairs, which they pretended to understand, we
might questionless have expected a more fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
