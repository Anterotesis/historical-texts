         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>za,</hi> who hath so well deserued
of the new Testament) is begunne at the 14. verse of this
second Chapter. There the Apostle entreth into discourse
<hi>what manner of faith that is,</hi> by which a man is saued, and
sheweth that it is neither an hypocriticall profession, and
ostentation of faith, where it is not in truth; no nor euery
kind of <hi>true faith,</hi> which is saith indeed, that is able to
iustifie a man before God: but onely such a kind of true
faith, as is fruitfull in good workes. This doctrine the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

workes, can the faith saue him?</hi> that is, can such a kinde of
faith saue him? As if hee should say; No: such a faith as


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11671:9"/>
hath no workes, cannot saue a man, Secondly, he openeth
and illustrateth the truth of this proposition, by a familiar
similitude.<note place="margin">15.</note>

               <hi>Euen so the faith, if it haue no workes, is

words profit not a poore man, if we doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
releiue him; so speaking of <hi>faith,</hi> and professing
of faith, will not saue a man, vnlesse his <hi>deedes</hi> declare that
hee hath saith indeed. Thirdly, he bringeth in a true <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer,</hi>
whose faith is fruitfull, chalenging as it were an
hypocriticall professor of <hi>faith</hi> to declare it by his <hi>workes;
Shew mee thy faith by thy workes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">18.</note> 
               <hi>and I will shew thee my faith

it by my <hi>deedes:</hi> if thou hast <hi>faith</hi> (as thou braggest)
shew it by thy <hi>deedes</hi> also. Fourthly, he sheweth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and example, that not the shew of <hi>faith,</hi> no nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
kind of <hi>true faith</hi> is able to saue and iustifie before
God: As to beleeue that there is a God, that there is but
one God, that this God is mercifull, iust, &amp;c. no, not to
beleeue all that to be true which is written of God in the
Scriptures, is sufficient to saluation. For so much the very
<hi>Deuills</hi> of hell beleeue, and yet are in no comfort, nor hope
of fauour. And this hee laieth downe in the 19. verse:
<hi>Thou beleeuest that there is one God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">19.</note> 
               <hi>thou doest well: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills
also beleeue, it, and tremble.</hi> As if he should say; In <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing</hi>
so much thou doest well: for that is true, and
ought to be beleeued: but this is not inough, nor suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
If it were, then the <hi>Deuills</hi> might be saued; for they
<hi>beleeue</hi> so much as well as thou. But they <hi>beleeue</hi> that, and
yet tremble, so thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iest <hi>beleeue</hi> as much, and yet be
damned. And thus I am come to the words of my Text,
<hi>The Deuills beleeue, and tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11671:9"/>
The <hi>words</hi> are a plaine and full proposition, consisting
(as euery proposition doth) <hi>ex subiecto: The deuills. Et ex
praedicato duplici; beleeue, and tremble.</hi> Of the <hi>Subiect</hi> I

had many meditations: But by discoursing of them, I
should not attaine to the principall ende of my thoughts.

yet <hi>Dodoneus</hi> saith of it, that it is good for nothing. I would
therefore intreat and perswade all young Diuines, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
their race with trauersing the worthie writings of
<hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, Musculus,</hi> and
the like, (bookes some thirtie or fourtie yeares agoe in the
onely request) and of them to take their chiefe repast: vsing
only the other like sweet meats after a feast, rather to close
the stomacke, and to delight with varietie, then to satisfie
the appetite, or to support nature. For my part, I refuse not
wholly to vse them, as will appeare by this Treatise: but in
many cases, (as namely in this of <hi>the Deuills beleeuing,</hi>) I
hold both their <hi>Obiections</hi> and <hi>Solutions</hi> so needeles and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous,
as I doe not vouchsafe them so much as a bare rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This may suffice the bodie of this <hi>Auditorie;</hi> that the
<hi>Apostle</hi> here affirmeth, and reason from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the same, that there is <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleefe,</hi> euen in the
<hi>Deuills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this sheweth that the very <hi>Deuils</hi> of hell haue
some thing in them that is good. For they <hi>beleeue.</hi> Now
true and right <hi>beleefe,</hi> is of it selfe the good gift of God.
Indeed the <hi>Deuills</hi> as bad as they are, haue in them many
good parts, For 1. their naturall substance is good: it is
the creature of God, and<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>all that God made, was exceeding
good.</hi> 2. Their naturall qualities are good, their knowledge,
their vnderstanding, their wisedome, their immortalitie,
their inuisibilitie, their agilitie, and the like, are all good
properties in themselues. 3. They often speake that which
is good. As when they professed<note n="s" place="margin">Matth. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For all <hi>truth</hi> hath correspondencie to God, the fountaine
and rule of truth. 4. Many times they doe that which is
good in it selfe. As when by <hi>Coniurers</hi> they fetch home
stolne goods to the right owners; or by <hi>Witches</hi> doe cure
and heale desperate diseases. My selfe did once know<note n="u" place="margin">Ioane Wells of Stow market in Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Againe, take another example of this: A man is
deepely indebted, <hi>&amp; non est solvendo,</hi> he hath not to pay:
he heareth, he knoweth, he <hi>beleeueth,</hi> that his Creditour
is a verie honest and mercifull man; that he hath dealt very
honestly and mercifully with others, giuing day to some,
remitting to others a third part, a halfe part, yea to some
the whole debt. But he hath neither promise from his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,

Absurd; for we haue heard before out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that
<note n="n" place="margin">De vnic. bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. c. 10.</note> the deuills faith was as true a faith as Peters. And certen
it is, that if they haue any <hi>faith,</hi> that must needes be <hi>true:</hi>

likelihood or similitude, because it beareth some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of faith: As a king in a play is called a king, and

               <hi>A true faith may be idle, and vtterly

thereof. But as the intention of controuersie is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them (for they speake of a profitable and liuely

            <p>Now come we to describe the true differences of these
two <hi>faiths:</hi> and so in a few words lightsomely to open all
that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh in this Chapter of a <hi>dead faith
without workes,</hi> which can not saue a man; and yet no
whit therein crossing S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his two worthie
Epistles to the Romanes and Galathians, teacheth and
prooueth, that <hi>Only faith sufficeth to saluation.</hi> Thus therfore
I proceed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Elect</hi> apprehendeth (as many other
things) so namely and particularly, <hi>The mercie and loue of
God the Father, per Deum mediatorem, by Christ the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
Finding, and feeling that God loueth him, he in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
affection turneth to God to loue him againe. For, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
gratiam parit:</hi> Louing God againe, he laboureth to
serue, and honour that God, who hath loued him first: and
that by doing his will and commandements. Hereof he
bringeth forth good works, to the glorie of God, and the
benefit of his Church. And thus<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>faith worketh by loue:</hi>
that is, of loue, it is fruitfull in good works.<note n="c" place="margin">Greg. hom 12. lib. 3. in Ezech. 40. 47.</note>

or a liuely faith; because it sheweth the power and life of
it selfe by operation, as a tree sheweth it selfe to liue by
the leaues, blossomes, and fruit which it bringeth forth.


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11671:24"/>
And of this <hi>faith</hi> is all S. <hi>Pauls</hi> treatie, when he maketh it
the hand or instrument of our <hi>Saluation.</hi> On the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
the <hi>faith of deuills</hi> apprehendeth many things, as hath
beene before declared; but among all, it apprehendeth
not, nor can apprehend <hi>no mercie, fauour, loue,</hi> or <hi>pardon
from God,</hi> as from a <hi>Father:</hi> but all <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>seueritie,</hi> as
from an angrie and offended <hi>iudge.</hi> Not <hi>beleeuing</hi> that God
loueth them, they haue no inclination to loue God againe.
Louing him not, they haue no care to honour him: not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his honour, they are not carefull to please him by
performing any dutie to him, or his people. And this is

<hi>beleeue the starie of Christ,</hi> and what the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

&amp; includit,</hi> presupposeth and includeth the former. For no


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11671:25"/>
man can by <hi>faith</hi> assure himselfe of the <hi>mercie of God,</hi> who
doth not first <hi>beleeue</hi> that there is a God, and that all is
true which proceedeth from him. Therefore doe not we
imagine such a <hi>iustifying faith,</hi> as beleeueth nothing but
<hi>mercie</hi> to himselfe: or that <hi>beleefe</hi> of <hi>mercie</hi> alone (that is
ioyned with no beleefe els) is sufficient to iustification.
But we say, that a <hi>Iustifying faith,</hi> hath for his <hi>Obiect,</hi> all that
God would haue to be <hi>beleeued:</hi> and among all other
things principally, the <hi>mercie of God.</hi> I make this plaine
by a similitude. The <hi>vegetatiue soule,</hi> is the soule of plants,
and is a true soule in his kind, though it hath neither sense
nor reason. The <hi>sensitiue soule,</hi> is the soule of beasts, and
soules, and fishes, &amp; it is a distinct kind of soule by it selfe;
including <hi>vegetation,</hi> but void of reason. The <hi>reasonable
soule,</hi> is the soule of men, &amp; is a distinct kind of soule by it
selfe; yet such a one as includeth both <hi>vegetation,</hi> and <hi>sense.</hi>
Applie this to the three kinds, or degrees of <hi>faith. Credere
Deum,</hi> to beleeue there is a God, is the faith of Infidels and
Pagans, and is a true <hi>faith,</hi> though it neither beleeue the
<hi>Word</hi> of God, nor <hi>mercie</hi> from God. <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> that is,
to beleeue all that God saith to be true, is the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills</hi>
and <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and includeth in it the faith of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and is a <hi>true faith</hi> in the kind, though it apprehend no
mercie. <hi>Credere i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Deum;</hi> that is, by <hi>faith</hi> to relie vpon
the <hi>mercie of God,</hi> is the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
both the <hi>faith</hi> of the Infidels, and the <hi>faith</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills:
and is a distinct kind of <hi>faith</hi> in it selfe. And this
compleat <hi>faith,</hi> consisting of all these three, we <hi>Protestants</hi>
say, to be that <hi>onely faith that iustifieth in the presence of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against therefore both <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> I make
these foure conclusions. 1. True Christian <hi>sauing faith,</hi> doth
not onely beleeue <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> the word of God, and
the Word of Christ, the storie of God, and the storie of
Christ: but also it doth beleeue and apprehend the <hi>mercie</hi>


               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:11671:26"/>
of this God, <hi>per de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mmediatorem,</hi> by Christ the Mediator.
2. True Christian <hi>sauing faith,</hi> differeth from the <hi>faith</hi> of
the <hi>Deuills,</hi> only in this (and the consequences thereof)
that the <hi>Elect</hi> apprehend the <hi>mercie of God</hi> to them in
Christ, which the <hi>Deuills</hi> can not doe. 3. To beleeue only
the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and the <hi>Storie</hi> of Christ: is to beleeue
no more then the <hi>Deuills.</hi> 4. To beleeue all that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills
doe beleeue, and not by <hi>faith</hi> to applie the mercie of
God to thy selfe in Christ, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o more keepe thy soule

<hi>trembling;</hi> of which S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith here, that though <hi>they
beleeue,</hi> yet <hi>they tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that the <hi>word of God</hi> is cleare in this case, and that
God requireth in the Scriptures, not only the <hi>faith</hi> of the
storie; but also, by <hi>faith,</hi> an application of mercie to a mans
owne soule; I will make manifest vnto you by foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> arguments: whereof, The first shall be drawn from
the doctrin of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> which is the foundation of truth;

yet if a man rightly consider of it, <hi>Omnia ex quibus fides po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

1. No man can doubt, but <hi>faith</hi> is built vpon Doctrine:
for<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>faith is by hearing:</hi> viz. of the doctrine which is
taught vnto vs. Now vpon what doctrine hath <hi>faith</hi> his
foundation? vpon the doctrine of the Law? By no means:
for,<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The Law is not of faith.</hi> It neither describeth the
faith, nor requireth the faith, by which we are iustified; but
<note n="b" place="margin">Calv coir. in Gal. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>rationem iustificandi hominis a fide prorsus alienam habel:</hi> it
prescribeth a meanes of iustification cleane contrarie to
faith: that is, obedience and workes of the Law. It is
therefore built vpon the doctrine of the Gospel: faith must

The matter therefore to be beleeued, is <hi>the Gospell.</hi>
Now, what is the <hi>Gospell?</hi> A bare Historie only? or a bare

telleth vs withall, how easily and freely we haue receiued
these things, (that is, remission of sinnes, iustification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
to heauen, adoption to be the sonnes of God.)
For it telleth vs, that we haue not obtained these things,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11671:27"/>
either by our owne industrie, or by our owne good
workes, but by the grace and mercie of God. O comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Gospel: here is a verie Gods spell indeede, here are
glad tidings indeede, here is a doctrine that passeth all
ioy comprehensible with the deepest vnderstanding. But
now gather we this together. Doth the <hi>Gospel</hi> bring good
tidings to vs of good things that haue betided vs? Are
these good things, remission of sinnes, iustification, and
the rest? Doth the <hi>Gospel</hi> tell vs that wee haue receiued
these benefits without our labour, and without our merit
freely of the grace of God? And must we beleeue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel?
Why then we must beleeue, that these glad tydings
are sent to vs, that remission of sinnes, and saluation is
giuen to vs, that we are saued by <hi>mercie</hi> without our <hi>owne
deserts.</hi> Is not this to beleeue more then the storie? Nay,
is not this to take home the Gospel to our selues? Is not
this by <hi>faith</hi> to beleeue that the saluation which Christ
wrought for man mentioned in the Gospel, <hi>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we haue receiued: No doubt it is, and so without doubt it
must bee. For, if <hi>faith</hi> be built vpon the doctrine of the
Gospel; then, <hi>Qualis causa, talis effectus:</hi> such doctrine,
such faith. But the doctrine of the Gospell is a doctrine
of remission of sinnes, of iustification<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of remission of sinnes, of iustification, of adoption, of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
by Christ to vs: which I trowe is an applying of
Gods <hi>mercie,</hi> and Christs <hi>merits</hi> vnto our selues.</p>
            <p>And here let none obiect vnto me, that a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
there are glad tidings in the Gospel; that a man may
beleeue that the Gospel preacheth remission of sinnes and
saluation by Christ, and yet not to apply them to himselfe,
as doe the deuills and thousands of Reprobats: for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede

carrieth with it, not onely a representation of Christs

how it may be receiued of vs. The carnall eating of Christ
(if S. <hi>Bernard</hi> any such) is also notably confuted by the

prooue, and that pregnantly, from the words of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that, the Sacrament of the Lords supper, which hee
there calleth, the sacrifice of the Altar, is not only a bare
signe and representation of Christs bodie and blood bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and shead vpon the Altar of the Crosse: but also that
the receiuing in of the bread and wine into our selues, doe
seale vp vnto vs that doe receiue them, Christs owne ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
into vs, and dwelling within vs, euen in our hearts
by a liuely <hi>faith.</hi> And hereof it is that we call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>signa exhibitina,</hi> signes that doe exhibite, reach

these 3. verses, must of necessitie intertaine this
threefold distinction. Thirdly, the Iesuites Argument
is like the <hi>Logique,</hi> and other Popish learning of their
Schooles. Is not the distinction good betweene <hi>Credere
Deo,</hi> and <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> because that many professe in
the Creede, I beleeue in God, which haue no charitie?
Why? The Creede giueth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the worke of
God.</hi> But the Creede teacheth what true faith is, and how
we should professe it. And if any man will in the Creede
professe that he doth beleeue in <hi>God,</hi> when as he doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue a God, or beleeue God to say true: this is but
the hypocrisie or vnbeleefe of the professor, not a defect
of the profession. For the sauing profession of faith is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
in God, with hope of mercie. And that the very le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite

that S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and others, had erred in this distinction

consciences of the hearers. The <hi>Papists</hi> would be adiured
by the high and sauing name of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> no longer
to feede themselues and the people, with the courser mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels

with a broader, nigher, and easier way to heauen, then
God himselfe hath chalked out; least they fall into that
which leadeth to destruction. And lastly, all wee present
should be carefully admonished, to vse all holy meanes by
which this <hi>sauing</hi> and <hi>iustifying faith,</hi> might be kindled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and continued in our hearts. Therefore had wee
neede diligently and conscionably to read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
to heare the <hi>word</hi> preached, to frequent the <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
yea, we had need to pray much to God, to meditate much
with our selues, to conferre much with others, for the
strengthening of our consciences in the same. But this
