            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>§. III. AND here I conſider Firſt, that
all theſe Arguments of his Credibility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
as to Us, either on the pure Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> who was the firſt who
produced him with any great applauſe
and confidence, and who is therefore juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpicious, if not of wholly coyning
him, yet at leaſt of a partial favour to
him, and of the firſt endeavours to juſtify
and defend him after the neglects that had
been caſt upon him ſince the time that he
had firſt been Publiſhed and Tranſlated by
<hi>Philo Byblius,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

not very difficulty reconcileable, as has
been ſhewn. If it ſhould prove otherwiſe,
then <hi>Porphyry</hi> alone muſt anſwer for both,
not only the pretended <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi>
himſelf, but the pretended <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to allow him all the favour that is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and to grant that this <hi>Philo Byblius</hi>
is to be ſuſpected of the Original fraud,
becauſe of this more Antient citation of
him by <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> which could have been

his miſtaking <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> for the famous

this <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> was either generally

as moſt of the <hi>Egyptian</hi>

of this <hi>Gods</hi> name in
the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Sethron, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos,
Sethoſis,</hi> &amp;c. And then
it cannot be thought
ſtrange, that as his whole

his <hi>Chronological Period,</hi> ſo
that <hi>Period</hi> it ſelf ſhould
be aſcribed to the <hi>Egyptian
Seth,</hi> and conſequently the
<hi>Pillars</hi> alſo from which theſe accounts
were taken. It may be another account
may be given of this matter, that by the
<hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Seth</hi> may be meant only their
belonging to <hi>Egypt.</hi> So it appears that
the ſame King who was called <hi>Egyptus</hi> by
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56952:19"/>
called <hi>Sethos,</hi> and as it ſeems from
thence concluded by <hi>Manetho</hi> to have
been the ſame with him whom the <hi>Greeks</hi>
called <hi>Aegyptus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Danaus,</hi>
(who neither was himſelf known to the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the name of <hi>Danaus</hi> but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi>)
becauſe <hi>Sethos</hi> in the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Tongue, ſignified the ſame thing as
<hi>Aegyptus</hi> in the <hi>Greek.</hi> Now the Name
of <hi>Egypt</hi> was derived from the Name of
<hi>Aegyptus,</hi> by which he was known to
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and therefore proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the Name of <hi>Sethos</hi> muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
the like denomination of <hi>Sethos</hi> to
his <hi>Country.</hi> So <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus</hi>

Which, being once admitted,

<hi>Joſephus</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56952:19"/>
And therefore they who were ambitious
of challenging them to themſelves, were
to take occaſion of doing ſo from a <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opolis</hi>
of their own. Accordingly the
<hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> for their <hi>Xiſùthrus</hi> pitched

               </gap> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood)
becauſe I cannot think they had
them in two places, for that ſame reaſon of
preſerving them from the <hi>Deluge.</hi> Yet the
Country where they were, might have

as the occaſion of erecting theſe

they,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Platon</hi> in <hi>Tim.</hi> qui ea habuit ab <hi>Aegyptiis</hi>
               </note> no doubt on pretence of ſuch
<hi>Pillars,</hi> boaſted themſelves alone to have
preſerved their <hi>Histories,</hi> through the

from this confounding the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> accounts, which followed upon
their ſeveral reſpective <hi>Emulations,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was, that theſe Inventers of the
Fable of <hi>Seth,</hi> were ſo particular in telling
us the very <hi>materials</hi> of thoſe <hi>Pillars.</hi> The
<hi>Aegyptian Syringes</hi> were, as it appears
from <hi>Ammian</hi> cut out of a <hi>Quarrey,</hi> and
therefore were of ſolid ſtone.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ammian,</hi> L. XXII.</note> But the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> mentioned by <hi>Epigenes</hi> were
<hi>Coctilibus Laterculis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Plin.</hi> N. H. VII. 56.</note> for which that place
was Famous. Theſe two ſo well fitting
the deſign of preſerving them from the
<hi>Conflagration</hi> and the <hi>Deluge,</hi> made them,
who were willing to confound things for
Intereſts of their own, to be as I ſaid ſo
very particular, not conſidering that by
the account given in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus,</hi> the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> had another pretence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
their own <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> from the
<hi>Conflagration</hi> as well as from the <hi>Deluge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. XIV. So alſo, for the <hi>Writings</hi> from
whence our <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> is pretended to
have Collected his Hiſtory, there ſeems
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56952:21"/>
little doubt but they were alſo deſigned
for the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Mercury;</hi> as
alſo that the Subject of theſe <hi>Writings,</hi>
were taken from thoſe <hi>Plates,</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi>
now mentioned. <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> himſelf
expreſly ſayes, that <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
very carefully into the Notions of
<hi>Taautus;</hi> That <hi>Taautus,</hi> to whom they
were aſcribed, was no other than<note n="*" place="margin">Philo Byblius <hi>ſays ſo expreſly in</hi> Euſeb. <hi>Pr. Ev. l. 9. p. 32. A.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
will, I believe, need no proof. And
theſe <hi>Mystical Books</hi> of the <hi>Ammonians</hi>
being joyned with them, makes it yet
more probable. For even among our
preſent Counterfeits under the Name of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> we have an Epiſtle of <hi>Aſclemus</hi>
to <hi>Ammon,</hi> concerning the Concealment
of their <hi>Philoſophical Mysteries,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Fragments of the like addreſs
in <hi>Stobaeus Eclog. Phyſ.</hi> by which we ſee
that thoſe unfaithful dealers with <hi>Hermes,</hi>
did both joyn this <hi>Ammon</hi> with him
whom they make a King in <hi>Libya,</hi> (very
probably with ſome relation to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Libyan</hi> Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi>)
and withall, made the ſame <hi>Ammon</hi> a
very zealous Patron of thoſe <hi>Philoſophical
Mysteries.</hi> So that this holds exact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with thoſe other Cheats, and
looks as if it belonged to the ſame Forge.
Unleſs poſſibly we may refer it to that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56952:21"/>
more Antient Conjunction of <hi>Thoth</hi> and
<hi>Thamuz,</hi> and the God of the <hi>Aegyptian
Thebes,</hi> called <hi>Ammon</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">In <hi>Phaedr.</hi> p. 213.</note>
whence it comes to paſs that the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Thebes</hi> has, in the Prophets, the Name
of <hi>No-Ammon,</hi> as it was uſual, and, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi>
obſerves, moſt proper to the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
to denominate their <hi>Cities</hi> from
their <hi>Deities.</hi> It may be this may be the
reaſon why the Name of <hi>Ammon</hi> is ſo uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
made uſe of in the accounts of the
<hi>Aegyptian Philoſophy,</hi> becauſe the Name
it ſelf ſeems an off-ſpring of <hi>Ham,</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the Scripture to the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
it ſelf, ſo that the <hi>Ammonian Philoſophy</hi>
is no more than a <hi>Colony</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian.</hi>
And theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, theſe <hi>Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

            <p>§. XV. But to examine now the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56952:22"/>

               </note> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
he had Conquered the difficulties
of acceſs, and ſubmitted, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
ſeems to have done, to Circumciſion; yet
the <hi>Mystical Books</hi> of the <hi>Ammonians,</hi>
and much more the <hi>Mystical Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks</hi>
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> (of which kind
the Sacred <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> of their <hi>Pillars</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
were,) depended ſtill on a higher
degree of <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> of the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> for their <hi>Explication.</hi> And who
can undertake that they would, after all,
deal <hi>Faithfully</hi> with him? Eſpecially if
they had ſuſpected the leaſt deſign in him
of committing them to <hi>Writing,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging</hi>
them to Poſterity? And after all,
what judicious Perſon would not rather

concerning the ſenſe of their <hi>Anceſtors?</hi>
And then, what will become of this ſo
much applauded Teſtimony of <hi>Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi>
if <hi>Phoenician</hi> matters muſt not be
expected from him, as they could not
from ſuch means of Information; and if
the Teſtimony even of the <hi>later Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
muſt be preferred before him? I am
very well aware that the whole credit of
this Author depends on the contrary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that both theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Taau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Apocryphal Books</hi> of the <hi>Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
were in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and concerned
<hi>Phoenician</hi> Affairs, and in the <hi>Phoenician</hi>
Tongue or <hi>Characters,</hi> that a Native <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi>
might be preſumed fitteſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them.</p>
            <p>§. XVI. THIS will indeed, and will
alone, make him ſo <hi>credible</hi> as he is
thought to be. And it is plainly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Author himſelf, who makes
<hi>Hermes</hi> a Native <hi>Phoenician,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apud <hi>Euſe.</hi> Pr. Ev. 1. 10. p. 36. A. 39. B.</note> and to be
made <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by one that was.
And this ſeems the moſt likely account
how the <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Seth</hi> (which I ſaid
ſeem to be the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>)
came to be placed by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in
<hi>Syria,</hi> that he had met them placed there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56952:23"/>
by ſome who were thus in Intereſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to place them ſo, to juſtifie their
other Fictions. Beſides <gap reason="foreign">

in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> by them who were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have it ſo, as has already
been obſerved. And the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Name
of <hi>Seth,</hi> ſo exactly agreeing with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Name, was a likely <hi>occaſion</hi> of miſtake,
and an <hi>Argument</hi> too, for them who had
rather have him believed to be a <hi>Hebrew</hi>

I oppoſe all the contrary, both <hi>Teſtimonies</hi>
and <hi>Arguments</hi> that might be produced
to prove that <hi>Hermes</hi> was a Native <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
and that <hi>Aegypt</hi> was never ſo ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> as to receive, nor
<hi>Phoenicia</hi> in ſuch a ſtrong and flouriſhing
condition, as to give them a <hi>King</hi> of their
own Nation. That is as many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as there are or have been <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Writers, not only <hi>after,</hi> but <hi>before</hi> the
publiſhing of this pretended <hi>Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon;</hi>
as many of them, at leaſt, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Hermes,</hi> as many of
them as wrote before theſe Diſputes of
Antiquity of Nations were ſtarted, as well
as they who wrote afterwards, to abet
parties now made, and to drive on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
by this time already formed to their

hand. The higheſt account of all the

by them who had then the curioſity to

amounted not to above five, and among
them no mention of any one that was a
<hi>Phoenician,</hi> a ſign none ſuch was ſo much
as challenged by them, till this pretended
<hi>Sanchoniathon.</hi> The ſame account is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by others afterwards, by <hi>Ampelius</hi>

fictitious <hi>Phoenician</hi> was not of that credit,
as to be thought worthy to encreaſe the
received Number. And theſe were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to be oppoſed to the true <hi>Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi>
himſelf. The Original Writings of

could have been Interpreted by none but
them, if we will allow any thing to the

But how much more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
are they to over-ſway the <hi>Vouchers</hi>
for <hi>him,</hi> and for all thoſe <hi>things</hi> alſo which
recommend him as ſo very creditable?
How much Antienter? How much freer

that <hi>Taautus</hi> either <hi>found</hi> or <hi>made</hi> all things
<hi>clear;</hi> that he Originally wrote them ſo
whatever he wrote upon his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
that he <hi>made</hi> them ſo, where he

But that the later <hi>Priests</hi> again
retrieved their <hi>Mythologies</hi> and Arts of

            <p>§. XVIII. BUT how many things are

such Publications of their <hi>Mysteries</hi>
if it lay in their power to do ſo? How

neither is this account of his Information,
any thing more creditable than the others.

               </gap>.
And it is obſervable, that <hi>Stephanus</hi> ſeems

<hi>Memoires</hi> of <hi>Gideon,</hi> might have given
him the Title of <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi>
a <hi>Stranger,</hi> a likely occaſion of ſuch
a miſtake. If they did ſo, then this it
ſelf had been a ſufficient Argument, that
they could not have been <hi>Gideon</hi>'s. And
then, what credit muſt that part of his
Hiſtory be of, which relyes on ſo uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable
Informations? And indeed, how
unlikely is it, that <hi>Gideon</hi> ſhould have
left ſuch <hi>Memoires</hi> behind him? In all
likelyhood, what had come from him,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56952:29"/>
would have been <hi>accounted Prophetical;</hi>
at leaſt, if it had been undoubted, would
have been made ſo by the atteſtation of
the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> who were by God himſelf

<hi>Prophets.</hi> Which is the moſt defenſible
way for aſſerting the Divinity of the <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous</hi>
Authors of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
And if ſo, what probability had there
been of their miſcarriage? Nay, ſuppoſing
them only <hi>Humane,</hi> and of no higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
among the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet, who can
think they would have neglected ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Monument of their <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
from ſo ſure a hand as <hi>Gideon</hi>'s? But there
is not the leaſt <hi>Memory</hi> of ſuch a work
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> not in their <hi>Canonical
Histories;</hi> not in the multitudes even of
<hi>Counterfeits,</hi> that were Antient, or were
ever received, even among the <hi>Helleniſts,</hi>
of which we have any account, either in
the Antient <hi>Stichometriae,</hi> or in any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Quotations;</hi> not ſo much as in any
<hi>Quotation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Canonical Writers</hi> that
lived near thoſe times, and quote ſeveral
extant then, which have ſince miſcarried,
as the Book of <hi>Jather,</hi> of the <hi>Wars of the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Not even in the Book of
<hi>Judges,</hi> where his Teſtimony had been
moſt uſeful for continuing the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56952:29"/>
Hiſtory, from the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to his
own time. Can we think they would
thus generally have neglected him, if they
had known him, or thought him Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine?
Can we think the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> would
have valued him, if his own <hi>Country-men</hi>
had ſo neglected him?</p>
            <p>§. XXIII. Certainly, if he ever had any
ſuch <hi>Memoires,</hi> or made uſe of them any
where, it muſt have been, moſt probably,
where he gives account of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> matters.
But his accounts concerning them, are ſo
full of <hi>miſtakes,</hi> of miſtakes ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
even with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Intereſt, as could
not, with any probability, have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned

a Teſtimony as that of <hi>Gideon.</hi> I

of his accounts of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> affairs, as far as

preſerved to us by <hi>Porphyry.</hi> He

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56952:30"/>
Philistines,</hi> ſo much abhorred
and deſpiſed by them? Would have
diſhonoured <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, ſo far as
to have made him a <hi>Heathen Deity,</hi> a
thing ſo deteſted by the <hi>Jews?</hi> He makes
him <hi>actually</hi> Sacrifice his Son. It is plain
what Intereſt obliged him to ſay ſo, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he might hereby give an account of
that Antient, but Inhumane Cuſtom, of
<hi>Sacrificing</hi> their own Children to him,
under the name of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Moloch.</hi> For
this was generally the deſign of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Myſteries,</hi> to commemorate ſome
memorable Action of their <hi>Deity.</hi> Thus
the pleaſure that <hi>Ceres</hi> took in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene
behaviour of <hi>Baubo,</hi> was comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated
in the <hi>Eleuſinian Myſteries.</hi> And
the like delight that <hi>Hercules</hi> took in the
<hi>Plow-man's Curſes,</hi> when he was eating
his Plow-Oxen, was alſo remembred with
the like <hi>Curſes</hi> ſtill repeated in the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the Worſhip of <hi>Hercules.</hi> But
what ground could he have in doing ſo,
from the <hi>Old Testament?</hi> He might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from the later <hi>Myſtical</hi> Expoſitions
of the <hi>Hellenists,</hi> who ſpeak of it as done,
becauſe it was reckoned to him as done in
the <hi>Divine acceptance, Gen.</hi> XXII. 16.
Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes he <hi>Offered him,

either in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe from any <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Records, nor conſequently could he have
theſe different Informations from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi>
of <hi>Gideon,</hi> unleſs we can ſuppoſe
them, not only different from all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Records of his <hi>Nation,</hi> but from
themſelves alſo, theſe things being the
Principal in this Author, that concern
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and yet, being ſo impoſſible to
have been taken from any <hi>Memoires</hi> of

Forger of this Author himſelf, as he did
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56952:31"/>
not <hi>uſe,</hi> ſo neither did he know of any
ſuch <hi>Memoires,</hi> either truly or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly

at leaſt, not owned for ſuch among the
<hi>Jews.</hi> Which as it is a clear conviction
of his deſigned diſingenuity in a matter
not excuſable by any pretence of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
ſo it will render him juſtly liable
to a ſuſpicion of a like diſingenuity in his
other fair pretences, though we had not
the like evidence of conviction of them.
At leaſt no ſuch pretences to means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
muſt be truſted on his <hi>word,</hi>
and there is no better pretended for
them.</p>
            <p>§. XXIV. BUT, to let the Informations
alone, the work it ſelf affords Intrinſick
Arguments enough of juſt ſuſpition. A
great occaſion of the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of thoſe
times, was the <hi>Emulation</hi> of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for glory of Inventions and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Hence it came to paſs, that of all
glorious Inventions, and of all Famous
Perſons, ſo very different and inconſiſtent
accounts are given by the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of
the ſeveral Rival Nations, each of them
challenging them for their own. Hence
ſuch a multitude of <hi>Jupiters, Hercules</hi>'s,
<hi>Aeſculapius</hi>'s, <hi>Diana</hi>'s, &amp;c. nay, and of
<hi>Homers</hi> too, different not only in Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56952:31"/>
but in Age too, yet pretending gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to the glory of the ſame Actions.
It muſt needs be, that of ſo inconſiſtent
reports concerning the ſame Perſon, all
but one muſt have been not miſtakes,
but deſigned <hi>Forgeries.</hi> Which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
note to ſhew that, as it was not unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
ſo neither was it new, to <hi>Forge</hi> on
ſuch occaſions. Yet they pretended ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to honeſt means of Information.
Now this pretended <hi>Sanchoniathon,</hi> is full
of this vanity of arrogating uſeful Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Perſons to his own <hi>Phoenicia.</hi>
Which, as they will prove him <hi>later</hi> than
theſe <hi>Aemulations</hi> of ſeveral Nations about

But becauſe I cannot tell what to ſay to

will not eaſily be diſcharged of it. For

What <hi>Joſephus</hi> had there produced in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was
very probably the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> alluded to by
<hi>Philo.</hi> I cannot think any other was

been the <hi>first</hi> that engaged in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
(he does not intimate in the leaſt

and becauſe the time was ſo ſhort between

be any new occaſion for any one elſe
to undertake that cauſe that <hi>Joſephus</hi> had
ſo very lately, and ſo accurately defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For <hi>Joſephus</hi> wrote his Books againſt

that very time. This could not chooſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56952:37"/>
but particularly move <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> as
being himſelf a <hi>Phoenician,</hi> and who might
very well have known <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf,
if he were Threeſcore and Eighteen years
old, at the Two hundred and Twentieth
<hi>Olympiad,</hi> as has been obſerved out of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idas,</hi>
though poſſibly the <hi>odd</hi> number of
the <hi>Olympiad,</hi> above Two hundred and
twenty, which is requiſite to make him
live to Write concerning the Empire of
<hi>Hadrian,</hi> is wanting. I mention not <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>'s
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which tells us more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
not the <hi>Olympiad</hi> only, but alſo
the very year wherein he conceives him
to have Written, becauſe it is of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But there was another thing
that added further to the reputation of
the <hi>Jews</hi> about that time. Their <hi>Eſſenes</hi>
had been in great reputation with as many
as had occaſion to hear of them, as a very
<hi>Philoſophical</hi> ſort of Perſons.<note place="margin">Nat. Hiſt. v. 17. de Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin. IV. §. 11. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Pliny</hi> the
Elder had mentioned them with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
as afterwards <hi>Porphyry</hi> did alſo.
But this concerned only their <hi>Philoſophy</hi>
of living. There was alſo among them,
others who had written <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
not only <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
in the time of <hi>Ptolomaes Philometor;</hi> not
only many others intimated, though not
named by <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56952:38"/>
if he ever lived to finiſh that work of the
Sentiments of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Praef. ad Antiq. in fin. &amp; Ant. xx. 9. &amp; ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi ſaepe.</note> ſo often promiſed
by him, as I doubt, he did not. Theſe,
by Myſticizing the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Moſes</hi> to
a ſenſe, not very diſtant from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
among the wiſeſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and
in a moſt elegant, rapturous, modiſh ſtyle
(ſuch was that of <hi>Philo</hi> particularly.)
They gained ſo much further on the good
opinion of the wiſe ones of that Age, as
to have their Nation, which had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been deſpiſed as <hi>Barbarous,</hi> now to paſs
among the Nations which were Famous
for Wiſdom. And the rather becauſe this
way of <hi>Myſticizing</hi> the <hi>Poets,</hi> for the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> into a <hi>Syſteme</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi>
was already taken up by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
and the other <hi>Dogmatical Philoſophers,</hi>
who were concerned for the defence of
the received <hi>Religions</hi> againſt the <hi>Atheiſts</hi>
and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who had
taken great advantage from thoſe <hi>Fables,</hi>
for expoſing them. Who had withall,
been herein imitated by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
who had <hi>Allegorized Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſtris,</hi> and
all their own moſt Antient Hiſtories.
From whom the <hi>Alexandrian Jews</hi> ſeem
willing to differ as little as was poſſible.
Accordingly <hi>Laertius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prooem. ad vit. Philoſ. p. 3. B.</note> who wrote not
long after, takes them into that Number;

among the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves,
which alſo commended them for that very
cauſe wherein they differed from the reſt
of Mankind. Such was that produced by

            <p>God might poſſibly in this Caſe, make

               <note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Pr. Ev. X. 10.</note> (very probably in
his Body of <hi>Philoſophy Collected out of
Oracles,</hi>) whereof ſome might have been
Antienter than the time of <hi>Philo Byblius.</hi>
I am not concerned to Diſpute what <hi>real</hi>
Credit theſe <hi>Oracles</hi> deſerved, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56952:39"/>
they could not chooſe but have been
very powerful recommendations to thoſe
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> who did actually believe them
<hi>Divine,</hi> and that is all for which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at preſent. To the ſame purpoſe,
alſo I refer the advantageous Characters
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the <hi>Orphaicks</hi>
firſt mentioned in theſe firſt times of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi>
And as <hi>Orpheus</hi> had among the
<hi>Heathens</hi> the Reputation of a <hi>Sacred</hi> and
<hi>Inſpired Perſon,</hi> ſo his word muſt have
been reverenced by them all, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> becauſe he was taken
for a great promoter of their <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
But there was yet a further reaſon that
might peculiarly recommend him to the
<hi>Aegyptians.</hi> That is, that he was, by
ſome Traditions, received by Perſons of
great Authority among themſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have been a <hi>Sacred Perſon</hi> to
the Deity of <hi>Heliopolis.</hi> So <hi>Chaeremon,</hi> a

               </gap> were

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56952:42"/>
prove the Author to have been a

Worſhip was particularly preſcribed, by
which their Idolatrous <hi>Prieſts</hi> in thoſe
times were guided.</p>
            <p>§. XXXIV. YET though the Author
of theſe Counterfeited works, pretending
to the name of <hi>Hermes</hi> were a <hi>Heathen,</hi> I
muſt withall grant, that the great Perſon
now mentioned, had an occaſion for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
him for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> from thoſe
frequent alluſions to the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
Scriptures, which he had obſerved in him.
But I have already ſhewn another way
how theſe <hi>Alluſions,</hi> not expreſs <hi>Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
might have been uſed by a <hi>Heathen</hi>
of that Age. That is, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiter
of them, might have been one
of that Set of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who had, as
has been ſhewn, taken in the <hi>Jewiſh Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>
into theirs, from the Writings of
<hi>Philo</hi> and ſuch others as had recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it to them, by their <hi>Myſtical Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of it. Accordingly, their Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
at the <hi>Second hand,</hi> as they found
them already produced by ſuch Writers
as they dealt with, not mentioning, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56952:43"/>
but very rarely, either <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Author,</hi>
as in all likelyhood they would, if they
had taken them immediately from the
<hi>Originals.</hi> And this Party was more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to propagate among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
(ſuch as theſe undoubtedly were who
Forged the Works of <hi>Hermes,</hi>) becauſe
the <hi>Alexandrian Jews</hi> were moſt Famous
both for <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> above
any of their Nation in any other Colony;
had multitudes of their <hi>Philoſophical
Eſſenes,</hi> and a flouriſhing <hi>Temple</hi> among
them to the days of <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> and did,
no doubt, ſuit their notions as near, as
Truth would give them leave, to the
<hi>received</hi> Doctrines of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> which
were very plauſible recommendations to
them. And when it had thus got into
the <hi>Hermetical Philoſophy,</hi> by this means
it was unawares inſinuated into thoſe who
were moſt averſe either to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or
the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, who yet had a
great Veneration for the <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as
was pretended, of the Antient and Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hermes. Longinus</hi> was one of them,
who yet wrote againſt the <hi>Christians.</hi>
And <hi>Porphyry</hi> another,<note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Pr. Ev. xv. 20.</note> who yet was one
of the greateſt Adverſaries, perhaps, that
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever had. And this was
the more likely to prevail among them,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56952:43"/>
when <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was taken for one of
their own <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and that of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi>
where thoſe very <hi>Pillars</hi> are pretended
to have been, from whence the Doctrine
of <hi>Mercury</hi> was pretended to have been
Collected, the cuſtody of which muſt, by
their cuſtoms, been properly his Province
as a <hi>Priest.</hi> So that on this account, they
might preſume his Doctrine to have been
the ſame with that of <hi>Mercury.</hi> But how
much more might they preſume it, if they
took his Perſon to have been the ſame
alſo? And ſome of them were of that
opinion, if we may believe <hi>Artapanus.</hi>
This I take to be a more likely account,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artap.</hi> ap. <hi>Euſ.</hi> Pr. Ev. ix. 27.</note>

a ſhrewd ſuſpicion that <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi>
was to ſay nothing but what <hi>Philo Byblius</hi>
would have him, that though we have
ſeen him ſo full of a partial <hi>deſign</hi> for the
honour of his Country; and though we
have ſeen him guilty of ſo many <hi>inſtances</hi>
of notorious <hi>diſingenuity</hi> in that regard;
and though this pretence concerning <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blos,</hi>
appears, from the <hi>Scripture</hi>-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> to have been as
groundleſs a <hi>fiction</hi> as any he had been
guilty of: Yet he ſhould yield to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>Philo,</hi> and make his <hi>Byblos</hi> a
more Antient City even than his own

than that of <hi>Byblos. Philo</hi> therefore

being thus concerned; and being, by his
concernment, prompted to ſay many
things both new and falſe, and which could
not be made appear from any Monuments

as it was indeed done very unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
ſo it ſeems (as I ſaid) to have been

making him hereby ſo far <hi>ſuperior</hi> in time

            <p>§. XXXVIII. AND having placed him
thus high, he was in courſe obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
his <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Information</hi> yet <hi>higher.</hi>
But being to give an account of <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Affairs, upon the Credit (as I ſaid) of
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teſtimonies, yet very different
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56952:47"/>
from thoſe which were owned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
among the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves; he
was therefore obliged to bethink himſelf
of ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Name to Father his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
upon, of whoſe <hi>Writings</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>
themſelves had never heard. And the
reaſons, why he was to make him a <hi>Priest,</hi>
might be of two ſorts: That he might
hereby recommend his Authors <hi>Credit,</hi>
becauſe thoſe moſt Antient accounts of
things were generally, as we have ſeen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <hi>Sacred Inſcriptions</hi> in <hi>Temples,</hi>
pretended alſo to have been written either
in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> or <hi>Sacred Characters,</hi>
to which as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were ſuppoſed to
have the eaſieſt acceſs, ſo they were alſo,
by thoſe <hi>Mystical Instructions</hi> which they
were obliged to know as <hi>Priests,</hi> beſt
qualified for underſtanding them: And
that he might alſo give an account why
ſuch <hi>unheard-of</hi> Writings might have been
ſo long concealed from <hi>Vulgar</hi> knowledg,
becauſe being <hi>Sacred,</hi> and written by a
<hi>Sacred Perſon,</hi> they might have been kept
within the <hi>Adyta,</hi> only among the <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
which might alſo give an account how
they might afterwards <hi>miſcarry,</hi> before
the pretended <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to quote them, though they might
have been ſuppoſed really extant when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56952:48"/>
he was to <hi>Collect</hi> his Obſervations from

into the <hi>Monuments</hi> of any place,
whether <hi>Historical,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophical,</hi> made

<hi>Eudoxus</hi> to <hi>Chonuphis,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> to <hi>Sech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphis.</hi>
And for <hi>Plato,</hi> on occaſion of
his <hi>Story</hi> of the Iſland <hi>Atlantis,</hi> and the
Exploits of his own Country-men the
<hi>Athenians</hi> againſt them, for which he was
beholden, not to any <hi>Athenian</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but only to thoſe pretended to by
the <hi>Aegyptian Saitane Prieſts:</hi> So he
thought himſelf concerned, as well as he
could, to defend their <hi>Credit,</hi> and to do
it by theſe degrees. Firſt, though this
was only a matter of <hi>Secular Hiſtory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In <hi>Tim.</hi> init.</note> yet
for the better recommendation of it, he
refers, not to <hi>Secular,</hi> but <hi>Sacred Records.</hi>
Next he aſſigns theſe <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> as
was undoubtedly moſt proper, to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56952:48"/>
cuſtody of the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Then he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
a Recommendation of the <hi>Credit</hi> of
their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> beyond any of other places
that might be oppoſed to them, from the
particular conveniences they enjoyed,
above others, for addicting themſelves
wholly to the employment of their own
Profeſſion, and their unmixedneſs with
the Prophane Vulgar. Accordingly they
who, before <hi>Sanchoniathon,</hi> pretended to
Publiſh their own Records, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>Priests.</hi> So was <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi>

and <hi>Chaeremon.</hi> And <hi>Manetho</hi> aſſumes
the Title in the very <hi>Dedication</hi> of his

greater credit to his performance. And
though the <hi>Jews</hi> pretended to no ſuch

kept their <hi>Sacred Books</hi> ſo reſerved from
the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> either in <hi>Sacred</hi> unknown

they alſo inſiſted on the ſame way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their own <hi>Records</hi> againſt the
<hi>Heathens</hi> who contradicted them. So
<hi>Joſephus</hi> alſo reaſons.<note place="margin">Cont. <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> L. 1. p. 1036.</note> He alſo derives his
<hi>Information</hi> from the <hi>Sacred Records</hi> of his

theſe <hi>Records</hi> the peculiar Province of

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56952:49"/>
of their <hi>Priests,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> had
uſed before him, their <hi>Separation</hi> from
<hi>Secular</hi> Employments, and their <hi>unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi>
with Vulgar <hi>Affinities.</hi> And as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he has occaſion to vindicate his <hi>own
Credit,</hi> either againſt <hi>Juſtus Tiberienſis,</hi>
or the then <hi>Gentile</hi> Authors who had given
other accounts of the <hi>Jewiſh War,</hi> than he

            <p>XLI. THIS <hi>Aegyptian Philoſophy</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being that which was ingredient in
moſt of the received <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, at leaſt
being pretended and conceived to be ſo,
how different ſoever the accounts were,
which were pretended from that ſame
Original; therefore <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> alſo
thought it fit to take it into his pretended
<hi>Sanchoniathon.</hi> And becauſe he had found
it Fathered on Authors who ſo little
agreed concerning the Particulars of it,
where it was to be had, and who muſt
therefore ſome of them be certainly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
it was therefore neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56952:53"/>
to ſome very <hi>certain means</hi> of <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
Accordingly he alſo pretends to
the <hi>Writings,</hi> not the Pillars of <hi>Taautus</hi>
or <hi>Mercury.</hi> Which, by the way, makes
it ſuſpicious that he took his Informations
from the Books as Publiſhed from the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liopolitane</hi>
Pillars, ſeeing he does not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſo much as pretend to the Original
Pillars themſelves; and yet to ſecure his
credit from being only at the <hi>Second hand,</hi>
he pretends that <hi>Mercury</hi> cauſed them to
be written Originally, not in Pillars, but
in Books. But becauſe ſo many before
him who had pretended to thoſe ſame
<hi>Writings,</hi> had yet miſtaken in <hi>Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them; he therefore contrives a likely
account how they might have a likely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſuch miſtakes, and yet himſelf
be free from the ſuſpicion of the like <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi>
He pretends therefore that the firſt
<hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> had extricated the
<hi>Philoſophical</hi> accounts of the firſt <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
of things, fnom the <hi>Mythological</hi> Arts
of concealment, wherein <hi>Antiquity</hi> had
involved them; and that it was ſome
while after, but yet before any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the Prieſts
had again involved them. Which yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done before <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s time, by whoſe
means they came to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was a plain
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56952:53"/>
occaſion how the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
thoſe latter accounts darkened pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
by the Prieſts, might be miſtaken.
Becauſe they had nothing to inform them
but theſe deſignedly obſcure <hi>Allegories,</hi>
which were both capable of many ſenſes
in themſelves; and if any certain ſenſe
had been preſerved, yet it had not been
eaſily diſcoverable by the <hi>Greeks</hi> without
the Prieſts, who, as I ſaid, were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to communicate any thing of that
nature to <hi>Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. XLII. AND by the ſame means he
had alſo provided an account how the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> themſelves might be miſtaken
concerning their own Philoſophy. For
thoſe Prieſts, who firſt involved them,
are ſaid to have delivered them down
thus obſcured, both to their own <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi>

<hi>Vigerus</hi> has rightly rendred it. It
ſeems then, that they muſt not have been
ſuppoſed to have cleared them, even to
ſuch as were <hi>initiated,</hi> which ſure they
would have done, if themſelves had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
any certain Tradition concerning
them. Accordingly they are ſuppoſed to
have continued under this obſcurity, till

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56952:54"/>
               <hi>Surmubelus</hi> and <hi>Thuro</hi> are ſaid to have

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For this
ſeems to have been the Notion of that
Sacred term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as it is uſed in the
counterfeit Writings of <hi>Mercury,</hi> (whom
this Author follows) and the Pen-men
of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> and other ſuch
Writers of that Age, for the <hi>Revelation</hi> of
<hi>Mysteries.</hi> I ſuppoſe from that Literal

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Theſe therefore I
ſuſpect to have been pretended for the
Authors of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to which this Author pretended, as has
already been obſerved. Wherein if I be
not miſtaken, it will then be further ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious,
that theſe Authors themſelves did
not ſo diſcover them as to make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the prophane <hi>Vulgar,</hi> but only ſo
as to retrieve the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
which had probably, by that time, quite
miſcarried, afterthy had been ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in their <hi>Brests,</hi> and intruſted only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56952:54"/>
to <hi>Oral-Tradition.</hi> For, if theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
had been deſigned for the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> the
<hi>Writings</hi> which contained them, would
not have been ſtyled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               </gap>, and by that means

as they are ſuppoſed to have been. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, by the preſent extant Epiſtle of

muſt not have been for divulging their
<hi>Myſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. XLIII. AND in giving this account
how all that had before him, written on
this Subject, might have been miſtaken,
he at the ſame time ſecured his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the like Exceptions. For
having pretended before, that <hi>Taautus</hi>
had written his Books clear from thoſe
<hi>Mythologies</hi> and <hi>Allegories</hi> wherein they
had been involved by the <hi>Priests,</hi> and
were afterwards again involved till they
were a ſecond time unriddled by <hi>Surmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belus</hi>
and <hi>Thuro;</hi> and having made his <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choniathon</hi>
derive his Information imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
both from <hi>Taautus</hi>'s own Books,
and from the Books of thoſe <hi>Expoſitors,</hi>
who afterwards retrieved his way of
ſpeaking clearly without <hi>Allegories:</hi> He
had hereby ſecured himſelf of two things
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56952:55"/>
of great moment for recommending his
<hi>Credit.</hi> One was, that his <hi>Informations</hi>
were derived from clear and unobſcured
<hi>Originals,</hi> not from <hi>Allegorical</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand
accounts, from them who had
no mind to be underſtood by thoſe to
whom they communicated their <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
Another was that, even for thoſe
<hi>Originals</hi> themſelves, he did not depend
on a ſingle Authority. The conſent of
the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> with thoſe of
the <hi>Ammonians,</hi> were to be mutual atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
of the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of each, (at leaſt
would be pleaded as ſuch by him) that
neither the Original Writings of <hi>Taautus,</hi>
nor thoſe retrievements from the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
might ſeem ſuſpitious of being the
Fictions of thoſe who <hi>firſt</hi> produced
them. For having pretended them to be
from diſtant <hi>Writers,</hi> and diſtant places,
and <hi>Sacred</hi> inacceſſible <hi>Records;</hi> it would
be pretended that there could not have
been that <hi>Communication</hi> between them,
as to make them able to agree in Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Yet was not this excluding of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
to be underſtood ſo, as if he had
avoided all <hi>Fables;</hi> but particularly with
reſpect to the <hi>Stoical</hi> way, whether by
them derived to the later <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or
borrowed from them. That was to <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorize</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56952:55"/>
their firſt Hiſtories into a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a Syſteme of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> to make
<hi>Jupiter</hi> ſignifie the <hi>Aether, Juno</hi> the <hi>Air,
Veſta</hi> the <hi>Earth, Neptune</hi> the <hi>Sea, &amp;c.</hi>
and ſo to <hi>Allegorize</hi> the Hiſtory of the
<hi>Actions</hi> of thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> into a Hiſtory of
<hi>Nature;</hi> as if indeed there had never been
ſuch <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Perſons,</hi> but only that the
ſeveral <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> had been
<hi>Myſtically</hi> repreſented by ſuch <hi>Names,</hi> and
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> had, by a <hi>Poetical
Proſopopoeia,</hi> been turned into a <hi>Romance.</hi>
That theſe were indeed the <hi>Allegories</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by <hi>Philo Byblius,</hi> appears by theſe

the other <hi>Antients</hi> who firſt began to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
this way with the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) I ſay
with all theſe wayes, they made it indeed
ſeem likely, if not concerning all that was
ſaid of thoſe <hi>Perſons,</hi> yet concerning many
of them, that they were not ſo much as
deſigned for Hiſtorical Truths, but only
for <hi>Allegorical Repreſentation.</hi> Yet theſe

the ſame <hi>Authority</hi> which delivered the
deſigned Hiſtories; muſt therefore render
all their Hiſtories liable to juſt Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>
            <p>§. XLIV. NOR does it ſeem to have
been the way of <hi>Allegorizing</hi> only, that
<hi>Philo</hi> found fault with in the <hi>Greek</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that uncertainty of their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which neceſſarily followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
but alſo the indecorouſneſs of
their <hi>Allegories</hi> to their <hi>Deities,</hi> which
the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> before, but now
in <hi>Philo</hi>'s time, the <hi>Christians</hi> had lately
made great advantage of, for expoſing

ſo does his performance agree with

<hi>Philo,</hi> or his <hi>Injudiciouſneſs</hi> in his choice
out of extant Hiſtories, what he was to
Father on his <hi>Sanchoniathon,</hi>) we have
ſome things intermixed, which neither are
likely to have been true, nor to have
been deſigned for ſuch by the Authors;
nay ſeem to have been deſigned for no
other than <hi>Allegorical</hi> ſenſes, and that in
the worſt moſt indefenſible way of <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing,</hi>
from which he had pretended to
vindicate their received Religion. He
makes his <hi>Saturn Emaſculate</hi> his Father
<hi>Ouranus.</hi> Here is one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which
he had before reckoned among the moſt
<hi>Scandalous</hi> ſort of <hi>Allegories.</hi> But this he
may poſſibly pretend to have been done
by his <hi>Man Saturn,</hi> who was afterwards
by miſtake made a <hi>God,</hi> eſpecially as the

the <hi>Man</hi> it might have been Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
true, and deſigned for no more by
his pretended <hi>Sanchoniathon.</hi> But what
ſhall we ſay to that which follows, where
he makes the Blood that flowed from the
wound of <hi>Ouranus</hi> to have <hi>paſſed into the
Springs and Rivers?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Blood, and from ſuch a wound as that
was, to have flowed into the <hi>Fountains</hi>
and <hi>Rivers?</hi> Certainly this could have
been meant for no other but an <hi>Allegory.</hi>
It is like what is told concerning <hi>Oſiris</hi>
among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the tears of
<hi>Sophia</hi> among the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> who ſeem
to have borrowed much of their <hi>Hereſie</hi>
from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> where it firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And I can hardly doubt, but that this
was intended by the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom
he took it, to ſhew the true <hi>Original</hi> of
<hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> that the <hi>Waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Firmament,</hi> as the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes
them, were derived from thoſe

               </gap>, in the larger Notion of it, as it
includes the <hi>Air</hi> alſo. And poſſibly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
this as taken from <hi>Taautus</hi> an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,</hi>
by the <hi>Rivers</hi> might be meant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56952:58"/>
the ſeveral <hi>Oſtia</hi> and <hi>Cuts</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> from
which no doubt all the <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
proceeded, which were accordingly
turned alſo into <hi>Blood,</hi> when <hi>Nilus</hi> was ſo;
and then he might allude to the Tradition
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that <hi>Nilus</hi> was derived
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us.</p>

               </gap>, was becauſe, of all thoſe many

to that which derived it from the

I ſaid in the larger Senſe, whether from

<hi>Popular</hi> Opinions are moſt likely to have
been intended by the <hi>Mythologers.</hi> And to
prove that this was ſo, we cannot have a
fitter Teſtimony than this of <hi>Homer.</hi> He is
one of the moſt <hi>Antient</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
As a <hi>Poet,</hi> he is moſt ſuited to <hi>Vulgar</hi>

He was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Born, of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56952:59"/>
the <hi>Aegyptian Thebes,</hi> if we may believe

the <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> of this <hi>River</hi> above

will alſo afford a new Argument againſt

pretended falſly that <hi>Taautus</hi> was free
from theſe <hi>Phyſiological Allegories,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from the <hi>Scandalous</hi> ſort of them, and

needs have known from the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if he had indeed any ſuch Books,
whether any ſuch matter was ſo much as
pretended by him. If it was <hi>pretended,</hi> but
<hi>falſly;</hi> that will ruine the Credit of <hi>Taau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
himſelf, and make him ſuſpicious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And this will alſo be another convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> alſo thought fit to

might alſo have the double Title to that

ſome who had found it, and in deſcribing

the <hi>Poem,</hi> to have given an account
of their Sentiments, on thoſe Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which that Age was ſo very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
and curious. Yet it alſo became it to
derive them from <hi>Atlas,</hi> and ſo to fit their
Opinions to his Perſon. Or perhaps it might
rather have been that yet more antient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Solon,</hi> concerning the <hi>Atlantes</hi> in

of theſe, rather than <hi>Timaeus,</hi> it is probable

            <p>§. XLVII. THUS I have endeavoured to
give an account of the deſign of this whole
<hi>Fiction,</hi> and that ſuch a one as might agree
both with the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Philo
Byblius.</hi> I have ſhewn what liberty the
<hi>Principles</hi> of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> allowed
them for the Practice of ſuch <hi>diſingenuities.</hi>
I have ſhewn how little ſuch an Author as
<hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> was known before the time
of <hi>Philo Byblius,</hi> notwithſtanding all the
ſearch that had been made into the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Records,</hi> and how little <hi>regarded</hi> after.
I have ſhewn how little he ſavoured of the
Antient <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and how much of the
<hi>Modern Emulations.</hi> I have ſhewn how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
creditable he is in his pretended means
of <hi>Information,</hi> and how far from that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> for which he would
have it believed, that his <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> was
ſo particularly remarkable. I have ſhewn
that thoſe means themſelves are alſo ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
either that they never were extant, as
the <hi>Memoires</hi> of <hi>Gideon;</hi> or that they were
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56952:62"/>
Counterfeited themſelves, as the <hi>Writings</hi>
of <hi>Taautus</hi> and the <hi>Ammonians,</hi> and that
long after the time that <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> is
pretended to have lived in; that he could
have followed no <hi>Jewiſh Records</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> matters; and that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Writings of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the
<hi>Ammonians,</hi> divulged ſo long after his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Age, are rather Convictions of his
<hi>Falſe-hood,</hi> than a Recommendation of his
<hi>Credit.</hi> I have endeavoured alſo, as far as I
could gueſs from the <hi>Circumstances</hi> he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, to give a particular account of the
<hi>occaſion</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of each particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the management of this whole
<hi>Fraud.</hi> And I know not what can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired

            <p>§. XLVIII. NOR can I ſee that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
will in the leaſt injure the Cauſe for
which thoſe <hi>Pious</hi> as well as <hi>Learned</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have been concerned, who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made uſe of this Author for <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi>
or <hi>confirming</hi> ſome <hi>Historical</hi> or
<hi>Philoſophical</hi> paſſages of <hi>Scripture.</hi> If there
were any of theſe <hi>Heathen Antiquities,</hi> that
could either pretend to the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
or to that even <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Evidence
of being <hi>genuine,</hi> there might then be ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56952:63"/>
pretence for reconciling or confirming
ſome paſſages of the Scriptures by them
for their uſe who did not grant the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Sacred</hi> Writers above their
own in regard of their <hi>Divine Inſpiration.</hi>
But we never hear of any of thoſe <hi>Heathen</hi>
accounts of things mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
before the Tranſlation of the LXXII
put them into an <hi>Emulation.</hi> Then it was
that <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and <hi>Manetho,</hi> and <hi>Menander,</hi>
and <hi>Laetus</hi> firſt made and publiſhed their
Enquiries. No mention of the <hi>Chaldaean
Xiſuthrus,</hi> nor of the <hi>Aegyptian Hyeſi,</hi> nor

in <hi>Cteſias</hi> or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or
any of thoſe more Antient <hi>certainly-genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi>
Writers. When they did publiſh them,
the very <hi>Records</hi> pretended for them
make them ſuſpicious of Forgery. They
were pretended only from <hi>Sacred Pillar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

challenged in ſeveral places, yet not acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

them. But the Scriptures were only
then <hi>Tranſlated.</hi> The <hi>Originals</hi> were extant

by any who had the curioſity to learn
their <hi>Tongue.</hi> I do not inſiſt on the <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

becauſe I find no better Arguments for it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56952:63"/>
than gueſſes that <hi>Plato</hi> had ſome things from the
Sacred Writings, which I believe he had not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that ſuch a <hi>Suppoſition</hi> is directly contrary to
the much better atteſted Story of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Tranſlation performed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus.</hi> I rather chooſe
thoſe more Antient inſtances of <hi>Theopompus</hi> the
Hiſtorian, and <hi>Theodectes</hi> the Poet, who had ſeen
and underſtood theſe Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> before
the Tranſlation of <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> as we are aſſured
by <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> in <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Ant. xii. 2.</note> beſides that
even the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> one of the lateſt of them,

believe <hi>Joſephus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ant. xi. 8.</note> So that even from the <hi>Greeks</hi> we
have as early Evidence of their being known, as
we have of their being enquired after, or of their
being in a capacity to underſtand them; and there
can be no reaſon to expect earlier. Beſides the
repugnancy of thoſe other Nations to each other,
and of the different Authors even of the ſame
Nation,<note place="margin">Cont. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</hi> L. 1. p. 1036. F.</note> were certain Arguments that they did
not write from the ſame uniform and true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi>
as the <hi>Jews</hi> who all agreed in the ſame
Books, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves. And for the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
that of the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> muſt in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
have been received from them before the
time of the LXXII. both becauſe the <hi>Samaritanes</hi>
were before that ſo exaſperated by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as
that it is not likely they would receive any ſuch
thing from them, and becauſe it ſhould ſeem the
<hi>Prophets</hi> were not then collected by the <hi>Jews</hi>
that they might have been delivered to them,
and becauſe they ſtill preſerve it in the <hi>Old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Character, not in that which was afterwards
introduced by <hi>Eſdras.</hi> Upon all theſe accounts it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56952:64"/>
cannot be thought reaſonable either to oppoſe
theſe <hi>Heathen</hi> accounts to the Scriptures, or to
think that any thing can be made more credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Scriptures, becauſe it is confirmed by
the conſent of ſo exceptionable Authorities. I
have rather ſhewn that the occaſion of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
in <hi>Philoſophical</hi> matters, was rather
their imitating and allowing the Authority of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and making him the Standard of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which may indeed be of uſe for
ſhewing Hiſtorically how that part of <hi>Moſes</hi> was
actually underſtood from thoſe times wherein
theſe Heathen accounts were firſt produced; but
can be of no farther uſe for ſhewing either the
ſenſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or how the antient firſt Deliverers
of his Doctrine did actually underſtand him,
than as theſe things may be inferred, or preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
from the actual ſenſe of thoſe later times,
wherein theſe <hi>Heathen Antiquities</hi> firſt appeared.</p>
