         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Our Account of the <hi>French</hi> Supplies are
different, it is certain there are but Four Regiments, one Red, one
Blew, and two White, and the most they pretend is 1400 Men in
a Regiment. The Supplies of Stores are 1000 Barrels of Powder,
Ten Field Pieces, Four Mortars, with Bombs, Corcases, Ball, and
other Necessaries for War, as Pistols, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the quantity not
known. They are Eight Battalions, whereof Four are <hi>Switzers</hi> and
<hi>Walloons,</hi> and other Strangers, as several <hi>German</hi> Prisoners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
300 <hi>English, Irish</hi> and <hi>Scotch.</hi> That the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> had been
with K. <hi>J.</hi> at <hi>Cork</hi> near two Months, in order to take the <hi>English,
Irish</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> that came from <hi>France</hi> into his Regiment, but Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General <hi>Layson</hi> would not suffer him to have a Man. That
one of the <hi>French</hi> Regiments is as far as <hi>Waterford,</hi> on their March,
and stay there till they hear how we move.</p>
                  <p>There is already Shipt aboard the <hi>French</hi> Fleet Five Regiments of
<hi>Irish</hi> design'd for <hi>France,</hi> viz <hi>Mack-Carty</hi>'s, Coll. <hi>Brown</hi>'s, Coll.
<hi>Charles O Bryan</hi>'s, Coll. <hi>Butler</hi>'s, and Coll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Fielding</hi>'s, all Foot.
They say they forc'd some Protestants Aboard the <hi>Irish,</hi> they run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away so fast. Their Eight Regiments of Dragoons are in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad condition, as also Four Regiments of Horse are worse. For
<pb facs="tcp:39485:2"/>
a Barrel of Oates being sold in <hi>Dublin</hi> for Twenty Shillings, and but
few to be had, they feed their Horses with Grain and Pease-straw,
and their Work-horses are so weak, that Carriages are not to be had.
Their Spring comes on apace about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and if Grass can be had
their numbers will make them more formidable; at present they are
in a very ill condition, and three Weeks hence will be worse. A
Price is set on Bread in <hi>Dublin,</hi> but with this difference, that a Loaf
they would formerly sell for three Pence is now sold for a Shilling,
and also instead of being all Wheat, it is compos'd of Wheat, Pease
and Barley; and it is a melancholly sight to see the Bakers Houses
so throng'd and beset with People, and oftentimes can't get Bread
in three or four days. The Lord <hi>Dunganon</hi>'s House called <hi>Young's</hi>
Castle is quite demolish'd, and the Timber thereof carried to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to make Fuel, and all the Trees and Hedges in and about the
<hi>Phoenix</hi> in the Deer Park are cut down, and the Deer, which were
above 2000 Brace were destroyed; they say it is to save the Grass
for a Campaign.</p>

Coll. <hi>Motles,</hi> and their Forces at <hi>Dundalk, Ardee, Cavan</hi> Castle,
<hi>Blany</hi> and <hi>Drogheda</hi> are in a bad condition, dying in great numbers
for want of Provision, and other Conveniencies; there were at <hi>Ardee</hi>
300 sick at once the last Week. Coll. <hi>Sarsfield</hi> is come from
the Borders of <hi>Cavan,</hi> and Brigadeer <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moy</hi>
is going to Govern there; <hi>Sarsfield</hi> is faln sick since he came to
<hi>Dublin.</hi> The death of Coll. <hi>Nugient</hi> is much lamented by the <hi>Irish,</hi>
being a fit Instrument for any Barbarity; he was killed at <hi>Cava<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

with many Brave stout Fellows; the <hi>English</hi> being not half their
numbers, always routed and killed abundance, though the <hi>Irish</hi>
were all pickt Men. The Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> was there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had two
