         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Treatiſe to your
<pb facs="tcp:18366:3"/>
Ladiſhip, are three; your
Knowledge, your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and my owne Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
For the firſt; as
it is to you a ſingular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
and Content, ſo
is it to me a ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
for you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
more to underſtand,
then I doe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
Had I written to
your Ladiſhip in the
Roman Language, the
French, the Italian, or the
<pb facs="tcp:18366:3"/>
Spaniſh, they had beene
almoſt as familiar to you
as this your native
Tongue, in which you
are Miſtreſſe of ſo great
an Elegancy, that no
words are ſo fit as your
owne, to eternize your
owne actions. But theſe
are only the conveyances
of Learning, the vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
whereof you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd,
and in every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
part of it are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18366:4"/>
of as much, as the
want of an Academicke
education, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
divertments incident
to your ſexe, permit. And
of this ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Modeſty keeps the
key, and ſhuts out Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
not ſuffering a
word to iſſue forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Grace to attend it.
Hence it comes to paſſe,
that as it is impoſsible to
handle perfumes without
<pb facs="tcp:18366:4"/>
bearing away part of their
ſent; ſo to converſe with
you without favouring
of your goodneſſe. Nor
does your Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
reliſh of your ſweet
Diſpoſition; for you reade
not of a vertue, which you
forthwith put not into
act, &amp; adde to it a greater
beauty, then it had in the
Example from which
you deriv'd it. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
Madam, of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:18366:5"/>
your Excellencies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in me a beliefe, that
this portraiture (though
imperfect) of the prime
Preſident of femall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
would prove a
Preſent moſt acceptable
to your Ladiſhip, to
whoſe innocency you
makes as neer an approach
as any thing mortall can
doe. Should I ſay you
are without ſinne, I
ſhould impiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict

the Scriptures;
ſhould I ſay you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I ſhould unjuſtly goe
againſt mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for neither I, nor I
think, Envy her ſelf could
ever yet diſcover in you
the leaſt imperfection.
Sure I am if you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
they are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
unleſſe you place
your owne Conſcience
for a witneſſe, which it
will not better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:18366:6"/>
to judge it ſelfe, then
it will doe my Charity
to cleare it. Nor is this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of yours froward and
formall, but gentle, free,
and communicative. You
ſhew the world that there
is a chriſtian freedome, of
which we may lawfully
partake. By your faire
Demeanour you cleerly
demonſtrate, that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and vertue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb facs="tcp:18366:6"/>
ſociable, and that
ſhee is more fruitfull in
ſociety, than in ſolitude.
This teſtimony, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
Truth, and the
people (whoſe Regiſter
I am) commanded mee
to give You, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to Poſterity. I
cannot deſcend to ſuch
baſeneſſe, as to flatter
you, yet (if I ſhould,)
would not you be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
who are like a

ſweet Inſtrument, that
ſends forth a delightfull
ſound without being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of its owne Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
No, no, heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
my lines ſhould bee
like thoſe Sacrifices, out
of which they uſed to
plucke the heart, but leave
the tongue behinde. I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

would not give you the

to me odious. But wee
muſt warily diſtinguiſh

we cannot over-worſhip
the true Deity, ſo wee
cannot over-praiſe a true
Piety. It onely now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth,
that I offer up to
your Ladiſhip, two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions;
the firſt of which
is, that you would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to permit this Booke,
under your gratious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
to doe that
where you are not, which
you performe where you
are; that is, to confirme
<pb facs="tcp:18366:9"/>
the good, and convert the
bad. The next is, that
your Ladiſhip would
be pleaſed to accept of my
ſubmiſsive Gratitude,
which, though great, can
be no way proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the infinity of your
favours. Theſe I would
endeavour here to ſumme
up, were I not deterred
from the attempt by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility,
and your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Nature, to which
<pb facs="tcp:18366:9"/>
nothing is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing,
than thankes
for an old Benefit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more pleaſing,
than the conferring of
a new. I chooſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
of Ingratitude,
than of offending your
Ladiſhippe, whoſe
ſervice next to that

Honourer of your

not a Glaſſe wherein a Babe, a
Foole, or a Monſter may ſee it
ſelfe, as well as you. By this you
cannot curle your haires, fill up

<pb facs="tcp:18366:11"/>
looks, that Nature who made
you, knowes you no more, but
utterly forgets her owne Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
By this you cannot lay
ſpots on your faces, but take them
out of your ſoules, you may. By
this you cannot compoſe your
Countenances, but your Mindes
you ſhall, and give them a never

This Glaſſe will not flatter
you, nor if you be angry with it
for ſhewing your Deformities,
can you breake it. Both the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

all internall, and therefore not

of the reprobate. All her Viſitants
were but ſo many Converts,
whoſe bad affections, and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

benefit, ſhee did to her owne
kinde. Neither doth ſhe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require your Gratitude, but
your Imitation, whoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
perfection farre excels all
<pb facs="tcp:18366:14"/>
your ſo long vanted maſculine
merits. I doubt not but by the
more, and leſſe knowing of
you, I ſhall be diverſly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The firſt will argue mee of
indiſcretion in that I choſe not
a Matter of a higher nature
whereby to make a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of my ſufficiency. To
theſe I ſhape this anſwer, that
my Invention could not ſoare
higher, for whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
her perſon, or her divine
Gifts, ſhee is in Dignity next
God himſelfe. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſo ſublime a ſtraine as
Vertue, which enters Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:18366:14"/>
when Subtility and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
are juſtly excluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
is vertue muſt ſave us; for in
knowledge the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
farre exceeds us. There is
no Argument, as I take it, ſo
important, or concernes us ſo
much as that of our ſalvation.
Theſe men would have mee
buſie my ſelfe in the Phyſicks,
to finde out of what, not
wherefore I am made: Or in
the Mathematickes, to learne
how farre it is to Heaven, not
how to come thither: Or in
Divinity, to bee inquiſitive
whether or no Chriſts mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb facs="tcp:18366:15"/>
feeding of ſo many, was
by augmentation, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Loaves and
Fiſhes: Whether or no they
who were born with ſight, &amp;
afterwards loſt it, being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it againe by Chriſt, ſaw
better after the Cure, than
they did before their blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
And whether or no the
Dead, who roſe with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
aſcended with him, or
were againe reduc't to duſt.
To theſe needleſſe accute fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
I aſpire not. How many
are there now in Hell, who
while they liv'd here, were
<pb facs="tcp:18366:15"/>
eſteem'd the Organs of the
Sciences, the Temples of
VViſedome, nay Oracles, as
if they had beene form'd in
Heaven, and ſent downe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full fraught with Gods
owne ſecrets, yet now deteſt
their former vaine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as much as the Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
they lived in? But in this
kingdome of Woe and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
none of vertues ſubiects
ever reſided. Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cenſure on, they ſhall not
ſo much as ſhake my ſecurity;
for I know it fares with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Learning, as with the
<pb facs="tcp:18366:16"/>
Vniverſe, wherein there are
more Delinquents then Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
The opinions of theſe I
can well tollerate, becauſe they
proceed from Science, though
erronious. But there are ſome
whom I have heard to paſſe
their caſting verdicts on the
moſt meriting Authors, who
deſerve themſelves to bee
hang'd for ſo often violating
their owne mother tongue,
did not their ignorance pleade
their pardon. Let theſe poore
wretched things, who what
they heare in the laſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
vent for their owne in the
<pb facs="tcp:18366:16"/>
next, ſhare amongſt them my
ſcorne, and pitty, as being far
below my anger. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that he who feares the
pale meager Family of the
Zoili, muſt onely write to his
owne <hi>Lar.</hi> If to the truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
the truely underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I can approve theſe my
humble indeavours, and draw
any one ſoule, but one degree
nearer to goodneſſe, my holy
ambition, and my no ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſhall receive an ample
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It now remaines that as to
theſe latter, I ſeeke to approve
<pb facs="tcp:18366:17"/>
all my actions, ſo to them I
likewiſe eſſay to iuſtifie this
preſent worke. I am the firſt
(to my knowledge) who hath
written in our vulgar tongue
on this our bleſſed Virgin,
drawne thereto I confeſſe by
the ſtrength rather of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than of ability. Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I profeſſe that I am her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer,
not her Idolater, and
that I no way allow of their
profane cuſtome, who robbe
God of his Honour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
it on her. But this I will
ſay, that though I impute not
the late troubles and afflictions
<pb facs="tcp:18366:17"/>
of the Proteſtant party in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to the ſmall reverence
there paid her (many of Gods
iudgements according to
Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> being ſecret, none
uniuſt) yet truely I beleeve
that the undervaluing of one
ſo great, and deere in Chriſts
eſteeme, cannot but bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to him, and that the
more we aſcribe to her (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Invocation apart) the
more gratious we appeare in
his fight. I have beene as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in the penning of this
Treatiſe, as poſſibly I could,
and (in imitation) of Vertues
<pb facs="tcp:18366:18"/>
owne ſelfe) have kept the
meane. But all pretenders to
Divinity know, that without
the helpe of Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
we can ſpeake little of
her life, or death, ſo ſparing is
the holy Writ in the mention
of her. The ſcholaſticall and
Eccleſiaſtical Writers inſerted
in this Booke to truſt, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
too much, is alike erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and therefore I referre all
to the diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Reader.
I will onely adde this; that
ſince the finiſhing of this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I have read a booke of the
now Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<pb facs="tcp:18366:18"/>
               <hi>Apparatus, &amp;c.</hi> and
am glad to finde that I have
not digreſſed from him in any
one particular. I conclude
with this proteſtation, that if
I have ſwerved in any the leaſt
point from the tenents recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Engliſh Church, I
ſhall bee moſt ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my ſelfe a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. Farewell.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Iſtory offers to our
view, Myriads of
holy Virgins in
Beauty, and vertue
equally attractive,
whoſe due praiſe
the Catholike Church doth at this
day ſolemnely ſing, but with a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18366:44"/>
more elevated voyce (as duty on
our part, and merit on hers
commands) the laud of that moſt
excellent Princeſſe, the Virgin
Mother of God. There be who
affirme that what ever the Creator
ſaw beautifull in heaven, or earth,
he beſtowed in the limming of
this rare Piece, not that ſhe might
be ſtiled the moſt faire amongſt
the daughters of women, but by a
heavenly prerogative, the alone
Faire, the alone Lovely. Looke
how many parts,<note place="margin">Her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Beauty.</note> ſo many arts you
might diſcerne of the Celeſtiall
Limmer. And this is no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to reaſon it ſelfe;<note place="margin">Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> for if
Chriſt was faire above the ſonnes
of men, ſhould not ſhe be ſo above
their Daughters, ſince from her
alone he received his fleſh? <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen</hi> proclaimes that
ſhe ſurpaſs'd all women in loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18366:44"/>
               <hi>Andraeas</hi> ſayes that ſhe was a
Statue carved by Gods own hand.
Others of thoſe firſt, and purer
times not without admiration, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that God was almoſt fifty
Ages in the meditation of the
ſtructure of this ſtately Pallace.
And truely our beliefe may eaſily
digeſt this, that his omnipotency
would make her fit to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Son, Empreſſe of this
lower world, and the bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
through which ſhould paſſe
the myſtery of mans Redemption.
Yet finde I a ridiculous deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> a Prieſt of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who affirmes that
her Face was of the colour of
Wheate, her viſage long, and her
noſe ſutable, her haire yellow, and
her eye-browes blacke. But what
authority he hath for this, neither
I, nor I thinke he himſelfe can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18366:45"/>
well tell; for ſurely ſimple Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
was not either curious, or
skilfull to deliver it by tradition,
or picture to poſterity. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he had it from his owne
dreames, or rather fancy. <hi>Mopſa</hi>
is as much beholding to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable,
and inimitable <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
for a delineation, as is my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ſubject to this curious Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
Whether, her beauty
chiefly conſiſted in colour, in
Symmetry of parts, or both I
know not: ſure I am the ſtreame
of other more judicious, pious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
carries me not into an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a ſtrong beleefe of her
heavenly forme. Cardinall <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and <hi>Galatinus,</hi> (with what
truth I cannot ſay) certainely with
more probability then he, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that her excellent tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
her conformity of members,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18366:45"/>
her firme and conſtant Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
free'd her from all contagion
and diſeaſes. And <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> goes
further, affirming that ſhe was no
other then a walking Spring. Such
variety of ſweet odours her very
pores breath'd out on all that
came neare her; as we reade of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>
living body, and the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
Carkaſſes which by a
thin ſpare dyet obſerved in life,
even after death ſent forth a moſt
ſweet perfume. <hi>Sylvanus Razzius</hi>
recounts a pleaſing ſtory of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Clerke, who by many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
implor'd, and obtain'd the
bleſſing of her ſight, but with this
condition, that he ſhould ſee her
but with one eye, and that one he
ſhould loſe. He willingly embrac't
it, but when ſhe appear'd dreſt in
all her Beames, not being able
with one eye to take a full view
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18366:46"/>
of her, he opened the other alſo,
chuſing rather to forfeit his ſight
for ever, then to looſe one minute
of the inconceiveable content he
enjoyed in the ſight of ſo glorious
a ſpectacle. Were this true, it
would make a brave example of a
devout ſoule raviſht with the view
of a divine object.</p>
            <p>If the Inne was ſo ſplendent,<note place="margin">Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Beauty.</note> ſo
ſumptuous, what may we thinke
of the amiable gueſt, that lodg'd in
it, her minde, beſet with thoughts
cleare, and radiant as her owne
eyes? He that dares attempt the
expreſſion of theſe her internall
gifts is ignorant of her ſublimity;
he who dares not, knows not her
humanity, her ſweetneſſe. As no
ſtile can aſcend ſo high as her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
worth, ſo on the other ſide
none can deſcend ſo low as her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18366:46"/>
Humility. Encourag'd therfore by
her meekneſſe, not my owne ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,
I ſhall endeavour to
limme her ſoule in little (ſince in
great neither my time, nor ability
will let me) which will appeare an
enterpriſe as hardy, and vaine as
his who ſhould ſtrive to limmit the
light, or circumſcribe the Ayre.
Know then, modeſt Reader (and
receive this knowledge with the
ſame extaſie, and zeale I write it)
that her internall luſter was farre
greater then her externall, like in
this unto the Tents of Kedar, as
ſoone cover'd with duſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
burned up with the heat of
the Sunne, as ſoone beaten, and
ſhaken with tempeſtuous weather,
but in the meane time inwardly all
glittering with glory, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.
O ye Angels, to you it is
onely given, not to ſinne, but on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18366:47"/>
her is conferr'd what you cannot
merit, to beare, and the reparation
of mans ruine. The Apoſtles, thoſe
holy Tapours of the primitive
Church ſometimes burnt dimme,
and were obſcur'd with the fogge
of ſinne, but her brightneſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vitious could leſſen, much
leſſe utterly extinguiſh. She was,
indeed, vertues prime, and great
example, and all the accompliſht
women of the Ages paſt, preſent,
or to come have grace, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the full in being called her
imperfect Coppies.</p>
            <p>Here my Invention treads a
Maze, and my heart is divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
an earneſt deſire to praiſe
her to the height, and a holy feare
leſt in that praiſe I ſhould trench
on Gods own peculiar. Attributes.
That ſhe was no way inferiour to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18366:47"/>
her Sonne, according to the fleſh,
I dare not with ſome avouch, who
magnifie her in a phraſe that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
her modeſty, and makes her
bluſh at her owne exaltation. Her
lowlineſſe was ſuch that it was
nearer the rejecting of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
then entertaining a
compariſon betweene her ſelfe,
and him to whom ſhe had profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her ſelfe an hand-maid. And
no leſſe is her ſhame, or rather, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
her trembling when pennes
prophanely prodigall aſcribe that
honour to her which is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and due to that Deity from
which ſhe received her grace, and
being. I will not, with <hi>Lipſius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
as much to her Milke, as to
her Sonnes Bloud. Neither dare I
ſide with thoſe who averre that
ſhe is halfe of that ſacrifice that
ranſom'd us, and Gods partner
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18366:48"/>
here. Nor is my penne ſo impiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
valiant as to juſtifie that God
made himſelfe the patterne, and
communicated to her by Grace
whatſoever hee had by Nature.
Nor am I of his bold opinion who
ſayes, If man had never ſinned, yet
Chriſt ſhould have taken fleſh to
honour her. Theſe men would
have her in all things equall to
Chriſt himſelfe. Neither her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
nor mine will admit of this
blaſphemous flatterie. I willingly
allow her to be the veſſell, but not
the fountaine of Grace. I am much
taken with his Tenent who holds
that God made all things for the
uſe of Man, becauſe he would am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
furniſh him with matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to buſie his head, leſt he
ſhould bee ſo audacious as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into his ſecrets, &amp; encroach
upon his prerogatives. We need
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18366:48"/>
not (thanks to his infinite
goodneſſe) bee ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
venturous, ſince he
affords us a large ſcope,
and ground enough ſafely
to extol this his Favourite,
ſecond to none that ever
bore fleſh, either in her
owne deſert, or his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme.</p>
            <p>To begin with her birth;<note place="margin">Her Birth.</note>

               </note> and God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
as he did here in <hi>Anna</hi>
the bleſſed mother of this
more bleſſed maid. And
here by the way I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
an obſervation derived
from Gods ſacred Word,
that for the moſt part the
children of ſterility are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18366:49"/>
fruitfull in ſanctity, and all good
works. <hi>Samſon</hi> was the ſonne of
barrenneſſe, and kept the people
in obedience. So was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and
gave precepts to the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
So was <hi>Samuel,</hi> and foretold
the miſery of ſervitude to the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Synagogue. So was <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and
with his counſell govern'd all Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
So was our hallow'd ſubject,
who brought forth the Sonne of
glory. The ſlaves of the <hi>Tyrians</hi>
rebelling againſt their Maſters,
and having ſubdu'd them by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
conſent, decreed, that hee
amongſt them who the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
could firſt diſcover the Sunne
riſing ſhould be their King. One
of them of a more gentle diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then the reſt, having hidden
his Maſter (by name <hi>Strato)</hi> from
the others fury, ſecretly askt his
adviſe in this ſo important affaire,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18366:49"/>
who bade him look into the Weſt;
for there he ſhould ſooner diſcern
the approach of the Sunne then
they who ſought him in the Eaſt.
This wiſe counſell he obey'd, and
while the reſt fixed all their eyes
on the Eaſt, he from the higheſt
part of the City, by his Rayes in
the Weſt, firſt diſcover'd his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
in the Eaſt. So in <hi>Anna</hi> (the
happy mother of this wonder of
women) being then in the occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or ſet of life the prophetick
world foreſaw the brightneſſe of
the dazeling light ſhe then teem'd
with. At length the worlds greedy
expectation was ſatisfied; and this
Cynthia, this chaſt Starre was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a Plannet farre greater,
and brighter then her ſelfe; of
whoſe all gladding ſhine the firſt
man participated, and the laſt ſhal.
I may as properly as dolefully call
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18366:50"/>
them Plannets, ſince they never
reſted, but were in perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
while in this lower orbe they
ran their fatall courſes, in which
they were often clowded, never
quite eclipſed. The day of the
Nativity of this moſt perfect
of Saints, I finde thus deſcribed
by <hi>Nicolaus Vernulaeus</hi> a late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and a profeſſor of eloquence.
The deſcription I onely inſert for
the elegancy; for I muſt condemn
it as guilty of Levity and Vanity,
and no way ſutable to the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
Gravity, and Modeſty of this
our ſacred ſubject. <hi>The Sunne, ſaith
he, this day burniſht his face, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to illuſtrate the world, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
gracious in her ſight, who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her breaſt a fire purer, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
than his owne Rayes. The earth
put on her freſheſt greene, and the
flowers ſpread their dainty leaves,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18366:50"/>
and made a ſweet exchange of odours
with her, yet hung their heads to ſee
themſelves both in colour, and ſent ſo
farre ſurpaſs'd. The trees advanc'd
their curled heads, and compos'd their
lookes within the Chriſtall ſtreames,
who ſeemed to dance after their owne
mumur. Amongſt the Beaſts their
King layd by his fierceneſſe, and not
one of his ſubiects was found ſavage,
or polluted that day. Then was the
Proverbe croſs'd; for the Worme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trod on, would not turne againe,
leſt ſhe ſhould prove unlike her mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
Miſtreſſe. In the very bowels of
the earth, the minerals and the ſtones
more pretious, aſſumed their quicker
ſparkes, as Emblems of her ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.
The Ocean had not a wrinckle in
his face, thouſands of Halcions ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
o're his head, and his Tritons
blew ſo lowd, that their notes ſounded
the very bottome of the Deep. Within
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18366:51"/>
his vaſt Dominions was no diſcord
that day; for the greater of the fiſh
forſooke their prey, and the ſmaller
ſwumme in that ſecurity, that the
Sprat at bearded the Dolphin, and playd
with the noſe of the overgrown Whale.
The birds ſung their choiſeſt aires; the
fowles flew nearer the earth to ſalute
her, and their Towring Lord the
Eagle brought his young ones to try
their eyes at this new borne Light.
The ayre it ſelfe was like her, gentle,
and being inviſible, came to ſteale a
kiſſe from her cherry lips, ſoft and
ſmooth as were his owne. The windes
(conceiving their ſilence would beſt
pleaſe) kept themſelves within their
dens; onely</hi> Zephirus <hi>was let looſe to
fanne the Pinke, and Violet, and
play the wanton with the Roſe.</hi> Thus
farre <hi>Vernulaeus.</hi> Of all things cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man alone, to whom, being
ſicke, ſhe was to bring a ſoveraine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18366:51"/>
Antidote was found leaſt joyfull,
leaſt gratefull. Yet were there
ſome, no doubt, of Gratitudes
children, who lay proſtrate before
her, and did homage to their
ſweeteſt Lady, who might better
be called the Mother of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
then <hi>Eve;</hi> ſince ſhe, like a
Murdreſſe, gave her children
death ere birth; and defaced thoſe
Images whereon God had ſet his
owne ſtampe. She was no wiſer
than a poor Fly, who, enamour'd
of the beauty of the flame, longs
to try if it be as ſweet as faire, and
is conſumed with her owne folly.
Had our bleſſed one ſupplied her
roome in Paradice, the forbidden
fruit had, perchance, beene yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted,
and man uncurſed; for ſhe
was altogether void of curioſity,
proper to that weaker ſexe, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18366:52"/>
the very bane of it. Our deareſt
Princeſſe therefore was deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Queene ere borne, receiv'd a
Crowne ſooner than ſight, and
found her Throne ſeated upon the
threſhold of life. And what
Crowne was ſhe preſented with?
Not one to compoſe which the
Eaſt, and the Weſt joyned their
treaſures, but a Crowne in the
making where of every vertue, and
all the Graces had a hand. Nor
did any vaine mortall place it on
her ſacred Temples, but God
himſelfe, who thought nothing
too deare, nor omitted any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
that might embelliſh this
goodly edifice wherein himſelfe
meant to reſide. Having thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
and honour'd her, he
plac'd her in this lower world for
the good and admiration of all,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18366:52"/>
for the converſation of a few.
Though borne on earth ſhe lived
here like a Native of Heaven.</p>
            <p>As we may gueſſe at the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a houſe by the entry into
it:<note place="margin">Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</note> ſo we may judge of her lifes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
by the very beginning.
<hi>Sabellicus</hi> affirmes that<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſets downe how ſhee diſpos'd of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hour.</note> ſhe no
ſooner ſaw the light, but ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
the Creator of it, and lifted
up her heart and eyes to the great
Infuſer of all her incomparable
excellencies. She lov'd God ere
ſhe had ſeene man. The defect of
her tongue could not hinder the
operation of her ſoule, in which
ere ſhe could ſpeake, ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
his unſpeakeable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
In her Religion preceded
the uſe of reaſon, and ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
Gods mercies long ere
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18366:53"/>
ſhe was capable of his nature, and
wiſedome. Ere ſhe could utter
holy words, ſhe made holy ſigns,
by which ſhe made knowne the
ſanctity of her heart. The firſt
word ſhe learn'd to liſpe was <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi>
She ſent forth many a ſigh
for ſinne, not having committed
any, and bewailed that of which
ſhe was utterly ignorant. The
rowling of the cradle put her in
minde that ſhe was newly enter'd
into the tempeſt of this life, the
infinite dangers whereof to eſcape
ſhe made Vertue her Pilot.</p>
            <p>We will not here with ſome
Writers of her Life, diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no ſhe had the ſame ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Education with other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
nor with them affirme that
ſhe entred the Temple at three
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18366:53"/>
yeares old, and lived cloſe by the
Altar, and was fed miraculouſly
by an Angell; as alſo that it was
there revealed to her that ſhe
ſhould be deliver'd of the Meſſias.
I will not make one ſteppe out of
Gods own path, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I never
yet ſaw the greateſt wit to ſwerve,
but it was in danger of ſticking
faſt. Yet hath a pious charity often
ſwallowed more than all this. If
from the hand of an Angell ſhe
there received food naturall, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,
ſure I am the wonder
is not ſo great as that of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
where the wombe inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Word. And why ſhould
we with difficulty beleeve that
this white ſpotleſſe ſoule was illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with Revelations by the
divine object of her chaſte vowes?
who undoubtedly deſerved to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18366:54"/>
rapt up if it were poſſible, a ſtory
higher than was Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> It is
likely enough, ſaith <hi>Mantuan,</hi> God
would have the Temple of his
Spirit to dwell in the Temple of
his ſervice. The ſame Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
that ſhe there liv'd a pretty
Nun, and Spunne, and wove the

and ſhame, and the care of
her Reputation, forbade her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
even the very Prieſts
themſelves, men whom God had
ſelected out of the Maſſe of the
vulgar to teach his Will, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
his people, and to ſing his
praiſe. Theſe curioſities, and bold
conjectures let us rather beleeve
then conteſt with the broachers;
for it is wiſedome to grant what
we cannot confute. Let us then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18366:54"/>
imagine that this holy Recluſe
confined her body to this ſacred
ſolitude, and a ſpare diet, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
kept her ſoule from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets
to which carnall delights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
all things humane. And it is
conſonant both to reaſon and
truth, that her exerciſe there, was
pious like the place. They who
goe about to take away her wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and reading tongue are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
ridiculous, ſince in evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeares that ſhe was well read
in the Scriptures by her divine
Hymne uttered in <hi>Zacharies</hi> houſe.
<note n="*" place="margin">Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and eminent Authors affirme her to have beene learned in the Hebrew tongue, all which you ſhall finde quoted in <hi>Cedrenus.</hi>
               </note> On her reading attended Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
on her Meditation Prayer,
or her Prayer Action, as the loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruit of the precedent. Thus
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18366:55"/>
buſied, the day left her, the night
found her. Her ſleeping cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we may ſuppoſe were ſutable
to her waking, and her very
dreames divine. She had not a
thought that was her owne, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to God. She was ſlow to
ſpeake, ſaith <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> but ready
to obey all holy advice. Her
tongue was not ſo ſwift as her
Wit, which made it follow for
direction in all the requiſites of
ſpeech. In a word, ſhe might well
uſurpe that of the Church, <hi>When I
was a little one, I was pleaſing to the
moſt high.</hi> When upon mature
deliberation ſhe left the Temple,
ſhe ſtill liv'd as if ſhe had beene
in it. Though in body ſhe was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable,
ſhe fetter'd her ſoule from
wandring abroad, her true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
being in heaven. This
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18366:55"/>
flouriſhing Vine planted her ſelfe
amongſt the Olives. She was more
choice of her company then of
her food, or rayment, both which,
God knows, were courſe enough.
She knew temperancy to be Gods,
and Natures Favorite, in that it
conduceth to the ſervice of the
former, and the preſervation of
the later. She therefore made this
heavenly vertue judge of her. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
leſt it ſhould long after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
the mother of all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Her ſoule gave laws to her
body, which it could not infringe
without the injunction of a ſtrict
pennance. She devour'd Gluttony
it ſelfe, and made the fleſh ſubject
to the command of the ſpirit. Her
fare, ſaith <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> required no
veſſell, nor need ſhe to waſh her
hands after her greateſt meale. Her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18366:56"/>
dyet defide the fire, as of no uſe.
From the Earths face, the Cows
dugge, and the Fountains brimme,
ſhe readily fetched her ſuſtinance.
She was as ignorant of the Perſian
luxury, as the ſuperſtition. To this
her cloathing was correſpondent,
for which her backe was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her fingers. Her hands were
the purveyours to her other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
She had one eye fixed on
heaven, and the other caſt upon
the earth, being intentive on the
Glories of the one, and the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of the other, and at once act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Magdalene.</hi> It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
credible that ſhe ſowed, and
ſpunne, and maintain'd life with
labour. Hee who gives life to all
things, ſuffer'd his then adopted,
and ſince naturall mother, to gaine
her living with ſweat, and care,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18366:56"/>
that her example might give pride
the checke, and teach Majeſty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
In her he made manifeſt
that mortall felicity is not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the immortall. She was not
ſolicitous for the feather, the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe,
or any outward brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
being onely carefull to cover
her ſhame, and at once to expell
two deadly enemies to her foule,
and body, pride, and cold. Her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſimplicitie was in all things
anſwerable to her inward.</p>
            <p>Well,<note place="margin">Her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothing.</note> now ſhe began to write
woman, and her fifteenth yeare
approached, and hand in hand
with the increaſe of time went the
acquiſition of all Graces. Her leaſt
perfection would render another
moſt accompliſht. In her all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
were at ſtrife, all overcame.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18366:57"/>
Nothing was here meane, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other then an union of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatives.
Charity, obedience, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
virginity, all were in her at
height. Nothing in her was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but the Deity it ſelfe. Yet was
not her vaine-glory ſuch, that ſhe
deſired with <hi>Dina</hi> to viſit the
daughters of other Regions, and
to enlarge the renowne of theſe
her Excellencies, being onely ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in the government of her
owne little, inward common-wealth.
Her fixed reſolution was
not onely to confine her perſon,
but her fame, which (had it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
forreigne Countries) Kings
would have come ſuppliants to
her cottage, and on their knees
have petition'd for her love. But
the bonds of her Matrimony were
already askt in heaven, and no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18366:57"/>
found why ſhe might
not wedde God himſelfe. Yet at
the earneſt ſolicitation of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Prieſts, ſaith <hi>Mantuan,</hi> was
ſhe content to be betroth'd to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi>
not that he ſhould do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of an husband, but ſerve as a
barre to the importunity of other
Sutours, that ſo ſhe might the more
freely enjoy the inconceiveable
pleaſure ſhe tooke in her vowed
virginity.</p>

But now the time is come when
ſhe muſt be (to the aſtoniſhment
of the world) a Mother,<note place="margin">The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ltuation.</note> and yet
remaine a Virgin. The marriage
betweene God, and Nature is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
on in heaven, and <hi>Gabriel</hi>
the Ambaſſador concerning mans
Redemption prepares himſelf for
his journey decreed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
He receives inſtructions from
the hands of Gods owne tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Mercy; and therefore, no
doubt, but they are gentle, and
pleaſing. Clad in white, (as an
Emblem of his innocencie) he ſets
forth without any other guard
then his owne right Arme able to
deſtroy Legions. The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi>
carried in their Enſignes a towring
Flame, the Babilonians a Dove,
the Scythians Lightning, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18366:59"/>
a Bow, and Arrows, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
an Eagle. And this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Ambaſſadour of peace,
(being to deſcend from the higher
to the lower world, from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour
to the creature, an Angell to
men) beares along with him in his
very name the ſigne of his Power,
and Fortitude that ſends him. The
gates, ſaith <hi>Vernulaeus,</hi> of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
pallace ſtand wide open, and
the ſacred Trinity gladly beholds
the departure of this divine Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.
The Angels clap their
wings, and make the heavenly
roofe ring with Haleluiahs. The
Saints attend, and ſend their vows
after him, that his preſence may be
without terrour, and his ſweet
delivery win conſent in the heart
of their glorious Empreſſe. The
vaſte ſpace betweene the Poles is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18366:59"/>
filled with troopes of holy ſpirits,
who give a convoy to this their
fellow-ſervant graced above the
reſt, in having ſo important an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
as the worlds ſalvation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his charge. The Starres
put on new, and brighter aſpects,
as ſeeming to foretell what they
foreſee not. The Earth bedeckt
with all imaginable ornaments
preſents him with variety of ſents,
and colours even to her ſelfe new,
and layes her prime dainties under
his feet. Onely her ſtupid Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
whom his Embaſſie moſt
concern'd, were altogether unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of his arrivall, and of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

him rather like an Herald

unwelcome to the Saint whoſe
Votary he was. He found her (as
ſome thinke) alone, ſeparated as
well in body as minde from the
world. She was not ignorant that
piety was nearer pollution in ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
than ſolitude, and therefore to
ſhun infection, ſhe avoyded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
She well knew that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt himſelfe had dwelt with
the Prophets and Apoſtles in
Caves, Dens, and Dungeons, and
there pen'd the all-ſaving Writ.
That which we call good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and ſweet converſation her
conſcience aſſured her to be at
beſt but a ſociable folly. In neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
ſhe feared proximity
in vice. Well, if alone he found
her, queſtionleſſe ſhe made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
uſe of that privacy, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
how in a corrupible body,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18366:61"/>
to preſerve a ſpirit incorruptible.
The celeſtiall agent having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and obtained audience,
ſpake the oration he made not; for
he was but Interpreter of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, in which office he juſtly
gloried. The ſpeech aſſuredly was
modeſt, and ſutable to the ſacred
cares it was to enter. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, no doubt, conſiſted of a
reverent applauſe of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
God had imparted to her.
<hi>Haile Mary,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>full of Grace,
the Lord be with thee: bleſſed art thou
amongſt women, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhe tooke
this the Text following declares.
<hi>And when ſhe ſaw him ſhee was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at his ſaying, and thought what
manner of ſalutation that ſhould be.</hi>
No doubt the Angell no ſooner
pronounc't, <hi>Haile Mary full of
Grace,</hi> but a bluſh aroſe in her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18366:62"/>
baſhfull face, and verified his
words. But this colour was not
fixed, it went quickly back to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
her noble heart againſt the
feare that invaded it. She ſaw her
ſelfe alone with one altogether a
ſtranger to her, whoſe face ſhe
neither knew, nor his intent. True
it is, his language was ſmooth, and
even, but as faire words as theſe,
have often proceeded from a foule
heart. She trembled at his ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thinking him to be a<note n="*" place="margin">That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her in the form or ſhape of a man is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome. in Epiſt. ad Euſtoch. de cuſt.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18366:62"/>
ſubject to abhorred Luſt, and
therefore feared violence: but
when ſhe once knew him, and his
Embaſſy, ſhe then undaunted,
diſcours'd with him as an Angell,
whom before ſhe quak't at as a
man. I conjure all modeſt ſoules
that ſhall peruſe this paſſage by all
things deare to them, to dwell
long upon it, as worthily deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both their admiration, and
imitation. Though ſhe received
from him extreme and heavenly
praiſes, yet ſhe was afraid, becauſe
ſhe was alone. O Saviour of the
World! Purity feares an Angell,
ſhall not Impurity then ſuſpect a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18366:63"/>
man though in the ſhape of an
Angell when his complement, and
diſcourſe are ſenſuall. Virginity
cannot bee too heedfull, which
makes it practiſe the doubt of
things ſafe, that ſo it may accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
it ſelfe to the feare of
things dangerous. If heathen wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have by nature ſo abhorred
pollution, that they have choſen
death before it, how odious muſt
we judge it to the Angellicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of Gods owne Mother?
Well, what courſe tooke ſhe?
She rejected theſe his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not with her tongue, but her
lookes, which put on a diſlike of
all he had ſaid. She had heard that
when Caſtles come to a parley, it
is a ſigne of yeelding, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought it her ſafeſt way to
involve her ſelfe within humility,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18366:63"/>
and a ſober ſilence. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
quickly delivered her out of
this Agony into a greater; out
of this feare into a more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
care. <hi>Feare not</hi> MARY, ſaith
he, <hi>for thou haſt found favour with
God; for loe thou ſhalt conceive in thy
wombe, and beare a Sonne, and ſhalt
call his name</hi> IESUS. <hi>He ſhall be
great, and ſhall be called the Sonne of
the moſt high, and the Lord God ſhall
give unto him the throne of his father</hi>
David. <hi>And he ſhall raigne over the
houſe of</hi> Iacob <hi>for ever, and of his
Kingdome ſhall be no end.</hi> To this
her anſwer was, <hi>How ſhall that be,
ſince I know no man?</hi> It is true, it is
true, moſt bleſſed Virgin, thou
knoweſt no man; but let thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
reſt ſecure; for the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, and not of man is here
required. God ſhould never be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18366:64"/>
conceived in thee, wert thou not
a Virgin, nor borne of thee ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou not remaine ſuch. Thou
canſt not be ſpotted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
or birth of an iſſue ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate.
This feare is as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
as that of defiling thy faireſt
fingers with the pureſt fountaine.
If <hi>Obededon</hi> having received the
Arke within his walles, was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with all manner of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that Felicity was voyced to
have deſcended from heaven into
his houſe; what ſhall we judge of
thy ſupreme bliſſe, O glorious
Virgin! who art not to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of a wooden Arke, but of
his only Sonne? With confidence
therefore conſent to thy owne
happineſſe, and the Redemption
of all Humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:18366:64"/>
But, indeed, I do not wonder at
her aſtoniſhment, when I conſider
her baſhfulneſſe. Mee thinks I ſee
her now caſting her eyes up to
heaven, now fixing them on the
earth, and now againe on the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
himſelfe, reſolving to
give up her ſoule rather then her
virginity. Harſh muſt the word
(conception) needs ſound to her
who was a votary nere to know
man, whoſe onely love was prayer,
whoſe onely childe was piety. But
when the Angell urged Gods will,
ſhe forthwith yeelded a handmaid
to her Lords deſire. Let us inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
liſten to the text. <hi>And the
Angel anſwer'd, and ſaid unto her,
The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,
and the power of the higheſt ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
thee; therefore alſo that holy
thing that ſhall be borne of thee ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18366:65"/>
be called the Sonne of God. And behold
thy couſen Elizabeth, ſhee hath alſo
conceived a ſonne in her old age, and
this is the ſixt moneth with her who
was called barren. For with God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall bee impoſsible. And Mary
ſaid, Behold the handmaid of the
Lord, bee it to mee according to thy
word.</hi> See here united an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
humility, and an obedience
even unto death. For the conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be the mother of God was
not eaſie to her, in that a meek, and
humble ſpirit with greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
aſcends the higheſt ſteppe of
Honours Throne, then a proud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
thence to the bottome, it
being a thing in nature farre harder
to climbe then to come downe. If
any man ſhall yet reſt unſatisfied,
and ſhall make a further enquirie
after this difficulty, he may pleaſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18366:65"/>
to conſider that her humility bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc't
her Sonnes exalted, and her
owne dejected eſtate; and as well
meditated the care, the diligency,
the reverence, and obſequiouſnes,
as the dignity, and excellency of
her whom God would vouchſafe
the moſt glorious title of Mother.
She wiſely weighed that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were not worthy to wait on
him, and therefore the ſervice of
her whole life muſt as farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
as the name of Gods Mother
did excell that of Servant, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.
If Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> yet in the dawn
of Grace, could ſo clearly diſcerne
his Maſters greatneſſe, as that he
cryed out, <hi>Depart from me a ſinner,</hi>
as deeming himſelfe unworthy of
his preſence: If the Centurion for
the ſame reſpect thought his houſe
too baſe to receive him, what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18366:66"/>
ſhould ſhe thinke who was not to
take him into her ſhip, or her lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but into her wombe, where he
was to remaine not a viſitant, but a
dweller? Full well alſo ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that her conſent was not
onely required to be the parent of
the Almighty, but the Spouſe alſo
of his holy Spirit, to whoſe inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſhe ought a greater obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
then others, having received
from the ſame ſpirit a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of grace, and honour. She
clearly foreſaw that ſhe was not
onely choſen to conceive the Son
of God,<note place="margin">Many ancient Writers bold that ſhe had the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> to bring forth, to nurſe,
and governe him, but alſo perforce
to yeeld him up (ſuch being the
divine pleaſure) to a three and
thirty yeares perſecution, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the curſed death of the
croſſe, the ſalvation of others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18366:66"/>
on his deſtruction. And
that ſhe did foreſee all this, plainly
appeares by the ſpeech of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to her, who (after he had
foretold the conception, and birth
of Chriſt) added, <hi>And he ſhall be
called Ieſus,</hi> that is, a Saviour. An
awfull reverence, and an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable
joy divided, without
doubt, her all-holy heart when ſhe
contemplated her future being a
mother to the Meſſias. Can a man
imagine any thing more difficult,
more bitter for humane nature to
overcome? Yet did her active ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
vanquiſh all theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and with an humble, raviſht
ſoule ſhe expected the entrance of
him into her ſacred wombe, whom
already ſhe had ſurely ſeated in
her heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18366:67"/>
Here before we proceed to her
conception, we muſt obſerve two
things not amply, and fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
expreſs'd, very remarkable
in the Angelicall ſalutation; Firſt,
the dignity of the Ambaſſadour,
next the worth of her to whom
his Embaſſy was directed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her many vertues equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eminent in this divine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt; he was not
a man, but an Angell; neither an
Angell of an inferiour order, but
of the ſupreme Hierarchy, which
choiſe and pure ſpirits having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
infinite ornaments and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from their Lord and Maſter,
retained ſtill his favour,<note place="margin">Hom. 34 in lect. Evang.</note> and ever
ſtood before him. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſtiles
him a principall Angell, treating
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18366:67"/>
of principall things. Some have
not feared to call him the ſupreme
Angell,<note place="margin">Serm, de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginis aſſump.</note> as <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> and others.
Truth will anſwer for him, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the celeſtiall ſpirits,
none are ſo predicated in holy
Writ as he, and <hi>Michael,</hi> to whom
the Declaration, and Expoſition
of ſo high Myſteries ſo often were
committed, as in <hi>Daniel, Zachary,</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi> is ſpecified. Some will
have his name to ſignifie God, and
man, and that this Etymology
containes a miraculous myſtery.
Amongſt theſe is <hi>Proculus</hi> Arch-Biſhop

I freely acknowledge that in this

any one word not frequent,

make the ſenſe cleare to the Femal

ſcope is not to ſharpen their wits,
but to beautifie their lives, and to
kindle in their faire boſomes an
holy ambition to aſpire to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of that devout life, which
this our incomparable Lady led,
and ended with the applauſe of
men, and Angels.</p>
            <p>Laying aſide therefore theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
arguments, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
(as my method commands
me) to deliver her ineſtimable
worth, and ſober demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Angell, which no elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
can ſo well expreſſe as a
ſilent, and reverent admiration.
Much I need not ſay of her of
whom I never can ſpeake enough,
eſpecially having already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
ſo many ancient, and learned
extollers of her excellencies, to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18366:69"/>
which my vote would adde no
more then a dimme lampe to the
glorious eye of heaven, or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
gloworme to a ſtarry night.
Yet ſince at the Altar of this meek
one (ſweet and chaſt as the Incenſe
there daily burned) a ſingle graine
ſent from a ſimple heart is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
I will not feare to pay her
a due oblation, though it come as
ſhort of her value, as I of her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
May it pleaſe thee then, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader, gratefully, with me to
acknowledge that this is ſhe who
gave fleſh to him by whom all
fleſh is ſav'd. This was the Dove
that firſt brought to us the Olive
of our peace. This is the Rainbow,
or firſt ſigne of our reconciliation
to the divine Majeſty. And (to ſhut
up all in a little) this was the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and Throne of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18366:70"/>
whence (his Majeſty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured)
his love ſhined forth to all
humanity. But in that a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of her vertues adorne her
more then can all the flowers of
Rhetoricke; I will (though in an
inelligant phraſe) ſet ſuch downe
as ſhall appeare moſt eminent in
this unparalell'd colloquy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were handled the profound my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the ſacred Trinity, as of
the Fathers omnipotency, the holy
Ghoſts efficacy, the Sonnes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and in him the proprietie of
both natures.</p>
            <p>Her Prudency ſhall take the firſt
place,<note place="margin">Her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note> not as the greateſt, but as
the moſt diffuſive, becauſe cleane
through this Dialogue it blends
with all the reſt. Firſt, ſhe awfully,
and adviſedly gives him full audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18366:70"/>
and at once both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the laws of patience,

the period of his ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Many of her Sexe
would have ſo cut him off
at every word, that hee
ſhould never have peec't
his ſpeech together againe.
Being more miſtreſſes of
their tongues then their
eares;<note place="margin">The common ſort when the Moone was eclipſed thought her to be enchanted, and with baſons and other things made a hideous noyſe to barre her from hearing the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers voyce.</note> they would never
have given him hearing till
they had beene weary of
talking. One of theſe, <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
makes mention of in his

            <p>This vertue of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune

obtain, if they do, it comes to them
the laſt of all other. Their tongues
are clocks which, once wound up,
few of them go leſſe then ſixteene
houres. But this wiſeſt of Saints in
a ſeaſonable ſilence, and caution of
ſpeech, was alike admirable: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that through the whole
Bible we finde not that ſhe ſpake
above five times.<note place="margin">Her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune ſilence and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpeech.</note> Twice to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell

and againe, <hi>Behold the Hand-maid

Sonne after long abſence, <hi>Why
have you dealt ſo with us.</hi> Laſtly,
when ſhe becomes a petitioner for
the poore, <hi>Becauſe they have no
wine.</hi> Here in this place ſhe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
hearkens to the Angell,
whom ſhe heares twice ere ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18366:71"/>
once. She made two pawſes
uſher her anſwer, which ſhe fram'd
with ſuch care, and ſobriety, as if
Modeſty had ſeal'd up her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and lippes, and that without
her ſpeciall warrant they were not
to be opened. And though her
thoughts were perplex'd and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
yet ſhe apparrell'd them in
ſuch a cleare, ſmooth calme of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that it would have genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
Barbariſme it ſelfe. When her
Chaſtitie is call'd in queſtion
(which ſhe eſteemes above health,
liberty, or life it ſelfe) ſhe poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denies nothing in that ſtrange,
and to her impoſſible aſſertion of
the Angell, but anſwers with an
humble enquirie, <hi>How ſhall that be?</hi>
Well might ſhe make this demand,
ſince ſhe knew by humane power
it could not be effected, and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18366:72"/>
Angell had not yet revealed, that
ſuch was the divine will. Though
never ſoule endured a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
then hers, and that Feare had
ſtretched the ſtrings of her heart
to their utmoſt extenſion, yet
choſe ſhe rather that they ſhould
breake in ſunder, than ſhe into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy.
Some women
(though chaſt, yet curſt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty)
having once heard their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
brought in queſtion, would
have omitted all interrogations,
and have given the Angell a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for his ſalutation, and have
reviled his name, if not offered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to his perſon. But in this
ſweeteſt of creatures, mildneſſe
and modeſty kiſſed each other; ſo
that nothing could flow from her
that was not pleaſing and gentle.
Yet could not her amazed lookes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18366:72"/>
conceale her feare, which afflicts
farre more than griefe; for we
grieve onely for what is paſt, but
we feare all that can happen. The
mercifull Angell reading in her
forehead the perplexity of her
minde, reſolved preſently to ridde
her of the tormenting doubt ſhe
was in, and to baniſh Feare out of
that Face reſerved only for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Graces to dwell in. He
therefore hides this great ſecret
no longer from her, but expounds
to her the manner and meanes of
her conception, which no ſooner
entred her eares, then conſent her
heart; and with a proſtrate ſoule
ſhe made her will conform it ſelfe
to Gods; <hi>Behold, ſaith ſhe, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of hers we may diſcover al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as many perfections as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18366:73"/>
words. Some draw hence an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that the ſalvation of
mankinde depended upon her
conſent, and conſequently the
damnation upon her refuſall. My
meditation dares not climbe ſo
high, not being able to conceive
how poſſibly the ſearcher of
hearts ſhould receive a repulſe
from his choſen one, nor how his
omnipotency can be confined to
one onely meanes in the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mankinde. It ſhall ſuffice
me to derive hence three of the
greateſt Chriſtian Vertues, her
Faith, her Obedience, her Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Faith is the hand whereby we
lay hold on Chriſt,<note place="margin">Her Faith.</note> and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
without which, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
all morall vertues whatſoever are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18366:73"/>
no better than gorgious ſins. The
dignity and neceſſity of this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
gift cannot but evidently
appeare to the meaneſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
in that no man is ignorant
that without Chriſt we cannot be
ſav'd, and without Faith we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
apprehend Chriſt, nor apply
his deſerts, and paſſion to our pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
ſoules. In this which excells
all other perfections did this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Mother of our <hi>Emanuell</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
all other creatures, as here in
briefe, and hereafter more at
large I ſhall demonſtrate. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
both in knowledge and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
infinitely exceeds me,<note place="margin">Lib de ſanct. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irg. cap. 3.</note> and
therfore I deſire you would heare
him for me. <hi>Strengthened by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Faith, ſaith he, ſhe made Gods
Sonne hers, more happy truely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Chriſt in her minde, then his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18366:74"/>
fleſh in her wombe. Endued with this
faith ſhe fear'd, and reverenc'd him
whom ſhe bore, whom as ſoone as ſhee
brought forth ſhe ador'd, and was the
firſt beholder of the glory of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
Would I muſter up my
forces I could produce many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Champions of the ſame
worth and antiquity, that with an
indefatigable zeale, doe vindicate
the faith of this bleſſed Virgin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome of theſe latter ages,
who accuſe her as defective in that
wherin ſhe was moſt accompliſht.
Their objections have beene long
ſince anſwer'd by Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and divers others
of thoſe Primitive times. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
diſtinguiſheth thus betweene
<hi>Zacharies</hi> demand and hers.<note place="margin">Lib. 16. de civit. cap. 24.</note>

he ſpoke this out of deſpaire, not

<hi>when ſhe askes; How ſhall that be, ſince

enquiring, not deſpairing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to</hi> Zachary <hi>it is ſaid, thou ſhalt
be dumbe becauſe thou believeſt not;
but to her the cauſe is expounded,
becauſe while ſhe doth queſtion, ſhe
doubteth not of the promiſe.</hi> And to
the ſame purpoſe, and almoſt in
the ſame words ſpeakes Saint
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> whoſe teſtimony I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
leſt I ſhould prove tedious,
and obſcure to the tender ſexe, to
whoſe profit this weake Eſſay of
mine is chiefly intended. Yet my
zeale to her whoſe true admirer I
am, compels me briefly to deface
all thoſe aſpertions, which the
adverſaries to her, and piety have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18366:75"/>
layd upon her. And I am wholly
transform'd into wonder as oft as I
conſider how malice, and her
ſpawne can bee ſo frontleſſe as
groſſely to deprave the meaning
of the Text onely to detract from
her, and ſhould be ſo audacious as
to contradict the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who by the mouth of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
pronounceth her bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe beleeved. True it is, their
expoſitions give a light to the
Scriptures, but it is ſuch a one as
we receive from lightning, which
brings with it rather terrour then
comfort.</p>
            <p>Here her obedience calls upon
me to cut off,<note place="margin">Her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> I cannot ſay, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
but vindication of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Though ſhe deſerved ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty,
and command, yet delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18366:75"/>
ſhe in nothing more then in this
ſubmiſſive vertue proper onely to
a Subject, and was a diligent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioner
of it through her whole
life in imitation of him who was
obedient even to an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
death. Her faith, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
were of equall ſpeed; for ſhe
no ſooner heard the Angell relate
that the Almighty had ordained
ſhe ſhould beare the worlds Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
but ſhe beleev'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
that it ſhould be ſo. She had
learnt in her infancy, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with God is better then ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and therefore ſhe was as ſwift
as thought in agreeing to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ordinance, that ſo poſteritie
might diſtinguiſh betweene her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and that of others whoſe
Wils, and Vnderſtandings have a
combat before they can bee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18366:76"/>
brought to a conſent. But this was
onely a lovely branch of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
tree, her humility, on which
a perpetual Autumne attended; for
it continually bore fruit.</p>
            <p>Of this Vertue I muſt treat more
at large then of the reſt,<note place="margin">Her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> becauſe it
is extenſive cleane through all the
actions of her life. Of this there are
many ſorts, whoſe ſeverall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
and ſhapes we will here
draw to the life, leſt the Reader be
impos'd upon, and verily beleeve
he enioyes the true one, when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he is onely poſſeſſour of the
adulterate.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the Naturall
Humility,<note place="margin">Natural humility</note> which is to be found in
many, who being baſely borne, and
bred, and poorely ſpirited, aſpire
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18366:76"/>
not to greatneſſe, but reſt fully
contented with that ſordid calling
Fortune hath allotted them. This
Humility is none of thoſe that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
doth warrant. There is another
kinde which we may call ſenſuall,<note place="margin">Senſuall humility</note>
and this makes men refuſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
not that they do not deſire
them, but for the trouble, care, and
danger that attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> them. This
Humility is baſe, and degenerate.
There is a third proud one of the
Hypocrite,<note place="margin">Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall humility</note> who though he be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of dignities, and ſeeks them
by all cunning, and undermining
wayes, yet (to be reputed humble)
he ſeemes to flie them. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
is falſe, and fained. A fourth
there is philoſophicall,<note place="margin">Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall humility</note> and morall,
and this conſiſts in the knowledge
of a mans ſelfe, and his miſerable
condition, ſo that by a naturall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18366:77"/>
light he can ſee to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and be ſerviceable to all
men, yet no further then the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his eſtate allows, and humane
reaſon requires. So that in this
mans opinion it ſhould not be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
but baſeneſſe in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to pardon an injury done him,
or to place himſelfe in an Hoſpitall
as a ſervant to attend the ſicke, and
needy. This Humility will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Chriſtian Teſt.<note place="margin">Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> A fifth
Moſaicall, or Iudaicall, offers it
ſelfe to our conſideration; and this
hath a neare reſemblance of the
true one; for by the peruſall of the
written Law we come to know our
ſelves more perfectly then all the
Philoſophers of the world can
teach us. To this purpoſe Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>From the Law comes the
knowledge of ſinne:</hi> and in another
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18366:77"/>
place, <hi>I had not knowne concupiſcence
to bee a ſinne had not the Law ſaid;
Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> In this Mirrour
we diſcerne our originall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all our diſordinate paſſions,
and affections, together with our
ignorance, and frailty. By this
Touchſtone we finde all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
philoſophical vertues to be but
counterfeit. But this carries with it
a very detrimentall diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
for it leads us beyond hope of
ſalvation, and there leaves us. For
when a man ſhall conſider that an
unattainable perfection, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
obſervance of the Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at his hands (wherein he is
commanded to honour God with
all his ſoul, and with all his might,
and to love his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
and yet withall ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in himſelfe an utter diſabilitie
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18366:78"/>
to execute theſe holy commands,
a frozen direction wil ſo benumme
all his thoughts that not one of
them will be of force to uphold
it ſelfe from ſinking into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit of deſpaire.</p>
            <p>But with the true Chriſtian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
it is otherwiſe which (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt made a ſubmiſſive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of its owne ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<note place="margin">The true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> pride, avarice, injuſtice, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie,
and infinite other imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
by a ſtrong apprehenſion
layes hold on the mercie of God
in Chriſt. And this goodneſſe of
God towards us makes our ſinnes
more odious even in our own eies;
no otherwiſe then the tender kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his Father made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
childe more clearly ſee his
owne errour, and diſobedience. For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18366:78"/>
this makes that ſpeech of God to
the Iewes, <hi>When you come into the
Land of promiſe, then you ſhall know
your ſinnes?</hi> as if he ſhould have
ſaid, <hi>How often have you diſtruſted
me, and not onely murmur'd againſt
me, but abandon'd me, and ador'd
Idols, making them your guides, and
attributing to them the benefits you
have received from me?</hi> ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
Chriſtian being once
entred into the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, ſees more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his ſinnes, then he did before
his calling, as having received a
greater Light. The excellency of
this vertue in a Chriſtian is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
humane expreſſion. Not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
a learned Father of the
Church ſtiles this the Treaſurer
of all other vertues.<note place="margin">Hieron. in Epiſt. ad Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</note> The antient
Chriſtians commonly uſurpe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18366:79"/>
for vertue it ſelfe. Chriſt
cals it pooreneſſe of Spirit, and
diſcourſing of mans Beatitude,
ſets it in the Front. This and
Pride are at endleſſe oddes; for
this is ſociable, and loves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
wheras pride affects ſolitude,
and is for the moſt part alone.
In the Empire of Pride, two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand quietly together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the dominions of Humility,
an infinite number may be placed
without either combat, or ſtrife.
Pride is never void of feare, and
doubt, whereas this ſtands ſecure
with <hi>Ionas</hi> in the bottome of the
Sea. Pride is ever ambitious of the
firſt ſeate, this of the loweſt, and
therefore is as much extoll'd by
all men, as the other cride downe.
Pride aſſumes all to it ſelfe, and is
full of ſelfe-love. This refuſeth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18366:79"/>
even its owne due, and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
it ſelfe, as knowing that it can
juſtly call nothing its owne, but
ſinne. Pride ſtormes at an injury
receiv'd; this embraceth all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that may exerciſe its pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Pride (like all things puft up,
and light) is wavering, and blown
here and there by every guſt of
Fortune; this in ſtability is a rock,
not in hardneſſe, being ſoft, and
white as the Downe of Swans.
Yet though this Vertue be of all
other the moſt innocent, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive,
it is withall the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull;
for, as nature, ſo God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
vacuity, and therefore (fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the humble utterly empty of
affection, preſumption, and
what elſe is derogatory to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
hee fils him with his
grace and ſpirit. What ſhould I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18366:80"/>
ſay more? Humility is feareleſſe
in danger, free in bondage, rich in
poverty, quiet in perſecution, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and gloriorious in ignominy,
lofty in lowneſſe, joyfull in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
and happy in the midſt of
miſery. This made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<hi>Abraham</hi> to acknowledge
himſelfe duſt and aſhes, <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptiſt to eſteeme himſelfe a meer
Voyce, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to account
himſelfe the greateſt of all ſinners.
This Iewell was ſo faire in Chriſts
eye, that to purchaſe it, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
not only poverty, miſery, and
all indignities, but even execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and malediction. What would
we judge of a great Prince, who,
in ſtead of enlarging his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſhould abaſe himſelfe ſo farre
as to become a poore ſubject?
Why this did Chriſt, who (being
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18366:80"/>
of all things the greateſt, and beſt
from all eternity) by humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of all the loweſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
even to the profeſſion of
ſervice to the meaneſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
It is alſo an evident marke
of his humility, that he choſe to
be borne of ſimple and obſcure
Parents, whereas he might, if he
would, have allyed himſelfe to
the greateſt Princes. This gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to the Iewes to mocke him,
ſaying, <hi>Is not</hi> Ioſeph <hi>his Father,
and</hi> Mary <hi>his Mother?</hi> True it is
that he was of the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
but when he was borne, it
was in its declination, and of no
repute. As the Moone fourteene
dayes together, to our ſight, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,
and fourteene againe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth,
till at length it be ſeene
no more: ſo in the fourteene gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18366:81"/>
from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
in honour, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
and was in his time at the
full height; but in the fourteene
following generations it was in
the wane, and in the dayes of
Chriſt neere utter extinction. And
whereas he might have inſerted
<hi>Sarah, Rebecca,</hi> and many other
Saints in his Genealogy, he placed
<hi>Tamar, Raab, Ruth, Berſabe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of an inceſtuous race, to ſhew
the world, that, though he hated
ſinne, he abhorred not ſinners.
What man is there who, having a
laſcivious wife detected of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will take her againe? Yet
Chriſt, having eſpouſed the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
ſoule of man, receives her
into grace and favour after ſhe
hath committed millions of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18366:81"/>
To this effect ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Though thou haſt committed
fornication with many Lovers, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and I will receive thee.</hi> Who
is there that being injur'd will not
onely forgive the Offendor, but
ſeeke his friendſhip, I, and lay
downe his life for him? All this
did Chriſt, who (being grievouſly
and hainouſly abuſed by man) not
onely demanded his pardon, as if
he himſelfe had beene faulty,
but made an oblation of his owne
heart-bloud to quench the wrath
of God juſtly conceived againſt
him. Another admirable act of
his humility was, that (God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, in ſo much that he
could at his pleaſure have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iudas,</hi> whoſe treaſon he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew)
all the revenge he tooke,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18366:82"/>
was to waſh his feet, and to call
him Friend when he came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him. To theſe I may adde
his living in obſcurity from his
twelfth to his thirtieth yeere, in
all which time we reade not any
thing of him. I will conclude with
all the croſſes and calamities he
endur'd, of which in his life he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reaped any fruit, and at his
death had his Innocency onely
predicated by one, and that one a
Thiefe. In a word, during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
here below (whether you
conſider his Doctrine, Actions, or
Paſſion) he was not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the exerciſe of any
vertue, as of this gentle, meek one,
that ſo he might imprint it as his
owne ſacred ſtampe, or marke in
thoſe mindes which he would
have known to be his. And, above
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18366:82"/>
the reſt, into the chaſt boſome of
his deareſt Mother did he ſend this
divine gift, before his birth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<note place="margin">Her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> and afterwards engrafted it
there by example. And this we
may well perceive by her ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following the patterne that ſhe
precedes all but himſelfe in this
milde, offenceleſſe vertue. In this
rare quality as ſhe had an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd
Maſter, ſo ſhe prov'd a
matchleſſe Schollar. He who is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the excellency ſhe hath
attain'd to in this one perfection,
I dare pronounce him withall ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of Gods holy Writ, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeable
of all goodneſſe derived
thence. Yet ſome ſacrilegious
theeves there are, who robbe this
beautifull Temple of its prime or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
this ſweeteſt Garland of
its faireſt Flower. They maintaine
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18366:83"/>
(me thinks the earth ſhould ſhake
it ſelfe, and them when they utter
it) that ſhe was humbled, not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Theſe I may more properly
averre to be learning, not learned.
They may with as much juſtice
deprive the Roſe of her bluſh, the
Lilly of her white, the Violet of
her purple, and the Chriſtall of its
clearneſſe, as her of this pretious
ornament, which ſhe obtein'd by a
ſtudious pious imitation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
with a holy care. But my
wonder is the leſſe when I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the continuall Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Impudency, and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Whoſoever ſhall ſettle his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
on her diſcourſe with the
Angell, her pilgrimage to her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
houſe, and her divine Hymne
there (though he have ſworn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the ſlave of prejudice) he will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18366:83"/>
breake his chaine, and reaſſume ſo
much freedome as to declare her
truly humble. Sure I am if they
would have her halfe a degree
humbler, they make her wholly
abject. To my thinking theſe ſixe
words alone (Behold the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of the Lord) are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of errour ſix thouſand ſuch
ſhallow Authors. To thoſe who
are plac'd in an extreame height, all
things below ſeeme farre ſmaller
then indeed, they are, but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
they appeare the ſame; but
here it fals out otherwiſe, where
the introducer of one pregnant
bleſſing that contein'd all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world (and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
placed above it) thinks all
things under her farre greater then
her ſelfe, and above her in value.
Certainly all the ancient Fathers
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18366:84"/>
with one conſent affirme that ſhe
deſerv'd to be Empreſſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who humbled her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them all. For my owne part, I
am ſo tranſported with the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her meekneſſe that me
thinks I heare her thus expreſſing
the humility of her ſanctified heart
to the heavenly Nuntio.</p>
            <p>Is this a delightfull dreame, or a
pleaſing viſion that thus raviſheth my
ſoule? What a lovely proſpect is this?
What do mine eyes behold? Cedars
ſtooping to ſhrubs? Mountains to val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?
The Ocean courting a Riveret?
I diſcover more then all this. I ſee
Heaven deſcending to Earth, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Majeſty to humane miſery, a
bleſſed Angell to a wretched mortall.
True it is I am the ſtructure of Gods
owne hands, but an edifice not cleare,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18366:84"/>
not faire enough for the habitation of
his onely Sonne. Alas, alas! I am a
veſſel too uncleane to encloſe a Deity.
Is this fleſh of mine pure enough to
clothe purity it ſelfe? I am not worthy
to be reputed his childe, much leſſe his
parent. Oh lend me thy harmonious
voyce, thy heavenly Rhetoricke, thou
celeſtiall Oratour, that I may render
him thanks, and praiſe; though not
equall, yet nearer to the grace I have
received. I deny not but wee ſee his
Name written in every thing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but in obſcure Characters, like
the diſcovery of the Sunne in a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
Thou art nearer him in eſſence,
in preſence, in goodnes, in knowledge,
and canſt finde out words more ſutea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his worth. Wherefore I earneſtly
beſeech thee in thy beſt phraſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the unfained gratitude of his
moſt humble Hand-maid, who eſteems
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18366:85"/>
her ſelfe unworthy to touch, much
more to conceive him. Neither ſhalt
thou thy ſelfe depart without moſt
humble thanks for the eternall honour
thou haſt done me by this viſit.</p>
            <p>It is probable enough ſhe ſaid
much to this purpoſe, this forme
of ſpeech being agreeable to her
diſpoſition, and demeanour. To
conclude this point, ſix cleare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of her Humility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
above the reſt, the holy
Writ offers to our ſerious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
conſideration. The firſt in
this ſubmiſſive conference with
the Angel. The ſecond in the
houſe of <hi>Zachary,</hi> where the more
her vertue is predicated by her
couſen, the more ſhe humbles her
ſelfe. The third in her delivery,
where ſhe meekly ſubmitted her
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18366:85"/>
ſelfe to all wants, and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The fourth in her Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when ſhe obſerv'd the cuſtome
of other uncleane ſinfull women,
and rankt her ſelfe with them. The
fifth in betrothing her ſelfe to a
Carpenter, and in paying as great
an obedience to him as ever wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did to husband, and in joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with him in labour to get a
poore living, to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and their Sonne. The ſixth
in having a care of the poore, and
in aſſociating them at all times.
But of all theſe I ſhall treate more
at large in the courſe of this divine
ſtory, whoſe order now brings me
to the myſticall conception of her
bleſſed Sonne, our onely Lord,
and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The heavenly Ambaſſadour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Him ſecondeth Saint
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> of all the Fathers the moſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18366:86"/>
ſubtle and ſollid. Theſe enſuing
are his owne words. <hi>When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſaluted the Virgin, then did the
holy Ghoſt make her fruitfull, then
did that woman conceive a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a man, then was ſhee repleniſht
with grace, then ſhee receiv'd the
Lord, that hee might be in her who
made her.</hi> And in another place he
writeth thus.<note place="margin">Serm. 2. infeſto Annun. Domin.</note> 
               <hi>Make no delay, O Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
ſay but the word ſpeedily to the
Meſſenger, and receive thy Sonne,
give thy Faith, and feele the vertue
of it. Behold, ſaith ſhe, the Handmaid
of the Lord, be it to me according to
thy word. Here was no delay at all the
divine Agent returneth, and Chriſt
enters the Virginall wombe. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God is ſuddenly made fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and is predicated happy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ages. She preſently conceived
the Divinity of the Word without the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18366:87"/>
fellowſhip of a man.</hi> In this celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Nuptials betweene
God and nature, while my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
advanceth one ſteppe, my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
retires another. Here Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is transformed into Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Eloquence into ſilence. Some
are rather ſolicitous to ſearch into
the profundity of the Myſtery,
than humbly to acknowledge
it, and by Reaſon ſeeke to pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which excludes all reaſon.
What was before time it ſelfe,<note place="margin">This concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Time, from all eternity.</note> is
believed, not comprehended by
man; for that tranſcends the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of man which was
before his nature. No eyes but
thoſe of Faith, can penetrate this
Wonder. All things in God are
above reaſon, nothing above
Faith. Here a Virgin conceives
without the loſſe of Chaſtity, a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18366:87"/>
Maide remaines an immaculate
Mother. Eternity is here encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd
by time, glory masked in
miſery. A thing finite containes
Infinity, a mortall encloſeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Here the Sonne is as antient
as his Father, elder than his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is made of her whom he
made. Here is a concurrence, or a
congregation of Miracles. It is a
miracle that in the forming of
ſuch, and ſo great an iſſue the aide
of man ſhould be utterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that as he was man, he
was onely made of the pure bloud
of the Virgin. It is a miracle that
the ordinary number of dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the forming of a humane
body is not here obſerv'd, but in
a very moment without ſucceſſion
of time a body is fram'd, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:18366:88"/>
all theſe is that at the ſame inſtant
wherein the ſoule is joyned to the
body, the Divinity and Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are united in one perſon, and
the eternall Word is inſeperably
linkt with the fleſh; ſo that the
Son of God and man is the ſame
in the Virgins wombe. As for the
manner of her conception, I doe
not more mervaile at the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
ſtrangeneſſe of it, then I
doe at the daring inquiſition, and
ſenſuall expreſſion of ſome, who
relate it in words as groſſe as their

I could free the moſt learned, and
ingenious <hi>Eraſmus</hi> from the juſt

to me according to thy Word; in the
very inſtant (to make good the words
of the Angell) the holy Ghoſt came
upon her, and enter'd through the open
dores of her Faith. What part did he
enter? firſt the Chappell of her chaſte
boſome, then the Temple of her holy
and incorrupt wombe: Her boſome,
that ſhe might be made a Prophet eſſe,
her wombe, that ſhee might become a
mother.</hi> Now for the time of this
conception, whether or no it were
preciſely on the 25. day of March,
I will not ſtrive to chaine any
mans beleefe to a reſolution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though I finde many old and
great Doctors of the Church to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18366:89"/>
have held it for a truth. Many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
here ariſe which I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, nor deſire to diſcuſſe. I
will onely looke into the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this incomparable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
after that ſhe knew ſhe was
become the receptacle of a Deity.
The meere apprehenſion of ſuch
an unheard of honour in other
women, would have begotten
pride, arrogancy, and diſdaine,
not onely of all their ſexe, but of
mankinde it ſelfe. They would
have repin'd at their breathing of
common ayre, and (ſcorning the
earth they trod on) have nouriſht
an ambition to walke on the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
of heaven. But this
Maide above imagination excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
the more ſhe was grac'd and
dignified, the more ſhe was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
When all men admir'd, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18366:90"/>
even ador'd her, and judg'd her
worthy to be preſently aſſumed
into heaven, ſhe was ready to
creepe into the center of the earth,
and there to hide her, thinking
that every one pointed at her, as
undeſerving that ſupreme dignity
confer'd on her by God himſelfe.
And whereas others would have
ſtudied nothing but rich Tiſſues,
and embroyderies to weare, and
the moſt coſtly Perſian Carpets
to tread on, ſhe meditated ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in apparell, and a good paire
of ſhooes to beare her afoot jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
over the ſteepe and flinty
mountaines, intending to beſtow

have trotted over hils, and dales,

climing, a thing as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the nature of it, as it is to
things ponderous of themſelues to
flie. This ſoveraigne of her ſexe
having the celeſtiall Monarch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the narrow compaſſe of
her wombe, made haſte to paſſe
thoſe ſteep, ſtony, and rugged hils,
the willingneſſe of her minde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
the feeblenes of her body.
And, to ſay the truth, whether
ſhould ſhe (whoſe worth exalted

to places as eminent in ſcituation

her by one hand, and Humility
by the other. And if we diligently
peruſe Gods ſacred Word, we

honour'd with many notable acts.
Where did that parent of an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

On a mountaine. Where did <hi>Moſes</hi>
receive the Tables of the divine

Law? On a mountaine. Where did
Chriſt, (his Humanity concealed)
transfigure his face into a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of eternall glory? On a
mountaine. Where did he ſhed his
pureſt bloud, and lay downe his
deareſt life as an expiation for our
hainous and manifold ſinnes? On
a mountaine. But why theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Acts were performed on
mountains rather then in vallies,
Reaſon hath not a ſight ſtrong, and
quicke enough to diſcover. But
this is evident, that God hath not
plac'd Heaven it ſelfe on the one
ſide of us, or under our feet, but
over our heads, that we might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our looks, and fixe them on his
eternall habitation, and aſpire to

our true countrey, out of which
while we live, we leade but a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

ſurely the very ſight of ſublime

            <p>The cauſe why ſhe tooke this

ſo briefly, that I will ſtrive to avoid
even long ſyllables. Yet do ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

from theſe two Chriſtalline

to compoſe an entire booke

            <p>The Angell that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,

her that her Couſen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in her old declining age had
conceiv'd a ſonne, and that this
was now the ſixth moneth of her
being quicke. Theſe glad tydings,
no doubt, delighted much our
bleſſed Ladies minde, where they
could not ſtay without rendring a
faire encreaſe of fruit, firſt in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
then in action. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
ſhe no ſooner heard them but
her ſoul was delivered of a twinne
of vows; the firſt was, to praiſe
God, that he out of his beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and infinite goodneſſe had
vouchſafed to crowne her couſens
fruitfull vertue with the bleſſing of
a childe, ſhe being now in yeares,
when deſpaire had chaſed all ſuch
hopes out of her breaſt, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe
(as the world conceiv'd)
had ſeal'd up her wombe. The

other was, all impediments ſet
apart, to give her couſin a viſit in
her owne Country, and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Having performed the firſt,
her thankeſgiving for her, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
the latter, her journey to

            <p>Behold here a prodigall
Charity that hath no reſpect of it
ſelfe,<note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> being onely intentive on the
good of another. It was charity
that withdrew her from her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
privacry into the publike
view, which till then ſhe had ever
ſhun'd. It was Charity that added
wings to her feet, and armed
her heart againſt all ſiniſter
accidents that could happen.
It was Charity that emboldened
her to goe to her couſin without
any invitation, not being expected
by her, or, happily, by face
knowne to her, and with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18366:95"/>
of welcome to enter her
houſe. It was charity that caus'd
her to tender ſervice there where
it was due to her ſelfe. It was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that cheer'd her up, and ſent
her on this congratulating Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.
Laſtly, it was Charity that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
ſanctity it ſelfe encloſed in

            <p>Having patiently paſſed the

(having no other revealer, nor

immediately knoweth the Mother
of her Lord to be there preſent,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18366:96"/>
and knowing doth acknowledge
it, and acknowledging doth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
her perfections, &amp; profeſſeth
her houſe bleſſed in being graced
with her vouchſafing to be in it.
She at firſt ſight diſcernes in her
ſo many, and ſo great concealed
vertues and myſteries, that a man
would judge ſhe had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the enterview of her, and
the Angell. Nor did ſhe conceale
theſe her excellencies, but did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
them with ſuch skill and
zeale, that Fame was even proud
to repeat them. Could the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall

a narrow humane boſome is not

the humble and meeke. He hath filled

The aſſeveration of ſome,
that this was not an effect
of the Virgins vertue, but
of the Word incarnate,
may be admitted for
good, if we onely have an
eye to her Vertue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the aide, and power
of the divine Grace. But
all Wiſedomes Children
are by Truth, her ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that many things
are lawfully attributed to
ſecondary Cauſes, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
and efficient cauſe
not rejected. And this way

what worke ſoever God

wrought either in the

houſe of <hi>Zachary,</hi> or elſe where

any thing to the conſpicuous
merits of the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> or any

Yes ſurely, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> taſted
the fruit of her all-gladding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
for ſhe could not conceale
the pleaſure conceived in her
heart, but utter'd it in the beſt
words ſhe could. <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe alſo
relliſht it, and by his motion gave
what ſignes he could of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and worſhip he receiv'd, and
payd. Neither could it otherwiſe
be but the Manſion of <hi>Zachary</hi> and
the adjacent countrey were both
delighted, and ſanctified by the
three moneths reſidence of her,
who bore not about, but in her, the
Author, and conſummatour of all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18366:100"/>
piety. Their joy, queſtionleſſe, was
beyond imagination great, in that
they had never before ſeene Gods
gifts, and graces paſſing through
ſo pure an organ of his Spirit. But
the aged Propheteſſe her ſelfe,
doubtleſſe was in a holy delitious
Trance at the very firſt ſteppe ſhe
made over her threſhold, and
thought her houſe, but halfe bleſt
till the other foot was in. Their
mutuall ſalutation ſurely was low,
and ſubmiſſive, which I cannot
better expreſſe then by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the encounter of two
ſhades ſoftly creeping ore the face
of the earth. The Evangeliſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
onely the Compendium of
their conference, which could not
be but as long as ſerious. They
treated ſurely of deepe miraculous
Myſteries, as of the incarnation of

the Word, of the perſecution of
her, and Gods onely Sonne, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

may come to paſſe that the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

Thy Charity and Humility
made thee forget thy ſublime and my

But from others thou mayſt hide it,

who haſt ſurpaſſed thy Fathers
Faith in beleeving things which
ſeeme more impoſsible to humane
Reaſon: if in this rude ſpeech of mine
I have over-talked my ſelfe, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken
thee, impute it to my declining
and doting yeares, and grant me thy
Pardon. Thus I end, but not without
adding to thoſe I have already given
thee, a Myriade of Welcomes, and a
million of Aves more.</p>
            <p>The vertuous Maid undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was not here mute, but devided
her ſpeech betweene God and her
Couſin. She directed (with I
know not whether greater Piety,
or Prudency) her praiſe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ere ſhe would vouchſafe to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18366:104"/>
make a reply to the latter. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
without all peradventure her
humanity afforded her, and to this
purpoſe for ought we know,
might it be.</p>
            <q>Deareſt Couſin, your own wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will plead my excuſe, in
that I rendred him laud to whom
it belongs, ere I accepted of it my
ſelfe to whom it is not due. You
magnifie me, and I my Creator.
Your ſacred iſſue moved with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
at the ſound of my harſh
voyce, and my ſpirit rejoyceth in
the Mercy of my ſweeteſt Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
You give me attributes more
proper to my Maker than to me,
not unlike thoſe Heathen who
take off the heads from the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of their Gods, and faſten them
to the ſhoulders of their Princes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18366:104"/>
Statues. Your commendations fit
your ſelfe better than me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
thoſe reſplendent rayes
which returne into the radiant bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that ſent them forth. In a
word, you have ſubſcribed my
Name to your owne Character.
The humbling and undervaluing
of your ſelf is a ſtrong argument of
your vertue; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

give me leave to tell you,

me an affront together with your

ſurely to behold decrepit age wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on active youth, wiſedome
on vanity; a venerable Matron on
a ſimple Girle. The ſcope of my
journey is to attend you, to lend
you my ſtrength, now your owne
failes you, and to ſerve you
through all the offices of your
Hand-maid. Doe but intimate
your will by the leaſt ſigne, and
you ſhall ſee me flye to performe
it. Your Invention cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
any thing ſo impoſſible,
which my will (ambitious to
pleaſe you) will not judge moſt

you intreat me to ſtay long with

you, you tranſgreſſe the Lawes of
Friendſhip in petitioning her
whom you may juſtly and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
command. A thing ſtrange to
me it is, that you ſhould thinke
me ſo ſtupid and ſenceleſſe, as
that I ſhould need an invitation to
be made truely happy. Before I
had the honour to ſee you, I envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe that enjoyed your ſweet
and divine converſation, and
thought they enricht themſelves
with my loſſe; wherefore a ſtaffe
to beat me hence is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
than Oratory to keepe mee

for the grace which I ſhall never

Celebration of a ſolemne
Feaſt. And the Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi>
(of what authoritie in other things
I know not certainly in this one
particular very commendable)
hath decreed the ſolemnization of
this Feſtivall day in theſe verie
words.</p>
            <p>The Bleſſed Virgin being inſtructed
by the celeſtiall Meſſenger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by the Holy Ghoſt, aſcended in
haſte the mountanous Countrey, and
entred the humble houſe of <hi>Zachary.</hi>
For <hi>IESUS</hi> who was in her wombe,
made haſte to bleſſe <hi>Iohn</hi> as yet in his
Mothers Belly. And the moſt glorious
Virgin viſiting her Couſen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
was pleaſing to her both in her
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18366:108"/>
loving viſitation, and fruitfull Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie.
The Conſideration of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
Myſtery ought to delight the
mindes of the Faithfull, wherein theſe
two glorious Mothers (who bore about
them the comencement and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of our Salvation) did ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
communicate their joyes, and
wherein the moſt excellent Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>
the moſt venerable amongſt
the Daughters of <hi>Aaron</hi> diſcours'd
together. The firſt of theſe had inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in her wombe the Creatour and
Redeemer of us all, the latter his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner.
Theſe Saints being made Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by a Miracle conferr'd together
of the Divine benefits they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
The meeting of this worthy paire
was moſt happie, and illuſtrated with
great, and glorious teſtimonies of the
divine Grace. The one conceived by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18366:108"/>
the cooperation of the holy Spirit, the
other by Myracle in her old Age, and
both their iſſues foretold by the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Angell. <hi>Iohn</hi> as yet impriſoned in
his Mothers wombe doth worſhip his
Lord borne to him in <hi>Maries</hi> Belly;
and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> fill'd with the Holy
Ghoſt doth congratulate the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sonne of God, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Mankinde, and prophecying
declares her Couſen bleſſed in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and contemplating the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
revealed to her. On the other ſide
<hi>Mary</hi> full of unutterable joy, layed up
all theſe ſayings in her heart, which
before ſhe had heard from the Angel,
and now from <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and breaks
out into a Song of Thankſgiving to
the Lord. Who can ſufficiently praiſe
ſo great Myſteries? Who can declare
thoſe joyes to the full? <hi>Iohn</hi> not yet
borne rejoyceth, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18366:109"/>
with the arrivall of the Virgin.
Mary is extreamely pleaſed in the
Myſteries, the Saviour of the world is
acknowledged by his Fore-runner, not
onely the Angels, but Heaven and
Earth reſent the pleaſure, and the
whole Trinitie is glorified with new
praiſes. Wherefore the greatneſſe of
theſe joyes is to be extolled with eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
commendations, and with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ſolemnities to be celebrated, and
the Lord in the wombe, the Virgin
that beares him, the barren that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
and the Fore-runner that it
ſanctified ought to be preſented with
all imaginable praiſes and honours.</p>
            <p>With this pious and gratefull
ordinance of the Church I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the viſitation of our incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Lady, and now proceed to

we are now to treat of. Here

               <hi>The
ſtone which the Builders refuſed is the
head of the corner. This was the Lords
doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath
made, let us rejoyce, and be glad in it.</hi>
This is our wedding-day, wherein
by the Sonne we are joyned to the
Father. This is the day of the new
union, wherein he who is God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
the ſame that he was, yet
for our ſakes is borne, and made
what he was not; wherein he that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18366:110"/>
was every where without a Body,
is made preſent to us by a Body,
that what God hath by <hi>Nature,</hi>
men might receive by <hi>Grace.</hi> This
is a great, a joyfull, a fortunate, a
deſired day, the end of the Law,
the end of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Goſpell, nay the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
it ſelfe. This is a day of State,
uſher'd by the Angels, follow'd
by the Apoſtles. Let our Mindes
remove the diſtance of Time and
place, and dwell a while with our
all-holy-Lord and bleſſed Lady,
leſt we looſe the pleaſure of this
day, the leaſt Accident whereof is
Myſterious. What a brave aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Viſitants of all Conditions
reſorted this day to this place,
which then might rightly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Randevous of the Saints?
Would you ſee thoſe who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18366:110"/>
men, but below him who is
borne? Behold the Angels ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his birth. Do you deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the married? Here you have
<hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married?
Here you have <hi>Symeon.</hi>
Widdows? Here you have <hi>Anna.</hi>
Prieſts? Here againe you have <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary.</hi>
Wiſe men? Here you have
them from the Eaſt. Ideots? You
have here the Shepheards. But
here is to be noted, that theſe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of Beaſts heare the voyce of
the Angels before any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
firſt receive the Goſpell, and
firſt divulge it. And in this they
were more happie then <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
himſelfe, who (though he had
made a firme Peace by Sea and
Land, and had now the third time
ſhut up the Temple of <hi>Ianus)</hi> yet
was he ignorant of the bleſſed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18366:111"/>
Peace concluded on betwixt God
and Man. O how much ſometimes
Ignorance avails in Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!
Kings, Potentates, the Rulers
of the Earth, and the wiſe of this
world are aſleepe while Chriſt is
borne. Theſe moſt ſimple of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and innocent as the creatures
they tend, watch all night, and
therefore are firſt made partakers
of theſe joyfull news. As their
owne wooll not yet dipt in any
dye readily drinks in any colour
they pleaſe of beſtow on it: So
their minds voyd of all humane
wiſedome, greedily ſuckt in the
Divine; Faith is the <hi>Compendium</hi>
of Salvation, and humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of times the obſtacle of
Faith. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> having confined to
Heaven, the Maker, and Moover
of it, would never have beleeved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18366:111"/>
his birth here below. <hi>Plato</hi> would
have derided this miraculous rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who the more he attributed
to God, the leſſe would he have
expected his ſo humble comming
into the world. Neither would
the Stoicks who held God to be a
fire, nor <hi>Hipocrates</hi> who thought
him to be a warm'th, ever have
look't for him clad in fleſh and
bloud. Wherefore they are here
elected witneſſes of this ſtrange
truth, whoſe Science was of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtrongly to beleeve, not wittily
to diſpute. O what proficients in
Faith did theſe ruſticall Swaines
prove in a moment! What a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſecret is imparted to them?
Let us examine the verity of this
by that infallible Touch-ſtone, the
text. <hi>And there were in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Shepheards abiding in the field,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18366:112"/>
&amp; keeping watch by night, becauſe of
their flocke, and loe the Angell of the
Lord came upon them, and the glory
of the Lord ſhone about them, and
they were ſore afraid. Then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſaid unto them, Be not afraid;
for behold I bring you tidings of great
joy that ſhall be to all the people: That
is, that unto you is borne this day a
Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.
And this ſhall be a ſigne unto you; you
ſhall finde the Childe ſwadled and
layed in a Cratch. And ſtraight way
there was with the Angell a multitude
of heavenly Souldiers, prayſing God,
and ſaying; Glory be to God in the
high Heaven; and Peace on Earth,
and towards men good will. And it
came to paſſe that when the Angels
were gone away from thence into
Heaven, that the Shepheards ſaid
one to another; Let us goe then unto</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:18366:112"/>
Bethlem, <hi>and ſee this thing that is
come to paſſe, which the Lord hath
ſhewed unto us; ſo they came with
haſte, and found both</hi> Mary <hi>and</hi>
Ioſeph <hi>with the Babe layd in the
Cratch.</hi> And when they had ſeene
it, they publiſht abroad the thing that
was told them of that Childe.</p>
            <p>Here three things eſpecially are
remarkable:</p>
            <p>Firſt, their forwardneſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving:</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſpeed they made
to ſee what they had believed, and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to publiſh what they
had ſeene.</p>
            <p>That they quickly believed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the haſte they made to
ſee. They no ſooner ſaw him, but
they found him to be the King of
Iſraell indeed, yet withall to be a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18366:113"/>
Shepheard. They inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
this to be the Shepheard,
who was to lay downe his life for
his flocke. The Prince of all Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
whoſe ſheepe-fold is the
world: The Shepheard that was
to ſeperate the Goates from the
Sheepe. They diſcover'd this to
be the immaculate Lambe that
was to take away the ſinnes of the
world. They diſclos'd this Lamb
to be the greateſt Lyon of the
Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Whom now they
looke on in the Cratch, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
ſhall hereafter behold on his
Throne. Theſe men in whom
there was no guile as they could
not deceive others, ſo they could
not in this be deceiv'd. They nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not ſuſpect any fallacy, and
therefore might ſafely relate this
divine wonder to all they met.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18366:113"/>
The ſecond witneſſes of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
are the Wiſe men. After
God had laid open the Treaſure
of his divine ſecrets to Idiots, he
ſhewes them alſo to the wiſe. It
ſeemes the Earth at this time was
become the Booke of Gods grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Myſteries, and Heaven the
Index. In this they finde the Star
of this King of the Iewes, which
(having beene before the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of his Nativity) they now
make their guide in their journey.
The Starre performing this duty
to its Creator, at length brings
them to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where they view
him in the Crateh, whoſe Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before they had found in the
Heavens. To him they doe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
tender adoration, and pay
Tribute, and opening their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18366:114"/>
make him an oblation of
Gold, Incenſe, and Mirrhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Whom before they had in vaine
ſought in the Heavens, they now
finde on the earth, and in the moſt
ſorded part of it, a Stable, full of
ſeverall ſtinkes; where he (to
whom none are worthy to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
had two dull Beaſts for his
Companions.</p>
            <p>Returne now you Sonnes of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to your owne home, by much
more learned, by more than much
more happy than when you ſet out.
Heaven is now ſet open to you, which
before your unbeliefe kept ſhut againſt

you have ſeene. Publiſh in all places

which God is onely able to produce,
onely faith can apprehend. Of all
Creatures to man onely belongs the
gift of Reaſon, by the rule whereof he
meaſures all things. But doe not you
doe ſo, leſt you fall not onely into an
irreparable, but a damnable errour.
Follow you the inſtruction of Faith,

him, who when he gave the Law
appeared in Fire, now he offers
Grace involv'd in Hay. Yet in this
dejected poſture, in this courſe
manner while he lay, he wanted
not a whole Army of Angelicall
ſpirits that declar'd his Birth to
Men, and they who had before
chanted his praiſes as he ſate in
Glory, now ſing his goodneſſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Cratch. Though he have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18366:116"/>
a hoomely roofe over his head,
the Eaſt obſerves his approach.
Though the poverty of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
obſcures his Deity, the
Starres in Heaven make it known.
Behold him who came humble to
the humble, for the humble, and
yet his humility is above all ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
Reverently and intentively
look on him who deſcended from
Heaven to Earth, who came to
you, into you, who is borne in the
night, borne in the midſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and borne (after the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
humane condition) naked, and
none offer him aſſiſtance. Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
clothes are wanting, ſome
ragges are found out, a Cradle is
miſſing, a Manger is at hand.</p>
            <p>Here he cryes to you, and holds up
his pretty hands to Heaven, which he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18366:117"/>
cals to witneſſe that he can humble
himſelfe no lower. Can you view this
humble, this mercifull ſpectacle, and
not weepe your ſelues into marble? O
ſpeedily put on ſackcloth! beſprinckle
your ſelues with Aſhes, kneele downe
in the duſt and dung under the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
where your Lord lyes, knock your
ſelues on the boſomes, fetch ſighs and
grones from the bottom of your hearts,
repay him the teares he lent you, and
by your ſad geſture and deportment
demonſtrate how much you are bound
to him who ſuffered for you even in his
Birth.</p>
            <p>Having ſeene the Sonne, now
ſtedfaſtly place your eyes upon
the Mother. Behold the unpollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mayd (a great part of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
ſitting neare the Manger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voyd of all luſt, chaſt in Soule
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18366:117"/>
and Body, who doth now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that of which ſhe is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without a miracle, to wit, that
ſhe is a Mother, and with fixed
eyes expreſſing now joy, now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
ſees her ſelfe wedded to
Heaven. She beholds her ſelfe a
Mother deliver'd of her Parent, a
handmaid of her King, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
She to her aſtoniſhment finds
that ſhe hath brought forth an
iſſue more mighty then <hi>David,</hi>
more ancient then <hi>Adam.</hi> And now
ſhe feeles the tender, and ardent
affection of a Mother, but the old
love ſhe hath borne her virginity
gives it an allay. Here the Mother,
the Midwife, and the Nurſe are
one and the ſame, leſt any thing
leſſe pure ſhould handle him then
her who brought him forth. And
now ſhe nurſeth this Heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18366:118"/>
with her pure milke, which
flows from no mortall luſt, but
from the Celeſtiall Grace. Her
breaſts white as their owne milke
preſſed by her delicate fingers, as
white as either, he ſoftly pats, and
playes with. Sometimes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
to them for ſport, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for neceſſity, and he who
feeds all things elſe draws thence
his nouriſhment. He caſteth up
now one eye, now the other, and
with a pleaſing looke gives her a
ſweet ſmile, not unlike to that
which <hi>Zephirus</hi> imprints on the
cheeke of the Roſe. She returnes
him another, and her infinite, but
chaſte, affection ſhe divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
her Sonne, and her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And now her extaſie being a
little over, ſhe cals to minde that
ſhe hath often read her owne ſtory
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18366:118"/>
fore-told by the Prophets, <hi>That a
Virgin ſhould bring forth a Sonne.</hi>

            <l>Purification, according to the Law</l>
            <l>of Moſes were accomplished they</l>
            <l>brought him to Hieruſalem, to</l>

Having waited on her in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
<note place="margin">Her Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> we will now attend her to
her Purification. This day (the
celebration whereof is inſtituted
by the Church) is called <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe,</hi>
as much as to ſay, the <hi>Day of
Lights,</hi> on which (while Maſſe
was ſinging) very many Tapours
were burning in the Church. The
Luſtration of houſes was yearely
uſuall with the Romans in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of February, from whence
this cuſtome in the Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.

               <hi>Innocentius</hi> thus propounds
and ſolves the Queſtion. <hi>What is
the reaſon, ſaith he, that on this Holy
day we uſe ſo many Lights in the
Church? The cauſe of this inſtitution
is two-fold. The firſt is, that a Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
cuſtome may be converted into a
Chriſtian Right or Ordinance, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18366:123"/>
that which was performed by ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Idolaters in honour of</hi> Ceres
<hi>and</hi> Proſerpina, <hi>may be turned into
the praiſe and glory of the Virgin</hi>
Mary. <hi>The ſecond is, that they who
by Grace are purified, by this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
may be admoniſhed to imitate
thoſe prudent Virgins, who (as the
Evangelicall Parable teſtifieth) came
not without their Tapours lighted to
the Nuptials of Chriſt their Spouſe.</hi>
This day the Church uſed to
pray, that as the viſible Lights
chaſed away the darkeneſſe of the
night: ſo the hearts of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
might be illuminated by the
Inviſible flames of the holy Spirit,
&amp; (being cured of their blindneſſe
brought upon them by vice) might
with pure and cleare eyes diſcerne
thoſe things which are pleaſing to
God, and neceſſary to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18366:123"/>
and having paſs'd through
the ſad, darke, and diſmall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of this world, might at
length arrive at Heaven, where
they ſhall behold, and enjoy a
Light everlaſting. This day is not
onely made Holy by the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mother, but by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
alſo and preſentation of the
Sonne, of whom, as of the more
worthy, we muſt firſt diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It was truely a great abaſing of
the Sonne of God (for which by
the Prophets he was ſtyled a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant)
who being not a debtor to
the Law, but the Lord of it, and
the onely Firſt-borne free from
ſinne, yet endured and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
with other Children, both
the Iewiſh Circumciſion and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and at once publikely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18366:124"/>
his Fathers houſe, and (to
uſe the Prophets phraſe) fill'd it
with glory. There offer'd by the
Virgin hands of his Mother, he
was to his Father a moſt pleaſing
oblation, being the end of the
Law, and all the antient Sacrifices.
Neither was the longing of <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Anna</hi> onely ſatisfied with
his aſpect, but the ardent wiſhes
alſo of many others, in whoſe
mindes the old ſparke of Faith
now burſt out into new and bright
flames, which did not onely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their owne, but other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes
alſo. Not a few, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> markt this day
with a white ſtone, and did cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
it with joy and thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
in that the Light foretold by
<hi>Eſay</hi> then aroſe, and comforted
all thoſe to whom the ſhine and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18366:124"/>
warmth of it extended. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had
never ſeene her Meſſias, till then
when ſhe had free leave to kiſſe,
embrace, and dandle him in her
Armes, and therefore her joy
muſt of neceſſity be more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
Yet ſome of her inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were deafe, and could not
heare the Prophets proclaime his
comming; others were blinde,
and could not diſcerne him being
come, nor were ſenſible at all of
the Honour they received in the
venerable preſence of him, and his
incomparable Mother.</p>
            <p>I now come to our ſweeteſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the time of whoſe Lying in
being expired, ſhe ſets forward to
the Temple. I have read ſome
who poetically ſet downe her
going thither, and compare her to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18366:125"/>
               <hi>Aurora,</hi> whom the Poets deſcribe
ſitting in a golden Chariot drawn
by a <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> her yellow haire
ſpred over her milky ſhoulders,
with a Torch in her hand enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this inferiour world. For my
owne part (though of all humane
ſtudies I am moſt taken with Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy)
yet both by Nature and Grace
I abhorre to write of things divine
in the ſtile of the ſtage. But this
Religion and modeſty will licenſe
me to averre, That when ſhe went
to be Purified, ſhe was in all things
the very figure and reſemblance
of Sanctity it ſelfe. No doubt but
ſhe was accompanied with a Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of Shee-Saints, of which ſhe
was the Chorus. Neither was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
abſent, who as before he had
beene a guardiant of her, and her
Infant in her Delivery when he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18366:125"/>
was not capable of the Miracle;
So now he is altogether incapable
of his owne Felicity in attending
his faireſt Mate, and deareſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to the holy Temple. And
who doubts but this bleſſed one
joy'd more in this Iourney than
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> or any other. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifie that it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
cuſtome amongſt the very
Heathen from remote places to
come to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 12.</note> and in the
Temple thereof to performe their
devotions.<note place="margin">Acts 2. 8</note> Doe you thinke this
pious Maide can be out-ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the performance of a holy
duty by the Gentiles? Can you
imagine ſhe could neglect and
looſe the occaſion of time and
place offered her, to commend to
her Maker in her beſt words the
vowes and prayers of her prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18366:126"/>
heart? She came to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
(for certainly ſhe dwelt not
there) with farre greater ſpeed
and joy, queſtionleſſe, than to her
Couſins houſe, this being a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that much more concern'd
her, in that ſhe was by more and
ſtronger tyes bound to ſerve God
than <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Her Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> And here by the
way we muſt not omit her Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Charity. Of the firſt
whereof we have a cleere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
in this, That what other
women did out of feare of the
Law, ſhe was perſwaded by a
perfect faith, and an humble
obedience to performe. For that
her Purification was neceſſary, I
beleeve no man will affirme, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in this ſenſe, That the Rites
and Ceremonies impoſed on the
purified by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18366:126"/>
decency to be obſerved by her
who had borne him that came to
fulfill, not to deſtroy the Law.
She could not be maculated in
conceiving, becauſe ſhe knew no
man, nor in bearing, by reaſon it
was without a man. Why ſhould
ſhe be ſolicitous to redeeme her
Sonne, who was himſelfe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of the world? This was
aſſuredly an act produced by her
Humility, as was alſo her refuſing
the company of the rich, and her
aſſociating the poore and needy,<note place="margin">Her charity.</note>
though moſt impure, and abject.
And ſhe her ſelfe was ſo penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that ſhe had not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to buy a Lambe, whereof to
make oblation. Whereas the Rich
hide and hourd up their wealth,
ſhe drawes forth the<note n="*" place="margin">This is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen,</hi> &amp; many more.</note> Treaſure

gold, which upon charitable uſes
ſurely was conſumed; for her
Frugality and Temperancy were
ſuch, that in ſo ſhort a time ſhe
could not poſſibly have ſpent the

are not to be wondred at in her,
who being a Doctreſſe, ſcorn'd
not to be a Diſciple, and ſtrongly
to endeavour the attaining even to
thoſe vertues which by Nature
were innate, and by Grace engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in her. Raviſht in ſoule with
theſe her Excellencies, me thinkes
I ſee her Majeſtically pacing on to
the Temple, and heare her thus
ſpeake to thoſe who accompanied
and met her on the way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:18366:127"/>
My deare friends, Siſters, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſervants, I have ever deſir'd and
endeavour'd (as neare as Humane
frailtie will give me leave) to imitate
my ſweeteſt Sonne, whoſe profound
Humility and perfect obedience can
never ſufficiently be extolled. Full
well he knew Humility to make the
firſt ſtep to eternall life; Obedience the
ſecond; the former of which to teach
all men he deſcended from Heaven,
the latter to demonſtrate, he became
obedient to his Father, even to the
ſuffering of the curſed death of the
Croſſe. Would you ſee me a Proficient
in both theſe ſupernaturall vertues?
Behold me who am unpolluted, (as
not having conceived by humane
meanes) going like one vitious, and
impure to be purified. I who am free
from the obſervation of the Moſaicall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18366:128"/>
Lawes and Ceremonies, have ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

of Charity and Humility, to none a

produced Salvation to the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
by Example alſo I taught how
this Grace (applicable to all, applied

him of. Her greateſt detracters
ſurely cannot imagine her ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
as not to be apprehenſive of
the delight, the Comfort, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
the honour his preſence
did impart, nor ſo unthankfull as
not to acknowledge, and to her
power expreſſe her gratitude.
Certainly her ſoule was in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18366:130"/>
Trance when ſhe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated
the grace and felicity ſhe
had in Gods owne houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Aſſembly of his elected
people to acknowledge her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for the ineſtimable benefits
he had vouchſafed her, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for this, that in his glorious
eyes ſhe ſeem'd worthy (though
in her ſelfe undeſerving) in her
owne name, and that of his choſen
to preſent him with ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſuch a gift as exceedingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
in excellency, all Hoſts,
Sacrifices, and Sacraments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
being indeed, their onely
ſcope and end. <hi>Anna</hi> the Mother
of <hi>Samuel</hi> is praiſed for her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in Prayer, the fruit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe reaped in her diſpair'd of
Fertility. And of our admired
Virgin, we reade that ſhe careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18366:130"/>
frequented the Temple, of
which (being wiſe) ſhe knew the
inſtitution, and (being pious) the
cuſtome, which ſhe moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
obſerved. Wherefore this
day of her Purification, and at all
times elſe, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſhe much excelled <hi>Anna,</hi> and
her whole ſexe in the fervency of
her Oriſons, in the ardency of her
love, in purity, and ſublimity of
minde, in holineſſe of life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
contemplation. We may
boldly conclude that ſhe pour'd
out her prayers here in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
than ſhe did in <hi>Zacharies</hi>
houſe, where ſhe could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the flame of her zeale from
breaking out into the praiſe of
God her Saviour, in whom ſhe
rejoyced. To this effect, happily,
here ſhe pray'd.</p>

O eternall and gracious God! I am
below other women in merit, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them all indebted to thy ſupreme
Maieſty, for making me the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of thy onely Sonne, the Temple
of thy Spirit, and for this ſpeciall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
done mee in the Temple of thy
Service, the congregation whereof
makes me the onely point wherein the
lines of their affection, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doe meete. If women be reſpected
for their fertillity, needs muſt I be in
great eſteeme with all men, who (by
thy eternall Predeſtination, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
providence) have brought
forth thy onely Sonne, their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
With a bowed heart, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

haſt faithfully and mercifully fulfilled
all thoſe thy favourable promiſes
made me by thy Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18366:131"/>
Couſin <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and thy holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
Thou who can'ſt neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
nor be deceived, haſt made me
(the vertue of thy Spirit operating)
a Mother, my virginall integrity ſtill
preſerved. That long long'd for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
(than whom nothing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or better could be given by thee,
or taken my me) I have at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to ſave all thoſe that beleeve in
him. This magnificent immenſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible,
unvaluable Treaſure,
this beloved Sonne of thine in whom
thou art well pleaſed; This Saint of
Saints, by whom all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, are re-eſtabliſht, this
Saviour of the world I here preſent to
thee, as a gift moſt acceptable in thy
ſight. He whom all Nations, and the

thirſted to ſee: The Angell of the new
Teſtament, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:18366:132"/>
the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
in whom all generations are
bleſſed, the Lord of the Temple is
here come to illuſtrate his owne houſe.
O mercifull Father! open the eyes of
the dimme ſighted Iſraelites, that
they may ſee the glorious Light that
now ſhines on them, and not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
but worſhip their Meſsias,
and imbrace him in their hearts, as
I doe in mine Armes. Neither let the
Rayes of this new borne ſtarre reflect
onely on them, but on all thoſe alſo,
who ſit in darkeneſſe, and the ſhadow
of death, that to them it may reſtore
life and luſtre. So ſhall they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thee, and him whom thou haſt

made ſpirituall dwellings for thee to

Betweene her Purification, and
Paſſion of her Sonne, ſhe is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mentioned in holy Writ, but
when ſhe is, it is ſtill to her praiſe
and honour: As when her care for
the poor made her petition Chriſt
for Wine to revive,<note place="margin">Her charity.</note> and refreſh
their drooping, fainting Spirits;
And when ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>Why
have you us'd us thus? your Father
and I have beene to ſeeke you.</hi>
Whence all women may learne
Humility, motherly care, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall
Faith. She who was without
blemiſh, as being Gods owne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe chaſte boſome no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

lookt on all men with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency

what the Scripture omitteth, muſt
be ſupplied by our charitable ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
which cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all thoſe her Actions buried
in ſilence, to have beene of the
ſame pure thred with the reſt of
her life. The truth of which we
finde confirm'd in her perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in goodneſſe, even to her
ſonnes end, and her owne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At his death wee reade ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>

by the Croſſe of Chriſt his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and her Siſter</hi> Mary Cleophoe
<hi>and</hi> Mary Magdalen. <hi>When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ieſus ſaw his Mother, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

his Mother, Woman, behold thy Son,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18366:133"/>
and he ſaid to his Diſciple, Behold thy
Mother, and from that time he tooke
her for his.</hi> His pardoning of the
Thiefe is not a greater argument
of his Mercy, than his taking care
for his Mother was of his Piety.
He gives Temperancy the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chaſtity, and commends
theſe to each other who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to live and dye Virgins.
Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes theſe words
of Chriſt to his Mother, included
much bitterneſſe, for they put her
in minde that ſhe was to make a
dammageable exchange of Chriſt
for <hi>Iohn,</hi> of the Servant for his
Lord, of the Diſciple for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
of the Sonne of God, for the
ſonne of <hi>Zebedaeus.</hi> And this was
the reaſon (if we give beliefe to
<hi>Mantuan)</hi> that he called her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
not Mother, leſt the very
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18366:134"/>
ſound of that deare word ſhould
make her more ſenſible of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
loſſe, and force her into
an immoderate griefe. But ſorrow
was no Noveltie to her for that
ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>In this world, you
ſhall have affliction,</hi> was in her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
whoſe life contained more
miſeries then minuts, which ſhe
patiently underwent, knowing
that the more diſtreſſed ſhe was
here, the more bleſſed ſhe ſhould
be hereafter. And if we ſhall adde
the light of Reaſon to the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Truth, we ſhall ſoone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that a fatall ſadneſſe haunted
her from the birth of her onely
Sonne to his buriall. When ſhe
was great with him, and readie to
lye downe, the inhumanity of the
Bethlemites was ſuch, that they
confined her, and the Lord of all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18366:134"/>
things to a Stable, and would not
ſupply her with as much as Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
a Mantle, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
wherewithall ſhe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her ſelfe, and her ſweet Babe
from the moyſture of the night,
the ſharpeneſſe of the winter, and
other intollerable inconveniences.
When her Childe was eight daies
old, ſhe ſaw him looſe bloud in
his Circumciſion, which her divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſoule miſgave her to be a
Type of the deare remainder he
was to ſhed. Then againe her
minde was infinitely vexed for
the butchery of thoſe guiltleſſe
Children which were murthered
for the ſake of her owne innocent
Infant; of the ſorrow and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of whoſe Mothers, her tender
compaſſionating heart was a moſt
competent Iudge. From this
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18366:135"/>
bloudy Maſſacre to ſave
her Saviour, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
(without taking
leave of her friends, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of what was hers)
to take her flight with him,
&amp; through danger,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vernulaeus</hi> ſaies that thoſe who flye from danger, travaile moſt by night, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is likely our bleſſed Lady did ſo.</note> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and horrour, to
make her way into Aegypt.
When he was twelve
yeeres old, ſhe loſt him,
an Accident more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for heretofore her
ſtudy had been to preſerve
what ſhe had, now her care
was to finde what ſhe had
not. What an Agony her
ſoule ſuffer'd at the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
tydings of the behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of her Sonnes Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,
I leave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18366:135"/>
of all thankefull ſoules;
for ſhe could not without being
ſtayned with ingratitude, but
mourne for his abſence and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
departure out of the world,
who had received ſo much joy at
her preſence before he came into
it. But above all theſe, the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd
Treacherie of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who
deliver'd this Lambe of God, as a
prey to theſe Wolves; the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his other Diſciples, the
malignity of his Iudges, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of his Executioners conſpir'd
to make her miſerable. Nor is it
unlikely that ſhe bewailed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
the obſtinacy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of her Nation, who revil'd
him that bleſſed them, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
him who came to ſave them.
With what amazement and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was her heart ſurpriſed think
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18366:136"/>
ye, when the newes came of her
Sonnes being apprehended? But
when ſhe ſaw him forſaken by his
friends, bound by his enemies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
before the high Prieſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
by <hi>Herod,</hi> deſpis'd by the
people; ſcourg'd, and tortur'd by
the command of <hi>Pilate,</hi> his body
trembling, torne, and pierced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd
with his owne bloud, and
hung between two Theeves; then,
and never till then did the Sword
foretold by <hi>Simeon,</hi> paſſe through
her Soule. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaies this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of <hi>Simcon</hi> was ſpoken to
her, not to <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> for on her alone
the whole weight of ſorrow was
to be laid. True it is that many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about the interpretation of this
Sword. To cleare all doubts, we
muſt take notice that the holy
Scriptures mention foure ſorts of
Swords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:18366:136"/>
The firſt is a Corporall, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
ſword, and of this Chriſt
ſpeakes to <hi>Peter, All that uſe the
Sword, ſhall periſh with the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is a ſpirituall
Sword, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes
mention, when he ſaies, <hi>Receive
the ſword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is a Sword of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
or Ambiguity, with which
the Apoſtles themſelves were
ſtrucken, when they forſooke
their Maſter.</p>
            <p>The fourth is the Sword of
Griefe or Tribulation.<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.</note> With this
the Prophet <hi>David</hi> averres the<note place="margin">Pſ. 105.</note>
Soule of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to have beene<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:18366:137"/>
pierc'd when his death was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
firſt by his trecherous Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
next by his incontinent
Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>That this Sword whereof <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Prophecied, could be no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
one, is evident, in that we
read not of any violent death ſhe
ſuffered. That it could not be the
ſword of the Spirit, is manifeſt;
for the word of God was her dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delitious food at the ſame time
when <hi>Simeon</hi> made this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<hi>Origen</hi> indeed will have it to
be the ſword of Ambiguity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity:
which erroneous opinion
of his, is refuted by many great
Fathers of the antient Church,
and by <hi>Franciſcus Lumbertus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. Lucae cap. 2.</note> an
accute Proteſtant Doctor of the
moderne in theſe words. <hi>Thoſe,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18366:137"/>
ſaith he, who will have this to be the
ſword of Infidelity, are not to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to; for (beſides that they can
produce no proofe of this their opinion)
it is contradictory to the Text, moſt
raſh, and moſt untrue. How can it be
that the ſword of Infidelity ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the breſt of Gods ſacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into which, infidelity never
made the leaſt impreſsion? From the
beginning, her Faith was moſt firme
and intire. Let therefore thoſe Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
and wicked ſlanders of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men be put to ſilence. I will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
nothing to the bleſſed Virgin, but
what I reade in the holy Writ, where
ſhe is pronounced bleſſed, becauſe ſhee
beleev'd. We have many teſtimonies
of her Faith, but of her Infidelity not
one word is extant in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
Yet this prophane aſſertion
is not a whit ſtrange, or to be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18366:138"/>
marvelled at in <hi>Origen,</hi>
who held that Chriſt dyed
for the Angels, and the
Starres, and whoſe ſoule
was, indeed, no other than
a Mynt of Hereſies.<note place="margin">Her paſſive For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the Death of her Sonne.</note> 
               <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton</hi>
affirmes, that her
ſorrow was much aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by her Faith,<note place="margin">Melan. in cap. 27. Matth.</note> which
aſſured her of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
She knew ſhe had
borne the Meſſias, whoſe
bloud was to waſh away
the ſinnes of the world.
Wherefore ſhe might well
be amaz'd, diſtruſtfull ſhe
could not be at all. The
holy Spirit certified her
this was not a deſtroying
death, but a triumphing.
Her Faith, the oftner it
was tryed in the furnace of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18366:138"/>
affliction, the brighter ſtill it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
She ſtood with the affection
of a Mother, the paſſion of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but with the conſtancy and
fortitude of a man, in beholding
her owne bloud ſpilt, her owne
fleſh rent, and mangled before her
face. With an unſhaken confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and a true internall valour,
ſhe beheld his body naked, and
ſcourg'd, his hands and feet nailed
to the Croſſe: yet ſometimes the
ſtrings of her relenting, mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart were ready to cracke
with the very thought of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
tortures and afflictions; but as
often againe they were ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and comforted with a full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that he ſhould overcome
them all, and death it ſelfe. She
ſtood here (her Sonne onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
the prime patterne of a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18366:139"/>
ſollid Faith, and conſtant Patience
to all poſteritie, in that neither the
feare of Tribulation, of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of the wracke, of the ſcourge,
or death it ſelfe could divide her
from her Chriſt. She committed
not that errour moſt incident to
women, many of which gentle
ſexe periſh in the midſt of their
Lamentations, and will neither
admit of Counſell, nor Comfort.
She did not teare her haire, ſcratch
her face, batter her boſome, ſeeke
to ſtifle her ſelfe, or gave any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſperate ſigne of a ragefull
ſorrow, nor did ſhe curſe her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or make imprecations for
Vengeance, or ſo much as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
againſt them; but attended the
ſad event with the ſame calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of minde with which this
meeke Lambe did his end. Her
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18366:139"/>
carriage was beyond the Levell of
Cenſure, and in all things ſutable
to the modeſty and gravity of
ſuch a Matron. She fear'd not at
all the fury of the Iewiſh Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that environ'd her, but ſtood
ſecure, and fac'd danger. Though
ſhe was an eye witneſſe of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſaw his Limbs diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and wrack'd, yet did not the
evils ſhe ſaw, wound her ſo deep
as thoſe ſhe heard. The Roman
Fencers uſed to have Wards, or
Covers to ſave their Eares: She
had greater need of ſuch to barre
the entrance of blaſphemies able
to provoke God (if his mercies
were not above all his workes) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to deface Nature, and reduce
the world to its firſt Chaos. She
heard him call'd a Drunkard, a
Blaſphemer, a breaker of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18366:140"/>
a lover of Publicans and
Sinners, nay a very Divell, who
was her and Gods onely delight.
Yet did not all theſe killing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
theſe impious ſlanders, drive
her into the mercileſſe gripes of
deſpaire; for ſhe was confident
that the two perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would not forſake the third.<note place="margin">Melan. in loco praedic.</note>
               <hi>Melancton</hi> commending this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall

No doubt, when (after

choſe rather to periſh, than to come
thither for ſhelter. With them the
dead are more ſenſible of thy paſsion,
than the living, and their devouring
Sepulchers more mercifull then they
themſelves. O my Sonne, my Sonne,
that I ſhould ſee thee ſuffer, and not
be able to ſuccour thee! O that I were
an oblation as ſpotleſſe, and as grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in thy Fathers ſight, as thou thy
ſelfe, that all thy afflictions, all thy
torments might be mine. Were my
power correſpondent to my will, I
would reſcue thee from Legions of thy
enemies. But alas I am a weake wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and all my ſtrength lyes in my
tongue, which will onely ſerve mee
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18366:142"/>
to deplore thy loſſe, and that I truely
doe from the very bottome of my
heart.</p>
            <p>Thus, or to this purpoſe, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
ſhe bewail'd him dying;
but when ſhe once beheld him
dead (Love and Beauty being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
that face) and ſaw withall
their malitious cruelty ſurvive
him, when ſhe view'd his very
carkaſſe pierc't, and water toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with bloud flowing thence,
when ſhe had leiſure to imbrace
his dead body, to number his
wounds, to kiſſe them, and to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
with the holy water of her
eyes to waſh away his ſtripes: ſhe
then was ſo wholly oppreſſed
with anguiſh of ſoule, that ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
at that inſtant deſired her
ſoule, if poſſibly, might tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18366:142"/>
out of her living body, into
his dead one. True it is that many
affirme ſhe felt not thoſe torments
which other women endure in
Child-birth, who are liable to the
malediction laid upon <hi>Eve:</hi> But if
at his comming into the world,
ſhe was not ſenſible of any paine
at all, certainely at his going out,
the griefes of all women contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into one, equals not hers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
And aſſuredly her ſorrow
was much increaſed when ſhe ſaw
<hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſo vehemently to grieve,
whom his death not ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
as it did her, nor were they
ſo able as ſhe to judge of his value.
Then queſtionleſſe in this, or the
like phraſe ſhe renewed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
her complaints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18366:143"/>
O my ſweeteſt Sonne! I bewaile
mine owne, and the wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all thoſe, whoſe ſoules thou haſt
feaſted ſo many yeares with thy mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous
Language. My griefe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to my affection. If <hi>Samuel</hi>
lamented the death of a reprobate
King, if <hi>David</hi> wept over wicked
<hi>Abſolon</hi> with this exclamation, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon
my Sonne, O my Sonne
Abſolon;</hi> can my teares be too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
powr'd upon thee, who art Sonne
to me, and Righteouſneſſe it ſelfe?
Who ſhall forbid or hinder me for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>Ieſus my ſweet Sonne, O
my ſweet Sonne Ieſus?</hi> If thou
didſt weepe over <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
her deſtruction then at hand,
ſhall I not bewaile thy neere approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
end? Thou didſt then compaſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the future Ruine of thoſe very
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18366:143"/>
ſtones, which now with a ſilent grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſeeme to condole, and weepe for
thee. When thou cam'ſt to the Tombe
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thou wert ſo farre from
reprehending the teares of others, that
thou wepſt thy ſelfe for company. Thy
owne example then warrants the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of my griefe; for when thou wert
living, the ſmall paine thou felt'ſt in
the ſleeping of thy foot was, and ought
to be more to mee, than the eternall
ſleepe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> could be to thee.
And as thy teares for him were tokens
of thy humane nature, not ſignes of
thy diffidence (in that thou knew'ſt
he would forthwith ariſe) ſo are mine
for thee, witneſſes of my wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
not of my diſtruſt, who am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of thy ſpeedy reſurrection. Nor
doe I onely grieve my owne griefe for
as for mans ſake, I rejoyce in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Grace, who delivers thee to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18366:144"/>
death, and in thy Charity
who doſt ſuffer it: So likewiſe
in mans behalfe I am griev'd
that he ſhould be the curſed
cauſe of thoſe thy extreme
torments: for as not to joy in
the benefits thy death hath
brought with it, would argue
his ingratitude, ſo not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole
for the tortures that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, would demonſtrate
his cruelty. And here I faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
promiſe thee, that both I,
while life, and thy Church,
while the world doth laſt,
ſhall yearely ſpend this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<note n="*" place="margin">S. <hi>Bernard</hi> cals this <hi>Hebdoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam poenoſam,</hi> the weeke of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and the high Dutch, <hi>Die Martyr Wock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> the Martyrs weeke.</note> time of thy Tragicall

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18366:144"/>
thy gratefull Spouſe to doe.</p>
            <p>Thus condoling, thus bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hers, and the generall loſſe,
ſhe attended his herſe to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
provided by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> where
never man was laid before; for it
was not fit that Incorruptibility
ſhould ſucceed corruption in the
ſame lodging. This fragrant
Flower was no ſooner ſet in the
ground, but ſhe ſent many a deare
drop after it to faſten it at the
root; for ſhe knew within three
dayes it ſhould ſpring up againe,
not to grow in the earth, but to be
tranſlated into Heaven, there for
ever to flouriſh, and perfume the
celeſtiall habitation. Nor were
her eyes, ſaith <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> cloſed
with his Monument, but watched
themſelves almoſt blinde with a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18366:145"/>
greedy expectation to ſee the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his body built up againe,
which three dayes ſince was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
After many a longing
looke ſhe eſpied the Tombe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and her onely joy to iſſue
forth, whom full well ſhe knew
by the countenance and figure of
his Humanity, but farre better by
the cleere proofes of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
for the Graves delivered up
their dead, many of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to their friends in the holy
City. Some, and thoſe of great
authority in the Church affirme,
that after his Reſurrection, ſhe of
all others ſaw him firſt, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Scripture ſeemeth to inferre
that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> firſt beheld
him, they thus expound it, That
the Evangeliſts would not make
his Mother the firſt witneſſe of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18366:145"/>
Reſurrection (though indeed ſhe
was) knowing that her teſtimony
by the Iewes would be more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
than that of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi>
I dare not poſitively conclude
any thing herein, but I may ſafely
maintaine that this her delight for
his Reſurrection, counterpois'd
her griefe conceived for his death.
In her was now made good that
of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>According to the
multitude of the griefes of my heart
thy Comforts have rejoyced my ſoule,</hi>
and that of her Sonne, <hi>Bleſſed are
they that mourne, for they ſhall bee
comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who makes queſtion but
that ſhe who with ſuch unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleaſure diſcover'd his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
faithfully, and cloſely wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on him, till his Aſcention?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18366:146"/>
She who was as inſeparable to
him as his ſhadow, without doubt,
was on the Mount<note n="*" place="margin">Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius contra haereſ. &amp; libel. Aetij.</note> 
               <hi>Olivet,</hi> with
other of the faithfull, when in the
ſight of them all he aſcended. She
heard, doubtleſſe, his laſt words,
received his laſt benediction, and
her ſight waited on him till the
clowds imbrac't him, which it in
vaine eſſay'd to penetrate. What
Soule not in ſelfe tranſported with
the view of a heavenly object, can
ſuppoſe, much leſſe expreſſe what
her contentment was when ſhe
ſaw her owne fleſh flye above the
reach of Envie, into the Armes of
Glory? When ſhe beheld this
high Prieſt, (his Sacrifice ended,
and God fully appeas'd) enter
Heaven there to ſit on the right
hand of his Father, and to be the
unceſſant and eternall Mediatour
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18366:146"/>
betwixt him and man? With ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
knees, erected hands, and
eyes, ſhe worſhips him aſcending,
and when her ſight failes, her ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
continues. Her zeale paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all the orbes betweene him,
and her with greater facility, and
ſubtility then the Lightning ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
through the Ayre. Great is
the vigour and force of the Spirit,
when all things elſe ſet apart it is
wholly intentive on the Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Creatour. When by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
it is ſeparated from the
body, it thinkes onely on him,
lives onely to him, and is (as it
were drown'd) in an inundation
of his love. When it hath extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
the ſcorching lawleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of the fleſh, and kindled the
holy ones of the Spirit; the body
rebels no longer, but becomes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18366:147"/>
obedient to it in all things. When
it hath once fixed its eyes on this
beloved object, it never removeth
them thence. When it is once il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
with the beames of the
holy Ghoſt, it is preſently turn'd
into all Eye, all Spirit, all Light,
no otherwiſe than thoſe things
the fire once layes hold on, are
turn'd into fire it ſelfe. Of thoſe
who live in Wedlocke, it is ſaid
that they are two in one fleſh; and
why may it not be ſaid of Chriſt
and the Soule wedded to him,
that they are two in one Spirit?
And if ever it might be reported
of any, ſurely of this Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
who (though ſhe was devided
from her Redeemer in Body) yet
in ſoule ſhe was united to him.
When her eyes were growne
dimme with her ſo long dwelling
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18366:147"/>
on that part of Heaven where they
left, and loſt him, ſhe caſt them
downe on the earth, the poverty
whereof ſhe commiſerated in that
it was deprived of this one Iewell,
in value above all it had left. And
now She returnes into the holy
City not diſconſolate, and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as other women are when
they loſe their onely childe; but
with a cheerfull look for her Sons
victory, who had triumphed not
onely over the Iew, but death and
hell it ſelfe. She made her will
lacky Gods, and though ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be diſſolved, and be with
Chriſt, yet ſince it was his beſt
pleaſure ſhe ſhould continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
here below, ſhe readily aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reſolving by her example on
earth, to furniſh heaven with
Saints. <hi>Dammianus</hi> ſayes, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18366:148"/>
after her Sonnes deceaſe, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ten daies in Prayer and
Faſting, expecting with a fervent
longing, the promiſed comming
of the Spirit. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that ſixe ſcore men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were aſſembled in one rome,
and joyned in hearty prayer, of
the which, <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of
IESUS was one. And as he
names her laſt, ſo her wonted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
perſwades me that ſhe had
the laſt, and<note n="*" place="margin">S. Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard. In ſerm. de verb. Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp. Signum magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> loweſt place, and
ſate beneath the other ſinfull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of inferiour quality, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of her humble Lord
now exalted. And it is more than
probable that ſhe was preſent with
the Apoſtles, when the Holy
Ghoſt came upon them, and that
ſhe there received the firſt fruits
of the Spirit. After which time
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18366:148"/>
we reade no more of her in holy
Writ. For where, and with
whom, how ſtrictly, and how pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſhe liv'd after the Aſcention
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Serm. 5. de Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſump. Virg.</note> till the houre of her
death, ſaith <hi>Idelphonius,</hi> is onely
knowne to God the ſearcher of
hearts, and to the Angels her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Viſiters. The reaſon which
many alledge why neither the
reſt of her life, nor death are pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the holy Evangeliſts is
this, that the Apoſtles were ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
about the converſion of the
Iewes and the Gentiles, &amp; enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Chriſtian Church, That
they had no time to ſet downe the
particular Acts of her life after her
Sonnes Aſcention, nor the ſeverall
Circumſtances of her death, as
where, when, and how ſhe dyed.
Some Authours peremptorily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18366:149"/>
maintaine (upon what ground I
know not) that ſhe liv'd to her ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventieth
yeare, and to her laſt
houre dwelt in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> neare to
her Sonnes Sepulchre.<note place="margin">Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. ſer. de dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Virg.</note> Others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no better warrant averre that
ſhe went with <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
continued with him at <hi>Epheſus</hi>
till her death, and urge the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who affirmes that
ſhe wrote to him in theſe words,
<hi>I will come with</hi> Iohn <hi>to ſee thee, and
thy friends, &amp;c.</hi> Concerning her
death, Some avouch that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and the moſt eminent of
the Primitive Church, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at it.<note place="margin">Serm, de dormit. Virg.</note> 
               <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith that
Chriſt was alſo there in perſon,
and that he thus ſpake to her: <hi>Come
my bleſſed Mother into the reſt I have
prepar'd for thee, and that ſhee thus
in way of anſwer prayed to him: Into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18366:149"/>
thy hands, O my Sonne, I commend
my Spirit: Receive that deare Soule
which thou haſt preſerved free from all
rebuke.</hi> As I will not juſtifie all
theſe their Aſſertions for true, ſo
on the other ſide I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them as erroneous, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to convince them of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
and for ought I know, they
may have paſs'd by unwritten
Tradition from man to man. I
will therefore affirmatively ſay
nothing but this, that moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
her death was welcome to
her, in that ſhe had ſo often both
meditated and practiſed it, having
many times by auſterity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
departed this life ere
ſhe left it. If that of <hi>Seneca</hi> be true,
that to dye well, is to dye willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then certainly ſhe dyed the
death of the Righteous. She was
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18366:150"/>
not ignorant that Death to the juſt
is no other than a delivery from
priſon, a laying downe of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the end of a Pilgrimage, the
unmanacling of the Soule, the
diſcharging of a due debt to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the returne into our true
Country, the dore that opens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a never fading life, the entrance
into the celeſtiall Kingdome, and
the Vſher that was to conduct her
to her bleſſed Saviour, with
whom ſhe had mentally conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ever ſince he left the earth:
Since which time there be who
avouch that ſhe never willingly
ſaw any man.</p>

The ſame modeſty I have
ſhew'd in treating of her death,<note place="margin">Her aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I
ſhall reſerve in diſcourſing of her
Aſſumption, which by many of
the Fathers, all of the Romiſh

is held for an undoubted
truth, though upon no ſounder
proofes than the former produce
concerning her departure hence.

ſecrets and myſteries,

(who hold that the

thinke the Aſſumption of

            <p>
               <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith, the

workes of the Deity are therefore
poſſible, becauſe omnipotent, and
that there are ſome things, which
though they are wholly omitted
in holy Scriptures, yet upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
reaſons they are believ'd, and
exemplifies his poſition in the
Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary.
Dammianus</hi> argues thus, That as
conceiving without ſinne, ſhee
brought forth her Sonne without
paine, a curſe laid on all other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
ſo might it well be that ſhe
who was without ſinne, might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
Death, the reward of it.

Nay, I have read a moderne Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
who thus elegantly deſcribes
the manner of it: <hi>When, ſaith hee,
the Soule of this Sweet one, reactuated
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18366:152"/>
her body, ſhe aroſe in Triumph from
her Sepulcher, and was aſſumed into
Heaven. In her paſſage thither, the
orbes bowed and bended themſelves
to make her a triumphant Arch
through which ſhee might paſſe in
greater ſtate. The Sunne with his
brighteſt beames imbrac't her, that
it might be ſaid,</hi> A woman was
cloath'd with the Sunne. <hi>The
Moone ſtooped to her, that it might be
divulg'd the Moone was under her
feet. The brighteſt of the Starres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwove
themſelves to make her a
radiant Crowne, &amp;c.</hi> But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
is no more theologicall,
than the conſent of the orbes is
Philoſophicall, and is no way
correſpondent to the dignity of
our Sacred ſubject, on whoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
entry into Heaven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beene a faithfull, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18366:153"/>
Attender, I will now returne
to vindicate her honour here on
Earth, and make an Apology to
Chriſtians (with ſhame and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
I ſpeake it) for Chriſts owne
Mother.</p>
            <p>It may pleaſe then the gentle
Reader to underſtand that two
queſtions ariſe amongſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Divines. The one whether
or no ſhe merited to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God; the other which way
ſhe could deſerve that greateſt of
Glories. For the firſt, they affirm
that never any Creature merited
ſo great a bleſſing as the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods owne Sonne. For he
ſent, ſay they, his Sonne into the
world, not urg'd thereto by our
merits, but out of his owne
meere Grace and Goodneſſe. It
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18366:153"/>
was a worke of his Charity, and
condeſcending, not of retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or obligation: and therefore
that he choſe not the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to be the Mother of Chriſt, as
ſhe was a Virgin, humble, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
adorn'd with Faith, Charity,
and other divine vertues, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God had decreed her to
beare his onely Sonne, therefore
his beſt pleaſure was, ſhe ſhould
be Miſtreſſe of perfections ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to ſo high a Calling. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, Becauſe God
hath predeſtinated us, therefore
he calles, juſtifies, and glorifies
us, and not becauſe we are juſt,
therefore he electeth us. Againe,
they argue thus, that all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
depend on Chriſt, and are
deriv'd from him, and therefore
ſhe was without all deſert before
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18366:154"/>
her Sonne had imparted it to her.
That this was well knowne to her,
is manifeſtly proved by her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Hymne, in which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
all good to proceed
from him, and therefore to him
aſcribeth all honour and glory.
Others her Champions, who cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
fight, not onely for her
heavenly, but earthly triumph,
confeſſe that ſhe was not prefer'd
to that ſupreme dignity by deſert,
but by Congruity, as they call it:
that is, not that ſhe was abſolutely
worthy of ſo great a grace, but
that ſince God had fixed a decree
to ſend his dearely beloved Sonne
amongſt us, ſhe of all others was
the fitteſt to conceive and beare
him. But here againe they differ
about the way, in that ſo many
waies they hold her capable of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18366:154"/>
this ineſtimable Diadem. Some
give the preheminency to her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
and ſay, the love of that
drew the Sonne out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of his Father, into her hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
wombe; and therefore the
Text ſaies not, that a faithfull, an
obedient, or an humble ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but a Virgin. Others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
this ſupreme favour to her
Faith, by which (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
all the miraculous
workes of the old Teſtament have
beene begunne and perfected:
Wherefore her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
ſaid to her, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, becauſe
thou haſt beleeved.</hi> Some aſcribe
this infinite honour done her, to
her Humility, to which all other
vertues flow, no otherwiſe than
the waters naturally runne to the
loweſt places. This caus'd her to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18366:155"/>
ſay in her gratefull Hymne, <hi>Thou
haſt regarded the lowlineſſe of thy
Hand-maid.</hi> Others impute the
conferring of this greateſt bleſſing
on her, to her obedience, in that
ſhe committed all to the will of
the higheſt, with this proteſtation,
<hi>Behold the Hand-maid of the Lord,
be it to mee according to thy Word.</hi>
Others give her Charity the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hand, which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies,
gives life and ſpirit to all
other vertues, they being without
it no other than dead Images.
Laſtly, ſome there are who will
not award the Crowne to this or
that peculiar vertue reſiding in
her, but to the united Harmony
of them altogether; for they ſay,
it is not this ſtring, or that, makes
the Muſicke, but the accord, and
conſent of all. For my owne
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18366:155"/>
part, (Divinity not being the
ſpheare wherein my ſtudies
move) a modeſt inquiſition will
better become me, than a bold
and peremptory Concluſion in
any point of Controverſie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I moſt humbly ſubmit this,
and all things elſe divine, by me
handled, to the Cenſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> whoſe not Connivence
alone, but approbation I know I
ſhall have in boldly affirming that
ſhe was a tranſcendent Creature,
not to be ranked in reſpect of
her worth, with any of her
ſexe, but to have a place aſſign'd
her apart, and above them all;
being not to be conſidered as a
meere woman, but as a Type, or
an Idaea of an Accompliſht pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
They who uphold the latter
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18366:156"/>
of the aforeſaid opinions, erre
not ſo much in my judgement,
in the adoring extreame, as ſome
too ſevere maintainers of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
doe in the neglecting. They
are ſo farre from praiſing her
themſelves, that they moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprive her of the praiſe given
her by others. The Puritans in
generall, but eſpecially the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>non-Conformiſts</hi> of this Land,
are thoſe I meane, who as in their
Courſe oratory they called
Queene ELIZABETH, <hi>Queene
Beſſe,</hi> So they give this Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
no higher a ſtile, than of
<note n="*" place="margin">J have both heard theſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent ſpeeches, and read them cenſurd in a Manuſcript of a moſt learned Doctour of the Engliſh Church. And this is very credible to al ſuch as heare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe their illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sermons, full of invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the antient Saints, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with predications of their owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Brethren.</note> 
               <hi>Mal, Gods Maide.</hi> They reject
all Teſtimonies of her worth, as
<hi>Haile</hi> Mary <hi>full of Grace, The Lord

               <hi>All generations ſhall call mee

abhorre to heare her call'd

God-bearing,</hi> few of
them being ſo learned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in their owne Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to know that they
who ſo ſtile her, thinke
not that the God-head
proceeds from her, but
that ſhe brought forth
Chriſt, in whom was the
union of both Natures,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18366:157"/>
and therefore they being inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſhe muſt by ſtrong conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
be deliver'd of both God
and Man. And why are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
from giving her theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Epithites? Becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
they challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but a leſſer of Piety than did
their Anceſtors. By diſclaiming
words, and phraſes familiar to
Antiquity, and by inventing new
leſſe reverent, and ſignificant;
they give all men to underſtand
that they had rather be reputed
good Grammarians, than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and had rather give names
to the Church, than accept them
from her, and cheriſh prophane
Novelties, rather than allow of
Reverent Antiquities. They wreſt
many places of Scripture to prove
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18366:157"/>
that Chriſt himſelfe ſlighted and
rebuked her, which depravations
of theirs (were my Readers
Turkes) I would draw into the
Light and lay their deformity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to all; but it is needleſſe (I
truſt) to informe a Chriſtian, that
he who hath ſaid, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thy Mother,</hi> would ſurely
never breake his owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and by ſlighting
his Mother, trench upon a ſinne
of all others moſt deteſtable in
his ſight, Ingratitude. Of one
thing I will aſſure them, till they
are good <hi>Marians,</hi> they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be good <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> while
they derogate from the dignity
of the <hi>Mother,</hi> they cannot true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour the <hi>Sonne.</hi> They are
I confeſſe, much more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to her, than the Iewes, but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18366:158"/>
by farre more detracting from
her than the Turkes, which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
of mine is ſtrengthened
with evident proofes both out of
the Iewiſh <hi>Thalmud,</hi> and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
<hi>Alchoran.</hi> The Iewes call
her <hi>Thlua,</hi> as much as to ſay,
Butchereſſe, or the wife of a
Butcher, and <hi>Sono,</hi> a publike
ſinner, and <hi>Thmea,</hi> one polluted
with all manner of uncleane and
filthy luſt. And all of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are enjoyned in ſolemne
Prayer made in their Sinagogues
thrice every day to curſe Chriſt,
his Mother, and all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sect, as is to be found at large
in the third Booke of the Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,
wholly compos'd of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fables, groſſe Errors, and
horrid Blaſphemies. True it is
That the Turkiſh Alchoran now
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18366:158"/>
acknowledgeth Chriſt to be God,
and now againe denies him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him in at the fore-dore, and
ſhutting him out at the backe,
yet doe they hold him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of Prophets next their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
But his Mother they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
above all women that ever
breathed this Ayre. Let us heare
this Oracle ſpeake, in all things
elſe falſe, but in this moſt true.
Theſe enſuing are the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
words of the Alchoran. <hi>O</hi>
Mary, <hi>excellent above all men and
women, who perſevereſt in the ſtudy
of God onely.</hi> And in another place,
<hi>O</hi> Mary, <hi>God hath choſen thee, and
purified thee, hee hath elected thee to
make thee famous above the women
of all Ages:</hi> and againe, Mary <hi>by
behaving her ſelfe wiſely, is guilty
neither of Malice, nor any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18366:159"/>
which cauſed us to breath our
ſoule into her.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>that Many
men have beene perfect, but no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was ever found perfect, but</hi>
Mary <hi>the Mother of Ieſus.</hi> But
though truth is to be imbrac't
where ever we finde it, yet it will
appeare more gracefull in the
mouthes of Chriſtians, whoſe
moſt learned, moſt eloquent, and
moſt judicious Doctour, we will
produce,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin lib. de nat. &amp; grat. cap. 36.</note> giving this Teſtimony
of this our deareſt Lady. <hi>Except
(ſaith he) the holy Virgin</hi> Mary,
<hi>(whom for the honour I owe my Lord
and Maſter, I will not name when
ſinne is my ſubject) whom to have
had grace infus'd into her, wholly to
ſubdue ſinne, wee know by this, that
ſhee was thought worthy to conceive
and bring forth him, who aſſuredly
was without ſinne: This Virgin, I
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18366:159"/>
ſay, excepted, if we could Recall, and
Aſſemble together all the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and ſhould aske them, if they
were without ſinne, they would una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
thus anſwere: If we ſhould
ſay we have no ſinne, we deceive our
ſelves, and there is no truth in us.</hi>
But becauſe the Fathers are no
way ſuſpected of neglect towards
her, we will ſpare their verdicts,
and chiefly inſert their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of her, who were the firſt
Reformers of our Church. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
ſhall be their Leader, who
ſaith, <hi>That none but the Virgin</hi>
Mary <hi>either was, or ever ſhall be ſo
holy: That the fruit of her wombe
ſhall be bleſſed, ſince no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
without pleaſure and ſinne:</hi>
and againe, <hi>In this is</hi> Mary <hi>bleſſed,
That ſo great gifts are given to her,
as ſurpaſſe humane underſtanding.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18366:160"/>
For hence all honour and beatitude
proceeds, that in the Vniverſall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
race one perſon ſhould be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the reſt to whom none ſhould
be equall, becauſe one and the ſame
Sonne is common to her with the
heavenly Father.</hi> This he applyes
to that ſaying of <hi>Mary. Hee that is
mighty hath magnified mee, &amp;c.</hi>
The ſame Author in another place
ſayes, <hi>Mary is our Mother, Chriſt
our Brother, and God our Father, and
that all this is true, the Faithfull by
effect doe finde. Calvin</hi> cals her
his <hi>Miſtreſſe. Wee willingly, ſaith
he, take</hi> Mary <hi>for our Miſtreſſe, to
whoſe doctrine and precepts we are
obedient.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Thogh <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was not a Reformer of our Church, yet he is much ſuſpected by the Romiſh Church, and moſt ſerviceable to the Proteſtant in the ſetting out of the Fathers.</note> 
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſtiles her his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18366:160"/>
Savioreſſe. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
his approbation of her.
<hi>I truſt in God it ſhall never be ſaid
of me, that I did oppoſe the dignity of</hi>
Mary, <hi>towards whom to be never ſo
little ill affected, I hold to be a moſt
certaine ſigne of a Reprobate minde.
She who is above all, Queene of all,
whom God above all hath honoured,
ſhould not ſhe be eſteemed amongſt
all the moſt eminent? Bucerus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth,
<hi>That a godly minde will not
judge but charitably and piouſly of
her, who brought forth Chriſt our
Lord: Bullingerus</hi> concludes; <hi>If</hi>
Mary <hi>be bleſſed amongſt all women,
and to bee pronounced bleſſed by all
Nations, moſt curſed are the Iewes,
who never ceaſe to revile and ſlander
her; and moſt unhappy are thoſe
Counterfeit Chriſtians, who (being
little better than Iewes) robbe her of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18366:161"/>
the praiſe due to her. Needs muſt ſhee
be indued with a ſingular moſt ſelect,
and perpetuall Virginity and purity,
who is eſpecially choſen by God to be
the Temple of his Sonne, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the moſt holy.</hi> Now if any of
theſe contradict themſelves by
pulling downe in other places
thoſe Trophies of her praiſe
which here they haue erected,
they are to be anſwered as the
Satyre did the Man with whom
he ſaid he would no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
becauſe he ſaw hot and cold
breath to iſſue from the ſame
Mouth. But to leave them; All
parts of the world have produced
Admirers of her worth.</p>

All which are Canonized for

Temples to her Memory.
Neither have the Princes of this
our Ile beene defective in doing
her all poſſible honour, and in
Conſecrating Chappels and
Temples to her Memory. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke</hi>

and Common-wealths
have enrolled themſelves. My
Arithmeticke will not ſerve mee
to number all thoſe who have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
their names in the Soda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Roſary of this our
bleſſed Lady, the originall of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18366:164"/>
which is derived from the battaile
of <hi>Naupactun,</hi> gain'd by <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Chriſtians, which
victory was attributed to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
with her Sonne. The
Colonian Sodallity firſt inſtituted,
had out of <hi>Lovaine,</hi> 4000. out of

4000.</hi> out of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,

are of this Sodality, as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines,
the Ciſtertians, the
Franciſcans, the Carthuſians, and
many others. If all theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Examples of great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and pious people will not
move us to honour her, we ſhall
be judg'd both unworthy of this
life, and ignorant of that better to
come. For ſhame let not us alone
deny her that honour and praiſe
which all the world allowes her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:18366:164"/>
After theſe impartiall witneſſes
of her worth, we will place thoſe
divine priviledges imparted to her
by the Almighty, for which we
have (if that alone were ſufficient)
the Authority of many pious,
learned men.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</note> they affirme, That her
Chaſte eyes ſent forth ſuch divine
beames that (though her Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
moved not onely all mindes
to honour her, and all Eyes to gaze
on hers) yet they never kindled an
unholy fire in the moſt Adulterate
boſome. A ſacred priviledge pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to this Saint alone; for it
was the will of her omnipotent
Sonne, that neither Sathan nor his
Miniſters ſhould conſpire the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of that chiefe Temple
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18366:165"/>
of his Spirit, which his fleſh had
inhabited ſo long, nor any impure
thought ayme at the mudding of
this pureſt Fountaine. Whether
her prophetick Soule foreſaw the
ſnares of the ungodly, and ſo
ſhun'd them, they ſay not, once
for certaine they averre, that
Temptations aym'd at her, broke
like Haile againſt a Rocke, nor
could all the Engines of the
world, the fleſh, and the Divell
hurt her more, then can the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
ariſing from the earth, reach
the holy inhabitants of Heaven.
And this opinion (for ought I
know, I ſubmit it to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
may without, or profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or blaſphemy, be admitted
into all honeſt boſomes: for if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of nature he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Ionas</hi> entire in the Whales
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18366:165"/>
Belly, if he protected <hi>Daniel</hi> from
the ravenous Lyons, ſhould not
he ſecure her from Corruption
whom he had adorn'd with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vertues and dignities?</p>
            <p>Next,<note place="margin">2 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</note> they hold that ſhe was
not onely without blemiſh, but
her very lookes ſent forth ſuch
heavenly rayes, that whoſoever
beheld them, drew thence a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
fire that never went out, and
vowed an everlaſting Virginity.
If this be a truth, it is a curious
one, and it is not materiall at all
whether or no it be beleeved, or
rejected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</note> that ſhe conceiv'd and
bore her Sonne, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paine (the common Curſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to Childe-bearing) but
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18366:166"/>
with infinite delight. This alſo is
a Curioſity, and of no importance
whether it be ſwallowed or no.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, that ſhe had
a Frigidity of Soule, which
quencht in her all heat of carnall
concupiſcence. This laſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is implyed in the firſt, and
may perchance ſafely be received.
The truth is, we may ſecurely give
her all humane attributes (not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
on the divine) for ſhe
was in dignity above all, but God
himſelfe. Faith and Charity, the
fulneſſe of the Law were in her at
full. She was in an active and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
life, admirable. The
Tongue eſteemed the worſt part
in a woman, was in her the beſt,
which well might charme Eares,
offend them it could not. Her
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18366:166"/>
Soule weigh'd her Conceptions,
and gave them a rayment of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
owne hiew; for certainly ſo
cleere thoughts were apparell'd
in as faire words. She who both
after her conception, and at other
times is commended to us by the
ſacred Scriptures, for laying up all
holy Sayings in her heart, can we
imagine that ſhe could ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe?
Neither could ſhe commit
any undecent Act, who liv'd in a
Light to others inacceſſible. They
who maintaine that for a time the
whole Militant Church was in her
alone, have probability to backe
them; for I know not in whom
elſe it could remaine, when his
Apoſtles, Diſciples, Friends, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and all others forſooke
Chriſt, ſhe onely excepted, who
would not leave him, who from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18366:167"/>
before his birth, had ſtucke to her.
I will conclude with this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That if ever the Soule of any
mortall enjoyed here on earth the
embraces of her heavenly Spouſe,
and tooke from him a kiſſe ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all the Eaſterne Odours,
this was ſhe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:18366:167"/>
And here, O bleſſed Virgin!
J leave to diſcourſe further of
thee,<note place="margin">Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> and direct my ſpeech to
thee. O thou eternall glory of
thy ſexe! had the Queene of
<hi>Sheba</hi> ſeene thee, as ſhe did <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
ſhee had not ſo ſoone
beene delivered out of the
Trance into which her Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
caſt her. In thee ſhee might
have diſcovered all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of which woman kinde is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
who wer't indeed vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thy ſexe. In thee <hi>Aſpatia</hi>
might have found her Modeſty,
<hi>Livia</hi> her Prudency, <hi>Sulpitia</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:18366:168"/>
her Majeſtie and Gravity,
<hi>Cornelia</hi> her Patience, <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
her Chaſtity, <hi>Porcia</hi> her
Fortitude, <hi>Tanaquill</hi> her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<hi>Plautina</hi> her frugality,
and all theſe in eminency. But
why talke I of the Heathen to
thee, who didſt not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip
in manifold vertues all the
Femall, but the Maſculine Saints
themſelves? Thou didſt excell
<hi>Abel</hi> in Innocency, <hi>Abraham</hi>
in Faith, <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Obedience,
<hi>David</hi> in Gentleneſſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles in Piety, and
the Martyrs in Patience. O thou
whom Heaven would have of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18366:168"/>
the ſame conſtancy, purity, and
ſublimity with it ſelfe, thou art
ſo farre from having an equall,
that all thy ſexe cannot afford a
worthy witneſſe of thy Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies!
O thou Mother of the true
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who never put on the
yoke of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but ſtood free
in the middeſt of <hi>Egypt!</hi> Thou
rodde of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> alwaies ſtraight,
who broughtſt forth the fruit of
life! thou wert here a terreſtriall
Paradice, whereinto Serpent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entred, on which Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction
was never impos'd, and
haſt no doubt, now in the coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
Paradice a conſpicuous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18366:169"/>
ſeate above all the Angelicall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and next thy glorifi'd Sonne
himſelfe. For if Chriſts promiſe
to all his fellow feeling members,
that if they ſuffer with him, they
ſhall raigne with him, if they dye
with him, they ſhall live with
him; what eminent place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhalt thou have aſsigned
thee, who in ſoule didſt ſuffer for
him more, than all his Martyrs?
O thou baſhfull Morne that didſt
pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cede and produce our Sunne!
Thou Circumſcription (if J may
ſo ſay) of the uncircumſcribed!
Thou roote to this Herbe of
Grace! Thou Mother of our
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18366:169"/>
Creatour! Thou Nurſe to him by
whom all things are fed! Thou
Comprehender of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible!
Thou bearer of him
whoſe word ſuſtaines the Globes!
Thou who didſt impart fleſh to
him, who wanted nothing elſe!
Thou <hi>Sarah,</hi> thou Mother of
many Nations, who brought
forth our <hi>Iſaac,</hi> our Laughter,
when a juſt ſorrow conceiv'd for
a loſſe eſteem'd irreparable had
clouded this inferiour world! O
pardon, gratious Princeſſe, my
weake endeavours to ſumme up
thy value, which come as ſhort
of thee, as my head does of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18366:170"/>
Nothing that is not it ſelfe
glorified, can expreſſe thy glory
to the height. Thou deſerv'ſt a
Quire of Queenes here, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of Angels in Heaven to
ſing thy praiſes. Were all the
Earths brood, the droppes, the
ſands of the ſea, and the ſtarres
of heaven tongued, they could
not all expreſſe thee ſo well, as
ſilent extaſie. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe, O my
ſweeteſt Lady! that now I have
ſaid all I can of thee, I have but
but done like <hi>Timanthes,</hi> a
great Maſter of his Art, who
being to expreſſe the vaſtneſſe of
a Cyclops in a ſmall table, drew
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18366:170"/>
onely his Thumbe, by which the
ſpectators might judge of his
large proportion. To give thee
an eſtimation anſwerable to thy
merit, is a thing impoſsible: J
muſt therefore be content to doe
by thee, as the antient Heathen
did by the Images of their Gods,
on whoſe heads, when by reaſon
of their height, they could not
place the Crownes, offer'd to their
Deities, they humbly layd them at
their feet.</p>
