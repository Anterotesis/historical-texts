            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the ruines of that famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Honour,</hi> into which the entrance
was only through the Door of <hi>Deſert,</hi> are
now-a-dayes ſo demoliſhed, and interr'd
in rubbiſh, that there doth not remain to
memory ſo much as the place where it
ſtood; nor the hope of raiſing it from the
contempt of its preſent ruins, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of its paſſed grandure. Therefore
though now Vertue ſtriveth to aſcend, it
doth not increaſe at all: like certain ſtars
neer the Antarctick Pole, which having
had ſixty ages of continual revolution,
yet have reaped ſo little profit from their
tedious travaile, as that they have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
to ſo much as a viſible Aſcenſion
above our Horizon. The Mountains which
are gravid with Golden Ore, uſe not to
afford either Groves for delight, or
herbs for food: Naught appears upon
them but barren cinders, and ſterile
ſands; through which as bones, they
diſcover huge ſtones, poſſeſſing a certain
ſhameful nudity, ſo that it would reflect
as a diſgrace upon other Hills embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with herbs, and beautified with trees,
to be put in competition with them. This
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51927:13"/>
is the miſerable lot of Vertue in the
World. By its Golden veins incloſed in
its bowels, it is rendred as poor without,
as it is rich within. And yet ſhe proveth
this verity, that Vertue and Nakedneſſe
are Twins, born together at one birth, in
the Terreſtial Paradiſe, and were never
ſince ſeparated and divided from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Garments of the body are more
honoured than the vertuous habits of the
minde; it pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Goodneſſe in the breſt as orient
pearls, for if your poor clothes make
you ſeem a contemptible ſhell of Mother

fewer eſteem you.</p>
            <p>All this holdeth true aſwell in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as in Vertue; for it alſo, as born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame Aſcendant, hath it for its

full of diſreſpect; and the courſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

            <p>That men of great learning are not
born, but only as the Phoenix, one in five
hundred years: that there are not ſome
who inrich the World with new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the Ages are grown barren, or the places
unfruitful in Wits: The fault lyeth in
great part upon them who open not the
Port to them that would launch out, nor
ſhew the lure to him that flyeth; for there
wants not ſome Minds with great Wings,
and Wits with large Sails. He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            <p>That there are not ſome with the

gave, where he counſelleth that
above all things, they have regard to the
building of the Theater, where Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are acted, and Muſick recited ſo,
that it be not deaf, and by that means the
Muſicians and Comedians unprofitably
ſpend their voice and pains. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>To paſſe the terms of ordinary in any

is a task hard enough to require,
and long enough to take up our whole

            <p>Finally, for Students to be forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
every day with poverty, to contraſt
every hour with her miſeries, to divide
their thoughts into a thouſand ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whither their neceſſities call them;
theſe are thorns, in which Learning
makes not her neſt. He that will have his
bees gather honey, muſt not expoſe them
to the violence of the winds: for where
theſe have too much power, thoſe have
none at all. In their flight from their hive
to the flowers, and from one flower to an
other, in their return with the prey the
winds if impetuous, drive them out of
their way, and tranſport them elſwhere.
Such are the thoughts of Scholars, for
where other cares diſtract them, they can
perfect no excellent work they undertake.</p>
            <p>And to ſay the truth, how can theſe

            <p>But having deſigned to begin this
Tractate from the peculiar felicity of a
Scholar, ſhewing that even then when
he wants all things, he is ſatisfied and
happy only in himſelf, and (as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls

hitherto exaggerating in the parſimonious

reſpect him, the need he ſtands in of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

more diſcovered the crime of ſuch
who regard him not, then any miſery
in him through his being diſregarded.
For (to conclude) Gold, although digged
from the dirt and ſtones, amongſt which
it lies buried in the mines, would appear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51927:19"/>
more ſplendid; yet he is infinitely more
the loſer, who doth not dig and make
it his own, then it by being undiſcovered
and un-appropriated. And again, in the
crime of them that eſteem not the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
their merit is proved, ſince their
advancement is demerited, and the not
honouring them is a crime.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how a learned man may

that happy temper of the Golden Age,
when free from all fear of loſſe, every one
lived pleaſed with that which was his;
namely, content with himſelf, and ſo far
rich as he needed nothing; namely, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not riches. Thus <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Crates,</hi>
two friends, two Phyloſophers, two beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
were by <hi>Archeſilaus</hi> for their honour
called <hi>Reliques of the Golden Age.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               </p>
               <p>The rich are not ſo blinded with the
ſplendor of their gold, that they ſee not at
leaſt in part the worth of theſe goods. A
poor learned man appeareth among rich
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51927:31"/>
ideots, as rags among ſilks, frieze amongſt
purple, the meagerneſſe of a face conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by ſtudy, and made pale with looks,
amongſt plump and ruddy faces; Thoſe
look on themſelves as ſheep covered with
golden wooll, and the other as a great god
among the ancients, graven in a homely
ſtone, or imprinted in clay; but therefore
no leſſe honourable, than if they were caſt
in gold, and in-laid with pearl.</p>
               <p>That adventurous Ship, which firſt of
all paſt the large Straights of <hi>Megallanes,</hi>
which ſteered it, environed all the earth,
whence it was called Victory: returning
into <hi>Europe,</hi> and drawn into the Port, was
beheld by all as the ſecond <hi>Argo</hi> of the
World. Thoſe ribs which had been of
proof againſt the batteries of ſtorms, of
till-then-unſeen Oceans, thoſe faithful
ſails at the encounter of ſtrange winds,
that rudder, that maſt, thoſe ſail-yards, in
fine, all its parts were judged worthy of
the nobleſt ſtars in heaven: ſince ſhe had
overcome the elements, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
not of a fleece, but world of gold.
Nor did her being in part defaced with
weakned maſt, diſlocated yards, diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſides, tattered ſails, faln poup, render
her leſſe valuable and beautiful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51927:32"/>
The other ſhips well rigg'd, beheld her
with a certain envy, and thoſe impreſſions
which the tempeſts and the long voyage
had made in her, as ſcars in a Martial
Captain, they eſteemed more honourable,
then that beauty with which they were
adorned. To her they ſtruck ſail, vailed
yards, bowed Ancients, they full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,
and rich with gold, the Victory
empty, ſhattered, disfigured, they adored
as their Miſtreſſe. Behold, the condition

the end the mind learn to Phyloſophate,
and not erre; it's needful, the feet go

attein to the riches of <hi>Sapience,</hi> but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way but by going to the Sages, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, and begging it. Truth (ſaid
they) a Native of Heaven, is a Pilgrim on
Earth, and is found no way but by Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination:
He that ſeeks it, doth as the
rivers, which encreaſe the more, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they go; ſo that they which at their
fountains were ſcarce little brooks, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating

Seas. The vapours of the earth, would
they ever aſſume the form of ſtarres, if
leaving the country where they were all
dirt, they ſhould not run after the Sun,
and make themſelves much more happy
in being Pilgrims in heaven, than if they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51927:33"/>
were Citizens on earth? Men are not as
Planets, which have the greateſt virtue
then, when they are in their own houſes;
yea, it happens many times, that ones
own country proveth a ſtep-mother, and
a forraign land the mother, in faſhion of
certain plants, which from their Native
Soil, where they were nouriſhed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
humours, tranſported to a ſtrange
climate, in the remove they loſe their
power of hurting, and find together with
a harmleſſe reliſh, the virtue of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
aliment. A mans own country
ought to be to a wiſe man, as the Horizon
to the ſtars, for birth, not for Sepulchre;
to take thence the firſt light, and as the
<hi>Aurora</hi> of <hi>Sapience,</hi> after to climb to other
places, even to find the moſt high and
ſplendid noon-tide which it makes on
earth.</p>
               <p>Thus thoſe Sages underſtood it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their knowledge practiſing,
ſeemed juſt of the nature of the Heavens,
which have reſt in motion: whence with
tedious voyages, they ran where in ſome
new Academy of the learned they might

was, as <hi>Sineſius</hi> ſpeaks, a perpetual going

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51927:34"/>
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſometimes

and a hundred others came through

one of the Worlds Sages. Juſt like the Sun,

vein of ſtone into thoſe men that were his
Scholars, and made them become obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and inſenſible, by extirpating all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
out of their hearts. So that his
ſchool was rather an Ingravers ſhop where
he wrought Statues than an Academy
of Philoſophy, where he moulded Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
His firſt and laſt leſſon was to
learn to get the mind to the pitch of Royal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51927:44"/>
fortitude; ſo that neither the ſurprizals
of Love, nor the aſſaults of Malice, nor the
ſeiges of Hope, nor the batteries of Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
nor the ſcalado's Audacity: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
that neither the arms nor arts of any
Affection ſhould be able to force the heart
to ſurrender it ſelf, or yeild either at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
or upon articles. In the tempeſt
of bodily inſirmity, of diſturbed humours,
of ſickly conſtitutions, he would have the
heart ſtand <hi>Velut pelagi rupes immota,</hi> which
aſſaulted but not moved by the waves,
breaks them at his feet, and makes them
recoile in a foam. All the tortures of the
World, though with a painful wracke our
members ſhould be torn off, one by one,
have not in them any thing worthy to
cauſe a fainting of paleneſs in our faces, or
feebleneſs of courage in our breſts: have
not power to extort one interjection from
our mouthes, nor one bare tear from our
eyes. Yea, rather the more torments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
the more of cheerfulneſs ſhould
appear in the fore-head; like the Heavens
which are then fulleſt of ſerenity when
<hi>Boreas</hi> blows with greateſt frigidity &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity.
But what talke I of <hi>Zeno</hi> and the
Stoicks? <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, that animal,
whoſe ſoul only ſerved him for ſalt, to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51927:45"/>
end he might not ſtink alive in pleaſures;
taught, not how to turn thorns into flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to extract hony out of gall, to change
his miſeries into Jubilees, and to convert
misfortunes into felicities. Delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being the fountain of beatitude (ſaith
he) and that man not being able to call
himſelf bleſſed, who is not alwayes ſo, it is
neceſſary that he knew as well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in torments as in contents. <hi>Quare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens</hi>

               <p>But they deſire too much, who will not
infuſe Wiſdom into men, without depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of humanity. Other Schools
more prudently taught, that the affections
ſhould not be pull'd up by the roots as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
plants, but as wild and un-culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
trees they ſhould better themſelves
by tranſplanting and grafting. Many
ſound, witout a skilful Artiſt to accord
them, make a diſpleaſing diſcord; but if
from Proportion they receive Time and
Meaſure, they compoſe the melody of a
perfect Harmony. But thoſe rigid Schools
by the impoſition of ſo ſtrict an injunction,
of extirpating the paſſions from the heart,
have taught us thus much; that right
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51927:45"/>
Philoſophy can give us ſuch an empire
over our affections, that if it inchant not
the ſenſes at the undergoing of affliction,
nor yet render us ſo ſtupid as to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of them; yet it permits us not to be
tranſported with deſperation, not provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with impatience; nor in the many
tempeſts ariſing from the miſeries of the
body, to loſe the tranquility of the
mind.</p>
               <p>Now therefore behold a <hi>Wiſe Sick man:</hi>
Behold him I ſay, not extended on a bed,
but imbarqued in a ſhip; not among the
feavers and anguiſhes of a violent infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but amidſt the waves and billows of
a long and tedious tempeſt. See how he
lower ſail, how the planks flye aſunder,
how the maſt trembles, how each part
from poop to prow ſhivers, and the ſhip
reſents all this, as no peril of wrack, but
as the nature of the tide. The judgment of
the Pilot, and dexterity of the Marmers,
ſteere it, I will not ſay quietly through ſo
many tumults, but ſecurely through ſo
many dangers. Sapience ſits at the ſtern,
to manage the mind, and govern the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that in one, (though it may be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent)
tempeſt, wherein another would have
ſunk, a Wiſe ſick man will ſail, if not with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51927:46"/>
the ſerenity of a calm, yet with the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Port.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſhall ſee in a body tottering, a mind
ſo firm, in a body diſordered a mind ſo
compoſed, that you would think you ſaw
two perſons in one man, one of a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
another of an Infirm. This like the
ſides of <hi>Olympus</hi> obnubulated with clouds,
bathed with myſts, and transfixed with
thunder; that, like its lofty top, alwayes
enjoyes the Heavens ſerene, alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
either the Sun or the Stars; That like
a cloud which is melted and diſſolved into
rain; this like a Rain-bow, merry in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and laughing in the midſt of
tears.</p>
               <p>Now if you would know how this comes
to paſſe: tell me: Tranquility of mind,
doth it avail to the ſanity of body? They are
ſo united together, that the one ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
with the other, and (as it happens in
the chords ſet to uniſon) that the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtruck the other moves. The affections
of the mind are the winds, the humours of
the body the ſea; whilſt the winds rore,
the Sea grows rough and tempeſtuous.

dead before he was aware of his dying,
and was more aggrieved that he could not

over-hearing ſome Phyloſophers, which

his fugitive ſoul to his head, as if he

to the fortitude of his mind which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

That grand proof of <hi>Roman</hi> valour which
<hi>Mutius Scevola</hi> gave to King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> when
more reſenting the errour he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
than the burning of his hand, beheld
it un-dauntedly to burn in the fire, when as
he could not endure without impatience
to erre in his body, to the ſo great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the king his enemy, that he was
conſtrained not only to commend his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
in the middeſt of his repentance for
not having ſlain him; but to be alſo his
champion againſt himſelf, taking the
fire from under that hand which merited
light, and was more worthy of a palm for
his error than he would have been for his
blow; This I ſay, was one, only act, upon
one only hand, for a ſhort time, in a man
worthy of death, in a man bitterly offended
with himſelf. <hi>Poſidonius</hi> ſo many years in
his bed, as <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> in a morter, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one part after another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed

death, which he endured only to be
the longer dying, and beheld himſelf and
his miſeries, with not only dry, but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eyes; and took thoſe very pains as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to Phyloſophate upon, methamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing
his Chamber into a Schoole, and
his Bed into a Chair. In a word, he did as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51927:49"/>

loſe his light, yet it loſeth not the courſe
of its revolution, but proſecuteth its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although ſhee be not ſo full of light
as before.</p>
               <p>Men flockt from all parts about <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
to hear and ſee a man, which from his
own wounds took Balſome for others; and
more admirers had he lying upon a bed,
than that famous <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of braſs, erected
upon the entrance of the Port, for the glory
of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and miracle of the World. <hi>Pompey</hi>
the Great paſſed into <hi>Greece,</hi> and drawn
by the Fame of <hi>Poſidonius,</hi> deſired to ſee
him; and he came juſt at the inſtant,
when he was more than ever, under the
anxions pangs of his dolours. He came,
he ſaw, and he was overcome. <hi>Pompey</hi>
ſeemed the patient, compaſſionating the
torments of <hi>Poſidonius; Poſidonius</hi> ſeemed the
healthful man, diſcourſing amply with
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and proving the verity of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Nihil bonum eſt, niſi quod honeſtum ſit;</hi>
and with ſuch cheerfulneſs of face, and
conſtancy of mind did he doe it, that lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with torments, inſtead of groning,
he ſmiled, and when others would have
plaid the beaſt, he ſaid. <hi>Nihil agis dolor,

Thus Sapience which is the quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
of the nobleſt learning, can better
than the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake did <hi>Achilles,</hi> render

               <p>As (again) to the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to
ſee how little he favoured the ignorant
Saint in compariſon of the Wiſe; it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
to remember, that where he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the liſt of our miſeries, ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
extends his armes, he only debarres
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51927:55"/>
ignorance, nor would he ſuffer her dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have any place in the Light of the
World. In poverty neceſſitous, in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
drooping, in ſollitude abandoned, in
contempts neglected, in nakedneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed,
in pains tormented, on the croſs
murthered: ſatiated with opprobries,
and from the crown of the head to the
ſoal of the foot abounding with dolours:
amongſt ſuch a multitude of maladies,
he would not admit of Ignorance. Under
the hairy skin of the ſalvage <hi>Eſau</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo that as being
the Wiſedome of the Father he was not,
and Maſter of the World, he would not be
Ignorant. For if that he ſpake not more
highly of what he did, it was becauſe he
would not be a Sun to the eyes of Batts;
condeſcending too much in being a Lamp.
But if he then was ſilent, he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ever ſince for theſe ſixteen Golden
Ages, which the Church hath hitherto
ſeen; he had ſpoke I ſay with tongues

Prudence; for that the laws and edicts of

Therefore in my judgment, the moſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrious

not aſſign the Heavens an Intelligible

Battails, have their eye only upon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

ten Darts, never touch him with any of

This man is expert above you all. For to

but an <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> a Judg that could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the language of the dead when they

you ſhould ſee how true it is that <hi>Mercury</hi>

               <p>But in my judgment, the whole crew of
ſuch, who in their Books under their own
names publiſh the labours of others, may
be diſtinguiſh'd into three orders, one worſe
than another. The firſt are thoſe who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
from one, one thing; and from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
another; and altering their titles, and
inverting their order, compoſe Books as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51927:77"/>
they make Garlands, wherein many litles
make a mickle, many flowers make a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
They have this diſcretion to ſteal
from every one a little, that ſo few ſhould
perceive and none complain of the theft;
and (as I may ſay) they do not embaſe,
but only clip the Coyne.</p>
               <p>The names of theſe Authors ſumptuouſly
writ in Capital letters in the Frontiſpice of
their Books, ſtupifie them to behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fathers of ſo prodigious an iſſue;
when as they are conſcious that they were
devoid of productive virtue, or ſeed, that
might inable them to the generation of ſo
admirable Births.</p>
               <q>Miraturque novas frondes, &amp; non ſua poma.</q>
               <p>He perceiveth himſelf indow'd with ſuch
riches, and yet knows that he had neither
ſtock nor revenues equivalent to ſo great
a purchaſe.</p>
               <p>They hold it amongſt them for a Law,
never to mention the Authors out of which
they had filtch'd, leaſt they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
for Plagiaries. Nor care they for
<hi>Pliny,</hi>

them.</p>
               <p>But it happens many times (and this is
the final end of all the Art of ſuch lik thieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
that they take upon them to cenſure as
Ignorant, and condemn as ſhallow and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial,
thoſe very perſons from whom
they borrowed all that they had of good,
inſomuch as declaring themſelves nice and
critical in their opinions, they are unſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of felonious filching. Juſt like to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
which where they break down their
banks with a high tide, diradiat, teare up,
and beare before them, all that ſtands in their
way, but of that which their impetuoſity
carries away, they ingorge the moſt ſolid,
and ſhew only the ſtumps, ſedg, and mud.
This is an act proper to <hi>Harpies,</hi> to ſtisfie
their hunger at anothers Table, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themſelves with devouring that

               <p>But, behold, in two ſhort receipts, the
remedy againſt the vicious avidity after
others labours. The firſt is, to perſwade
your ſelves that the VVorld is not a Judge
of ſo litle judgment, that it cannot from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51927:81"/>
publick fame, or rather infamy; from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments,
and witneſſes; when ſo thou art;
find thee to be guilty of felony: and by
this meanes thou wilt never be got to do it,
(although occultly,) out of a hope that none
can detect thee. You invert the order of
things; ſo that the method of thoſe things
ſeem yours, which you transferre from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to your own uſe: yet howſoever
though you ſhould be a <hi>Cacus;</hi> ſubtile in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
upſide down the traces of the feet of
the prey, that you filcht into your houſe;
dragging them by the taile: there will not
want a <hi>Hercules;</hi> that by thoſe very trails,
will trace out the theft, and fraud; and
puniſh the Author. Yea, you your ſelves,
will let ſlip from your mouth, or pen,
ſomething; that may advert the diſcreet of
the fact: and you ſhall in this reſemble the
Raven; which never ſteals ſo ſubtlely, but
with the ſanguin'd beak; and even with the
prey in his mouth; he croaks: whereby,
afore he is aware, he charms up the ſtones,
that flye about his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>Nay, when you your ſelves are ſilent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51927:82"/>
papers ſhall ſpeak againſt you, and your
own Books ſhall form the proceſſe. In this
confidence <hi>Martial;</hi> with whoſe Epigrams
many made themſelves paſſe for Wits, and
Poets, divulging them for their own; ſpent
no words in the accuſation of Thieves, and
the defence of his own,

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is; that you perſwade your

Learned; than to be proved Ignorant; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing of your own, and yet fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
filching from others. If your head be
bald for want of hairs (the Emblem of the
thoughts, the riches of the mind;) you will
not take thoſe of the dead, and make of them

and withal more divine the <hi>Venus's</hi>

inſtruction: ſerving, not ſo much for a
pattern to the copies which they drew; as
for a form of perfection, to the Idea's, which
they comprehended in their minds: of a
moſt abſolute proportion of parts, temper
of colours, and vivacity of Spirit. Such to
the fancy, are the Compoſures of the brave
Maſters of Learning: which beheld with
intenſeneſſe, imprint in the mind by little,
and little, a noble Idea of the like ſtyle; and
we find by experience in him that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to read with attention, works of
noble ſentiments, and lofty ſtyle: that, as
if drunk with the ſame ſpirits; it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to expreſſe himſelf in any
other manner, than nobly. Thus it even'd
to the Nightingales, that made their Neſts
upon the Sepulcher of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that as if
from the aſhes of that great Muſician, and
Poet, they had alſo took his Spirit: they
were incomparably more ingenious, and
skilful Songſters, than the others: ſo that

                  <p>And from this, of reading intenſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Learned Labours, to imprint an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

in the mind conformable to them: may
ſeem to ariſe thoſe occult miracles of the
imaginative power; which hath made us
ſometimes ſee, ruſtick mothers, of deformed
faces, and plebean proportion; to bring
forth children of viſage and features Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical;
(like lovely <hi>Narciſſus's</hi> growing upon
ill-favoured, and ſordid Leeks:) thanks
to the form, which the mothers frequent
beholding of beautiful faces, and exquiſite
pictures, gave to the tender Babes in their
conception.</p>
                  <p>Nor becauſe the Authors are excellent,
and we ſtupid of wit; doth it follow that
the reading them is of no avail, to make us
with imitation to reſemble them. The Eagle
before that ſhe thruſts her little Chicks from
the Neſt, with great circulations and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſoares and wheeles over and about
them, ſtriking them ſometimes with her
wings, and provoking them to flie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Eaglets, although they are not a jot
incouraged to follow their mother even
above the Clouds; whither at one diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wing ſhe is tranſported: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
it prompts them to abandon
their Neſt, put themſelves on their flight,
and to try alſo themſelves upon the wing.
Therefore it naturally comes to paſſe, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51927:93"/>
we follow that which pleaſeth: eſpecially,
if the Genius of the Nature, accord with
the Election of the Will: and the toiles
therein undergone, either are not tedious;
or elſe the bitterneſſe of the trouble, loſing
it elſe in the dulcity of the operation; they
are not felt toilſome.</p>
                  <p>Seeing before us therefore, the ſublime
flights of an happy Wit; let us not only
rouſe and provoke our deſires to imitate
them; but lets us add vigour to our thoughts,
and courage to our mindes: that ſo we may
find our ſelves able to do more, than without
ſuch a ſight we could ever have effected.
Whereby, if we come not to touch the
Heavens, and ſoar above the Stars; at leaſt,
we may raiſe our ſelves from the Earth, and
diſ-neſt. If we attein not to expreſſe with
equal periods, the loftly circulations of the

yet we may do as the Sun-flower,
which fixed in its root, and moveable in its

the World is not ſo deprived of judgment,
but that they know, that certain Allegories,
which others, (thanks to her ſelf) apply to
this Poetry; (Allegories, which how ever
they are wyer-drawn, yet do they not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
to the covering of thoſe immodeſties,
which are read in them) were not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
by which the Poem was compoſed; nay,
never entered into the Authors thought:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51927:105"/>
                     <hi>Chimaera's</hi> are they, not Allegories; and
unprofitable endeavours of ſuch, as would
convert obſcenity into a myſtery.</p>
                  <p>The Table of <hi>Cebes</hi> is one thing; to trace
the intricate avenues of whoſe Labyrinth, it
requires the Clew of an Old Interpreter;
that ſo a ſtranger not underſtanding, as he
ſaid, the <hi>Aenigma'es</hi> of that <hi>Sphinx,</hi> meet not
with death where he expected benefit: The
modern Poems another, which ſtand in
need more of a <hi>Sphinx,</hi> to put them into
<hi>Aenigma;</hi> than of an <hi>Oedipus,</hi> to interpret
them.</p>
                  <p>Yet, all this while I deny not, but that
ſome Ancients, to conceal from the eyes of
the vulgar the miſeries of their Theology:
hid them, (as treaſures within the <hi>Sileny,</hi>)
under the Fables, which they received for
Verities. Howbeit, as there remains nothing
of the myſteries of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sages, but
only their Images; Bats, Apes, Owles:
heretofore learned Hierogliphicks, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Reliques; which alone are taken
from the ancient Pyramids: ſo of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Theology of the Gentiles, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no more to the memory of the
World, but the Adulteries, Thefts, Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
of the gods: Images two unworthy
of any ſubſerviency, in the diſplaying the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51927:105"/>
myſteries of Divinity. But the Poets now
a-dayes have no occaſion for, or thought of
this. And if they ſhould, they would be no
leſſe imprudent than impure: taking away
directly contrary to the end pretended:
namely, reciting, to infuſe good manners,
obſcene Fables; apter far to extirpate virtue
where it already hath been implanted:
which would be (as ſaith the Theologiſt
<hi>Nazianzen) per ſcopulos ducere a dlittus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Orat. 3. contra Julian.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it needeth not that they clothe the
Wolves like Sphepheards, and the Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Poets, like Moral Phyloſophers.</p>
                  <p>The third defence is that they ſay, they intend
no mans hurt: in their writings, but their own
honour. Their Books bear in their frontiſpieces,
written in Capital letters,<note place="margin">Praefat. Cent.</note> the ſaying of <hi>Auſonins,
Cui hic ludus noſter non placet, ne legerit:
aut cum legerit obliviſcatur: aut non obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
ignoſcat.</hi> So that he who falleth must blame
himſelf as weak, not the Poet; which compoſed
not the Book, nor publiſhed it, to offend the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
What harm is their in the ſtones, if ſuch as
are of glaſse go to juſtle with them? He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fight, let him not Arm himſelf: he that is not
well provided for a ſtorm, let him not ingulfe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51927:106"/>
of ſpeech; not a <hi>Spider,</hi> that ſucketh the poyſon of
Laſciviouſneſſe. Even in Holy Scripture we meet
with the Inceſt of <hi>Ammon:</hi> the Adultery of
<hi>David:</hi> the deteſtable uncleaneſſe of <hi>Sodome.</hi>
The finger of God writ them; nor are they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
becauſe ſome may draw thence examples of
ſinning; reliſhing the fact, more than they reſpect
the puniſhment. Therefore, that ſome decline in
their Virtues, by reading a Book, compiled onely
with an intent at the advancements of the Wit;
this is the crime, not of the innocent Author, but
of the incautulous Reader.</p>

                     <hi>Quam ſapiens argumentatrix ſibi videtur igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia

occaſion. Did you ever ſee So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes,
better couch'd in Syllogiſmes? I
thought at firſt, that I my ſelf ſhould have
been perſwaded by them: <q>For, (ſeeing
that that which is not directly intended,
cannot render another culpable:) the ſin
is not a ſin; we not intending in the leaſt
the incommodity of the crime, but only
the pleaſure, or commodity of the action.</q>
Theſe are Maſters of their profeſſion. But
do they not deſire that, which they ſay they
deſire not: whilſt in the mean-time crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they attempt all the means, by which it
is atteinable: ſo that if they intend not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
why do they attempt otherwiſe?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51927:106"/>
Suppoſe this very thing were the Scope of
ſome Poets: to excite with the delectation
of Fable, and Verſe, the inſentives to luſt:
could they do it more handſomely, or more
efficaicouſly? And when they indited were
they either ſo ſtupid, or ſo blind, as not to
perceive the ſame? And can they be ſaid
not to deſire that, which in ſo forceable
manner they effectually deſire? Nor may
that be applied to their purpoſe, which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>

hand an excellent Authour of a peſtilent
Book, over-comming the contraſts of his

in Hell; ſacrificing it generouſly to the

to the heart; to burn a Book, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

you by St. <hi>Jerome: Why the Elephants, that
are as it were ſo many Mountains of fleſh, have
onely four feet, on which they reſt the immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
maſſes of their huge bodies: and the Louſe,
which is but a living Point, hath ſix?</hi> You will
confeſſe you know not this, (which if you
did, you knew juſt nothing;) and will you
pretend to underſtand that, which even that
man is not able to underſtand who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
all things? At the firſt ſtep you take
in the purſuit of intelligible things, you
ſtumble with <hi>Thales</hi> into a ditch, and would
you attein to the ſight of that which ſo far
ſurmounts the Stars? <q>How oppoſite to
you, would the correction be, which <hi>Zeno</hi>
the Stoick, gave to a conceited young
Fellow, that had as little wit in his head,
as hair on his face; and demanded his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to things, of which he was not able
to underſtand the demand: The Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
made him ſet a Looking-glaſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and then whiſpered in his ear;

                  <p>Your Wit in compariſon of that of the
Great <hi>Augustine,</hi> is but as a Graſhopper
confronted to a Horſe; and do you pretend
to couch the lance, and hit the mark, when
he withdraws, and preſumes not to eſſay it?
Yea, (as it were ſlinging himſelf with that
Phyloſopher into the Sea, and ſaying, <hi>O
abyſſe tu me cape, quia te ipſe non capio:</hi>) he an
hundred times proteſteth in his writings
to know nothing; and that he knew not
how to know; and goes on ſaying, <hi>Neſcio,
&amp; non erubeſco conſiteri me neſcire quod neſcio.</hi>
And how dare you open your mouth, or
exalt your voice to contradict, and queſtion
that, to which for this ſixteen Ages, the
Pens of a world of Doctors; the Blood of
a world of Martyrs; the conſent of ſo many
Nations; the Teſtimony of ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
have ſubſcribed and ratified? With
the Ruſh-candle of your Dim underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Who repleniſheth the Rivers with waters,

little Diamonds, ſo they held precious the
leaſt minute of that time, of which alone it
is commendable to be covetous. It was a

miracle to ſee them in Publick: and they
reſembled, as in the love of VViſdom, ſo
alſo in this, the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is
placed very neer the Sun, and which, by
that means very hardly is diſcerned: as if
he cared not for terrene eyes, who alwayes
was in the eye of the Sun: and beheld by
him, not with an unprofitable look, but
with a large communication of light. In

Men, as white in their thoughts, as hair,

<hi>Cum in foro eſuriam,</hi>

ſome object, was a ſufficient excuſe to take
it where it offered it ſelf to them. Farther
more that which by the Law of Nature they
were bound to allow the body to preſerve
life, they allowed themſelves for neceſſity
not for delight, and many times it fell out,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51927:146"/>
that, either with a voluntary abſtinence, they
in part deprived themſelves of it, or immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the profound thoughts of their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
for ſome time forgot it. Thus <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
(unmindful of his being a Man, while
he was all mind, and all thought, and fated
with the ſweeteſt <hi>Nectar</hi> of thoſe noble
cognitions, with which he banqueted his
VVit,) had let his body die of famine, if

food. Thus <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſeemed alwayes out

               <p>TO ſet out with ſucceſſe upon our

to take directions; as for him

Nature is like the Planets; that
where they go retrograde, make but ſmall
progreſſe. They get not moſt from her, that
moſt preſſe and force her; but they that
moſt pleaſe and obſerve her: whereupon,
ſhe, which freely working in every, though
difficult enterprize, ſucceeds with no leſſe
facility than felicity; (as the Coeleſtial
<hi>Syrens</hi> revolve their great Spheres with their
melody,) if violence be offered her, ſhe not
only not increaſeth the virtue by the force,
but rather loſeth her former vigour and
ſtrength: as water, that by cold freezeth;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51927:149"/>
and if before it had motion, now all ſtrength
is extinct, and it becomes immoveable, and
as it were dead.</p>

that is incident in the acquiſt of the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
as with his own <hi>Genius;</hi> and with that
which the Maſters of Arts calleth <hi>Invita
Minerva:</hi> is like to him that ſwims againſt
the ſtream in a place where ſome torrent
precipitates; that toils much, but advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

when the Nature admits it not: which

leave their currents, to go climb and aſcend

               <p>The Wiſe <hi>Athenians</hi> eſteemed it a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of never knowing any thing, not
to know from the beginning to apply our
ſelves to that, for which Nature deſign'd
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51927:150"/>
us. Thence it was that before they applyed
their children to any profeſſion, they cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
inquired into their Inclinations;
of which the Deſires commonly are Truth-telling-Interpreters:
and that they did, by
laying before them the implements of all

               <p>They believed that Heaven called them

therefore, by the teſt of a good Touch-ſtone
to learn what ſort his Mettal is of; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to extract there-from what he
may. Let him obſerve (ſay the <hi>Platonists</hi>) in

betake himſelf to the Pen, to the Scepter, or

               <p>It is doubtleſſe a moſt unhandſome thing
to ſee ſome times in the Schools certain
heads, better able to crack Lobſters, than
to ſtudy. Heads that have a Mind ſo ſtupid,
and ſo ill adapted to the myſteries of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they ſeem like a reverted <hi>Jove,</hi> to

               <p>There is therefore a neceſſity, if we will

that it hath ſo knowable a voice, that
it needs no interpreters to declare it, but
cares to hear it. It only reſts that we ſpeak
ſomething for others information in this
diſcovery; and it ſhall be of the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
from whence VVit is conjectured:
and the knowledge thereof will be uſeful to
the end that in employing ſuch as depend

from the viſage, conſtitution, and lineaments
of the Body, of the immenſity, ſubtilty,
vivacity and profundity of a VVit: I will
here recite, but without much troubling
my ſelf with their confutation, the more
common ſymptomes given of this matter,
by the Profeſſors of Phyſiognomy. And
firſt,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Platonists</hi> deny that Beauty of Mind,
and deformity of Body can ſubſiſt together
in one and the ſame man.<note place="margin">Plot. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Gnoſ. &amp; alii.</note> That <hi>Trine</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
with the <hi>Moon,</hi> which is the ſeal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Stars mark the moſt lovely faces,
that it may have conſonance with numbers,
they contemper the Mind, and accord it to
the motion of the firſt <hi>Mind. Pythagoras</hi>
that Soul of Light, was ſo fair in his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that his Scholars ſome called him,
others believed him <hi>Apollo</hi> in the diſguiſe of
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> coppied from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo:</hi>
Nor doth there want a reaſon for the
ſame. For as much as beauty is no other,
than a certain Flower, that is produced by
the Soul, as a buried ſeed, upon this ground
of the Body. Likewiſe the Sun, if a Cloud
cover it, it ſhineth through it, with its more
ſubtle Rayes, and renders it ſo glorious,
that it no longer reſembleth a vapour extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from the Earth, ſordid and obſcure, but
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51927:155"/>
flaming Gold and as it were another Sun.
No otherwiſe a Soul, that is a Sun of light
within the Cloud of the Body, that covers
and conceals it, ſhineth through it with the
rayes of its beauty; ſo that it renders that
alſo beyond meaſure beautiful: and this is
that which <hi>Plotonus</hi> calls the <hi>Dominion,</hi> that
<hi>Form</hi> hath over <hi>Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhich if it ſhould be granted, that Souls
come only into Bodies reſembling them;
and onely tye this knot of ſtrict amity, there
where there is exact ſimilitude; who but
ſees that a beautiful Soul cannot then unite it
ſelf to a deformed Body?</p>
                  <p>Nor availeth it to tell them of <hi>Aeſop,</hi>
(born, if ever any was, with the Moon in the
Nodes) that he was a <hi>Therſytes; Crates,</hi> no
Citizen of <hi>Thebes</hi> but a Monſter of <hi>Affrick;</hi> of
<hi>Socrates,</hi> ſo ill-furniſht with beauty, yea, of
ſo groſſe a ſtamp, that <hi>Sophyrus</hi> the Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer
gave him for the very <hi>Idea</hi> of one
ſtupid and blockiſh; whom <hi>Alcibiades</hi> called
a <hi>Sylenus;</hi> thereby declaring him without,
half Beaſt; within, more than Man: and
<hi>Theodorus</hi> deſcribing in <hi>Theectetus</hi> a Youth of
moſt fortunate VVit, ſpeaking with the ſame
<hi>Socrates,</hi> could tell him, <hi>Non eſt pulcher: ſimilis
tui eſt: ſimo naſo, &amp; prominentibus oculis, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
minus ille quam tu in his modum excedat.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:51927:156"/>
They deny that ſuch deformity in them was
the intention of <hi>Nature,</hi> but the miſtake of
<hi>Chance;</hi> not the defect of <hi>Form,</hi> but the fault
of diſobedient <hi>Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if that be ſo, the Women have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
great advantage, to whom <hi>Beauty</hi> was
given for a <hi>Dowry;</hi> and we ſee, that it is
<hi>Natures</hi> continual care, to work that ſoft and
morbid Earth, ſo, that ſhe may therein plant
this flower the more ſuccesfully. And yet
through the ſubjection to which they were
condemned, they have as little Judgment
in their heads, as they have much of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe
in their faces. VVhence <hi>Aeſops</hi>
Fox may ſay of the moſt of them, as he ſaid
of the Marble head of a very lovely fac'd
Statue; <hi>O beautiful, but brainleſs head!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And really, if we obſerve experience, it
will be obvious, that <hi>Nature</hi> is not oblieged
to theſe Laws, of ſetting Pearls only in
Gold, and of putting VVits of excellent
Sapience only in Bodies of exquiſite Beauty.

                  <p>Others argue from the palure of the

                     <note place="margin">Orat. 14</note> And rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſeemeth to perſwade as much; for that
the very beſt of the blood is exhauſted in
the operations of the Mind, and the face
thereby left ex-ſanguate and diſcoloured.
Therefore the Star of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the Father of

not by election of the Will, but by inſtinct of

ſee their excellency, muſt behold them from
one point, namely that, where all the lines
of their knowledge Concenter; otherwiſe
they have nothing conſiderable, and indeed

                  <p>Theſe, and many more are the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
and different forms, whence VVits
come to be ſo various in <hi>Genius,</hi> and Tallent

brain, what harmony of qualities, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of humours, doth ſo obliege the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51927:161"/>
Soul; that it ſhould be in ſome in the things
of the Mind blockiſh; and in the more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and material moſt active; in others, in
the abſtracts excellent, in the practicks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable:
That it ſhould be diſpoſed, here
to one, there to another, here to all, there
to no act of Reaſon, or labour of VVit? If
the actions of the intelligent Soul are done
by her-ſelf, and reſt in her; what can the
Body do, howſoever tempered; or the
Brain, in what manner ſoever diſpoſed? and
if they can do nothing; it remains, that the
diverſity of Wits, ariſeth from different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Soul, not various diſpoſitions
of the Body.</p>
                  <p>But if this be ſo, if the mind depend not
on the Organs for operation, nor on the
Humours for well operating; whence is it,
that ſome, either by an accidental blow on
the head, or by a ſtrange diſeaſe, have ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
or gradually loſt their Memory, and
impair'd their Wit; ſo that their brain, like
the opened Box of <hi>Pandora,</hi> or the vented
Box of <hi>Ulyſses,</hi> is for ever after without Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Judgment? How cometh from the

Faculty;</hi> the rebolliment of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the diſorder of the Reaſon, Frenzy, and
Madneſſe? Why doth he, (that when a

Child was ingenious, and apt growing with
yeares), become groſſe of mind, and ſo
much the more ſtupid, by how much the
more before he was ſpritely? Yet the
Soul is it ſelf. VVho then implumes the
VVit, who obtuſeth the Fancy, who alters
the Soul from what once ſhe was?</p>
                  <p>But Countries, ſome abound with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Wits, as in <hi>Attica,</hi> that famous <hi>Athens,</hi>
the Neſt, and Nurſe of the <hi>Sciences;</hi> and in

the <hi>Zophiti</hi> motion amongſt other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
                  <p>Do we not ſee ſo great difference of
Wits between City and City,<note place="margin">Plut. in Alex.</note> even in adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Conntries, that ſome, as the <hi>Egyptian
Alexandria,</hi> ſeem to have deſigned their firſt

the ſummity of <hi>Olympus;</hi> have their feet
higher, than others carry their heads? And
whence is this, if neither Heaven, nor Air,

tempered by them, have the leaſt influence
in thoſe Actions: which being proper to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51927:162"/>
the Soul, as the principle of diſcourſe; by
her only are produced, and in her alone are
received?</p>
                  <p>It is then a more approved, and I am ſure
a more received opinion, that the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Complexion, whence the ſtate

the <hi>Wit,</hi> and to the diverſity of its <hi>Genius;</hi>
as the tuning of the ſtrings to the melody of

Intervals, Notes, meaſures of Tunes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and diſpoſitions of Uniſons, &amp; Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones,
proper, and mixt, to the diverſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<hi>Frigian, Dorick, Lydian;</hi> whence
proceeds the various Muſick, Grave, Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
Martial, Melancholy, and Merry.
Conſider the various (we will ſay) Tones,<note place="margin">Lect 9. in Hypp. de acre &amp; aquis.</note>
and Moods, of VVit, which <hi>Cardan</hi> would
deſcribe by the various conſorts of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
qualities in nine kinds of humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
Obſerve the proportion of eight parts
of Blood, two of Choler, and two of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
which <hi>Ficinus</hi> would preſcribe to
the harmony of a great VVit, and let every
one believe thereof as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>This ſeemeth univerſally true, that the
works of the VVit, participating an I know
not what of fiery, as the velocious motion
of the thoughts, and the nature of the ignean
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51927:162"/>
ſpirits that ſerve it demonſtrate; thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that partake moſt of fiery, are moſt
capable of ſerving it: even as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Flegme rendereth it ſtupid, and brings
it as it were into a ſomniferous Lethargy.
Therefore Choler which is hot in exceſſe,
&amp; withall dry, is wholly proper to the Wit.
But Melancholy (although it doth not ſo
ſeem) is more appoſit tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that; not that groſs
and loathſome humour, which more ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizeth
with Flegme in frigidity, than with
Choler in ſiccity; but a certain (as it were)
aduſt part of the yellow Choler, cold and
dry by nature, as the earth, but, if it be rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and enkindled, ſo capable to conceive
fire (as the exhalations raiſed by the Sun,
which yet are a cold and dry earth) and a
fire ſo vehement, and forceable, that it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
of lightning in ſtrength, though it be
more durable and conſtant. And hence
proceedeth Madneſs, and that Grave Frenſy
of the mind that wholly tranſports it beſides
it ſelf, and wholly concenters it in it ſelf;
that gives it velocious motions, and holds it
ſtedfaſt, and fixed; wholly diſperſing, and
wholly contracting the thoughts. Nor may
therebe wanting Bloud and Flegme, the one
for aliment to the ſpirits, the other for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament;
that ſo the too great drineſſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51927:163"/>
make not barren, or the too great heat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
not the organ and cauſe more
ſmoak than light. The predominant ought
therefore to be fiery, the reſt, of a mixture
in proportion to the degrees of this.</p>
                  <p>And this, if I gueſſe not a miſſe, is the ſo
famous Dry Light of <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> That <hi>Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
vigor, &amp; caeleſtis origo;</hi> that where it
hath the flame more bright, and in more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
humours leſſe thick and muddy, there
its a thing more like a Heavenly Intelligence
than a terrene Wit.</p>
                  <p>This is that ſo difficult <hi>Electrum</hi> of VVit
and Judgment together. The VVit the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
all inſtability &amp; motion; the Judgment,
the Chymical Medicine that fixeth it: The
VVit the Lion, and the Dolphin all fury, all
ſpeed; the Judgment, the Bridle, and Anchor,
that reſtrains the fury, that retards its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Wit the Sail, the Judgment the
Ballaſt: That the Wing, this the Clog:
That the young face of <hi>Janus,</hi> this the old,
and gray.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the temper of the humours
for the ſervice of the mind, is not one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
one, from their varieties take rice
the abilities, <hi>Genuis's,</hi> and humours, which
incline them to various kinds of ſtudies.
Becauſe that in ſome ſtudies there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51927:163"/>
more patience, and, as we are wont
to ſay, more Flegm; in others, greater
promptneſſe of mind; in others, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
more firm; elſ-where diſcourſe more
abſtract: here great memory, their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of comprehending as it were in one
ſole act the cognition of many objects; and
diſcerning their dependency without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
them; according as the humours
and their qualities, are variouſly tuned and
harmoniz'd together: whence more or
leſſe according to the predominancy of hot,
and cold, dry and moiſt, we have abilities
more apt to one than to another Science;
according to the temper of the qualities,
that the inſtruments require, for the better
diſpoſing them to operation. And this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of power, well diſpoſed towards ſuch
ſorts of objects, is the foundation of that,
which they call <hi>Genius.</hi> Becauſe that there
being in every one by natural inſtinct an
in-nate deſire of knowing; and Nature not
erring, but being conſcious of that, which
ſhe is to apply us to the deſire of, as our <hi>Good:</hi>
(a thing, which to obtein we have not power
ſufficient:) thence it is, that ſhe carrieth us
to the deſire of that, to attein which we are
ſufficently diſpoſed. The proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the power to the object, and the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51927:164"/>
deſire which we have to know; of which
one applyeth, the other determineth; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that ſympathy, which we may call the
Form of the <hi>Genius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, that it is not the diſpoſition, figure,
colour, nor maſſe of the members of the
body that we ſhould obſerve as immediate,
or true teſtimonies of the Wit, in applying
any to Learning. But from the <hi>Acts,</hi> the
moſt natural teſtimonies of the <hi>Powers,</hi> we
may argue their internal Temper, thereby
to find to which of the Arts it hath moſt
agreeable proportion. Thus, ſince the honey

                  <p>Therefore its needful to have knowledg
of, and acquaintance with many Books; and
a Judgment of competent ability to pick
out, but of greater maturity to apply the
things that one finds, that ſo where cauſe
requires they may in an ingenious, and
ſingular manner, expreſſe that which they
have to ſay. And in this, its an infallible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that every one gathers that for

Thus there are ſome that from flowers take

the images, painting them, others the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
diſtilling them; but the Bees take
thence the honey, and the honey all of one
ſweetneſſe, and of one Savour; though from
flowers of diverſe natures and taſts they
gather it. The ſame happens in Books,
Meadows of odoriferous flowers and hearbs
for the maintenance of the Wit. There be
thoſe who only take from them the ſight,
in the delight of reading them; others
ſome ſpirit of good odour, to waken the
Brain, and comfort the Wit. There are ſome
that bundle up herbs, careleſly gathering
what comes firſt to hand; and ſome that
with greater curioſity pick only flowers to
weave thereof <hi>Crownes</hi> and <hi>Garlands.</hi> Some
ſqueeze out the juice, others extract the
waters; Few from a great multitude of
Subjects, different from one another, know
how to gather honey of the ſame taſt, ſo
applying things, that all ſpeak to the ſame
purpoſe; and ſo that there may be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

Theſe diverſe manners of election, and
application, ſubmit to the Judgment, and
the Judgment follows the <hi>Genius</hi> which
every one hath of ſpeaking ſome in one
ſtyle, and ſome in another, ſuitable to the
<hi>Idea</hi> of his mind. Therefore matters extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

it not the property of a good Judgment, but

                  <p>Theſe are the Characters of the Forms
of Speech in their pure being, onely hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not deſcribed. The Maſters of this Art
which according to their profeſſion do treat
thereof, will compleatly ſatiſfie them that
deſire a more full information. It ſufficeth
me to have ſaid ſo much concerning it as
was requiſite to be known by way of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the enſuing advice: And it is, <hi>That
the</hi> Style <hi>ſhould be varied conformably to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the Subjects treated of; accommodating
it to each as the Light to the Colours, which
into ſo various Forms, ſo constantly transforms
itſelf.</hi> The ſame <hi>Scoene</hi> ſerves not to <hi>Tragoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Comoedies,</hi> and <hi>Paſtorals. This</hi> requires
Fields, and Woods, <hi>that</hi> City-houſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
The <hi>Tragick</hi> Princely Palaces, and
Temples. The place ought to correſpond to
the Action. Likewiſe <hi>Oration</hi> ſhould adapt
it ſelf to the ſubject; not treating of ſublime
matters with a <hi>Plebean Style,</hi> nor of baſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
with ſublime Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>In fine, we ſhould have that ſubtlety in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51927:200"/>
the uſe of <hi>Styles,</hi> which ſome Ancient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Statues had, that formed not every
god every Mettal; but according to their
various natures, in various tempers mixing
them, they expreſſed them to be either,
gentle, or cruel; horrid or handſome; bright
or duskiſh: and in that moſt commendable
was the judgment of <hi>Alcon,</hi> that made a
<hi>Hercules</hi> all of Iron; <hi>Laborum Dei patientia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductus,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, we ought not only univerſally to uſe
<hi>Styles</hi> fitted to the nature of the entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
of which we ſpeak; but in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
it behoves ſo many times to vary it:
as the things are divers which compoſe it.
And like as in Tragical Actions the Scoene
changeth, and alters it ſelf to Rural, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
ſome particularity either of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Satyre,</hi> or of the Modern <hi>Paſtoral;</hi> thus
where there occurs in one diſcourſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
proper to other Kinds, than that, which
the ſet ſubject comprehends, to expreſſe it
decently, it is requiſite to change the Form
of Speech; uſing appoſitely &amp; opportunely,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> adviſeth.<note place="margin">Lib. 43. cap. 14</note>

(about which, the end which
in the beginning I propoſed to my
ſelf, was, to advert that only, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the invention and diſpoſing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the manners of expreſſing them)
that which onely remains is, to go over it
with the finiſhing touch, and repoliſh it,
examining to particularly, and making a
ſevere judgment of each of its parts, to ſee
if there be as <hi>Sydonius</hi> found in thoſe of his

reſemble the Authour, <hi>Nec ſe agnoſcit in illis.</hi>
The reaſon is, becauſe the boyling of the

leaves not that tranquility nor clear

from GOD himſelf, that hath been ever
ſince the beginning of the World with a
great Leſſon our Tutor herein, in that he
made the World in one day, and was five in
beautefying it; taking one while darkneſſe
from Heaven, another while ſterily from
the Earth; adorning that with Stars, this
with Flowers: till that having compleated,
his Work he commended it as worthy of
his hand, <hi>&amp; requievit ab univerſo opere quod

Said an old Maſter to a melancholy
young man, that being unable to ſpeak as
he would, would not ſpeak as he might;
and therefore had unprofitably travailed
three dayes together about the beginning

not to ſpeak well, but to ſay nothing; of

What man is there though of never ſo
excellent a Judgment, to whom his works
are ſo pleaſing, that as Gold of the twenty
fourth Karact, there is nothing to be added
of good or taken away of baſe Alloy? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is a priviledge denied to all the things
in the World. The Sun hath its Myſts, the
Moon her Spots; of the Stars, ſome are
turbulent, ſome melancholy; and yet theſe
are the moſt conſiderable Bodies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
nor ought they therefore to be diſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe they are not altogether ſo
beautiful as they might be. Examine the
Books that have the eſteem of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the fame of great knowledg, they
will be fair faces but not without ſome ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
or defect; for not only good <hi>Homer,
Quandoque dormitat,</hi> but in a word, the <hi>Argus's</hi>
alſo, though they have a hundred eyes.
For if they had reſolved fully to ſatisfie
themſelves, and not to publiſh their labours
to the VVorld, till that they ſhould have
been compleatly perfect, <hi>Adieu-Books:</hi> the
VVorld would not have had one good one;
But if <hi>they</hi> patiently ſuffered their defects
counterfeited by ſo many excellencies, <hi>we</hi>
need not deſpair but that ſo much as is of
good in our writings, may find more praiſe
than the culpable diſpraiſe.</p>
