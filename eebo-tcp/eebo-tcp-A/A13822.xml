         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A drunkard is a willfull

            <p>2 There be foure things whereby

Gouernment, whereby hee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

Frugality and Labour, whereby

Fourthly, Liberality, and Mercie,
whereby hee feedeth himſelfe and
others: All theſe make a perfect

And all theſe were in <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>

he was of excellent gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

            <p>The firſt thing is Wiſedome,
obſerued in <hi>Salomon</hi> by Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

note, not out of one word onely of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21736:20"/>

and I truſt not out of order,

and therefore I will ſpeake of
it at this time in my viſitation of
this place, after many yeares ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that although you neede it
not in regarde of your continued
inſtruction, yet I will endeauour

Faith and Wiſedome both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherein the boundes that I
will walk, ſhall be Truth; my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>3 <hi>Salomon</hi> is therefore wiſe, becauſe
he teacheth and giueth Counſel of
all thinges, from the Court and

euery man (as a Phyſitian) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
Counſell to other when he is
well, and is not able to heale or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
himſelfe in euill. The higheſt
piece and part of Wiſedome is, to
Counſell our ſelues, not others.
<hi>Salomon</hi> neuer failed in teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for that is eaſie, but in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe, and diſtinguiſhing
Vice and Vertue aſſunder, when it
came to practiſe, there hee failed.
<hi>Salomon</hi> hath many diſciples in his
defection, not in his perfection,
for they are prouided for all but
themſelues.</p>
            <p>He therefore that will bee wiſe,
and giue Counſell to other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to King and Superiour, or to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21736:21"/>
Seruant and Inferiour, let him firſt
informe himſelfe, for the wiſe man
is a worthy and excellent Maiſter,
alſo a dexterious, and induſtrious
Scholler: How can he teach other
that teacheth not himſelfe? And
there is no greater foole in the
world, then he which is not proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for his laſt day, for his farewell
to the world, and laſt eſtate. His
ſoule is his chiefeſt care, his greateſt
price, his honourable charge, and
his endleſſe hope; he which is wiſe
for his ſoule, cannot bee a foole in
other things, although hee knowe
them not, for they belong not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him as the eſſential Office of his
life, but accidentally, and at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to know or not to know them.
For this cauſe, or for the ſouls ſake,
the wiſeman inricheth his mind, by
all that euer hee heareth, ſeeth, or
that commeth vnder ſence or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21736:22"/>
by obſeruing things preſent, by
recording and calling to minde
things paſt and abſent, by foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ends and euents of thinges
to come; whereby diligence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him like a Prophet for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, for another world. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
maketh him giue precepts of
life, by comparing things paſſed,
with things preſent, &amp; iudgement
ſo preuenteth future dangers, that
hee is neuer at a loſſe, euen for the
things he miſſeth, but he is ſtill the
wiſer by defaults and defectes, and
like a wiſe and artificiall Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,
by a falſe number findeth a
true, and by a wrong way diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the right. His eyes are like
man and wife, or like <hi>Dauids</hi> hoaſt,
ſome went to fight againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and ſome ſtayed to keepe the
ſtuffe and carriage: no more doe
they wander, both from home to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21736:22"/>
one ſtill keepeth houſe, as
one Pigeon ſtill ſitteth on the Egs.
So the food wherewithall it is ſped
abroad, is not decrely bought by
the death and daunger of the yong
ones at home. If hee buy wit, hee
maketh much of it; to keepe it, to
value it, to occupy it, that hee may
haue the Treaſure of knowledge,
his Counſels the infallible Oracles
of certainty, though no medler, yet
ſeeing into euery mans buſineſſe,
and yet beſt experienced in his

to heare his word, to poſſeſſe
his promiſes, to liue in his feare, &amp;
to die in his fauour.</p>
            <p>4. Now, for the attaining of this
Wiſedome, to counſell and teach

excellent quality (if I may ſo terme
it) of Wiſedome, yet ſit downe and
ſpend out their miſerable dayes in
vaine pleaſures, which coſt them
more deare, and moſt of all in the
end. I reade of a certaine Abbot,
who buſying himſelfe in building,
and other worldly occupations,
was reprooued by his foole in this
manner: <hi>ô ſtulte quid facis, quid te
in huiuſmodi negotijs, &amp;c.</hi> O foole
(ſaid he) what dooſt thou? Why
art thou ſo troubled with theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious

This foole, hath the moſt

ſtudy, care, or trauaile (and that
which is worſt of all) they liue in
an outward ſeruice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remorſe of conſcience for their
vanity, and thinke they ſerue God
very ſufficiently &amp; quietly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God calleth to them euerie day,
in that renewed reproofe of the
wicked man in the Parable, who
<hi>Bid his ſoule take his eaſe, Thou foole

one drop or dramme of heauenly

that is, <hi>Ericus</hi> the Wiſe. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,

7 Thus haue I diſcourced of
Wiſedom, and the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
whereunto I will adde but this
one complaint, that all wants and
defects bee ſenſible, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
dolefull to them that feele
them, onely the want of heauenly
wiſedome is not perceiued, is not
lamented. If a mans Land, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
or leafe bee in any danger,
preſently he repaireth to a Lawier,
to declare his caſe, either of offence
or defence, to ſecure his owne: &amp;
worthily, for wherefore was Law
made? Or how ſhall Iuſtice be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
except the eſtates of men
in the differences and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of the world, may bee thereby
eſtabliſhed? If the bodie bee any
waies heauy or diſtempered, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
poſt for a Phyſitian, to the
end, that Maladies preuented in
time, may more eaſily be auoided,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21736:29"/>
and health preſerued; and we doe
wel herein, for God hath not made
vs for ſicknes, but for health, and he
which placed vs in a Paradice, did
ſignifie thereby, that wee coulde
not brook a Deſart, &amp; what Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
haue wee now left, except our
health? Or what Deſart is ſo intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
as ſickneſſe? Wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are forſaken of their friends, and
forget their deareſt ſelfe. Nay, if our
Horſe or Oxe be but a little ill, and
forſake their meate, wee ſend for a
Leach, to the end that it may bee
holpen: but if our ſoule, ſicke of
ſinne and folly, forſake the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
food thereof, tarry at home,
forbeare the church and Sermons,
deſpiſe grace and Heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
we are ſo wiſe in our owne
conceites, that feeling no ſmart or
paine, we care not to be cured, but
like mad men, breake our bandes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21736:30"/>
and ſet light by our beſt Phiſitians,
ô therefore, I pray God open our
eyes, that our ſouls be not in worſe
caſe then our Oxen and Aſſes! they
fall and are ſicke, and find ſome to
helpe them vp, and eaſe them; we
fall and are ſicke, and finde none to
helpe vs vp, but like wanton Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wee lie ſtill, and cry againſt
them that would relieue vs. This is
folly, this is an euill to be abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and whoſoeuer is but a meane
Chriſtian, as he bleſſeth the hande
that feedeth him with bread, ſo let
him bleſſe the hand that feedeth
him with knowledge.</p>
            <p>8 But for the more deteſtation
of ſpirituall folly, giue mee leaue
to argue againſt it, and diſproue it
to your conſciences, that this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke
ſottiſhneſſe and ſoliditie, or
fooliſh ſimplicity in Diuine affaires
which concerne the ſoule, may bee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21736:30"/>
abandoned; for ſurely ſuch an one
is <hi>Salomons</hi> foole: and if our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt ſay that he is <hi>daunger of
Hell fire, which ſaith, thou foole,</hi> how
much more is he worthy and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to go to hell, that is a foole, then
he that calleth a foole. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the wrong to bee ſo tearmed,
when one is not, be ſo inexpiable,
as that it holdeth the ſlaunderer
in daunger of eternall torment,
what is not he worthy of, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himſelfe ſo? It is but the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of the caſe to be ſo named, but
to be ſo, is reall; and therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
&amp; yeeldeth greater damage.
Hearken therefore vnto me, and I
will ſet before you a rowe of fooles
recorded in aſſured ſtories, whom
euery man in the Letter derideth,
and loueth in the figure; that is,
miſliketh and ſcorneth this folly in
other, but loueth in himſelfe.</p>

take the Diuell at his word, and for

When <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men had

for a recompence, and yet it was
not a demand of any deſert, but an
intreaty for ſom neceſſary victuals
for himſelfe and his troope; which
thing the foole did not onely deny,
but to his perrill, and the perrill of
all his family, reproached <hi>Dauid</hi>
and his followers, for Runnagates.
And if his wife had not been wiſer
then himſelfe, it had not failed, but
that their blood had all beene that

that is, to men in want, that which

Tenant, and the Tenant from the
Landlord: that there is not ſo
much loue and good wil left in the
Countrey, as was betwixt <hi>Balaam</hi>
&amp; his Aſſe, when he did beat him.
I wil ſpeake plainly; Some like <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>
ſpeak proudly; others (like
the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) take it as
peeuiſhly, they will haue as little
charity in their eares, as other haue
in their tongues, a word &amp; a blow,
friendſhip is no heauier then a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which euery blaſt of wind toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
too and fro. The loſſe of ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
will cauſe a ſute, the gaine
of a ſhilling will make a Traitour,
and they are more ready to follow
a Crowne of Gold, then an Angel
of Heauen All their varniſhing is
outward; they are like Gyants pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
terrifying the beholders, and
if they haue not power to be cruell
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21736:35"/>
inough in their owne perſons, of
their owne eſtate, then they flye to
the mightier, and incenſe them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
good Natures by falſe tales,
and force them, inſtead of milke, to
draw blood from their Inferiours,
&amp; ſo they make themſelues fooles,
for they liue without credite, and
die without pitty; ſauing, It is pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they die no ſooner.</p>
            <p>12 Yet behold more fooles then
theſe: And now, wee bring in the
man in the Goſpel, who in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of long life, deſtroied his
Barnes, and builded greater, and
bad <hi>his ſoule take his eaſe, eat drink,
and take paſtime,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12, 20</note> 
               <hi>for it had much
goods laide vppe for many yeares: Ah
foole</hi> (ſaide God) <hi>this night they wil
fetch away thy ſoule from thee.</hi> And
worthily and rightly is he a Foole,
whom God calleth a foole, for his
iudgement cannot be deceiued, his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21736:36"/>
inſight into mans heart is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that it cannot erre: for he hath
anatomized and dissected more;
then all the Phyſitians that euer
haue beene. But who doth ſo now
adaies? Who blesseth himſelfe in
his riches? Seeketh them, but to
ſpend them; ſpendeth them, but
on himſelfe; keepeth, but for his
pleaſure; and maketh account to
liue many yeares? I will tell you
who: he that wil not giue, becauſe
he cannot tell what hee ſhall want
before hee die: For, although Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God haue dealt neuer ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
with him, giuing many
houſes, and much money, that was
borne to none; the ſixt part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
could haue ſatisfied him, before
he had it; now he will not truſt his
bounty any more, but out of his
owne prouident wretchedneſſe, be
vnmercifull to other, for feare of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21736:36"/>
want, while they wallow in all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
and abundance. Againe, they
are ſuch fooles, who neuer ceaſe
trauailing and labouring, all for
their liuing, as if they had at the
leaſt a leaſe of a thouſand years for
their life, dealing with their ſoules,
as Hackney men with their horſes,
giuing them no reſt till they bee
dead; And then, ſuch ſoules can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſt, becauſe if their bodies
giue them ſo little reſt while they
bee in them, (who yet haue great
occaſion to honour them) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
into whoſe power the ſoules
of ſuch men doe paſſe, will ſhewe
them much leſſe fauour, hauing no
other ioy, but to afflict &amp; torment
the ſoules that themſelues haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled:
For if the old Birde be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
to her young one, it muſt
look for leſſe fauour in the Tallant
of the Haukes. Therefore, neuer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21736:37"/>
gather or keepe, in hope of long
life (but onely to obey Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
who <hi>biddeth thee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>)
for as the ſhaddow runneth
from him that followeth it, ſo doth
long life from him that hopeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. <hi>Life</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ioh</hi>) <hi>is giuen to him
that deſireth to dye.</hi> And ſo we leaue
theſe fools, praying God for them,
that they may learne <hi>to unmber
their dayes, and apply their hearts to
Wiſedome.</hi>

            <p>13 We read of another gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Spirituall fooles in the

our Sauiour called Fooles;<note place="margin">Mat. 15, 23</note> 
               <hi>Blinde,
and leaders of the blind,</hi> becauſe they
were in nothing ſo wiſe, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
themſelues, and by obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their owne Traditions, they
made the Law of God of no effect,
auoyding (by corrupt and Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Gloſſes) the plaineſt Text of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21736:37"/>
Gods holy word, ſuch as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in thoſe two Chapters alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth:
how wiſe alſo, are many ruſ
ſet and Ruſticke perſous, to auoide
euery one of Gods Lawes, hauing
knowledge in nothing but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their ſins. Tell them of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
they ſay, the Law reſpecteth
iudgement; Of the Sabaoth, they
ſay, play is not forbidden, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
Of coueting houſe &amp; land,
they ſay, to deſire to buy, is not to
couet; and ſo they condemn God,
and iuſtifie <hi>Ahab.</hi> Sometime they
alledge, that the Goſpell is for the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſometime, the
<hi>Browniſts</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> ſomtime,
they ſnatch at Gods mercy, when
their owne ſinnes are taxed, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
his luſtice; ſometime againe,
Gods iuſtice, when they woulde
haue their enemies plagued, and
diſclaime mercie. Thus, they dare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21736:38"/>
not deny the Scriptures, yet they
will not confeſſe them, but in their
owne ſence. They make no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Prayer, except in the
Church, and there they are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
and a Holy day is more
then a Saboth: If they be inclined
to ſuperſtitious faſting, they haue
Text for that: If to prophane ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking, they haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that. The pride of womens
Garments, in <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> was
il in thoſe times, but now (they ſay)
it is good, (ſo the holy Ghoſt was
blinde, and ſaw not what ſhoulde
ſuite with our times.) The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of Merchants, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of rich men, ſpoken againſt by
<hi>Eſay, Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Michah,</hi> was for

if once we haue deliuered our

ſecurity; and to conclude, twenty
deceits in Wares, in writinges, in
words, are a farre leſſe ſinne, then
to miſſe paiment of a little money
at the day, although it come on the
Morrowe. But I will leaue theſe
Fooles, <hi>Which ſtraine at Gnats, and

his word may be our Wiſedome,
and our minds be ſubiect to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

            <p>We read of a certaine people,

(called <hi>Atlantes</hi>) who dwelling

day ſcorched by the Sunnes heat,
vnto whom it is a Cuſtomary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that ſo long as they feele and
ſee the Sunne, euen all the day long
they do nothing els, but with hand
and mouth, curſe and blaſpheme it
for ſo afflicting them with heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
angry (iniuſtly) with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
light, that comforreth all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
creatures, becauſe in their
owne particular, it giueth them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Theſe are worthy to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
themſelues, who for to doe
them a pleaſure, either would haue
the Sunne to remooue from her
place, or to leaue ſhining. Can
there be in worldly affaires a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
folly? Haue they no wit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue

But to continue in a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

they are <hi>Blackamoores,</hi> and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are not ſo blacke without, as
this folly maketh their ſoules black
within. So are theſe in ſtory, but
how are they reſembled in figure?
Marry againſt thoſe Wretches I
muſt apply it, who for their owne
particular, would remoue the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
the health of vs all; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
the peace of vs all; &amp; Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niing,
the light of vs all: becauſe
for the goſpell, they ſay other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
diſgrace them, and perſecure
them; by the Magiſtrate, they are
ſometime puniſhed, and forced to
right againſt their will: by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they are ouertopped in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and honour; Therefore they
are weary of the Goſpel, as the <hi>Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi>

and they would pul downe Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Colledges, Byſhopprickes,
Cathedralles, and all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Vertue and Vice, leauing no better
men in the ſtate, then Merchants,
Faulkners, Hunters, Riders, and
poore Carters and Seruing-men,
to do their baſe Offices.</p>
            <p>Theſe are verier Fooles then the

whereas, the <hi>Moores</hi> curſe that

Whenſoeuer therefore, you heare
any open their mouths againſt any

of a ſtrange kind of fooliſh people,
called, <hi>Pſylli,</hi> in <hi>Affrica,</hi> who were
of a very low ſtature of bodie, but
of a much lower and meaner wit
and conceipt. For they, hauing a
Citty much annoyed by the <hi>South-winde,</hi>
vpon a ſeaſon, eſpying their
opportunity, in a calme and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
weather, armed themſelues to
go out into the ſandy Sea, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
of ſand, to ſeeke this their
enemy, the <hi>South-winde,</hi> and to bid
it battell, hoping vtterly to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
it, ſo as it might neuer more
blow vpon them: while they ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
too and fro, to ſeeke this their
aduerſary, ſuddainely the Windes
aroſe, and ſo toſſed the ſand vppon
them, that in a ſhort ſpace they
were all ſwallowed vp therewith.
Theſe are worthily punniſhed for
their folly (will euery man ſay) for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21736:41"/>
what can a ſharp ſword do againſt
the cold winde? No more, then to
caſt ſtones; and what ſimplicitie
were it to thinke, that the Winde
were a liuing creature, and had ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bloud or ſpirit to looſe? Or if
it had, that mortal men could meet
or match it? Well, out of theſe
ſands which drowned theſe <hi>Pſylli</hi>
people, are aroſe a generation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as fooliſh as they; Namely,
thoſe which think by carnal means
to ouercome Spirituall daungers.
For, if the ſoule haue no affinitie
with Golde, the one being a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
the other a Spirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
what is there in Magical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment,
as a Fiſhes Liuer, to
driue away a Deuill? And Gold to
ſatisfie for mens ſinnes? the griefe
of Conſcience, cannot be cured by
Muſicke, nor carnal Precepts ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our Spirituall foe. Your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21736:42"/>
daungers are greateſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
truſt in the Lord, who is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and therefore fitteſt to diſpel &amp;
conquer them; but as for King, or
Man, or Horſe, or Speare, or Spel,
or Medicine, they cannot help the
ſoule againſt the Lordes wrath. It
is beſt to yeild our bodies to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
blaſtes, and let the minde bee
compaſſed about with him, whom
Winde and Seas obey. Honeſty
externall, is a neceſſarie Armour
againſt the malice of man, yet our

            <p>16 Thus haue I ſhewed you the
more generall Fooles, now I will
proceede againſt the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and ſpeciall. And in the firſt
place I will ranke the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi>
which taketh but the vaile or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion; letting goe the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21736:42"/>

               <note place="margin">Herod. lib. 1 Eraſmus.</note> Aſſe of <hi>Cuma.</hi> An Aſſe
finding a Lyons skin, to the end to
make himſelfe more terrible to the
fooliſh Citizens, put himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
and then ietted fearefully vp
and downe in the ſame, to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of as many of that Cittie as
ſaw him, euery one thinking him
(indeede to be a Lyon: and when
he had helde them a good time in
that dreadful opinion, at laſt, a
ſtranger came that way, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the general bruite of this
ſtrange Beaſt, was deſirous to ſee
him, and at the very firſt, beholding
his eares, knew him to bee an Aſſe
in a Lyons skin, and went boldly
to him, &amp; before al the multitude
plucked off the Lyons skin, and ſo
diſcouered the Aſſes practiſe. This
(I know) doth very wel ſuite with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21736:43"/>
an Hypocrite, firſt becauſe no wiſe
man will be a counterfaite, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſom ſhalow-witted perſon, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fitly reſembled to an aſſe, apt
to bear both Gods wrath &amp; Mans:
Gods, becauſe hee diſliketh him
that is not ſo good as he ſeemeth:
Mans, becauſe men of this worlde
hate him, that ſeemes to bee good,
although he be not. Now, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
skinne ſignifieth Chriſt, for he
is the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> in
whoſe garments wee are bleſſed of
God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in the
garmentes of his elder Brother.
How glad are ſome men, if for a
ſeaſon they can counterfait godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
(for that is both our Sauiors
coate and skinne) and then they
beguile ſimple people that ſuſpect
no fraude, for they will pray, read,
heare, giue, praiſe Vertue, diſpraiſe
Vice, and what not? So as they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21736:43"/>
may get an eſtimation of piety, to
couer their more odious and ſecret
practiſes. But GOD ſhall ſend a
man, a ſtranger, of more skill and
Wiſedome, to plucke the skin ouer
theſe Hypocrites eares, that all the
worlde may know and deride this
folly, &amp; that they themſelues may
likewiſe vnderſtande, that diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Religion and Piety ſhall haue
her ſhame in this world, and in the
world to come.</p>
            <p>17 Worldly men are alſo very
much troubled with Ignorance, &amp;
want of experience in diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
(I meane matters of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
whereof one <hi>Callicon</hi> (a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

and in his action apt to be derided,
they may take a view of their own
faces. This ſilly fellow being ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and wanting a Pillow or Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to beare vp his head, layed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21736:44"/>
it a Veſſell of glaſſe, which
being very hard, and not tollerable
to his tender head-peece, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that he had hearde that
Feathers make Pillowes ſoft; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
he went and filled it full of
Feathers, and ſo lay downe vpon
it againe, but with no more eaſe
then before. And ſurely (no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile)
for except the out-ſide were
apt to yeeld vpon any preſſure, in
vaine was it ſtuffed with any ſofte
matter. You laugh that hear this, &amp;
who can forbeare to deride ſuch a
folly vpon ſo litle harme. But turne
to your-ſelues (I beſeech you) and
tell me, Who hath the iudgement
to procure quiet ſleepe to his ſoule
when it is weary? Firſt, out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we know that it wanteth reſt,
and out of that knowledge wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to prouide it: but what doe
wee reſt our ſoules heade vppon?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21736:44"/>
Namely, a harde brittle ſhining
heape of ſome worldly pelfe, vpon
which our ſoule can take no more
reſt, then the fooles head vpon the
glaſſe, (for as the Lyon delighteth
not in ſtraw, nor the Horſe in fleſh,
no more doth the ſoule in wealth
of Gold and Siluer.) Then we hear
of another reſt more ſoft then
glaſſe, which is learned or gathered
from the Fowles of Heauen, I
meane the Saints, which bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs the holy worde of God, that
we prouide, and miſplace it in the
the former brittle harde Veſſell of
worldly heapes, and ſo thinke to
ſleepe more eaſily vpon our former
Pillowe, by reaſon of the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtuffing, but all in vaine, for if
the bottle be all hard and faſt ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
we may ſuck the skin off from
our lips, before we draw the Wine
through. Put not new Wine into
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21736:45"/>
old Veſſels, then ſaith our Sauiour,
it will be loſt, and put the ſoft Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Diuine promiſes into the
hard pots of carnall mindes, and
there ſhall be no more reſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But change the mind, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that ſaying; <hi>Bee ye renewed
in your minde,</hi> and then the ſoftnes,
ſweetneſſe, goodneſſe, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
of heauenly promiſes, more
waighty then Feathers ſhall yeelde
eternal reſt to our ſoules.</p>
            <p>18 I wil omit to ſpeak of vaine
feare, which taketh away the wit
of man, the feares of the wicked,
which are cauſeleſſe and eaſeleſſe:
declared in the folly of <hi>Phanax</hi> the
<hi>Graecian,</hi> who euer feared the fal of
the Moone, and did often in a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Prophetically pitty,<note place="margin">Plutarchus.</note> lament the
deſtruction of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> vpon
whom he thought of neceſſity the
Moone muſt fal; but let men feare
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21736:45"/>
their falling into ſinne, and with ſin
into hell, more then the fall of the
Moone vpon the earth, or a deere
yeare, cold Winter, or wet Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Againe, I might ſpeak againſt
that careleſſe ſottiſhneſſe, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ignoraunce of thoſe thinges,
which they daily hear and ſee; like
to one <hi>Amphiſtides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suidas.</note> which woulde

ſurely are thoſe, who wil not buſie
themſelues with Diuine numbers,
and know not certainly God to be
their Father, or the Church to bee

            <p>I will alſo omit, to diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the folly of prophaneſſe in

them. Theſe men are reſembled
vnto vs in that foole, who beeing

fleas, did put out the Candle, to the

foole-ſhip was deceiued, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he found, when hee wanted
light to take them out of his bed.
Euen ſo, they which thinke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
reſt to their ſecret bytings, by
killing the Witneſſes of their
crimes, or extinguiſhing in them
the little care they had of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

alſo want helpe and light to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21736:46"/>
a remedy when they woulde
haue it.</p>
            <p>19 I will conclude all, with
another ſtory,<note place="margin">Ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lib. eod.</note> againſt the prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
folly of worldly men, who
firſt labour for earthly, and then
for heauenly things. I do read of
a Noble mans foole, whoſe labour
was to bring in woode to the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin:
when hee came to the pyle,
hee would alway draw out vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
vpon which the whole pyle
lyeth, and let the vppermoſt alone,
(which had beene more ready) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that hee would do the hardeſt
labour firſt, and then the eaſieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
And by no means could
he be diſſwaded from this courſe,
but would ſpend more time in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out a ſticke, then hee ſhoulde
haue done in carrying in an arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
So are the Children of this
world, they take the moſt and firſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21736:47"/>
paines for inferiour thinges which
lye vndermoſt, and let the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and heauenly thinges, (more
eaſie to willing mindes, which yet
preſſe and keep downe the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things) to be laſt and leaſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
I referre my ſelfe to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
whether I ſpeak not true;
if true, whether you or he are more
fooliſh. Two parts there are in this
Spirituall folly; the firſt, that men
by giuing their firſt labours to the
world, which is vndermoſt, like the
foundation of a Wood-pile, looſe
much time, &amp; the world, or wordly
bleſſings, come more hardly vnto
them. For I muſt euer reſt in my
ſweet Sauiours ſaying,<note place="margin">Mat. 6, 33.</note> 
               <hi>Seeke firſt
the Kingdome of God, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
thereof, and all other things
ſhall be caſt vpon you.</hi> And heauie
things come more eaſily downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
then vpward; therefore the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21736:47"/>
Prophet telleth vs,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <hi>God remembreth

be ſought for in heauen, and then
(as <hi>Agar</hi>) we ſhal haue an Angell
to direct vs to the Fountain of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on the earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another part of this
folly is, that we cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with this foole, but that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
thinges are more eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
of all ſorts, then earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and therefore he which is ſeuen
yeares apprentice to a Trade, and
all little enough; yet an houre in a
Church at a Sermon, is loſſe of
time in Heauenly matters, they
may do it much ſooner. So one of
you, which liueth fifty, ſixtie, or
ſeauenty yeares, and al that time
laboureth in, and for the Worlde,
thinketh it enough for heauen, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21736:48"/>
haue a Miniſter, and a few Prayers
an houre or two before his death.
Theſe are our cares, and our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
upon theſe we paſſe our time,
and venture our ſoules. But (ô

this point three waies. Firſt, I

Secondly, the commendation of
it. Thirdly, the Commodity
thereof.</p>
            <p>3 Touching the neceſsity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
it was the ordinaunce of
God to ſubiect vs all to labour, to
diligent labour; yea, euen to ſweat,
immediately after our firſt parents
fall, and I verily thinke, had they
neuer fallen, yet without diligence
they could not haue liued, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
of all earthly and humaine
affaires requiring the ſame. For by
dulneſſe, ſluggiſhneſſe, and ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
our buſineſſe, our liues la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is intermitted, omitted, and
deſtroyed; neither the worke of
God or man, without vſe, exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diligence can long ſtand.
Al is a Talent, &amp; euery talent muſt
bee vſed (not digged into the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21736:54"/>
ground) which cannot be without
diligence. Thrugh want of exerciſe,
the Armes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
are dulled in the bodye, and
the pureſt and ſharpeſt wittes are
blunted in the minde. We ſee that
the Land miſsing his Tillage, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſmaller and worſer increaſe, &amp;
that which is often turned, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and Ploughed, is the ſurer
ground to the Husbandmans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
The Merchant, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
diligence, often cutteth the
Seas, is much richer then hee that
ſitteth at home, and doth little or
nothing, after one venture or two.
The Iron, of round is not made flat
with one ſtroke of the Smith, but
by often doubling, &amp; redoubling
the ſame. The Colt cannot bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
&amp; fitted for the ſadle, by once
backing and bitting, but by being
euery day in the hand of the rider.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21736:54"/>
When <hi>Lot</hi> went out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> he
muſt doe it with diligence, for hee
muſt be in <hi>Zoar,</hi> before the Sunne
riſing, and he nor they in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
muſt be ſo ydle or careleſſe, as
once to looke backward, and ſo by
diligence he and his Daughters eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
the fire and Brimſtone. By
diligence alſo, we eſcape <hi>Hel. Iacob</hi>
by his diligent ſeruice obtained <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell,</hi>
the Starre in his eyes, the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
of his heart. By diligent and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt
aduenture, did <hi>Dauid</hi> bring
the 200. foreskins of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi>
and wan the Kings Daughter. By
diligence, and not without dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
were the fiue Talents made
ten; and he which had ſo diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made and multiplied them, was
alſo made the Ruler of ten Citties.
I can neuer ſay enough of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
heereof, but this I will ſay,
without diligence the ſinnes and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21736:55"/>

&amp; reflux, by reſtleſſe laboring and
working, is not corrupted, by al the
riuers, carkaſſes, and carrions in the
world, but ſtil it worketh them out;
ſo as it is without infection. Wars
nor peace, omit or intermit dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
for in war it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerueth from

            <p>4 We read that the <hi>Mileſians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

accepted the determination

a more ample reference from the
heades of the ſeuerall factions, to
beſtow the kingdome or principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
vpon whomſoeuer them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

came to <hi>Miletum,</hi> and hearde all
parties, <hi>Pro &amp; con,</hi> what coulde be
ſaide for euerie mans Title. At laſt,
walking abroad, they ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
of the whole Iſland, and
no man minding ſo much as the
Tillage, to procure common food,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21736:56"/>
except one Husbandman, which
then had ſowed his land, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the fury of the ſedition.
This man they called, and before al
the claimers, they proclaimed him
K. as the worthieſt member of his
Countrey, prouiding for himſelfe,
and the common benefit of other,
when all in a deſperate ydleneſſe
gaue themſelues to ſowing &amp; ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of blood, he in a diligent hand
of prouidence, attended the ſowing
of Corne and graine, for the filling
of his Countrey with ſtore againe.
And ſo all vpon a little debate, yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him, and praiſed the <hi>Parei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
election. Euen ſo is it with the
diligent, their hand muſt bear rule,

not in the labours of men, are in
the labours of Deuils. When I
looke vp to heauen, I ſee, and find,
that without diligent Prayer, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reading, meditating, &amp; godly
continued conuerſation to the end,
wee ſhall neuer come thither; Oh,
therefore bee diligent, it is for a
Crowne, it will quite the paines, it
will pay the labour richly. If I look
vpon the earth, the Husbandman
hath foure ſeaſons, which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
he is rewarded with plentie,
and with neglecting, hee is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Beggery. Bee diligent,
for God doth ſpeed the Plough. If
I looke on learning, and learned
men, I finde that diligence maketh
their nights ſhort, their daies long,
their dyet thin, their bread courſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21736:57"/>
cording to that of the Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Mùlta tulit fecitque puer ſudauit &amp; alſit</l>
                  <l>Abstinuit vino &amp; venere qui pythia cantat.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Many and many are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of the Student; ſometimes
hee ſweateth; ſometimes, hee
freezeth; and the ſonges of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Oracles make him forbeare
both drunkenneſſe and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Be diligent therefore, for ſo,
meane men haue attained King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
Husband-men, riches;
Schollers, Dignities; and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes,
Honours; and without
this diligence, God wil not beſtow
his bleſſing. And thus much for
the neceſsity of diligence.</p>
            <p>6 The ſecond thing I noted of
<hi>Diligence,</hi> is the praiſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
thereof, for this alone
was neuer diſpraiſed. The Turkes
diſpraiſe Learning; ſome Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
ſome Fortitude, ſome Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21736:57"/>
ſome Religion, but all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Diligence. <hi>Salomon</hi> is as
much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for his diligence,
as for his wiſedome, and when he
ceaſed to be diligent, hee alſo cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be wiſe; and when he renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his diligence, and forſooke his
pleaſures, then hee recouered his
wiſedome. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> inferiour
to no man, in praiſe, in deſert, hath
his Diuine partes commended by
his diligence; firſt, in that hee
neuer ceaſed warning al men night
and day, and ſerued the Lorde in
watching and Prayer: that he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
two thouſand Miles, and in
all that iourney preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
for theſe his many accidentes
in his labour, is (as hee deſerued)
commended of all:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3, 15.</note> yea, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
tearmeth him his beloued Brother
<hi>Paule.</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
ſtory, is memorable for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21736:58"/>
many excellent partes in him, and
eſpecially for that in his baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
hee preached diligently, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
many to Chriſt Ieſus. Hee
that tilleth the ground ſhall haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
(ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi>) We
read of <hi>Furius Creſinus</hi> (a <hi>Roman</hi>)
who hauing euery yeare better
Corne then his Neighbours, they
called him into iudgement for the
ſame, alledging that by inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and witchcraft hee ſpedde ſo
well, and that by ſuch ſecret euill
meanes, hee drew away the fat of
other mens Lande into his owne.
The poore man appeared at the
day, and brought with him all his
Tooles of husbandry; waightye
Plow-ſhares, heauy Mattockes &amp;
Spades, ful fed Oxen, all his yrons
much bigger and ſtronger then
other mens, and laſtly his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a ſtrong and mightie young

woman, who was his helper in all
his Husbandry, &amp; ſetting all theſe
before his accuſers and Iudges, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out in theſe wordes: <hi>Haec ſunt
Quirites veneficia mea.</hi> (ô <hi>Romans</hi>)
this Daughter, theſe Oxen, theſe
Tooles are the Inſtruments of my
Witchcraft, and beſides theſe, I
vſe none, and theſe I apply with
all diligence: whereat his Iudges
being mooued, abſolued him with
commendation. Thus we ſee, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
procureth aboundaunce in
time of want, and fauour in time
of iudgement: who can ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſe or admire her praiſes,
which maketh men ſo praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
both in Court and Countrey.
When all <hi>Iewry</hi> were aſleepe at
our Sauiours birth, who had the
warning and notice thereof from

               <hi>flocke by night;</hi> commended for
nothing but for their diligence, to
them did the Angelles of Heauen
bring tydings of the <hi>Byrth of Chriſt
our Sauiour the ſonne of Dauid.</hi> Loe,
another Commendation of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and a greater cannot bee to
heare the Angels ſpeake, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Souldiers ſing, and to ſee
before all earthly men (next to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi>) the moſt bleſſed
Babe that euer was. Diligence is
obſerued by the heauenly powers,
and rewarded with the happy viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>7 Againe, the continual brand
of infamy and diſgrace, that is ſet
vpon the negligent and ſluggiſh, is
no meane praiſe of diligence and
induſtry, and therefore whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wee read of a ſluggard or ydle
perſon, euen in his greatneſſe he is
taxed for this. <hi>Eſau,</hi> who hauing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21736:59"/>
beene a hunting, came home hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
to ſatisfie his preſent hunger,
ſolde his Birth-right, in his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ſaith S. <hi>Auſten, Malebat eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

then tarry, or go ſeeke meate at an
eaſier rate, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rfore he is branded
with the Title of very fewe: <hi>Eſau
Ihate. Claudius,</hi> after he was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
grew ſo careleſſe and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh,
that he minded nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what he ſaide, nor to whome,
nor among whom hee ſpake. <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi>
another careleſſe King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi>
would play at Cheſſe ſitting
in Iudgement vppon mens liues,
whereby many times wrong iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proceeded out of the Kinges
negligence, and the bloude of an
Innocent was ſhed, which all the
kings of the world, could not make
to liue againe, or giue a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21736:60"/>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger was
wont to ſubſcribe to all Letters or
grauntes that were brought vnto
him: to draw him from this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe,
his Siſter <hi>Palcheria</hi> deuiſed
an edict to be made, whereby hee
baniſhed his wife whom hee loued
moſt dearely. And then ſhe getting
the writing againe after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had ſigned it, brought it vnto
him, blamed him, he denied it, ſhe
produced it, and the ſhame thereof
made him more diligent euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
Thus by negligence are al
other Vertues ſtained, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
giueth grace to all. Learne
(I beſeech you) to be diligent, and
not to breake off your diligence in
any point; and in all your actions,
ioyne labor and Prayer together:
Labour, without Prayer is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
againſt God; Prayer,
without Labour is a temptation of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21736:60"/>
God. Let <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
this for me; before al his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
he euer prayed, except two,
one againſt <hi>Eupator,</hi> and then hee
was ouercome, and loſt the field;
the other, againſt <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides,</hi>
and then he loſt his life. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his praiſes were many, for
valour &amp; fighting, yet his diligence
had not bin ſo fortunate, if he had
not ioyned his Prayers to his
ſword. Be faithfull and diligent in
ſmall thinges, ſo ſhall God make
you rulers ouer many, &amp; he which
is negligent in the ſmalleſt, ſhal not
be truſted with greater. I cannot
forget, I will not conceale the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ſaying of <hi>Bernard. Seruans doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinam
rarò accuſabit fortunam, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiam

this ſecond part of the praiſes of
diligence.</p>
            <p>8 The third part I propounded
to my ſelfe, are the commodities
of diligence, which are many, and
therefore neither this place, nor
this time will not permit me to ſet
downe either all, or thoſe fewe, ſo
largely, which I wil heere deſcribe.
Firſt, Almighty God, allureth and
draweth on men in all kind of life,
by, and for the hope of reward and
profit. <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, <hi>Moſes</hi> meſſage
to <hi>Pharaoh, Dauids</hi> fighting againſt
<hi>Goliah,</hi> our Sauiour Chriſts paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

ſeuerall rewards and promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to them, ſo hath diligence:
for it cannot be, that the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21736:61"/>
which bleſſeth mankind with
ſo many benefites, but that alſo it
ſhould receiue many commodities
for them. Firſt (<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>The
diligent hand ſhall beare rule;</hi> Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is none of vs all, but ſtill
retaine both an Image of honour,
and an aſpiring to Gouernement,
for God made not vs for ſeruile &amp;
baſe ſlauery, but to beare rule ouer
the creatures of the world. By dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
we haue already ſhewed how
many Emperours and Kings haue
beene aduanced from mean eſtate,
and now I will adde a fewe moe.
The Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from <hi>Lechus</hi> the ſecond, who
was a Husbandman, and by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
demonſtration, taken from
the Plough to bee the Virgin-Queenes
Husband; in remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
whereof, he cauſed his wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſoles or ſhooes to be reſerued
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21736:62"/>
in his Caſtle for all poſteritie to
remember, how, and in what ſort
he came firſt into the Court. All
the worlde knoweth that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppricke
of <hi>Metz</hi> is one of the
greateſt of Chriſtendome, the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
being a Soueraigne, and a
Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> the ſeate which
Princes and great Lordes haue
ſought after for their ſonnes. We
read of one of their woorthieſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
called<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Centur x.</hi> In his Chappell, where none came but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee written, <hi>Villegeſe prioris for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae eſto memor, &amp; qui nunc ſes conſidera.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Villegeſus,</hi> who was
but a Basket-makers ſonne, yet
would hee haue the Badges of his
Fathers occupation to remaine in
his Pallace, aſwell to make other
ſtudious, whereby they might
come to honor, as alſo to put him
in minde of his meane deſcent.</p>
            <p>9 The Graecians ſaide, <hi>Ponos
eucleias Pater,</hi> Labour was the
Father of Honour, for the bleſsing
of God doth ſo follow it, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21736:62"/>
moe are made honourable by
diligence, then by Birth, witneſſe
all the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who raiſed their
Commonwealth, and ſtoode not
vpon termes of blood (although it
be honourable) ſome of them were
fetched from the Plow, ſome from
other meane places; then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
gaue Titles, nowe Titles ſell
Vertues. <hi>Cicero, Fabius, Quintius,</hi>
and other, Witneſſe theſe thinges.
When <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was asked
how hee came to that excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
of ſpeaking, ſo as hee led his
Auditory to what part he pleaſed,
being the glory of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and
an honour to himſelfe, hee gaue
this aunſwere; that by ſpending
more Oyle then Wine, hee came
to that habit of perfect ſpeaking;
Meaning, that he was in his ſtudy,
writing and reading by his Lamp,
when other were at the Tauerne,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21736:63"/>
or in their banquettes eating and
drinking; ſoft beddes, and much
learning are hardly gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
good cheere and painefull
diligence are ſildome matched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
therefore as <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
ſorrowes went before his ioyes, &amp;
<hi>Diues</hi> his ioyes before his ſorrowes,
ſo Humility and Labour go before
honour, and Honour abuſed and
taken before the time, is ſeconded
with ſhame, miſery, and (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture)
hell.</p>
            <p>10 Againe, another commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wee receiue by labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
is the comfort of a good
heart, when we muſt ſit downe in
age, and can worke no longer: for
the night of age commeth, when
we cannot worke, and therefore if
a good Conſcience bee any thing
vnto vs, and we know any thing of
our ſelues, then may we with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21736:63"/>
reprooue the ydleneſſe of
other, and repeate (without boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting)
with glory and praiſe our
owne practiſe: whereby poſterity
and the younger will admire vs,
and praiſe vs, and Noble Spirites,
(whereof there bee ſome in euerie
age) will by our example be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to do the like. But if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in ydleneſſe and ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
what ariſeth in our mindes,
but filthy Luſts, impure thoughts,
abhominable actions, ſuch as wee
read were in the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Be not
deceiued, a little cranny letteth the
winde into the houſe, and a little
leake ouer-turneth and drowneth
a great Ship; euen ſo, a little ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſuffereth Sathans Wind and
Water, to enter into the ſoule to
the eternall perdition thereof.</p>
            <p>11 By all this we may ſee the
commodities of diligence, both as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21736:64"/>
it is in it owne Nature, and as it is
alſo in the contrary. And indeed,
wee may vrge this ſecond a little
further, to the ſhame of Drones,
ſluggards, and ydle perſons; God
doth worthily punniſh them, ſo as
they are not like to other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their
hands and faces ſpotted or ſtained
like the greene ſickneſſe, and their
bellies either blowne vp like <hi>Eglons</hi>
with fat, or (deſerued hunger fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them) lanke and flat downe
like the bladder that is pricked.
Nothing runneth in their minde
but the Torment of labour, from
that they poſt as faſt as <hi>Moſes</hi> from
his rod, when it was turned into a
Serpent, crying out againſt thoſe
that prouoke them, as the Deuils
againſt our Sauiour, <hi>Why art thou
come to torment vs before our time.</hi>
Yea, labour grieueth them ſo
much, as they watch late, becauſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21736:64"/>
they will not put off their clothes,
and lye long in bed, becauſe they
are loath to take the paines to put
them on againe. <hi>The ſluggard</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Salomon) when he turneth himſelfe,
maketh a noyſe like a Cart-wheele:</hi>
Why? Becauſe he is not liquored
with the Oyle of labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he is euer murmuring and
complaining: In Summer, hee
complaines of long dayes, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleth
them away at the Market, or
at the Ale-houſe, or at other mens
ſhoppes, or ſleepeth after euery
Meale, or doth nothing but aske
for newes. He is at defiance with
his owne houſe and Lands, ſo long
as there is a meeting or aſſembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
either at Bowling, Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Drinking, or other vaine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
beeing happy in nothing
ſo much (to his owne conſcience)
as that ſuch company and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21736:65"/>
driueth his buſineſſe out of his
head. After meat, if pleaſure call
him not away, he goeth to ſleepe,
and if the Sabboth come, that hee
muſt bee forced to his Monthly
day, yet ſhall Prayers be firſt halfe
done, and the reſidue he paſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
with deſires that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and like a merry Souldier
whome I knew taken by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and led from Tree to Tree to
be executed, was wont to ſay, that
when he had eſcaped one Tree, he
thought long till he had alſo eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
another.</p>
            <p>12 Well, as riches and honour
are the end of labour &amp; diligence,
ſo is pouerty the end of ydleneſſe,
and ſuch a pouerty as is leſſe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſteale, then to begge, for
his inward guilt of vngodly liberty
taketh away from him the boldnes
to aske for Gods ſake, and biddeth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21736:65"/>
him be his owne Caruer, to want
nothing till he come to the Goale
among his fellowes. But woe bee
to them that bring not vppe their
Children to ſome honeſt and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
labour, they ſpoile them in
their youth, dooing them more
harme for want of ſeauen yeares
Apprentiſhip, then they doe them
good by an hundred pound a year
Land. For <hi>eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh,
and the proſperity of fooles deſtroieth
them.</hi> Wo worth them alſo, that
get, and gaine, and take, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
from other mens labors, not
giuing them good words for their
benefitts, nor euer opening their
mouth for their large allowances,
either in the Church, or at the Bar,
yea, both in the Church, and at
the Barre: ſometimes <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>
coynancy (not ſquinancy) ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
their mouthes, as if their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21736:66"/>
throats were ſore: ſore indeede of
a Peſtilence neuer to bee cured.
Sometimes, poſſeſſed of a dumbe
and deafe deuill, whome they will
not ſuffer to be caſt out, leaſt their
Conſciences ſhould rend them at
his departure. Theſe are they
which giue vnto Phiſitians a groat,
vnto their Counſellers ſmoke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Flatterers a pound, vnto
their Minions &amp; Harlots a talent,
vnto Diuines and Preachers, a
halfepeny of cuſtome.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let vs all beware
of negligence, and not onely crie
out againſt it, as the ſouldiers did
of Warre in the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi>
when one had in the warres ſlaine
his own Father, yet did euery man
continue the warres: and ſo while
we diſlike ydleneſſe, we nouriſh &amp;
maintaine it; but let the Sonne of
God bee your example, not in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21736:66"/>
Miracles, but in his labours, that
when death or he calleth for you,
it may find you working, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Meditating, or hearing, or
Counſelling, or perſwading, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
euill, or but ſaying this will
I do, if the Lord Ieſus giue me life
and leaue, that the fruites of your
labours, like the coat of <hi>Tabitha,</hi>
may remaine when you are

The knowledge of God, is
both the cauſe of louing and inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him: for, How can wee loue
him whom wee know not? And
how can we haue him whome wee
loue not? <hi>The knowledge of God is
the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our ſelues is the fulneſſe of
Charity. If we be ignorant of our
ſelues, that ignoraunce begetteth
Pride, if we be ignorant of God,
that ignorance draweth to <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
for if we know not God, we
cannot hope in him; if wee know
not our ſelues, we cannot be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and then we cannot bee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
By the knowledge of our ſelues
(ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) wee Sowe in
teares, becauſe we feele and ſee to
our ſorrow, the defects of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21736:68"/>
By the knowledge of God,
we reape in ioy; becauſe, we feele
and ſee, and heare, the plenty and
copiouſneſſe of his Redemption:
therefore let vs go forth and carrie
our ſeed weeping, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
with our ſheaues ioying; and
both, for our knowledge, and for
our Humility, neither with the
<hi>Phariſies,</hi> let vs boaſt our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
others, nor with the baſe
multitude, be contented to bee like
others. For, in giuing <hi>Honor</hi> (ſaith
Saint <hi>Paule</hi>) <hi>go one before another;</hi>
that is, the rule of our Humility, to
wiſh with <hi>Martinus Turonenſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Centur. 11.</note> that
all our Vertues could bee concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.<note place="margin">1 cor. 14 31</note>
And again, <hi>Couet the beſt gifts,</hi>
there is the rule of knowledge; the
beſt giftes are the greateſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the greateſt knowledge,
(if it be ſanctified) maketh the beſt
men. Difference of knowledge,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21736:69"/>
maketh difference of men; and as
<hi>Dauids</hi> grace and knowledge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
him in the ſight of God and
<hi>Samuel</hi> before his Brethren (thogh
he were lower in ſtature, and they
taller and more perſonable men:)
euen ſo, God delighteth not in
mens legs, or ſtrength, but in their
heart and ſoules; The Angels are
pictured, not great, but full of
wings, and wee that are in the laſt
part and end of the world, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leſſe in our marriage bed, then
our Fathers in their Cradle, let vs
flye about the worlde, about our
calling, vppe to Heauen, with the
wings of heauenly knowledge.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Salomon</hi> therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
to bee diligent to knowe our
Heards, &amp; take heed to our flocks,
for they ſignifie but one thing.
Whereby hee meaneth, that wee
ſhould informe our ſelues, of al our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21736:69"/>
poſſeſſions, and not onely referre
their care to our Balyffes and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
who many times take more
paines to get our Liueries &amp; Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
then to doe vs ſeruice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.
It is well obſerued, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God hath giuen euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a minde and a ſtate equall, one fit,
or at leaſt fitted for another, and
no man is ſo poore, but his eſtate,
is big enough to occupie his mind,
and ſet that on worke; for a little,
with righteouſneſſe, will keepe an
honeſt man in action. But if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
be abſent, what is then
the condition of ſuch a perſon?
Namely, to buſie himſelfe in other
mens affaires, to talke of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings,
of their ſtocke, of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees,
of their ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and ſeruants, and of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
of Corne and Merchandize, as
if he had ten Characks at ſea, when
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21736:70"/>
he hath neither Money to buy, nor
ware to ſell away. This man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a ſtranger, but at home; kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
euery man, but himſelfe;
ſummes vp all mens reckoninges,
but his owne; is eeuen with all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
till he leaue himſelfe, euen
nothing. From the roote of this
vanity, ariſeth the ydle humour of
ſeeking after newes, in <hi>Italy, Spaine,
Fraunce, Turkey, Morocco,</hi> or the
Low-countries, and wanting good
matter, hee coyneth ſome of his
own; then he poſteth to one Lord
or Ladye, or other great perſon,
(but of meane intelligence) and
there hee venteth the winde in his
braine. Such is the nature of mans
minde (my beloued) as is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of good ground, if you Till &amp;
Sowe it, will it not bring foorth
good fruits? But if you Till it not,
and let it alone vnoccupied, will it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21736:70"/>
not bring forth weedes or Graſſe?
Euen ſo, our mindes ſowed with
knowledge of good diſcipline, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a happy harueſt of honeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
but let alone, and not filled
with ſome better matter, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſtuffed with the wind of vain
humours, lying Tales, credulous
lies, and vnprofitable diſcourſe.
From hence alſo it commeth, that
men haue leiſure to ſowe debate,
by immagining faults, where none
are, and diſcouering imperfections
and follies of other men, which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hid in ſecret, were better buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
forgotten, then remembred.
For what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of it, but ſhame
to our Countreymen, contentions
in the Law, troubling of the ſeates
of Iudgement, hatred and diuiſion
among honeſt families, exhauſting
of Treaſure, and ſetting the ſoule
either wide open (by malice) to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21736:71"/>
the deuill, or cloſed vp, by ſhaking
off grace and ſhame. This is the
fruite of them that are ignorant of
their owne eſtates, and yet be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
diſcerners of other men; &amp;
the beſt is, the world payeth them
well againe. For, if they haue as
many Maiſters, as they haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
euery one payeth him with
hatred, reuilings, and reproaches;
ſo as hee laboureth without fruite,
<hi>Sowing the winde, and reaping the
Whirle-wind,</hi> diſcouereth, without
thankes; ſpeaketh, without credit;
eateth, without welcome; liueth,
without reputation or loue; dieth,
without teares or pitty; ſauing, it
is pitty ſuch wretches treade vpon
Gods deare earth.</p>
            <p>2 But you (beloued) which
either heare this, or heare of this,
binde and buckle your ſelues to
knowledge, if it were poſsible, of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21736:71"/>
euery thing, Art, Trade, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation;
but eſpecially, of your
eſtates, without which, a Chriſtian
is vnlike to God, and ſhameth his
profeſsion, which crediteth other
men, where onely he ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
himſelfe. You haue but two
things in your eſtate to looke into,
your ſoules, and your Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
do in the one as you do in the
other. I read of one <hi>Pomponianus</hi>
a <hi>Mantuan,</hi> that he was in ſecret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for denying the ſoule, and at
laſt (as all ſecret faults ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealed)
it came into the light, and
hee was called into Iudgement for
it. His Iudges demanded of him,
whether hee did belieue hee had a
ſoule or no; hee anſwered Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
hee did not: whereat his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
and accuſers reioyced, his
graue Iudges reproued him ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and gaue ſentence vppon him.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21736:72"/>
The Priſoner meruailed, and told
them they were too haſty, for (ſaid
he) do you belieue you haue ſouls?
Yea, ſaid they al, and accurſe them
that do not. But ſaid he, do you no
more then beleeue it: ſaide they,
that is ſufficient: then ſaith he, <hi>Non
credoſed ſcio.</hi> I do not only belieue
it as a thing abſent; but, <hi>I knowe I
haue a ſoule,</hi> and faith, giues place
to knowledge. So my beloued, do
not onely beleeue you haue Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and Lands, and Friendes, and
Cattle, and goods, and Soules, but
know it: it is better to know, then
to beleeue it. Heauenly thinges I
muſt belieue, till I may know, but
earthly things I muſt know, or elſe
I cannot belieue. I will loue my
Seruaunt for his obedience, but I
will not belieue or truſt him for all
my ſtate. Know your ſelues to be
rich, and doe not onely beleeue it:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21736:72"/>
know your ſelues to be Chriſtians,
and do not onely beleeue it: know
your ſelues to be in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
for if you doe but belieue it,
you are deceiued: Knowe your
ſelues to haue Hope, Faith, and
Charity; report and opinion are
many times falſe. Faith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of life eternal, knowledge
is the perfection and complement.
Faith goeth before, (as Grammar
before other Arts) or as the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
belieueth his Maſter, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
commeth after, and eyther
confuteth or confirmeth the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
precepts.</p>
            <p>4 There be cauſes, there be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
there be contraries to Faith,
all which knowne and diſcerned,
doe no onely confirme Faith, but
tranſport, and transforme it into
knowledge: and true faith will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ceaſe, til it come to knowledge,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21736:73"/>
as true loue is not at quiet, till it
haue the ſeale of Mariage, becauſe
it traineth to experience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
reſteth in knowing. The
triall of many thinges begetteth
Wiſedome, and Wiſedome the
better part of experience, maketh
triall of euill thinges (yet without
ſinne) and keepeth that which is
good. It was the fault of <hi>Hieron</hi>
his wife, that hauing neuer kiſſed
man (except her Husband) thoght
that euery mans breath did ſmel as
ill as her husbandes: whereby her
husband blamed her, and ſhee was
not thought careful inough of him.
Vntill, and vnleſſe we know what
difference is betwixt a <hi>Iewes</hi> faith,
a <hi>Turkes</hi> faith, an <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> faith,
and a true Chriſtian faith: none at
all, in reſpect of the forme, but the
matter, the efficient, and the ende
of beleeuing, which is not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21736:73"/>
without knowledge. I call the
forme of beleeuing, not the eſſence
of a true Faith, which is a worde
impropriated to Diuinity, but the
beeing of faith, in the mindes
Morrall and Naturall Vertues.
Wherefore out of a good doctrine
ariſeth a good faith; not on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and out of good Doctrine
and Faith, a ſound knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
maintaining, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
both.</p>
            <p>This is that knowledge, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>is better then Golde and
Siluer,</hi> and is not therefore to bee
miſliked, becauſe it is not alway
honoured and had in reputation.
<hi>I haue ſeene</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>an
euil vnder the Sunne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>The race is not
alway to the ſwift, the victory to the
ſtrong, nor breade to men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
What then? God himſelfe
is not alway ſo reſpected as hee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21736:74"/>
ought, ſhall not wee therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
him as much, as if al the world
did agnize him? Bread (then which
nothing is more needfull to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde)
yet is not alway reſpected
of wanton and full-fed Children;
ſhall the hungry therefore caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
God forbid, no more let ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Science and Knowledge
looſe her reputation, becauſe ſome
indiſcreete Fooles, haue ſet her in
the laſt, leaſt, and loweſt place.</p>
            <p>5 God himſelfe is a God of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; next to God, men are the
Profeſſors and Students of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for euen the Angels by the
church, are informed in the ſecrets
of our Redemption. A man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledge, hath no God but
himſelf, no heauen but this world,
and in this (through ignoraunce,
of the world to come) they craue a
large improuement of their euill
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21736:74"/>
daies, feeling no other loue, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
or feare, or care, or ſorrowe,
or wounds, or conſcience; For, as
men firſt ſinne, and do not care, by
a long &amp; inueterate cuſtome, they
ſinne, and doe not knowe. From
hence men fall into a Reprobate
minde, hauing no good thing in
them, like Beaſtes they are guided
by appetite, like him that had a
thouſand Cookes, and a thouſand
Faulconers. Reaſon, which ſhould
rule, is made of the Ladye the
Hand-maide, and ſo the yſſue of
their minds is like <hi>Iſmael,</hi> a baſtard,
and a Bondage-generation; from
which ſildom commeth any good.
Religion, the Daughter of God &amp;
the Church, and the firſt borne in
Paradice; yea, in Heauen, is clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vp into ſome ſtinking Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thorough which, paſſeth the
ſincke of all our beaſtly pleaſures,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21736:75"/>
and that which ſhoulde haue the
higheſt, and the moſt honourable
room in our houſe of clay (too baſe
for ſuch a Gheſt) is thruſt behinde
the Stables of great Horſes, the
Mewes of Hawkes, the Porters
lodge, yea the Scullery of the moſt
ſeruile Offices, and where ſhe moſt
loueth to be (like the <hi>Haebrew</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant)
ſhee is boared thorough the
eare, and hath many wronges and
brands of diſgrace; ſtill a Seruant,
that ſhould bee a Commaunder.
Their rule to belieue is their ſence,
except they ſee (with <hi>Thomas</hi>) they
will neuer beleeue, and yet all the
ſences being filled, they are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,
ſo eaſie is it to ſhew the
reaſons of Diuinity, and ſo harde
to perſwade. In error, many (like
our late Apoſtataes) are firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
and then inſtructed, but in
Religion and Faith, after ſo much
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21736:75"/>
as ſence it selfe cryeth hoe, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
can worke no perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as though ſome <hi>Ephialtes</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
their breaſts.</p>
            <p>6 From hence alſo it commeth,
that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is layed vppon
God, becauſe he ſuffered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it, therefore he decreed and
acted it: and whatſoeuer other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
is committed in the worlde, he
muſt be made the Authour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
ſo ſtrangely rangeth ignorance
and want of Knowledge, being not
able to diſcerne betwixt permiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and action, betwixt the action,
and the euill, that like a Birde in a
net, the more it ſtriueth, the faſter
it is hampered, and the higher go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſin. Then Fortune or good
lucke is made their <hi>Goddeſſe,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
whatſoeuer they haue, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to chaunce, or to themſelues;
with the wicked in the Prophet,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21736:76"/>
they <hi>Sacrifice to their net,</hi> or elſe to
their Armes, to their Horſes, to
their experience, to their wit: but
if ſucceſſe faile, and the yſſue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
not the expectation, then
they curſe themſelues, or open
their mouth againſt Heauen, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Fortune, or peraduenture lay
load vpon the Deuil, and wel they
may, for they ride him to Hell, as
a Thiefe in a Cart to the gallowes.
The Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 8, 21.</note> 
               <hi>He which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
ſhall run hether and thether,
and when he is angry, hee ſhall curſe
his Gods, and the Kings.</hi> They giue
ouer praying in ſuch caſes, <hi>Propter

at hij renuntiarunt or ationibus meis.</hi>
For this euill I would pray to the
Gods, but they haue renounced al
my Prayers. That admired <hi>Tacitus</hi>
hath this blaſphemy. <hi>Numquam

people of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer indured
more ſlaughter, whereby it was
prooued, that the Gods are not ſo
watchfull for our health and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
as they bee for our punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reuenge. That wiſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy</hi>
alſo ſpeaking of a doleful ye are;
ſaith, that for Plagues, Famines,
and ſedition, neuer the like befell
them, and if (ſaide hee) forraigne
enemies had not beene wanting,
<hi>Vix ope deorum omnium ſuſtentata
foret Reſp.</hi> ſcarce all the Gods could
haue ſupported our eſtate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth. It is hard, yea almoſt
impoſsible, for men without the
knowledge of God, to ſtand in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
if it be not ſudden, but lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering.
Wicked men are worſt
in long ſorrowes,<note place="margin">Iudg. 15. Dan. 10, 8 Reuel. 1, 17</note> and beſt in ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
good men bee worſt in ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
(as <hi>Manaoh, Daniel,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi>) and beſt in long miſeries, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21736:77"/>
continued calamities. <hi>Titus</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Demy-God</hi> among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
when hee ſaw that hee muſt
dye in his youth, (after he had bin
Emperor but two yeares) he cried
out againſt the heauens for their
ſmall regard of his life. Wicked &amp;
ignorant men (if they haue any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
are like Tygers, who hearing
a Drumme, bite and teare off their
own fleſh; ſo theſe in great terrors
and euils, are at their wittes ende.
When their Conſcience byteth
them, then they ſeeke out falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
more hurtfull then aſſured
perils; Namely, the companie of
good fellowes, and Muſicall merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
as though ſin were ſent to
afflict them, to helpe the Tauerne,
Alchouſe or Minſtrell: but ſo alſo
they bewray their folly and want
of skill, for their laſt recourſe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
GOD, when they haue tryed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21736:77"/>
all other meanes, and then they
neither ſpeed well, nor do well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they doe it late, too late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the wrong end, all is
out of courſe, and loſt; yea, with
their own wiues they commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and poyſon themſelues
with their owne meate. There is
not one Vertue or grace of God,
which they cannot Nicke-name,
nor a fault ſo foule, which they wil
not blaunch ouer with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and if at any time it droppe
into them to heare a Sermon, it is
for the phraſe, or ſome ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
goodneſſe being a ſtranger,
and ſcornefulneſſe an ordinarie
companion with them. They haue
learned nothing of God, but to
ſweare by him, and that raſhly,
falſely, and preſumptuouſly; for to
reprooue them (neuer ſo gently)
for the ſame, is to take a Kid from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21736:78"/>
a Beare, and a Lambe from a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Wolfe by the eares. They
haue no care for their ſoules, no
more then for Beggers by the
High-way, whom they neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to heare, to remember, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
They loue none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and care not vppon whom
they treade, nor whome they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
to bee a foundation to their
riſing. I would they loued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in the Nature of true loue,
for ſuch loue is like the Mothers
loue to her Childe, a loue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
but their loue is like the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
mans loue to his meate, a loue
to conſume. To conclude, from
hence it commeth, that they neuer
thinke of death with patience and
feare it more then hell, becauſe
they are not ſo throughly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of hell, as they be of death, and
in one word, I may deſcribe them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21736:78"/>
by the Pſalme, <hi>The wayes of GOD
they haue not knowne, and there is
no feare of God before their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 Thus, and this haue I ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of knowledge, as it is a vertue
Morrall, and <hi>Theological;</hi> now it is
varied in my Text, by theſe words,
<hi>And take heed to thy Heards,</hi> which
afterwarde are alſo deuided into
Hay, Corne, Cattell, and ſeruants,
that euery one of theſe may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued

gaue reuerence vnto him. Loe, an
excellent dignity of houſ-keeping,

whom the Lord hath ſent into the

Euery Family hath its children, in

wiſe adminiſtration of Houſholde
affaires, as well to keep that which
is already gained, as to gaine that
which is deſired. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would
not haue a Byſhop or Deacon to

of experience, how they had orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

for no man can euer ſerue or rule

Oh, I ſay, what account ſhal
they giue vnto the Lorde, for this
drouſie &amp; Lethargical negligence
in their ſoules caſes. Al their care
is for the ſhoo, none for the foote;
all for the Hat and Feather, none
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21736:83"/>
for the head; all for the Badge on
the ſleeue, none for the Wages in
the purſe; all for the body, that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſoule are both loſt. It is a
comely thing to ſee a ſhip rigged,
and with ſpread ſailes floating on
the Waters, obſeruing alſo, how
one is at the Sterne, another at the
top, and euery man in his place,
(the winds moouing withall) ſo it
will continue in order and ſayle
ſurely; but if either Pilot or Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bee wanting, or other Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Winds wil ſoone rend the
ſayles, and the Shippe ſplit againſt
the rockes: euen ſo, it is a goodly
thing, and a royall, to ſee a Man
ſayling to heauen, hauing vnder,
him the earthly Waters, (though
inconſtant) aboue him the windes
of heauen: if hee want not in him,
Reaſon, vnderſtanding, Religion,
and Grace, which are the Mariners
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21736:84"/>
that row and waft our ſoules to the
eternall kingdom. It is good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to lay hold on this, and not to
forget that, <hi>For what ſhall it aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
a man, to win the whole world,
and looſe his owne ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Now, I returne againe to
the carefull Houſholder, who muſt
looke to euery part of his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it is in my text, Hay, graine,
Catle and Seruants; yea, although
he weare the Crowne. It was an
excellent ſaying of <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> a
King of <hi>Spaine: Principis inane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
niſi habet in aerario,</hi> the name
of a king or Prince is an idle thing,
if he haue not a Treaſury to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. The Crowne is maintained
by diligence, by the Plow, and the
Common-wealth flouriſheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame. I will not, nor may
I meddle with Princes; but I ſay,
that the name of a Houſholder is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21736:84"/>
an ydle thing without a ſtorehouſe
more or leſſe, according to the
proportion of the family more or
leſſe. The kingdome of heauen is
likened to ſuch a ſtore-houſe, out
of which the Lordes Family is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
with things new &amp; old.<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note>
The Lorde hath his Apple Trees,<note place="margin">Cant. 2, 5.</note>
and Orchards, and Sellers, as hee
telleth his Church; to teach vs, that
ſtore is no ſore, but ſorrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by the default therof. When
God himſelfe made the world, he
made man laſt of all, hauing firſt
prouided all other things for him:
as the world roofed with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and floored with the greene
Graſſie earth, ſtored with all fruits,
inceſſantly and ſucceſſiuely grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one after other. The Starres
being his lightes, the Creatures of
all ſorts being Seruantes and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries
to him, the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21736:85"/>
his aſſured friends, waiting on
his ſafety, &amp; euery bird ſinging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody
to his proſperity; ſo did the
great houſholder prouide for man
euen before he was made; ſo hath
he continued his ſtore working hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
<hi>And ſeede time, &amp; harueſt,
cold and heat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 8, 22</note> 
               <hi>Winter &amp; ſummer, day
and night, hath not ceaſed, but ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as long as the earth ſhal endure.</hi>
So muſt wiſe <hi>Houſholders</hi> prouide
aforehand, things honeſt; euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mariage, Meat and houſes, &amp;
clothing, &amp; before children, as the
mother doth the ſwadling cloaths.
That out of the heards he may with
<hi>Abraham</hi> fetch a Lambe or a Kid,
or an Oxe: out of the Paſtry with
<hi>Sara,</hi> fetch the Meale for the bread
of ſtrangers. It is not good to want
ſtore and prouiſion at hande, the
Veniſon is beſt in the Parke, and
the Cattle in our owne, and not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21736:85"/>
in others mens heards. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Iſaac</hi>
would haue Veniſon, becauſe it ran
wilde, <hi>Eſau</hi> was long in taking it,
&amp; ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> came in the meane time
with the tame Kid (a thing in ſtore,
and at hande) and got away the
bleſsing. Euen ſo, when neceſſaries
are then to bee ſought, when they
ſhould be vſed, it preuenteth both
the thankes, and the benefit, and
ſtore bringeth both: for <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon
(though not true) had both
the bleſſing, and the thankes. Store
at hand, is like friendes at hande,
whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A friend at
hand, is better then a Brother a great
way off.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alex. ab Alex.</note> The ancient <hi>Egiptians</hi> were
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to hang or paint at their doors
a <hi>Vulturs</hi> Wing, in token of their

which their Anteceſſors had
gotten by their proweſſe: &amp; theſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21736:86"/>
things (though at the doores) yet
no man durſt remooue or make
away. Thus did they for their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
let vs doe as much for our
houſes and Families, and let not
there bee among vs any that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
not his parents Lands, goods,
Armes, Cattle, and Vertue, that
as we are known by their names,
ſo wee may bee by their Landes,
Honours, Proweſſe, Frugality, &amp;
all other workes of Faith, Hope,
and Charity.</p>
            <p>12. Thus haue I briefly ſpoken
of the Houſholde care to get and
keepe. Now of the laſt part of the
Houſholder, or houſekeeping,
which is his mercy in ſpending, &amp;
liberality in giuing foorth. That
which was firſt called his charge,
<hi>Flocke and Heards,</hi> he now calleth
<hi>his Family and Maidens,</hi> which muſt
be fedde and cloathed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21736:86"/>
is firſt to be noted, that all the
care we haue ſpoken of, is to giue,
to beſtow, to ſpend, to diſtribute,
and feed others. Hee which is the
Seruant of riches, doth keepe, and
get them like a Seruaunt, but hee
which is the Lorde and Maiſter of
them, doth giue and diſpoſe them
like a Maiſter; nothing proueth a
man ſo much the owner of his
wealth, as the vſe and beſtowing
of it; nothing ſheweth him ſo
much a baſe ſeruant of wealth and
riches, as the hoording vppe, and
keeping it cloſe from the ſight of
the world. Now, the ſeruant doth
keepe them, as Seruantes do their
Maiſters goods; and he which is a
Seruant of riches, is not a Seruant
of Ieſus Chriſt. Beware of this
wretched getting of goods to keep
them, &amp; not to ſpend them: God,
Nature, Men, Beaſts, and all good
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21736:87"/>
creatures, confute and denie this.

wealth, giueth all in this worlde;

ſuch earthly pleaſures, haue a bitter

ſhe loueth to multiply,

that are laden with fruit, bear them
but till they are ripe, and then if
they be not taken off, they let them
fall. How glad are the fields when
they are couered <hi>Laetis ſegetibus,</hi>
with ſmiling Graine, and yet they

            <p>17 Let vs therefore keepe our

               <note place="margin">Prou. 22, 2</note> let vs with care and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

all, which ſtandeth in the amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diſtribution of the charge, who
they be that muſt be looked vnto,
who entertained and maintained,

For Chriſt doth thereby decipher

               <note place="margin">Ephe. 5, 25</note>

one ſickneſſe? No, if hee haue a

haue their faults and frailty, and
men are not cleare: <hi>Vnicuique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

therefore ſpare one another, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear

            <p>20 I proceed: Our Parents are

our Parents or their Anteceſſours,
haue any thing which they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
not into their Children, their
honour, fame, goods, or ſtaines,
for their children they haue them,
and in deſpite of reluctance, they
will deſcend vppon them. But let
them nouriſh and cheriſh their
Children, and not their ſinnes, and
let them wiſely take away the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from the ſound; I meane their
childrens vices from their perſons,
or elſe vice will ouercome Parents
and Children. Some make theyr
Children <hi>Ludentes Simias,</hi>

God to bee their Father, and
the Church to be their Mother.</p>
            <p>21 Our Parents are our charge
that are their Children, we ought
