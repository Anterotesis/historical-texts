            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of those uncharitable quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
which have broken forth in
these Latter dayes, amongst <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,</hi>
have been ready to conclude,
That <hi>either</hi> Men have not understood that <hi>thing</hi>
which Religion signifies, <hi>or else</hi> they have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:99437:3"/>
the <hi>Name</hi> of Religion, making it serve to
advance themselves, and promote some world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>designe:</hi> And if they shall consider the power
of unmortified lusts in the hearts of wicked men
<hi>emboldened</hi> by the Advantage of such generall
dissentions, it will not be so great a wonder to
see <hi>many cast off God</hi> and Holinesse, as to see
any keeping the Faith, and <hi>cleaving</hi> unto Christ in
such an houre of <hi>Temptation. One great snare,</hi> that
the Devill hath layed to intangle soules, hath
been, To put them upon it to call every thing
into <hi>Question;</hi> which hath been the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
because such <hi>enquirie</hi> doth pretend to <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi>
and is like that Tree of knowledge, a <hi>Tree</hi>
to bee desired to make one <hi>Wise,</hi> and certainly it
is farre better to be humbly and modestly inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
then Popishly and Sottishly ignorant, for
the <hi>Wise</hi> mans eyes are in his head, but the <hi>Foole</hi>
destroyes himselfe by a strange implicit faith, and
blind obedience: But when a Proud and Deboyst
Spirit shall become one of those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
those haesitating Questionists, how will
he Vaunt and Triumph in his conceits, as if he
had <hi>Posed</hi> and <hi>Non-plust Truth</hi> it selfe: When
such a one is gotten into this strong hold, what
will not his bold confidence <hi>dare</hi> to Question?
<pb facs="tcp:99437:3"/>
And although hee might consider that a <hi>Foole</hi>
may aske more questions then ten <hi>Wise</hi> men
can answer, yet still he persisteth in <hi>vaine</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories;
And such is the disturbance of his
minde occasioned by the pride and wickednesse
of his heart, that lett the most cleare and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Reply</hi> be made to his Demands; yet is Hee
wholly indisposed to receive satisfaction. Thus is
the <hi>poor,</hi> but <hi>proud</hi> and insulting Sceptick, at once
Really the Devils Bondslave, and conceitedly his
owne freeman.</p>
            <p>When I was, by your <hi>Order,</hi> called to this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
service, many things of this kind did presse
in upon me, And the greatest impression that I
could perceive <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> my spirit was, To speake

                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, by the blessing of God,
tend to the Vindication of the Truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from the Malicious, but Frivolous affronts
of Prophane, yet Cunning men; and I could
not finde out a more Direct meanes to this end,
then by an appeale to the Common sense of all
Regenerate soules, which I have done in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
discourse, according to the measure of
the gift received, the effects whereof I heartily
desire may be these two,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For ever to silence that Machiavilian
<pb facs="tcp:99437:4"/>
Blasphemy, that Religion is nothing but a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Engine, and that there is no such thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any where to be found. There are those in
the world, who in a true spiritual sense, have heard
with their eares, and seen with their eyes, and
handled with their hands <hi>of the word of Life;</hi> And
it is to be feared, that those soules, which deny,
that there is any Religion abroad, are wholly
devoid of it within themselves. Religion is not
a <hi>Chimaera</hi> or <hi>Notion,</hi> but a real thing in the hearts
and lives of good men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To stirre up and awaken Professors,
that they rest not satisfied in any Outward forme,
without the inward life and power of Religion.
Oh! Bee not contented to serve in the Oldnesse
of the Letter, but in the Newnesse of the spirit.
Wee have raised such a <hi>Dust</hi> by our Disputes in
lesser matters, and by our espousing such triviall
quarrels, that we have almost lost our Christ, and
alienated our affections from our first Husband.
It is time for us now to call forth that Primitive
spirit of Love and Purity, if by any meanes wee
might remove the Scandal of our contentions, and
exhort one another so much the more, as we see
the day approaching.</p>
            <p>After you had patiently given this Sermon the
<pb facs="tcp:99437:4"/>
Hearing, you were pleased to importune the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
thereof, whereby your selves and others
might the better Perpend, and truly examine what
is therein contained; which request of your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
I could not easily deny, but have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
performed, and do here tender it to your
<hi>Christian Acceptance,</hi> with hopefull confidence,
that seeing for the Truths sake, it found such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
entertainment at your eare, it shall not be
despised at the more severe Tribunal of your <hi>Eye.</hi>
Now, that good spirit of Jesus Christ open
the eyes of your mindes, that you may see and
approve things that are excellent, and perswade
your hearts to receive the Truth in the Love of
it, and direct your steps to walke in the paths
of Mercy and Truth, that you may be Saved.</p>

between light and darkness, between good
and evill,<note place="margin">Truth and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at enmity.</note> and wheresoever <hi>truth</hi> hath had
it's dwelling there <hi>error</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> have
endeavoured to intrude themselves; so
that no sooner was truth <hi>incarnate</hi> in the
Person of our <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> but <hi>Antichrist,</hi> yea <hi>many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs</hi>
did arise and set themselves against it; <hi>sed magna
fuit Veritas &amp; praevalebat, Truth</hi> was <hi>great</hi> and did <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</hi>
But when error and falshood did perceive that
Truth remained <hi>invulnerable</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ,
they betake themselves to his <hi>posterity,</hi> and the seed of
the Serpent doth conflict and try it out with the seed of
the Woman; yet still the victory hath been given on
the Saints side. But such was the malice of Truths great
Adversary, the Prince of darkness, that he would not
onely not lay down the <hi>Tucklers,</hi> but that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to deserve the name of <hi>Apollyon</hi> and <hi>Abaddon,</hi> Hee
hath left no means unattempted, and hath more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
sought out and invented how Hee might yet (if
possible) carry the day against the Truth; and to carry
on his undertaking hath projected <hi>two</hi> ways eminently,
whereby either to <hi>Bannish</hi> Truth wholly out of the
world, or to <hi>stop</hi> her growth and progresse in the world.
The <hi>one</hi> hath been by open <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antichrists double designe.</note> to persecute
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99437:6"/>
the persons of those who have professed themselves to
be Truth's subjects; whereby he might at once make
them weary of their profession, and deter and affright
others from entertaining that Truth which was thus
persecuted in those that did profess it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> way hath been by secret <hi>subtilty</hi> and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Sophistrie</hi> to undermine and imbase the Truth, to
mixe his poyson with Gods wine, whereby Hee might
with less difficulty either <hi>cheat</hi> the Professors, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it, or at least hinder the <hi>Genuine</hi> and naturall <hi>effect</hi>
which <hi>pure</hi> Truth should have upon the mindes of men.
But upon all the glory there hath been a <hi>protection</hi> and
defence, and this <hi>defence</hi> hath been the munition of
Rocks.</p>

<hi>primitive</hi> persecutions, and to relate unto us <hi>ruefull</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the bloody <hi>Massacres</hi> that have been abroad. Who
amongst us is ignorant of those <hi>Smith-field</hi> Butcheries,
and those <hi>whole-burnt-offerings</hi> of holy men, which the
bloody Priests of <hi>Rome</hi> did offer to their <hi>great Idol?</hi>
What shall we say to <hi>this dayes</hi> rehearsall of those <hi>not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi>

those <hi>armies</hi> and insurrections, those <hi>wars</hi> and tumults,
which have threatned as with <hi>open mouth,</hi> to swallow up
and devoure whole Nations, and Common-wealths,
where <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath had his worshippers? Certainly
<hi>nothing</hi> herein is so wonderfull <hi>as this,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath
yet a <hi>Name</hi> in the world, that Hee hath yet a <hi>Name</hi> in
<hi>England.</hi> And that which hath secured Truth and her

may take up that Angelicall <hi>Doxologie,</hi> and say, Blessing,
Honour, Glory and Power, be given to him that sits
upon the Throne, and to the <hi>Lambe</hi> for ever, <hi>amen, Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Secret craft.</note> That there hath been <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>Sophistry</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to steale away Truth from the professors of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more clear and manifest. The Scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
expresly, that there <hi>were</hi> false Prophets amongst the
people, and there <hi>shall</hi> false Teachers creep in, who
shall bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord
that bought them. And these <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>Factors</hi> for
Truths Adversary, are either those <hi>Tenebriones &amp; Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugae,</hi>
those Owles and Night birds, who doe <hi>secretly</hi>
blaspheam the Truth, but dare not come into the <hi>Light,</hi>
lest their workes of <hi>darkness</hi> should be <hi>revealed</hi> and made
manifest. Or else they are those whom the Father calls
<hi>Meridiani Daemones,</hi> those noon-day Devils, who with
an <hi>impudent</hi> forehead dare set themselves to cry downe,
and with most Devillish confidence to oppose that
Truth which <hi>must</hi> prevail and conquer. And these may
be those <hi>white</hi> Devils that would appear in the shape of
Angels of Light, whilst indeed secretly and inwardly
they are nothing else but <hi>Feinds</hi> of Darknesse. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>all these</hi> hath our Lord Jesus secured his Church
and people; and hath brought off his Truth <hi>without</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99437:7"/>
loss or prejudice; and that by the powerfull working
of his own <hi>Spirit</hi> living in the hearts of holy men. Now
as we have cause every way to <hi>bless</hi> God for Truths safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so from a godly <hi>jealousie</hi> and holy fear we may <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
and call upon the Professors of Truth, that they
be not led away with the <hi>error</hi> of the wicked, or ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the <hi>craft</hi> and subtilty of <hi>Antichristian</hi> seducers;
And this was the <hi>occasion</hi> of that <hi>discourse</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
falls upon in this Chapter, as may be gathered
from the 26. <hi>Verse, These things have I written unto you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them that seduce you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>aged</hi> Apostle in the <hi>beginning</hi> of his discourse<note place="margin">The Context.</note>
doth well consult the <hi>condition</hi> of Believers to whom
this Epistle should come, and writes unto them as unto
<hi>little Children.</hi> In Vers. 18. <hi>Little children,</hi> you, whose
<hi>attainment</hi> it is to know the <hi>Father,</hi> even the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him <hi>your</hi> God and Father.
My little Children, It is <hi>Hora novissima,</hi> the last houre,
and therefore you had need to <hi>stirr up</hi> your selves, and
seriously to <hi>consider,</hi> how to save your selves from that
great <hi>inundation</hi> of the <hi>mystery of iniquity,</hi> which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to suppresse the <hi>mystery of Godliness.</hi> My little
Children, It is the last houre, and as you have heard
formerly by those who instructed you in the Truth, that
Antichrist should come, so now <hi>already</hi> there be many
Antichrists, for this is the last time: And the danger is
<hi>greater,</hi> forasmuch as those Antichrists who are abroad
were sometimes <hi>pretenders</hi> to the truth of the Gospell,
sometimes they professed themselves <hi>subject</hi> unto that
Truth, which now they endeavour to <hi>oppose</hi> and vilify.
Yet let me informe you in this, That they <hi>went out</hi> from
us, but they <hi>were not</hi> of us, for if they had been of us, no
doubt, they would have <hi>continued</hi> with us; but they
went out, that it might be made <hi>manifest</hi> they were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99437:7"/>
not all of us. Now after Hee had given this <hi>Alarum</hi> to
Believers, concerning the <hi>approach</hi> of the Antichristian
Adversary; He gives himself and them a <hi>Cordial</hi> and
encouragement in the <hi>words</hi> which I have read, <hi>But ye
have an unction from the Holy one, and yee know all things.</hi>
Which words you may please to look upon as the
<hi>Saints security</hi> in evill times, or the <hi>best protection</hi> of holy
men against the impudent assaults of <hi>Brazen-faced</hi> error,
and <hi>Antichristian</hi> falshood.</p>
            <p>In these words be pleased to observe these three
things.<note place="margin">The Text open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Christ the Holy one.</note> A glorious Title given to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the King
of Saints. He is called the <hi>Holy one. You have an annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Holy one.</hi> The spirits of Antichrist they are
<hi>uncleane</hi> spirits, they are profane, debauched, polluted,
and polluting spirits, but the spirit of our Lord Jesus,
which is in you, proceedeth from one that is <hi>holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
and <hi>separated</hi> from sinners. This is a Title often given
in the old Testament to the <hi>eternall</hi> Majesty, that <hi>increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Being, God himself: And our <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> as the eternall
Son of the everlasting Father, is <hi>dignified</hi> with the same
Title, and called the <hi>Holy</hi> Child, the <hi>Holy</hi> thing, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
one; yea in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. he is called the <hi>sanctum sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
The <hi>great</hi> Saint, or the most holy of all: There the
Angel tells <hi>Daniel</hi> that after seventy weeks there should
be a reconciliation made for iniquity, and everlasting
righteousness brought in, and the <hi>most holy</hi> should be
annointed: that is, our Lord Jesus Christ, the true <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
should come in the flesh and be <hi>inaugurated,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled</hi>
into that great office of an high Priest, which
had been for so many years past <hi>typified</hi> and <hi>shadowed out</hi>
in their Priest that served in the Temple. Now this is
worth our consideration, That if our Lord Jesus, who is
the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence we receive this spirit be so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99437:8"/>
holy and pure, then surely the effects and operations
that this spirit doth produce in those who receive it,
must be holy and pure also. Impurity, uncleanness, and
sinfull defilements <hi>cannot</hi> possibly proceed from so <hi>pure</hi>
a spirit as the spirit of Jesus Christ is, whose Name is,
The Holy one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christs spirit <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> anointing.</note> Another thing considerable in the words is,
An <hi>effusion</hi> of the Holy Ghost from Jesus Christ upon
his people. <hi>Yee have an unction,</hi> or yee have <hi>received</hi> the
anointing. The custome of anointing was anciently u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
either to <hi>separate</hi> and consecrate to an holy use, or to
<hi>install</hi> and inaugurate to some office and service, or to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
with gifts suitable to some notable and eminent
employment. And we finde in the Scriptures, That
the anointing past upon some of their <hi>Prophets,</hi> their
<hi>Priests,</hi> and their <hi>Kings.</hi> It is also further observed, That
in the <hi>second Temple,</hi> the anointing, or the holy oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was <hi>wanting,</hi> which might signifie to the Jews that
then were, that their Ceremoniall Rites were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>waste,</hi> they should therefore long for, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire the <hi>Messiahs</hi> comming, by whom that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
and other things should be <hi>supplyed</hi> and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a more singular and eminent way. Our Lord
Jesus as our <hi>high Priest</hi> was anointed; and from him do
all his people as so many <hi>inferiour Priests,</hi> receive and
participate of that anointing: for as it is observed, the
High Priest of old had most oyle poured upon his head,
and the other Priests were but <hi>sprinkled</hi> with that holy
oyle. So then the meaning of this anointing which is
poured out from Christ upon his people must needs sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a <hi>communication</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> spirit, of the <hi>same</hi> life,
of the <hi>same</hi> grace and nature, that Jesus Christ, as the
chief Priest, was <hi>anointed</hi> withall from the Father:
so that the same disposition and goodness of mind doth
flow out from Christ to a gracious soule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99437:8"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Knowledge the benefit of anointing.</note> Here is the great <hi>benefit</hi> that Believers doe
Receive by this holy anointing, which they have from
the holy one, and that is, That they <hi>know</hi> all things. <hi>You
have an unction from the holy one, and yee know all things.</hi>
There is some difference in the <hi>reading</hi> of these words;
The <hi>Syriack Translator</hi> reads them thus, yee know <hi>all
men;</hi> and in that sence they may refer to that which the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of in 1 <hi>Corint.</hi> 12. 10. where, amongst
the gifts of the spirit, which he reckoneth up, this is
one, namely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>discerning of spirits.</hi>
And the truth is, this great gift of discerning mens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
was more especially given to some then unto others
in the primitive times, and they were able not onely
probably to <hi>conjecture,</hi> but also to give a judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
many with whom they conversed, and did
thereby discover divers <hi>hollow</hi> and <hi>false-hearted</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
<hi>which gift</hi> may, peradventure, though in a <hi>smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
measure and lower degree, <hi>live</hi> even to this day in
the hearts of holy men; for verily, they many times <hi>do
give</hi> a very shrewd conjecture, <hi>not to say</hi> judgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Professors amongst whom they live; but this
they doe with a <hi>sober, modest</hi> and <hi>compassionate</hi> spirit.
As for <hi>profane</hi> monsters, and <hi>notorious</hi> sinners, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is <hi>obvious,</hi> and <hi>easily</hi> to be discerned, by men
whose eyes are in their heads, who are not blinded with
a Bride of favour, or prejudiced with some <hi>fond</hi> and
<hi>passionate</hi> affection. But all the <hi>Greek Copies,</hi> as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
do read the words as we translate them. <hi>Yee know
all things;</hi> that is, all those <hi>maine, necessary, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi>
Truths, which Jesus Christ came to declare, as
from the Father to the World; or yee know all things,
that is, All those <hi>Truths</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> which those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
that now are, or that <hi>great</hi> Antichrist which
shall come, will sett themselves to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>contradict.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99437:9"/>
You, who have this anointing doe most certainly and
assuredly know, and are well established in these <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi>
and <hi>capitall</hi> Truths which you have received by
vertue of this anointing. Thus we have a brief account
of these words presented to us: And the point that I shal
discourse upon, with your Christian patience is this.</p>
            <p>That <hi>the most certaine and assured knowledge of Christian
doctrine is attained unto by a participation of the anointing
of Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. The Anointing best teacheth the Doctrine of Christ.</note> Yee have received such an unction, and
thereby it is that yee know all things. Every man
almost, in these days, thinks himself <hi>well instructed</hi> in
his Profession that hee makes, and in the Articles of
Faith whereunto he declareth himself to bee a servant:
who is there, that doth not judge himself to be as a
<hi>Master of Israel;</hi> well understood in all points of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
who yet, like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> remaineth in the very
darkness of ignorance, as <hi>not knowing</hi> what <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and the new birth might signifie: for we shall finde
that there is no such <hi>certaine</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> way to come
to the knowledge of heavenly Truths, as by Receving
an <hi>unction</hi> from Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iob's</hi> three Friends had spent much time in
arguing and redarguing the case with <hi>Iob, Elihu</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up and speaketh after this manner. I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that dayes should have taught wisedome, aud that
I should have found understanding in the multitude of
<hi>years,</hi> but now I finde, there is a <hi>spirit</hi> in man, and the
inspiration of the Almighty giveth him <hi>understanding;
great</hi> men are not alwayes <hi>wise,</hi> neither doe the Aged
understand judgement; I find a great <hi>difference</hi> between
the judgement that <hi>these men,</hi> though grave seniors,
give concerning <hi>Iob's</hi> case, and the judgement that the
<hi>spirit</hi> of God giveth: The Censure of these men procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the <hi>peevish, angry</hi> spirits of men, but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99437:9"/>
of the divine spirit in this case is according to
Truth.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>notable</hi> Scripture which I shall briefly speak
unto is in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 13, 14. &amp;c. where the Apostle
speaking of this very subject, telleth us of many things:
That which is the <hi>substratum,</hi> the maine business of his
discourse, are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>things of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
then he tels us of a <hi>naturall</hi> man and a <hi>spirituall</hi>
man; then he speaks of the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>minde</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and then Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
all these together, and bringeth forth thus much,
namely, <hi>That the spirit of the world, the spirit of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man,</hi> which is a mundane, worldly spirit, <hi>cannot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the things of the spirit of God, for they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
discerned, and onely they can know them, who
have the <hi>same spirit</hi> living and dwelling in their soules,
which Jesus Christ had dwelling in him having received
it from the Father; Wee have the minde, and spirit
of God, and hereby doe we know the things of the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>That I may the more clearly manifest,<note place="margin">Foure Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> to this <hi>great
Assembly,</hi> what my understanding is in this weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
give me leave to preface foure particulars, which
may prevent mistakes, as if any private or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
designe were aimed at in such a Doctrine as
this.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Rationall man the subject of Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> 
               <hi>Man as a reasonable Creature is the subject of
Christian Doctrine.</hi> Man doth not throw away his mind
and understanding when hee comes to be <hi>proselited</hi> into
the Truths of Christ. When God undertaketh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
a man with heavenly doctrine, hee doth not
deale with him as hee would deale with a <hi>stone</hi> which
he would raise up to be a child to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he
findeth man already endowed with a <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>will,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99437:10"/>
upon which account Hee is <hi>capable</hi> to heare further
from his God. Mans <hi>understanding</hi> is of very good use
in Christian Religion; for by that is man able to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>
much of his sence in heavenly things unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as also to plead for, and by argument to <hi>back</hi>
the Truth received, against the Cavils and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of such as oppose themselves. I must confess free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what I apprehend, That, in the <hi>moment</hi> of a mans <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi>
when the grace of God powerfully ceizeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his spirit to turne him from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan unto God, those <hi>acts</hi> that he
doth then performe, are the most <hi>rationall acts</hi> that ever
he did performe in all his life. The acts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Faith and Selfe-denyall, the act of turning from
sin unto God, which are the acts that appear in the first
motion of the soule unto God, these are <hi>in themselves</hi>
and to <hi>the soule,</hi> most reasonable, equitable, just and
right; yea, in the further <hi>progress</hi> of the grace of God
in mans minde, when it growes up into sanctification
and holiness, the <hi>understanding</hi> of a man doth act and
acteth <hi>understandingly.</hi> The truth is, This minde and
understanding of a man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, as the great
Philosopher calls it, the very <hi>flower</hi> of a mans soule,
which is <hi>not blasted</hi> and withered by the Truths of the
Gospell, but it is thereby <hi>reformed, rectified, repaired</hi> and
<hi>restored</hi> to its primaeve perfection, with great advantage.
So that I think, in a <hi>sober</hi> sence, what the Apostle speaks
of the Law, That it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, a School-Master
to Christ, may be sayd of mans naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and understanding: In which sence one of the
Antients calleth true Philosophy <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, an
inferiour Schoole, or a <hi>fore-teaching</hi> to Christ, as it is
that which renders a man capable and fit to receive the
impressions of a divine spirit: For certainely a man <hi>in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99437:10"/>
his witts,</hi> and not a <hi>mad, distracted</hi> man, is the subject
of Gods grace, of his converting and sanctifying
grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 The written word the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule.</note> The written word of God, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth, is the onely <hi>outward rule</hi> of faith and
manners. This is the <hi>norma fidei &amp; morum;</hi> According
to this rule must every man order his conversation,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 20. To the <hi>Law</hi> and to the <hi>Testimony,</hi> if they
speak not according to this word, it is because they
have not so much as <hi>morning-light</hi> in them. This is the
<hi>royall Standard</hi> of Truth, unto which we must bring all
mens <hi>dogmata,</hi> their assertions, and opinions, which are
<hi>vended</hi> for Truth in the world: Hereby may we <hi>examine,</hi>
and <hi>judge</hi> of all that, which men would obtrude upon
us. I recommend, to evry one that heartes me, the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
studying</hi> of the holy Scriptures, as being the <hi>Oracles</hi>
of God. It was that, for which, the Holy Ghost doth so
highly commend the <hi>Beraean Christians,</hi> That they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the word with all readiness of mind, and <hi>searched</hi>
the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so; and
upon this account they were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, more
noble, as being <hi>better borne, better bred; better educated</hi>
then those of <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> I will onely adde this, That
the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scriptures is but <hi>dead</hi> without a divine
power joyned with it, and a <hi>spirit,</hi> moving mans mind,
<hi>without a word,</hi> is very <hi>questionable</hi> and <hi>dangerous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 The Vnction of the spirit a universall sense.</note> 
               <hi>The Holy Spirit,</hi> which is understood by this
anointing, <hi>is no private spirit, or particular impulse, no
singular perswasion or extraordinary inspiration, but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and universall sense in all regenerate minds.</hi> Holy men
doe all agree, by <hi>common</hi> consent, in those Truths, which
the New Creature doth chiefly resent and rellish. The
Apostle to this purpose useth two expressions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. By <hi>one spirit</hi> are we all baptized
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99437:11"/>
into <hi>one body,</hi> and have been all made to drinke into <hi>one
spirit:</hi> and wee have the <hi>same spirit</hi> of Faith. Where the
Apostle considers the <hi>community</hi> of Christians, under
the <hi>notion</hi> of a body made up of severall members,
which must have <hi>a soule and spirit</hi> to informe, animate,
quicken and enliven it: This is that spirit of Jesus
Christ which doth <hi>live</hi> in the soules of holy men; and
<hi>distinguish</hi> them from the common <hi>Herd</hi> of Infidels and
<hi>Beastly</hi> sinners. Although we may be ignorant of that
which the Philosophers meant by their <hi>Anima mundi;</hi>
the soule of the world, yet me thinks every gracious
heart should easily apprehend what is that spirit and
soule of the regenerate world. But here I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
also, That the <hi>eternall spirit</hi> of God doth sometimes
come downe as from Heaven, and particularly move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a regenerate minde, whereby it doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>blow
off</hi> the ashes and <hi>stir up</hi> those heavenly sparkes, which
lay in the soule as <hi>buried</hi> under some clouds of sadness,
and hereby the <hi>frozen</hi> and <hi>benumined</hi> spirit of a precious
saint doth finde it selfe <hi>thawed</hi> into a vivacious fitness
for any service. This is that which the <hi>spouse</hi> calls for in
<hi>Song 4. 16. Awake O North winde, and come thou South,
blow upon my Garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.</hi>
This discourse, I conceive, may shew us the <hi>difference</hi>
between the <hi>good spirit</hi> of God, which sober minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
withall, and that <hi>fanatick</hi> and <hi>exstatick</hi> spirit,
which vaine men pretend unto, and are deluded with.
<hi>This spirit,</hi> in both the senses that we have spoken of,
may not be condemned as a groundless <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> for
as the learned <hi>Cameron</hi> observes, <hi>Enthusiasmus est, ubi quis
est merum organum, sine omni usurationis &amp; judicij.</hi> Then
is a man acted by such a spirit, when he uttereth Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<hi>without</hi> the use of his <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi>
as sometimes the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old did, who were but as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99437:11"/>
a <hi>trunk</hi> or <hi>instrument</hi> through which the spirit convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
those secrets, which God would declare unto the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 The spirit of Christ lives in his Ordinances.</note> The spirit of Christ signified by this anointing,
is first received in the way of his Ordinances, and is thereby
maintained and carryed on, and doth live with great delight
in the use of those Ordinances where it was first received.</hi> He
who hath received the anointing from the Holy one,
knows <hi>where</hi> he hath received it, and he knowes also,
that the same spirit can <hi>breath</hi> no where so freely, as in
such <hi>holy aire.</hi> The new Creature was <hi>borne</hi> under the
Ordinances of the Gospell, and is <hi>nursed</hi> and brought
up under them. <hi>Faith</hi> came first by <hi>hearing,</hi> and Faith
<hi>groweth</hi> and receiveth strength, being nourished by the
same Doctrine, by which it was at first <hi>planted.</hi> They
who have <hi>heard</hi> and learned of the Father come unto
Christ, and know not whether to goe from him, because
he hath the words of eternall life. The Apostle in 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. calleth the ministration of the Gospel the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the spirit,</hi> as being that by which the soul doth
receive, and grow up in this divine and heavenly life.
Therefore the Author of this Epistle writing to <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ones,</hi> tels them that as they <hi>had heard</hi> so it should be
that Antichrist would come, and that they should <hi>abide</hi>
in the Truth; whereby he doth <hi>commend</hi> them and
their Teachers for their great care and diligence in
<hi>searching out</hi> and receiving the Truth. I need not spend
time in shewing the lawfulness, conveniency, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Gospell Ordinances, such as are, Hearing the
word, prayer, breaking of bread, to shew forth the
Lords death, and the rest which are of the like institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Onely this I would speak by way of <hi>admonition,</hi> as
it is a serious and generall <hi>observation</hi> which holy men
have made, That no sooner do men cast off the use of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99437:12"/>
the Ordinances and appointments of Jesus Christ, but
at the same time they doe <hi>cast off God</hi> and godliness,
and laying the <hi>Reins</hi> upon their own necks, they set the
foot upon the holy Law, running desperately upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mischeif. Thus hath divine <hi>Iustice</hi> branded those
who would not humbly submit to such sacred <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Such is the <hi>Majesty</hi> and Authority of these things,
that almost every man in the use of them doth finde an
<hi>awe</hi> upon his conscience, and feel himselfe <hi>commanded</hi>
into a <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> modesty, a <hi>modest</hi> sobriety and
moderation.</p>

with the divine spirit.</hi> Here began this holy Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Jesus Christ was the <hi>first Receiver</hi> of the Spirit.
The eternall spirit powred forth an <hi>abundance</hi> of this
ointment upon the person of our Lord Jesus, He was
anointed with the oyle of gladness above his Fellowes.
In the ancient anointings, God had appointed certaine
<hi>measures</hi> of this oyl to be spent upon the persons anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>Saul</hi> was anointed with a <hi>Cruise</hi> of oyle, as not like
to continue in the throne long; <hi>David</hi> was anointed
with a horne of oyle, his Kingdome being to remaine
longer; but it pleased the Father that in Jesus Christ
should all fulness dwell, so that in <hi>Isai.</hi> 10. he is called
<hi>The anointing;</hi> and such is the savour of his good oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that his <hi>Name</hi> is as ointment powred forth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe the Virgins love him. The Lord Jesus did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this fulness <hi>for our sakes,</hi> that from it we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and grace for grace. Hee was to be the head of
his Church, <hi>propter eminentiam &amp; influentiam,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for superiority, but also for influence and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99437:12"/>
so that upon this account Hee was first considered
in the business of anointing, that he might be usefull for
conveyance of this spirit to his people. The ointment
poured upon the head of the high Priest, <hi>ran downe</hi>
upon his beard, and to the skirts of his clothing, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a sweet <hi>fragrancie</hi> and <hi>savour</hi> behinde it: so doth
this spirit of our Lord Jesus, flow from him, down to all
his saints, and <hi>perfumes</hi> them with his owne sweetness.
And as the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> when hee went to heaven,
let his <hi>mantle</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> fall upon <hi>Elisha:</hi> so did our
blessed Lord and Saviour, after his <hi>ascention,</hi> send forth
his owne spirit to dwell with his Disciples, as their
solace, and comfort, in his necessary absence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Christ as a second Adam hath his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring.</note> Iesus Christ as a second</hi> Adam <hi>doth begett
Children after his owne Image.</hi> The first <hi>Adam</hi> brought
forth children in his owne likeness, deriving to them
the same naturall spirit which was in himselfe: so
doth the second <hi>Adam</hi> propagate his posterity, and
give unto them his owne spirit which is supernaturall
and heavenly; The <hi>Picture</hi> doth not so exactly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the <hi>face,</hi> as the regenerate soule doth resemble her
everlasting Father. This <hi>Notion</hi> lyeth very obvious in
the 5. of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Where the Apostle discourseth
of the two <hi>Adams</hi> and their two posterities, with their
severall advantages, or prejudices that they received
from their head: As by <hi>one man</hi> sinne entered into the
world, and death by sinne, and death passed upon all,
for asmuch as all have sinned: which words referre to
the whole posterity of the <hi>first Adam:</hi> so by <hi>one man</hi>
came life, by one came forgiveness, by one came such a
universall reparation; that as <hi>in Adam</hi> all dyed, so in
<hi>Christ</hi> all are made alive; all the posterity of the <hi>second
Adam</hi> are as much, yea more advantaged by their Head
Jesus Christ; then all the posterity of the <hi>first Adam</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99437:13"/>
were damnified by his Apostacy, and the influence that
it had upon them. The Lord Jesus findes the children
of the first <hi>Adam</hi> in their naturall capacity, and maketh
them the subjects of his grace, but Hee bringeth forth
upon their minds and spirits a <hi>new creation,</hi> which he
did not finde in them, no not <hi>in semine,</hi> not in the seeds
or root of it: Hee cometh by his spirit to doe some
thing in man, which could not be done by the <hi>sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>improvement</hi> of those <hi>Rudera naturae,</hi> those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
and remainders of <hi>Shipwrackt</hi> nature, for if so,
then what meaneth that <hi>bitter</hi> Cup, what meant that
<hi>pomp</hi> of <hi>bloody sufferings,</hi> which Jesus Christ did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe?
What need was there that he should come en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with <hi>so much</hi> spirit? If <hi>Naturall principles,</hi> which
yet remaine in the broken posterity of the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
could have brought forth that which now is the <hi>great
designe</hi> and undertaking of Christ in the world; Hee
seemeth to have come in the flesh, and to have suffered
such contradction of sinners, and so shamefull, accursed
death upon the Cross upon <hi>too smal</hi> and too <hi>inferiour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>
Doth Jesus Christ, after <hi>all this,</hi> effect no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men, then what the <hi>scattered</hi> peices of decayed nature
being gathered together, could effect upon them? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Brethren,</hi> Hee doth more then so, for hee <hi>begetts</hi>
children unto himselfe as a Father, and <hi>uniteth</hi> members
unto himselfe as an Head, Hee <hi>transplanteth</hi> soules into
an other soyle, and they <hi>live in him,</hi> deriving sap and
spirit from him as from their <hi>better soyle,</hi> their <hi>new Root.</hi>
The Apostle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. doth thus exprese it, My little
children, with whom I travaile in birth, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>untill Christ be formed in you;</hi> that is, until
the <hi>spirit</hi> of our Lord Jesus comes to be that to your
soules, which your soules are unto your bodies; The
reasonable soule in man is the <hi>principle</hi> of life, and that

by which he is denominated to be a man, and <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
from a beast; so doth the spirit of Christ working it

and <hi>disposition</hi> with Jesus Christ, whereby he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
a Christian, and distinguished from other
men. The person of Jesus Christ was that <hi>originall copy,</hi>
according to which all his posterity should be made
conformable. This is that which the Apostle speaks to
in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where Hee saith, As wee have born the image
of the <hi>earthly,</hi> so must we beare the image of the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Adam;</hi> which is not onely to be understood in a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall</hi>
sense, That our bodies in the Resurrection shall
be called out of their dust into the likenesse of Christs

but not the <hi>spirit</hi> of the letter; yet no man hath so clear,

he whose minde is <hi>defecated</hi> and purged from the dreggs
of <hi>worldly lusts,</hi> which are like a <hi>fogg</hi> and <hi>mist</hi> upon the

them, now if there be a <hi>steame</hi> breathed upon the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99437:14"/>
glasse, the Reflection is very little, or none at all; or if
the light, which should convey the species from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the glasse, bee but a <hi>dim twi-light,</hi> a weake and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
light, there is no reflection neither; so it is
with the soules of men, whilst our <hi>worldly</hi> affections,
and <hi>adulterate</hi> love to sinne and wickedness, doe boyle
and bubble up within us, sending up their steames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our minds, the things of God cannot be seen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>greatness</hi> of that beauty and excellency which
is upon them; He that caused the light to shine out of

that light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ; for as the Psalmist speaks <hi>In
tuo lumine lumen videbimus,</hi> in thy light we shall see light.
The holy nature of Jesus Christ is the true <hi>Collyrium,</hi> the
true <hi>eye-salve,</hi> wherby the soul must be cured of its blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and the Apostle speaks in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10 of putting on

onely upon Argument is but doubtfull &amp; vncertain knowledge.</hi>
I conceive, that <hi>Syllogismes</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> are onely for
<hi>this</hi> world, and the things of this world, but not for the
things of God &amp; of the <hi>other</hi> world. The natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher

attains to his naturall knowledge by <hi>observations</hi>

great Philosopher after all his inquiry for knowledge,

himselfe to be ignorant, <hi>Hoc tantum scio quod nihil scio,</hi>
This onely do I know, that I know nothing. But God
hath ordained a <hi>better way</hi> to convey his Truth into our

be, because such an <hi>argument</hi> conveyed it unto us, what
shall become of us and the Truth, when wee meet with
a <hi>subtile sophister</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> Head, who shal frame
an argument against the Truth, <hi>unanswerable</hi> by our
Logick? Where shall a man ever <hi>consist,</hi> if he must live

whom the Gospell of Christ is preached, hath not <hi>an

of some kinde of arguments, who yet may have their

of well dressed arguments. Hee that is but an <hi>Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

He is a Christian at the greatest <hi>uncertainty</hi> in the world:
I must confess, many <hi>Notions</hi> which are obtruded upon

and <hi>sobriety</hi> are highly commendable. Yea, I confesse
further, That the heavenly principles of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be <hi>Back'd</hi> and <hi>strengthned</hi> by rationall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and many times, the soule is constrained by a

he would have us to understand, That all his Disciples,

the <hi>Lapis Lydius,</hi> the Touch-stone of Truth, and
such is the present Touch or Taste that some things do
make upon their spirits, that they doe easily discerne
from whence they come, although they doe not bring
them to an externall Judicatory. The <hi>Divine nature</hi>
whereof we are made partakers, doth put a difference
between that which is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> heavenly, and
that which is onely <hi>counterfeit</hi> stuffe, as the Touchstone
doth between Gold and Copper. It is worthy of our
observation, That every life doth <hi>attract</hi> and <hi>concoct</hi>
that which is suitable to its nature, and the most infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
life hath such a faculty. The <hi>Plants</hi> of the earth
do draw unto themselves that sap and juice which is

things which will maintaine their lives, and turne aside
from that which is <hi>poysonous</hi> and destructive to them, and
what is by them received, they turne, <hi>in succum &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem,</hi>

<hi>honour</hi> and popular applause, doth set himselfe to please
men; Hee that loveth <hi>pleasures,</hi> studieth excess, riot,
wantonness, and dalliance; and all these do finde their
spirits move with a kinde of <hi>naturalness</hi> towards such
things, and take wonderfull contentment in them; so
that as the Apostle speakes, These men are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
Lovers of pleasure, lovers of mony, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then lovers of God. The <hi>spirit of Iesus Christ,</hi> in the
hearts of holy men, doth, with <hi>savour</hi> and <hi>rellish,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the things of God, whilst other men that have but
<hi>common</hi> spirits, cannot take any delight or complacency
in them. Such was the hearty &amp; sincere affection of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, there
was none like him, who did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
take care of their affaires. And it is much more
true of a regenerate heart; for none attaine to such a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99437:16"/>
               <hi>discretion</hi> in heavenly Truths as it selfe attaineth unto,
for unto a man void of such a life, those precious truths
are like the <hi>white of an egge,</hi> without any savour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6 Heavenly knowledge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to Sanctification.</note> The true knowledge of heavenly things encreaseth
according to the measure of Sanctification.</hi> I doe not speak
of knowledge <hi>falsly</hi> so called, as the Apostle some where
termes it, but of <hi>true</hi> knowledge, that is, <hi>inward, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi>
understanding, and this grows up as holines doth
enlarge it self in the soule. The <hi>clearer</hi> the <hi>Glass,</hi> the
more perfect is the <hi>Reflection</hi> that it makes; The more
pure and spotless the soul is, the better doth it receive
and judge of heavenly things. If it be but <hi>Day-break,</hi> or
a <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>duskie</hi> twilight, we have a more doubtfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of things that are before us: but if it growes
to a <hi>morning-light,</hi> and once encreaseth into a <hi>noon-day</hi>
brightness, then have we a more exact and judicious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them. When the soul begins at first to turn unto
God, it hath some taste or smattering of these spirituall
dainties, and it is like that taste, which new-borne babes
have of the milk which they suck from the Brests; but
when the Christian follows on to know the Lord, whose
going forth is prepared as the <hi>morning,</hi> and when he
doth resolvedly, and strongly carry on the work of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
in his heart and life, then doth he come to a
more mature and <hi>ripened judgement</hi> of these things; Hee
was a <hi>child</hi> before, but now he is grown up to a <hi>strong
man</hi> in Christ. The great Apostle tells us, When he
was a child, he thought as a child, Hee understood as a
child, but when he became a man, hee put away child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
things, His apprehensions of truth were but <hi>low</hi> and
<hi>weak,</hi> because his capacity was not great, but now he
looks upon the brighter face of truth with greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
then he did before. Our Lord Jesus tells us
in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17. If any man will <hi>doe</hi> his will, hee shall <hi>know</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99437:17"/>
of the Doctrine whether it be of God. The best way to
know <hi>assuredly</hi> and <hi>impregnably</hi> the truth of those things
which God speaketh in his word, is to <hi>observe</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi>
those things which God enjoynes. The Holy Ghost,
which is the best witnes of Jesus Christ &amp; his Doctrine,
is given to them that obey him, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 32. and these men
do sweetly rest in an assurance of the truth, whilst others
who are of <hi>impure</hi> spirits do <hi>quarrell</hi> and snarle against
it. He that would grow <hi>in the knowledge</hi> of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, let him <hi>grow in grace,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
exhorts in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. One that is newly entered
into the School of Christ, doth finde it a hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
task, to subdue every corruption: The sins of <hi>edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
custome,</hi> and <hi>naturall tendency,</hi> are not easily maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
Hence it comes to pass, that upon any <hi>laps,</hi> or fall
into any particular sin, the soule begins to be haunted
with scrupulosities, doubts, and fears, yea, it doth upon
such occasions fall to question the <hi>truth</hi> of grace, and
the certainty of the Gospel, whereas, in case of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and close walking with God, there be no such
<hi>clouds</hi> arising, but a constant <hi>serenity</hi> upon the face of the
soul. The truth is, all those secret <hi>suspicions,</hi> and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
concerning the certainty of the wayes of Christ, or
of the worke of his grace upon our hearts, doe proceed
from some <hi>guilt</hi> contracted by acts of violence against
the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of the new Creature. Would
you then bee perfect in, and <hi>assured</hi> of the truths of the
Gospel, take the Apostles counsell, <hi>Put yee on the Lord
Iesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the
lusts thereof.</hi>

remaine without pollution by Antichristian falshood. This
anointing which yee have received <hi>abideth</hi> in you, and
as it hath taught you, <hi>yee shall abide</hi> in him; so saith
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99437:17"/>
our Apostle, in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 27. &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. shews the
ground of a souls <hi>establishment</hi> in the truth to be this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unction, this participation of the divine nature from
God, He that <hi>establisheth</hi> us with you in Christ, and hath
<hi>anointed</hi> us, is God. Such a soule can do nothing <hi>against</hi>
the Truth, but <hi>for</hi> the Truth. They who are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into an Orthodox opinion, or article of faith, by an
<hi>humane argument,</hi> may againe be easily cheated of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
by that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, that dice-play of men,
when some <hi>cunning</hi> Antagonist shall <hi>cogg</hi> an argument
which may seem to import a fairer probability. But he,
that hath this <hi>inward</hi> light of the life of <hi>Christ,</hi> as his <hi>guide</hi>
into the knowledge of holy things, is not easily removed
from the Truth, or much affrighted with the terror of
arguments, but shall hold his owne for ever. Children
and fools may exchange their <hi>Gold</hi> for Counters, but the
wise mans eyes are in his head, and he will not part
with his <hi>most precious Faith</hi> upon such easie tearms. This
true knowledge of God, and spirit of Christ in the soul,
is that <hi>immortall</hi> seed, that <hi>eternall</hi> life, which shall never
die; he that hath said, Touch not mine anointed, will
suffer none to lay violent hands upon his tender off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring;
and in case of any <hi>impudent</hi> assault or <hi>bold</hi> affront
offered to his sacred image, it shall appear, That <hi>Hee</hi>
who is in a renewed mind is <hi>greater</hi> then he that is in the
world. This holy anointing, this new creation in the
soule, is a Principle of <hi>recovery</hi> in case of some particular
Apostacy, and may be signified by that <hi>voice behind one,</hi>
which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speakes of, which shall say,
this is the way, walk in it, when he turneth to the right
hand, and when he turneth to the left. Suppose a man
having received this anointing, should, at any time, by a
sodaine temptation, defile himselfe with sin, whereby
his glory is stained, his spirit disquieted, his conscience
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99437:18"/>
wounded, and his peace interrupted, he shall finde such
secret <hi>struglings</hi> and <hi>strivings</hi> within himselfe, that he is
never quiet untill his filthiness be <hi>washt off,</hi> and the new
Creature within him <hi>restored</hi> to former freedom. Upon
this account the spirit of Christ is an holy unction; for as
oyle will not easily <hi>mixe</hi> with other liquors, or <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
with other bodies, so this divine spirit will preserve
it selfe pure, and hate the very <hi>garment</hi> spotted with the
flesh. An holy soule is like a fountain, or well spring
of water, into which there may be thrown dirt and
trash, but the fountain will still be <hi>cleansing</hi> it self, and
<hi>purging out</hi> that filth which was cast into it; the spirit of
Jesus Christ dwelling thus in the soule, will continually
be working out of all darkness, and leading it on from
light to light.</p>
            <p>Thus have we opened the Doctrine unto you, and
made it manifest, That the most <hi>certain</hi> knowledge of
heavenly truths, ariseth from the <hi>anointing</hi> of Christs
spirit within the soule, and not from outward argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The spirit of God doth <hi>convey</hi> these truths into
the soule, The new Creature doth resent them, and this
anointing doth establish the soule in a certain assurance
of them. Now by way of application, give me leave to
speak briefly to some few <hi>Corollaries</hi> or <hi>deductions</hi> which
flow naturally from this <hi>notion</hi> which hath been thus
explained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Use.</hi> The promises of the spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> If the new Creature brought forth in the soul,
by the spirit of regeneration, be that which teacheth the
certain knowledge of Christian Doctrine, Then <hi>here we
may see what is the true meaning of that spirit of Christ, which
he hath so universally promised to bestow upon his people.</hi> The
Old and New Testament is full of promises in this kind.
All thy people shall bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, taught of God; a <hi>new
heart</hi> will I give you, and a <hi>new spirit</hi> will I put within
you, I will put my <hi>spirit</hi> within you, and cause you to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99437:18"/>
walk in my statutes; I will make a <hi>new Covenant</hi> with the
house of <hi>Israel,</hi> I will put <hi>my laws</hi> into their minde, and
<hi>write them</hi> upon their hearts, and they shall not teach
every man his Neighbour, and every man his brother,
saying, Know the Lord, <hi>as if they were ignorant of him, or
unacquainted with him,</hi> for they shall all know mee, from
the least to the greatest, &amp; this spirit, which I will poure
out upon my servants, and mine handmaids, shall lead
them into all Truth. Now all these, and the like glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promises, do signifie unto us that <hi>experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of God and Truth, which is the proper effect of
this Renovation of minde which hath been sett before
us. When the soule is borne againe of that incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seed, and transplanted into our Lord Jesus, as into a
new root, partaking of his sap and spirit, then doth it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to a more cleare understanding of the will of God,
and hath a more perfect savour, and rellish of Christ and
his wayes. This holy Spirit is that true <hi>Shechenah,</hi> that
indwelling of God in the soule, which was antiently
shadowed out by that <hi>cloud of presence,</hi> which sate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Cherubims wings, in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. Then
are we indeed taught of God, when this spirit dwells
within us; then are wee under the fulfilling of these
promises, when we have received the truth, not as it
comes from <hi>Paul,</hi> or as it is delivered by <hi>Apollo,</hi> but the
<hi>Truth as it is in Iesus:</hi> when the spirit of Truth doth
make us to know not the <hi>word</hi> but the <hi>power</hi> of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
the minde of Christ in our mindes, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us from the ways of sin, into the love of God. I do
not here determine what those larger measures, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degrees of this teaching may be, in the latter dayes,
when the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the Lord shall <hi>cover</hi> the earth, as
the waters doe the Sea.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99437:19"/>
in heavenly things be by a spirituall anointing, Then
<hi>proud man must be humbled and bee willing to bee taught by a
divine spirit.</hi> Flesh and blood cannot reveal unto man the
things of the spirit, neither can any man call Jesus the
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, for the <hi>flesh</hi> profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it is the <hi>spirit</hi> that <hi>quickneth,</hi> and these things they
are <hi>spirit,</hi> and they are <hi>life.</hi> All things that Jesus Christ
spake, and did, they were spoken in <hi>parables,</hi> and done
in <hi>parables</hi> to those that are without; that <hi>hearing</hi> they
might hear and <hi>not understand,</hi> and <hi>seeing</hi> they might see
and not <hi>perceive:</hi> but to his Disciples he saith, Unto you
<hi>it is given</hi> to know the mysteries of the Kingdome, unto
you, these things are <hi>revealed</hi> from the Father. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
tells us in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5 That the weapons of our
warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to the
pulling down of those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
those strong holds, and reasonings, those insulting
notions that lift up themselves against Jesus Christ.
After all the <hi>Inquisition</hi> that our carnall reason can
make into the Scriptures of truth, to finde out articles of
faith: we shall still remain <hi>unsatisfied,</hi> and may perceive
that we are still ready secretly to aske the same question
that <hi>Pilate</hi> did, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> Many men doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
think that they throughly understand spirituall
Truths, when, alas! all their knowledge amounteth to
nothing more, then a zealous or passionate <hi>arguing</hi> for
them. The whole Bible to a reasonable man, not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
will be, as that book was which the Prophet
speaks of when it was delivered to the learned to read it,
he returns it, and saith, I cannot, for it is <hi>sealed;</hi> and when
it was delivered into the hands of the unlearned to read
it, he saith, I am not learned. We carry Bibles in our
hands; and say, we study the word of God, wee do well,
but untill we have a spirit from God <hi>teaching</hi> of us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99437:19"/>
and <hi>reforming</hi> us according to the Tenor of that
word, we shall be no great <hi>Proficients</hi> in that knowledge.
Hence it is that in the 19. Vers of the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iude,</hi> one
that hath not the spirit, and one that is sensuall, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to be the same person, <hi>sensuall, not having the
spirit.</hi> The truth is, <hi>vaine</hi> man would be wise, though
he be like a <hi>wilde asses</hi> colt: Men would not onely be
Masters of reason, and naturall knowledge, but would
also have dominion over other mens faith, and would
subdue the spirituall sense of the new Creature to the
<hi>Soveraignty</hi> and supremacy of humane arguments. But
as the Apostle speaks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, where is the wise? where
is the Disputer of this world? hath not God made fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
the wisedome of this world? These men indeed, be
those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, that would seem to be wise; but is it not
with them as the Apostle speaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
are they not
become dark, and vain in their imaginations; yea, doe
they not <hi>cum ratione insanire,</hi> even run madd with that,
which they call their reason, though it be nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a corrupt <hi>enmity</hi> against the <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of Christ. Give me leave to speak freely in this point;
when the <hi>great mysteries</hi> of the Kingdome of Heaven,
such are <hi>Self-denyall, reliance</hi> upon the grace of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the Messiah, <hi>living by Faith</hi> in another, and
deriving strength from Christ through a promise; I say,
when these things and the like are propounded to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
understanding, and un unmortified heart, will it
not say, that you doe <hi>lapides loqui,</hi> speak stones unto it,
and offer that which is too hard to be received? Me
thinks, when I offer such spirituall Truths to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of naturall understanding, which I
call argumentative knowledge, it is as when that which
belongeth to <hi>one sense,</hi> is presented to an other, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99437:20"/>
cannot give a perfect judgement of it. Hee that would
make mee to understand what <hi>Musick</hi> is, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of it, must not bring mee to one that can with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
relate a <hi>story</hi> thereof, and tell me <hi>in words,</hi>
what ravishing Harmony, and rare delights it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
one withall, and then bid me imagine how eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
note exceeded the other; for this is not to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the right string, but he must bring me to a <hi>Consort,</hi>
where mine <hi>eare</hi> may receive a true impression
from such <hi>musicall</hi> delights. It is not enough to <hi>paint</hi>
out the <hi>beauty</hi> of a Rose in the most lively colours, and
set it before mine eyes, but I must <hi>smell</hi> to the rose it
selfe, and thereby come to know the sweetnesse of
it. Wee may thinke to make our selves great <hi>Doctors</hi>
of the Law by a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a forme of <hi>knowledge,</hi>
but thereby we deceive our selves, attaining onely to a
poor and beggarly understanding of the truths therein
contained; for the best way to know them, is to obey
and practise them. He that hath his heart truly <hi>mortified</hi>
to this world, &amp; is <hi>crucified</hi> with Christ, being <hi>made alive</hi>
againe by that spirit of regeneration, Hee alone, doth
attaine to the most quick and lively apprehensions of
those Truths, that are revealed by Christ in his Gospel.</p>

Whatsoever their <hi>parts are,</hi> or their <hi>acquired</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

are very darke and ignorant. Perhaps, this inference, may

did to Christ, Are we blinde also? But I am sure
the Apostle tells us, Hee that hath not the Spirit of
Christ is none of his, and he that is not one of Christs
flock, I doe not know how he should <hi>understand</hi> Christs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99437:20"/>
voice. The prophaner Jews had the <hi>magnalia legis,</hi> the
great things of the Law delivered to them, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
them as a strange thing, for, as the Apostle
speakes, <hi>Moses</hi> hath a <hi>veile</hi> lying upon his face, and when
that people shall be converted unto the Lord, this <hi>veile</hi>
shall be taken away. There is the <hi>flesh</hi> of Christ covering

Christ as it is printed in our Bibles, which doth, like a

that a carnall heart cannot discerne the beauty, or judge
aright of the excellency thereof, so that the preaching
of Christ crucified, is, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99437:21"/>
the <hi>day-star</hi> arising in our hearts, will give us better
light into that more sure word, of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
then all the learned <hi>School-men,</hi> or volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<hi>Commentators,</hi> who have not plowed with Gods

               <note place="margin">4 <hi>Use.</hi> Litterall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> If knowledge of Christian Doctrine must be
received by spirituall anointing, then <hi>to be instructed in
the Letter of the Scriptures, is not enough to make a Christian.</hi>
A man may by naturall understanding, exercised upon
the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Bible, attaine to very great Orthodoxie
in Articles of Faith, and severall points of Religion,
for that which is true in <hi>Divinity,</hi> is true also in <hi>Reason;</hi>
but notwithstanding all this litterall knowledge, his
soule may be like <hi>Pharaohs leane kine,</hi> a <hi>starved</hi> and <hi>ill-favoured</hi>
soule. The generality of men in the world
are <hi>exceedingly mistaken</hi> in this businesse; for they have
thought it to be <hi>Reformation</hi> enough, if they might but
purge their Articles of Faith, and set forth in print that
which might vindicate the truth of <hi>their opinions,</hi> and
wayes, from the prejudice that they lye under in the
World, whereas in the midst of such reformation, men
shall be as <hi>carnall</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> as they were before, they
shall inwardly be as full of <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
and <hi>malice,</hi> of <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> as ever; and they
shall have leave to study mischiefe, and conceive evill
will against their neighbour, notwithstanding all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate
<hi>nicenesse</hi> of a reformed <hi>System.</hi> Brethren, Wee
must not onely reforme our <hi>Bookes,</hi> though that be very
good, but we must reforme our hearts, and our lives;
the <hi>power</hi> of this anointing must eat out the <hi>proud</hi> flesh of
our distempered hearts, and <hi>quicken</hi> us also into a more
<hi>pure</hi> and <hi>refined</hi> spirit. Professors doe thinke they attain
to a <hi>great measure</hi> of heavenly skill, if they are but so well
read in the Bible, as to turne from one Scripture to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99437:21"/>
and compare one place with another, whereby
they may more strongly <hi>back</hi> that opinion which they
would defend, whereas all this while, The Scripture
is a thing without them, and the minde of God is in
their <hi>Bibles,</hi> not in their hearts, but the true Christian
hath the word of God <hi>transcribed</hi> into himself, and can
say in his measure, as Jesus Christ did, I delight to do thy
will, O my God, Yea, thy Law is <hi>within my heart. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napius</hi>
in the life of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> speaking of his Master
<hi>Longinus</hi> sayth, Hee was such an excellent Schollar,
That hee was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Library, a <hi>walking</hi> Studie; all his books were so
well <hi>digested,</hi> and their notions <hi>concocted</hi> in his minde,
that he did (as it were) give <hi>life</hi> &amp; <hi>motion</hi> to his Books,
in a <hi>requitall</hi> for that learning which he had received
from them. He is a Christian to purpose, who hath the
Bible <hi>transpirited</hi> into his minde, who hath digested
the sense of Scripture into practice and <hi>vitall blood.</hi> Hee
is not a Jew which is one <hi>outwardly,</hi> neither is that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
which is outward in the flesh, but he is a
Jew who is one <hi>inwardly,</hi> and Circumcision is that of
the heart, in the spirit, whose <hi>praise</hi> is not of <hi>men</hi> but
of <hi>God.</hi>

               <note place="margin">5 <hi>Use.</hi> Want of anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ground of Apostacy.</note> Doth the Apostle bring in this anointing
of the spirit, as that which secures holy men from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
impostures, then here may wee see <hi>the ground
of those great Apostacies that are abroad.</hi> Doe wee at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time see some <hi>eminent</hi> professor come tumbling
downe like <hi>Lucifer</hi> from the height of his profession,
and <hi>immerd</hi> himselfe in the dung of worldly wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
let us know, the reason is, because he had no
<hi>root in himselfe.</hi> They went out from us; saith our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
for they were not of us, They were <hi>leviter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99437:22"/>
tincti, sed non penitus imbuti,</hi> they have had perhaps
some <hi>sodaine</hi> and <hi>transient</hi> tasts of sweetnesse in the
wayes of God, but never did feed upon them with
savour, nor digest them. They went out from us,
that it might bee manifest that they were not all of us;
There be some men in the world, who have much of
that which we call <hi>light</hi> in their understandings, but
have no <hi>grace</hi> nor <hi>honesty</hi> in their hearts, and it is no
wonder if they turne away from the Truth in a time
of <hi>Temptation,</hi> and day of <hi>Tryall;</hi> it is the <hi>good</hi> ground
that bringeth forth fruit, and it is the honest heart that
stands in a tempest, being well <hi>bottomed</hi> and <hi>grounded</hi>
upon a <hi>Rock.</hi> Hee that is <hi>hurryed</hi> into any profession,
by the <hi>impulse</hi> of his worldly affections, can not be
setled and established in that profession, but must turn
about when those affections give the word; Hee
is like a ship whose sails are open to every gale of
winde, but hath neither <hi>Ballast</hi> nor <hi>Rudder</hi> to keep it
steddy in its motion. Many people thinke themselves
so good <hi>Protestants,</hi> that they should never turn <hi>Papists;</hi>
who yet, I feare, would fall from their owne stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
into the error of the wicked; and casting off the
Protestant Articles, would easily entertaine for Faith
the <hi>dogmata</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> the reason whereof is, Their <hi>souls</hi>
are not <hi>converted</hi> to that Faith which they professe. To
an <hi>unregenerate</hi> man who gives up himselfe to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
All <hi>Religion</hi> is alike, for Religion doth oblige
and command the soule into a diligent obedience
to some Rule, but such an unmortified heart cannot
endure the beautifull bands of a Religious Law. But
where the Gospell of Christ cometh, as it did to the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> not in word onely, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
in power and much full assurance, where the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99437:22"/>
word of Truth is <hi>made manifest,</hi> in mens consciences,
and becometh an <hi>engrafted</hi> word, there we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
with the Apostle, that hee who hath <hi>begun</hi> a
good worke, will <hi>perfect</hi> it unto the coming of Christ.
This I must confesse, That men by the improvement
of their naturall understandings, and by observing the
<hi>Dictates</hi> of naturall conscience, may reforme some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi>
enormities and scandalous vices of their lives,
and proceed further in profession upon account of
some worldly considerations, but from all this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
though improved and carryed on very high,
they may againe revolt, and apostatize, because the
<hi>principles</hi> thereof were <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>politicall,</hi> not <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
and <hi>genuine:</hi> Such men as these are not like <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
whom <hi>Paul</hi> calleth his naturall <hi>sonne</hi> in the Faith,
they are not naturall, but artificiall Christians. But hee
that is, not in <hi>appearance</hi> onely, but in <hi>Truth</hi> also trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the image of Christ, hath the <hi>seed</hi> of God
remaining in him. and <hi>eternall</hi> life implanted, which
shall never wither; Hee shall never drowne himselfe
in sensuality, or fall away from the holinesse of a godly
life, into the filth and basenesse of a <hi>degenerate</hi> spirit.
The Apostle saith, <hi>Oportet esse haereses,</hi> There must bee
haeresies, That they which are approved may be made
manifest. The understanding Merchant knows which
is the <hi>Pearle</hi> of price, when one that is ignorant may
be cheated with a <hi>counterfeit.</hi> This is the excellency
and glory of a spirit taught of God, That when others
fall away from the <hi>Truth</hi> of Doctrine and <hi>integrity</hi> of life,
<hi>that</hi> will still adhere and cleave unto him; when the
whole world shall lye in wickednesse, <hi>that</hi> will preserve
it selfe <hi>unspotted</hi> and <hi>blamelesse,</hi> unto the comming of
Christ. Hence it was that the Martyrs of old, though
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99437:23"/>
they could not dispute, yet they could <hi>dye</hi> for Christ.
Hee that is alive in God, shall not be religious onely
when he hath the <hi>times</hi> with him, for that is easie, the
<hi>dead</hi> fish can swimme <hi>downe</hi> the streame; but when the
wickednesse of the times, and places where hee lives
draweth other men into a dissolute loosenesse, Hee
shall stand like mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and never be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6 <hi>Use.</hi> Deal kindely with the spirit of Christ.</note> If the Spirit of Christ be such a teaching spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby we know him aright, then <hi>it concernes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
regenerate soule to deale kindely with that spirit.</hi> Oh!
Bee very <hi>tender</hi> of the good spirit of Jesus Christ. I
meane not onely that Gentle spirit, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>breaths upon</hi> the Garden of our souls, and makes
the spices thereof flow out and give their sent,
but that spirit of Christ also which is <hi>united</hi> unto
and <hi>implanted</hi> in our Spirits, that <hi>New Creature</hi> which
is formed within us. Oh! Take heed of <hi>grieving, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
or <hi>quenching</hi> this spirit; <hi>Spiritus Sanctus est res de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licata,</hi>
The divine spirit is a very tender thing, Let
none dare to cast water upon it, whereby to <hi>coole</hi> or
<hi>dampe</hi> it, but let it act according to its own natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
It was the great request of <hi>Davids</hi> heart in <hi>Psal.</hi>
51. 11. Cast me not away from thy <hi>presence,</hi> and take
not thy <hi>Holy spirit</hi> from mee. O Lord, whatsoever
thou takest away, doe not take this away: This spirit
is that which puts me upon observance of thy will,
and doth many times <hi>recover</hi> and bring me back again,
when I have forgotten my selfe and thee. Christians!
would you know what you are most of all <hi>beholding</hi> to
in the world? It is the <hi>good spirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of Jesus
Christ; This is the <hi>Life</hi> of your <hi>lives,</hi> and the <hi>soule</hi> of
your <hi>soules;</hi> without this spirit you were but as other
men, yea, you were unto God, but as dead <hi>carkases</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99437:23"/>
stinking <hi>Carryons.</hi> Now if this spirit be our <hi>life,</hi> and if
by <hi>this</hi> men live, Oh! then be kinde and tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; take heed least by any meanes you doe offend
it. Then doth a soule deale <hi>harshly</hi> and <hi>unkindly</hi> with
this spirit, when it <hi>opposeth, resisteth</hi> and endeavoureth
to <hi>stifle</hi> the motions of it, when the <hi>will</hi> of Christ in the
soul is <hi>gain-sayd.</hi> Take heed, Christians, that you be not
so <hi>rude</hi> as to offer violence, and to force this holy spirit;
when that moves you <hi>towards</hi> God, doe not you <hi>turne
away</hi> from God. What the Apostle beggs for <hi>patience,</hi>
I would begg for the <hi>spirit</hi> of Christ, let the Nature,
Spirit, and Life of Christ have its <hi>perfect worke</hi> in you,
let it act according to its owne <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>latitude.</hi>
The Holy Ghost that dwells in you, doth advise you
not onely to be Christians, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> by fits and
starts, so as may serve your owne turnes, but also to be
<hi>enduring,</hi> and <hi>universall</hi> Christians: This divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is not satisfied if you bee onely moved by it in
your <hi>publick Assemblies,</hi> unlesse you be moved by it
also in your <hi>Closets,</hi> your <hi>Shops,</hi> and in all your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi>
for the Spheare of the new Creature, is, a
<hi>sober, righteous, and godly life.</hi> Where this holy Spirit
dwells, it will prompt the soule to something which
is <hi>transcendent,</hi> and above the straine of <hi>vulgar</hi> spirits.
Now suppose I should propound to this <hi>great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
the Question that Christ propounded to his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, what singular thing
doe you more then others? Yea, let me but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it to those who are called the <hi>holy ones</hi> of the
most High, Wherin doe you excell the Spirits of
worldly men? What is there that may speake you
to bee anointed with this Divine Spirit? Are you
not as <hi>Proud,</hi> as <hi>Covetous,</hi> as <hi>vaine</hi> in your conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99437:24"/>
as other men? Oh! Then let me commend this
unto you, as seasonable and wholesome counsell, Take
heed how you use the spirit of Christ which dwelleth
in you, and suffer it to act like it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7 <hi>Use.</hi> A guesse at hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory.</note> and Lastly. If holy soules know heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things by virtue of the anointing from the holy
one, which teacheth so sweetly and clearely, then
<hi>from hence wee may guesse at the glory of Heaven.</hi> Wee
may stand upon this Truth as <hi>Moses</hi> did upon the
top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and from thence view the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
If the dignity of Christian in this world, bee
such as to have his minde enlightned with the pure
spirit of Christ, whereby he knoweth the minde of
God with infallible certainty, then what shall his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bee in the <hi>world to come?</hi> The Scriptures call that
Spirit which Believers receive here, the <hi>Seale,</hi> the
<hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>first-fruits</hi> of that which they shall receive
hereafter. And although this present knowledge
which they have of heavenly Truths, doth so farre
exceed and transcend all the litterall knowledge of
other men; yet the Apostle accounts it <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall</hi>
in <hi>comparison</hi> of that knowledge which hee
expects at the Revelation of Jesus Christ; for in
this mixture of flesh and spirit the soule doth
use <hi>glasses</hi> and <hi>perspectives,</hi> but then it shall see <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
face to face, then shall it know even as it
is knowne. Oh! What infinite <hi>serenity</hi> and surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>brightnesse</hi> shall then incompasse holy soules, when
they shall see all Truth <hi>in him</hi> who is Truth it self?
Here wee may often meet with <hi>vexations</hi> disputes
from <hi>contentious</hi> Spirits, but in Heaven there shall bee
<hi>altum silentium,</hi> a deep silence and everlasting rest, where
our soules shall wade into a <hi>Sea</hi> of light and enter into
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99437:24"/>
a <hi>vast eternity</hi> of Truth. There shall be no spots, nor
blemishes, no doubts nor scruples arising in our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
for it shall bee <hi>all day,</hi> even a day without clouds.
Wee shall never more be troubled with the <hi>importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of busie arguments, there shall bee no room for
the <hi>Disputer</hi> of this world, but the <hi>immaculate</hi> Lamb
our Lord Jesus shall bee the <hi>light</hi> of that new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and he shall <hi>enlighten</hi> our soules with his own
light and glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
