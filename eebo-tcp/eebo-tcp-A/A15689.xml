            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And note that this medicine performeth its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration only by ſweat which is the trueſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way of the entrance upon that cure of the Plague (for the moſt part) and alſo it doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14338:4"/>
he uſually lyeth under, and the roome ought likewiſe to be kept warme with a fire therein, for that cold aire in time of ſweating, is obnoxious and dangerous.</p>

            <p>And whereas other ſtrong medicines commonly worke two wayes at once, namely by ſweat, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by Vomit, whereby they fiercely diſtract the Patient, and produce fearefull accidents, as if death it ſelfe were at hand, by two violent expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions at one time, yea oftentimes by a third, viz. By purging downeward: Alſo this moſt ſafe, and ſweating medicine, performeth as much as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, pleaſantly, and without rigour or nautious offence, as well in the Plague, as alſo in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſes, and namely in the ſmal Pox, where Nature alſo ſtriveth to thruſt out her venemous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <hi>per poros cutis,</hi> or by the ſweat holes of the skin, and that courſe of curing, is of all other the ſafeſt, in a contagious Diſeaſe at the firſt entrance, which then conſiſteth rather of poyſonous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours

vapours then of putrifaction of humours, in which regard the aforeſaid courſe is ſafe, for it is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, yea, and a deſperate one (as I conceive) to purge in the beginning of a contagious diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>FIrſt the patient is to be demanded if he had any ſtoole that day, or the day before, and if yea, all is well for that point; if otherwiſe, and that you find you have time to tarry ſo long (elſe not) let the patient have onely a ſuppoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that may move him once, and when he hath had one ſtoole thereby, proceed without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay to the adminiſtring of the Antidote; for delayes are dangerous in that fierce diſeaſe, and whether the patient at that inſtant be found ſweating, burning, quaking, raving, or in any other diſtemper give it in, and the party that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ought to be in his warme bed fitted with ſufficient coverings before he takes this Medicine in, then let him take it, either mixed with ſome cordiall thing, if he pleaſe, as a little Mithridate, or give it mixed with the pap of an Apple, which will doe as well, and ſo it is eaſieſt taken in by infants (as I ſuppoſe) for it needs no addition at all to adde vertue to it, onely the addition chiefly ſerves to carry or convay the medicine
<pb facs="tcp:14338:5"/>
without waſting into the ſtomach, for that it is a powder ſmall in quantity, and ſubject to waſte.</p>
               <p>Alſo the party that is to take it,<note place="margin">Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to bee provided before the taking.</note> muſt have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand an ordinary poſſet of Ale and milke to the quantity of a quart very warm, which when he hath taken his medicine, ſhortly after let him drink a reaſonable full draught of the ſaid poſſet well war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then lying on the one ſide, which ſide the patient pleaſe, let him be warme covered, head, face and all, leaving full breathing ſcope, and ſo in Gods name let him lye ſtill and ſweat gently, if he can beare it for three or foure houres were beſt, &amp; ever as he thirſteth, let him freely take warme poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet drink, which were beſt to be given him in ſome cruet or ſpout-pot, if ſuch were at hand, that he take no ayre by raiſing himſelfe up in drinking. And when he hath performed his due ſweating, let him be wiped dry and ſhifted, and then give the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſome warme broath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And further by divers experiences the Author hath found, that a patient ſo healed (ſhifting his cloaths) infecteth not an other, although he goe abroad the next day, for by that ſtrong ſweating the venome of the diſeaſe is wholy evaporated and gon, ſo as the next day he may by Gods mercy ſafely goe abroad, but for the day of his ſweating let him keepe within, and give him food competent in a ſparing quantity, ſuch as is of a light digeſtion, and deny him not drinke, ſo that it be ſomwhat warme at the fire only for that day.</p>
               <p>Thus much for thoſe which take the medicine within 24 houres of the firſt complaint. Item un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as the diſeaſe hath taken greater hold of, namely that before the receite of the aforeſaid

Antidote, the patient have outward tumours, ſwellings or Soares, as Botches, Carbuncles, or blaines, not yet broken nor ripe, if hee take the medicine as aforeſaid, and ſweat well upon it, the venome of the ſoares as is ſaid, ſhall, through Gods Mercy, be ſo evapourated by his ſweating, that the ſwellings ſhall decline of themſelves, and not at all come forward, and if any after do break, as being formerly ſupperated, or ripe before the medicine tooke place, they alſo ſhall, as ordinary boyles, eaſily and quickly heale with every meane medicine.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding generally, once ſweating healeth the Patient, yet nevertheleſſe if occaſion bee, hee may ſafely take a ſecond Doſſe, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, yea, and a third without danger; as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe have done, ſo that he may be the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of perfect health; nevertheleſſe if he find his deſire by the firſt, let him not take a ſecond, and if by a ſecond, let him not take a third, for ſweating medicines, too often taken, are obnoxious to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected weeke patient.</p>

or Ague, for a meſſenger, wherfore it were not amiſſe for any that hath young children, eſpecially in times that are contagious and infectious, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with remedies at hand, to fit ſuch an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſt, conſidering the medicine will keep its Vertue for more then ſeven yeeres.</p>
               <p>Moreover, for the manner of the ſweating in the ſmall Pox, let it bee very wearily and gently, and with no more cloathes then will keepe the patients ſweating, and defend them from taking cold, and deny not them warm poſſet-drinke in the time of their ſweating.</p>
               <p>Alſo, when any perſon is deſirous to take the benefit of the aforeſaid medicine, having an Ague, or Feaver, with <hi>paraxiſmes</hi> or fits, let him not take the medicine in the time of the fit, but one full houre as is ſaid, before the fit, or rather more, but if the Feaver be continuall, as often in that fierce diſeaſe of the Plague it is, give it at any time in manner aforeſaid; for if he take it, and his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning change into ſweating, which the medicine u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually produceth, the feare of Death in the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is halfe over.</p>
               <p>And further of a truth, the Author can affirme that he hath cured ſome by the heretofore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antidote, that had the Peſtities, or ſpots of the Plague, vulgarly called Gods tokens, upon them, and they are yet living witneſſes thereof; for which, and all other his exceeding favours in that fearefull diſeaſe, the Almighty God alone be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: And ſo the Author briefly eoncludeth with a Copy of a certificate concerning the Vertue of the before mentioned Antidote, <hi>Aurum Vitae,</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
