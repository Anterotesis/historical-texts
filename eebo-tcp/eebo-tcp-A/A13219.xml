         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

concerning the politicke government, together

much taken notice of in theſe parts of the world
as many other Princes and Potentates; yet may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21437:6"/>
it well appeare that hee is on meane Prince, nor
of ſmall power. His chiefe countrey, and from
which he takes his chiefe denomination, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by ſome <hi>Sueonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<hi>Suevia,</hi> and the people <hi>Swevi;</hi> now there is in

his dominion, not onely this country of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>

and a great part of <hi>Lapland,</hi> beſides ſome
Territories in the dominion of the great Duke
or Knez of <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> or <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> as hereafter ſhall
appeare. This countrey is a very fruitfull ſoyle,
a land flowing with milke and honey; and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
come in great abundance; beſides the
great abundance of mettalls digged out of the
bowells of the earth, and the excellency of the
paſtures of this land, may from hence appeare,
that ſome countrey people of <hi>Holland,</hi> removing
their habitation into <hi>Sweden,</hi> affimed that they
made as much butter of 60. meaſures of milke
there, as they did in <hi>Holland</hi> of a hundred the
like meaſures. This pleaſant countrey is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with innumerable lakes, furniſhed with
moſt daint y fiſhes; &amp; out of theſe ſame lakes do
run and Iſſue out many pleaſant and profitable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21437:7"/>
rivers. This country is in the South parts more
plain &amp; even; but towards the North and VVſt
more mountainous, not without great ſtore of
woods, very uſefull for the fining of thoſe met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
in ſo great abundance digg'd out of many of
thoſe mountaines. The maritane pares not of
<hi>Swethland</hi> onley, but of <hi>Finland</hi> alſo, are for the
moſt part environed with high and ſteepe rocky
hils &amp; Ilands, many of them being ſcarce cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with greene graſſe, and this is the cauſe why
it is ſo hard and difficult a matter for ſtrangers,
without ſome skilfull Pilot of the naturall inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitans,
to ſaile neere their ſhore, and ſtrangers at
their firſt approaching wonder that ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

This people, not onely of late, but even of
old hath been much commended for their great
hoſpitalitie in entertaining ſtrangers;<note place="margin">Their hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</note> the which
as it is common to all theſe Northerne people,
ſo is it moſt conſpicuous in the Swediſh nation,
it being eſteemed there a hainous indignitie to
deny entertainment to ſtrangers and travellers,
there being among them certain particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
concerning this ſame particular.<note place="margin">Robberies ſeldome heard of among this people.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they are of that ſinceritie, of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and ſo far from wronging others, that
this hath cauſed no ſmal admiration to ſtrangers
and travellers paſſing that way; which may in
this appeare; that although there be very great
forreſts found in that countrey, yet ſeldome any
robberies by the high wayes are amongſt them
heard of.</p>
               <p>In-ancient times both the Swediſh and the
Goths had their owne proper letters and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">Gothiſh let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aboliſhed.</note>
howbeit their letters have beene by the
firſt founders of Chriſtianitie in theſe parts quite
aboliſhed, and Latine letters put in their places.
And of this ſome render this reaſon; that among
theſe people were many bookes full of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
heatheniſh ſuperſtition, which ſuperſtition
of theirs they thought would hardly bee quite
rooted out, vnleſſe as well their letters, as books
written with thoſe letters were utterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
But by this meanes it is to bee ſuppoſed,
that we are likewiſe deprived of many ancient
acts and antiquities not unworthy the knowing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21437:20"/>
which are by this meanes buried in eternall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.
And of this prerogative beyond all other
people of Europe (the Grecians excepted) doth
this nation bragge, that they never borrowed
their letters of any other nation. And it is
thought that if their letters and bookes had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
this time continued, they might have conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
for antiquity with the moſt famous hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
either Greeke or Latine. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other nations the Goths were moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
for their opinion concerning the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the ſoule; concerning which opinion,
although there bee left no ancient records; yea
and if there were no teſtimonie of ſtrangers to
witneſſe the ſame; yet may this by many
monuments even untill this day remaining,
plainly appeare, the which are written upon
great grave-ſtones in this ſame ancient, chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of Rumcke letters, as the author ſpeakes, for
in them were commonly added towards the
latter end of the inſcription, theſe words,
<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That is,<note place="margin">The Swediſh much addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the high Dutch ſpeech</note> God helpe the ſoule of ſuch a one.
But as it hath fared with many other ancient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that in continuance of time they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
their ancient language; ſo hath this nation
taſted likewiſe of the ſame alteration &amp; change.
For by reaſon of their commerce and trafficke
with their neighbours the high Dutch, they
have alſo borrowed much of their language, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21437:20"/>
mingled it with their owne, as may, by many
arguments appeare; and the better ſort addict
themſelves to learne this language in perfection.
The like hath alſo befallen many other nations
of the Chriſtian world. The Italian what is it
elſe but a baſtard,<note place="margin">Italian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> compoſed of that pure elegant
Latine ſpoken in <hi>Tullies</hi> time, and the rude lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages

and letters,<note place="margin">Gothe louers of learning.</note> may from hence appeare, that even at

               <p>The Nobilitie is divided into Earles, Barons,<note place="margin">The Nobility Their titles were not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary.</note>
Knights, Squires, and ordinary Gentry. The
Earles were of old called <hi>Ieri,</hi> and were by their
Kings created, as likewiſe Dukes, called <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zogh</hi>
for their ſingular valor &amp; worth; but none
of thoſe titles were hereditary or deſcended to

theſe titles were quite omitted, vntill ſuch time
as <hi>Ericus</hi> 14.<note place="margin">When made hereditary.</note> in imitation of other Kings and
Potentates introduced again theſe titles of Earles
and Barons, and made them hereditary to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
As for Knights they ever were, as now

vpon the atchieving of ſome noble exploits, and
deſcend not to poſterity, unleſſe they ſucceed in

their predeceſſours vertues and valour. As for
the other Gentry, the chiefeſt of them are thoſe

the clergie of higheſt title meddle only with

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21437:22"/>
they are not onely freed from all ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
impoſitions, or other payments whatſoever,
but have alſo a yeerely ſtipend allowed them of
the king, who cauſeth certaine commanders for
this ſame purpoſe appointed (being firſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with all manner of weapons) for certaine
yeares to traine them vp at home, in the meane
time enuring them to endure all manner of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and ſuch toyle and labour as ſould eours
are wonted in war to endure; while in the mean
time the old bands (if need ſo require) be emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in forreine expeditions. And thus if commeth
to paſſe, that although the King carry never ſo
great an army out of the countrey againſt a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
enemy, yet is the kingdome never left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed
of ſufficient defence, ready to ſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions, and by this meanes there is the
leſſe uſe of mercenary ſouldiers, unleſſe upon ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and extraordinary occaſion, as now in this
great and memorable expedition againſt the
<hi>Auſtrian</hi> houſe, and the whole Catholike league.
It need not therefore ſeeme ſtrange, that this
great King hath even in our memories waged
war alone and the ſame time againſt all his three
potent neighbours, the king of Poland, of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,
and the great Prince or Duke of Ruſſia.
For whenſoever his forces are either wearied or
worne out, he is able preſently to exchange
with a new ſupply, who being already inured to
hardſhip and military labor and toile, are able to
undergoe any difficulty whatſoever.</p>

the law of the moſt ancient city Bitia, the which

and very laudable conſtitutions, by
which it was ordained and determined after
what manner the mediterranean cities ſhould
trafficke and trade with the inhabitants and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime,
to the end that each place might bee an
indifferent ſharer in the gaine: and beſides, this
laudable conſtitution was alſo enacted, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21437:23"/>
the benefit, gaine, or riſing of one City ſhould

the abundance of woods, which partly in regard

of the Kingdome of
Sweden.</head>
               <p>IN ancient times each Province of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had it's ſeverall lawes and conſtitutions,
whereof, as it is ſuppoſed, there were divers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
whoſe names, by reaſon of the long tract
of time, are now for the moſt part buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
               <p>And the Veſtrogothian lawes are ſo ancient,
that it is apparant they were made at ſuch times
as the Goths departed out of this kingdome,<note place="margin">Antiquities of the Veſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gothian lawes</note> or
at leaſt ſhortly after: for there is mention made
of the Goths inhabiting Greece and Thracia: to
wit, that none of them ſhould enioy or poſſeſſe
any of their ancient poſſeſſions in their owne
countrey, unleſſe they would returne and dwell
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21437:25"/>
there. And it is apparent that they dwelt there
before the times of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who as
he affirmed, were to be ſhunned and taken heede
of. Beſides, even before the incarnation of our
Lord and Saviour, they were ſuch a terror to the
Romans, that they were by them much hindered
from inlarging their dominion beyond the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius.
Now theſe lawes doe for the moſt part
agree with the lawes of the Viſigoths, ſet down
by <hi>Ifidorus,</hi> although they be farre ſhorter; for
the which cauſe it is not unlike that theſe ſame
lawes of <hi>Iſidrus</hi> were at the firſt collected out of
the conſtitutions of the Veſtrogoths, and after, as
the titles teſtifie enlarged by the kings of the
Viſigoths of Spaine. Out of all theſe Provincial
lawes and other conſtitutions of this kingdome,
did the Biſhops and Senatours thereof above
270 yeares agoe compile this generall law, very
agreeable to the law of nature, and not much
differing from the civill law, but that by this
controverted caſes are far ſpeedilier ended. But
before we ſpeake any thing concerning their
lawes, we will premit ſome generalities. In this
kingdome therefore there are ſeverall principall
colledges or ſocietics,<note place="margin">The whole government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in certaine ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. a Colledges or ſocietie of Iuſtice.</note> which comprehend the
whole government of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is called the Colledge of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
in the which ore three degrees or rankes:
the ſupreame, the middle moſt, and loweſt of all.
In this ſupreame or higheſt ranke or order, are
the noble Senators of the kingdome; in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21437:25"/>
next are ſuch as they call Lagman; and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Nomophy laces, as if we ſhould ſay; Recorders
or Regiſters. In the third ranke or order are the
Iudges of particular cities or townes, being
men of good eſteeme, and of honeſt life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and not unskilfull in the lawes of the
land. In this ſupreame court are iudged cauſes
of the whole kingdome, as well criminall as
ciuill; and to this ſupreame court, the ſubiect
may from any inferiour Court of the kingdome
appeale, whereas they determine and iudge
whether the inferiour court hath iudged right or
no; and from this court there is no appeale, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be to the king himſelfe, in whoſepower
it is either to qualifie the puniſhment, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the offence. Vnder this ſuprame court are
immediatly ſubiected and ſubordinate two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that of criminall cauſes, and that of the
court or chamber.</p>
               <p>The next to this colledge is the colledge of
war,<note place="margin">2 Colledge or ſocietie is that of warre, or court Marſhall.</note> wherein are handled all Martiall or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

               <p>The fourth Colledge or Court is that of the

To his court belong all cauſes concerning treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes

               <p>The fifth and laſt is the Exchequer, or, as the

are received all the revenues belonging to the
crowne, tributes, cuſtomes, ſubſidies, &amp;c. Over

kings armie, and ſo doth hee all the kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
their wages, In a word hee takes all, and
payes all, being accomptable to no body, but to
the king himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the great officers of the kingdome,
the Lord Marſhall is accounted the chiefe,<note place="margin">The Lord Marſhals of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21437:27"/>
to welcome ofrreine Embaſſadours, and
to provide things neceſſary for their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To his office alſo it belongeth to remove
out of the counſell ſuch as belong not thereunto,
and to ſee the Kings decrees, concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of defamation, and puniſhment of death du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in execution. Hee ſupplyes alſo the place

all tumults and diſorders. To him belongeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the overſight of the kings houſhold and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall
ſervants, and to correct the offenders.
And finally, in all publike meetings he beares
the great ſtaffe before the king.</p>
               <p>Next unto him in dignitie is eſteemed the
great Lord Conſtable, the field Marſhall, the
great Sewer, the Lord Chamberlaine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Provinces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmaller parts.</note> this whole kingdome is not onely
divided into ſeverall Province; Duchies, and
Counties, but beſides each Province is againe
ſubdivided into certaine territories or iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
commonly called Haradh, of the which,
ſome containe moe, and ſome fewer pariſhes.
Each Province againe hath its governor or lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
called Landz-herren,<note place="margin">Severall Iudges.</note> or State-haller;
and each territorie or iuriſdiction hath a Iudge
called Leenſman; and beſides, each pariſh
hath a Iudge called Nembdarius, or Nembde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus.
Now all theſe are diſtinct offices, and
ſubordinate one to another, and ſo may the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
appeale from one inferiour court, to a next
ſuperiour in due order and forme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21437:27"/>
The ſupreame governour or magiſtrate of the
Province is called Legifer,<note place="margin">The ſupreame Iudge <hi>Legifer</hi>
                  </note> as it were a law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and iudge, and are eſteemed in dignity next
unto the king, as being his iudges and uice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Now as many as are the Provinces, as
many are there of theſe ſupreame iudges: to
eleven, under whom are againe above 300. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counties,
or particular iuriſdictions; not unlike
the courts of Parliament of France, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of preſidiall courts. But the difference is,
that theſe ſupreame Iudges viſit every yeare a
great part of their Province, untill all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
be viſited, and when they have travelled
the round, they returne againe where they firſt
began (which the French Parliaments doe not)
much after the manner of the Iudges circuits in
this kingdome. And as this courſe is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the remedying of the publike diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the kingdome; ſo is it alſo ſome eaſe to
the ſubiect, theſe iudges demanding the tribute
and taxes by turnes, and not all at once, of ſuch
territories and pariſhes as they viſit, that ſo
the people be not all, burdened at one and the
ſame time.</p>
               <p>It is yet further to be obſerved, that by the
ancient cuſtomes and conſtitutions of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
beſides all theſe aforementioned courts,
there was yet one generall court commanded to
be kept in foure eminent places of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
once or twice a yeere, for determining
and finiſhing ſome caſes, which by the other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21437:28"/>
Iudges had not beene,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudicium praetoriale.</hi>
                  </note> or could not ſo well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.
And this they call <hi>Iudicium Praetoriale,</hi>
which was a meeting of many Iudges together,
where controverſies were duely and ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and ſentence according to equity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
This court was by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth,
father to this now reigning king <hi>Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
ordeined to be kept twice a yeere, once in
Vpſalia, in winter at the time of a great faire
then kept; and the other about Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day
in ſummer. The Iudges were without faile to
appeare at the place appointed in proper perſon
ſixe weekes after the publication of ſuch a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Now whatſoever was in this pretoriall
court determined betwixt party and party, was
to ſtand firme and inviolable for ever without
appeale to any other court whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the king will be ſure,<note place="margin">The Ral or Court Royal.</note> that iuſtice
be duely executed in all his dominions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beſides all theſe former courts, there is yet
another great and ſolemne court ſometimes
kept, called the court Royall or Ral; whereas
either the king in proper perſon, or elſe a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or ſpeciall commiſſioner heares all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
betwixt party and party: and this is a
court of reformation, wherin ſome things which
in other courts have not beene ſo well ordered,
are here reformed and amended. And this court
I take to be much like that ſolemne court ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
kept in the kingdome of Scotland,<note place="margin">Iuſtice heire of Scotland.</note> called
the Iuſtice aire, wherein very ſmall offences
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21437:28"/>
were ſeverely puniſhed. Now the king is ſixe
weekes before the time of ſitting to intimate the
ſame to his ſubiects. And within 14 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whoſoever hath a complaint againſt any, he
muſt cauſe ſummon his adverſary to appeare at
the day and place appointed by the kings letters,
to that purpoſe to bee read in the firſt <hi>Plac it</hi> or
Court; or where there is none kept, then at the
next Pariſh Church. Now if any upon this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſhall refuſe to appeare, the king or his
vicegerent, ſhall notwithſtanding his non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
(unleſſe very iuſt cauſe may bee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
proceed to ſentence againſt him.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning their particular lawes,
ſtatutes, and ordinances, the times and turnes of
their meetings in Courts of Iuſtice, the manner
of chooſing their Iudges, their oaths, and what
by them to be obſerved, as being too long and
tedious for this ſhort tractate, I willingly paſſe
by. But if any be deſirous to know their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſtatute lawes, he may have recourſe to their

and ſet them downe in order. I proceed now to

divers other harbours, eſpecially thoſe of

of ſuch commodities out of high Germany,
as might tend to the ruine of the kingdome: and
therefore the kings maieſty ſuffereth no ſhip to
come from thence, unleſſe they have firſt a paſſe
granted them, ſubſcribed with his maieſties
owne hand; the which the Merchants of Lubeck
often purchaſe at a round rate. And to conclude,
this king is very powerfull by ſea.</p>
               <p>And no leſſe powerfull is he alſo by land:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  </note> for
he is able in a ſhort ſpace from among his owne

reaſon of their frequent conflicts ſometimes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21437:30"/>
with the Dane, ſometimes with the Ruſſian, but
eſpecially with the Polonian, have purchaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelves no ſmall experience in military
affaire, having infinitely improved the valour
and proweſſe derived unto them by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours.</p>
               <p>This king may in a fortnights ſpace call out
twelve legions of well experienced ſouldiers,
(reckoning three thouſand to a legion) and may
carry them whither he liſt out of the kingdome,
yea if it were even to the very Indians, neither
yet is he unfurniſhed of choice, able, and skilfull
horſemen as well in Sweden as in Finland, both
theſe countries being well furniſhed with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
good horſes, the which how farre in bulke
of body inferiour to thoſe of high Germany,<note place="margin">The horſe, not bigge in bulke.</note> and

exceeding ſtrong, being accuſtomed to
hard labour, and eaſily undergoing any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
or toile, and withall contented with any

               <p>The lowneſſe of their ſtature hath beene the

the king of Sweden.</head>
               <p>NOW to maintaine all this great charge of
warre and other expences, there muſt bee
ſome meanes whereby it may bee effected.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes, threefold.</note> For
this purpoſe therfore there are certaine tributes
and cuſtomes yeerely paid into the kings coffers:
and theſe are of three ſorts.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from his mynes.</note> The firſt ſort of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
is that which is raiſed of his mines; out of
the which not onely are digged iron, copper and
lead in great abundance, but even ſilver alſo, of
the which are coined the Swediſh dollors, for
fineneſſe of mettall inferior to no other ſilver
whatſoever. Now ſome of theſe Mynes are
digged at the kings own coſt and charges, and
ſome at the coſt of private perſons.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt the king hath the whole benefit,
and of the latter but the tenth part, as of other
commodities.</p>
               <p>Of two copper Mines onely, at this time the
king receives a very great benefit; and beſides,
by reaſon of this abundance of braſſe and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it commeth to paſſe that hee is ſo well able
to furniſh himſelfe with braſſe Ordnance; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21437:31"/>
that not for his Caſtles and Forts onely, but for
his Ships alſo:<note place="margin">Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of braſſe Ordnance.</note> the ſum whereof is no leſſe then
8000. at the leaſt: and in the Caſtle of Stocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme
alone, there are at leaſt 400. great pieces
of braſſe Ordnance, and more might yet be made
if there were any need. And if the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did not oftentimes conceal ſome mines new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found out, the profit which would ariſe out
of theſe mynes would amount to a farre
greater ſumme.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes &amp; revenues ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing from the fruits of the earth.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The next way by which the kings revenues
are increaſed, is from the fruits of the earth, and
his cuſtomes as well by ſea as by land: for the
king hath the tythes of all manner of graine,
wheate, rye, barly, &amp;c. as alſo of butter &amp; cheeſe
of beaſts, hides, fiſh, and the like; the certainty
of which reuenues although it be not to us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
knowne; yet no queſtion ariſeth it to no
ſmall ſumme, and as is credible, to little leſſe
then 9 or 10. millions ſay their writers but this
muſt be underſtood of their owne coine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
not of Sterline money.</p>
               <p>Now concerning his cuſtomes,<note place="margin">Cuſtomes of all manner of merchandiſe.</note> the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
cuſtome of all wares tranſported out of
the kingdome, or imported into the ſame. And
that there be no want of good ſilver coyne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the kingdome, this order hath beene for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares agoe eſtabliſhed; to wit, that for every
hundreth dollors worth of merchandize tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of the kingdome, they ſhall pay into
the cuſtome-houſe tenne ſilver dollors in kind, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21437:32"/>
elſe tenne ounces of ſilver; for the which they
receiue in preſent pay the worth in other ſmall
copper coine of Swediſh money currant within
the kingdome.</p>
               <p>And for every hundreth dollars worth of
wares ſo tranſported out of the kingdome, the
merchant is tyed to bring into the kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the worth of 90. dollors of ſuch wares as
are uſefull for the kingdome; and for theſe 90.
dollors worth of wares, they are to pay into the
cuſtome-houſe tenne dollors, or tea ounces of
ſilver, of elſe the worth thereof in other money.
And whoſoever ſhall faile in any of the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
for the firſt fault hee ſhall pay 20 Swediſh
markes; and the next time all his wares ſhall be
confiſcate.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes of furres and rich skins.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As for the revenue and cuſtome of rich skins
and furs, it is ſometimes more, and ſometimes
leſſe, according to the intenſeneſſe and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the cold, and the abundance of ſnow.
For the greater is the ſnow, the greater number
of theſe wild beaſts are taken. Out of the country
of Lapland the Northermoſt of all his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the king receives a great number of theſe
skins or rich furs. And to the end he be not couz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he ſendeth thither euery yeare an officer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a clerke, who ſo narrowly inquireth into the
number of theſe beaſts ſo killed, that very hardly
can he be deceived.</p>
               <p>Theſe rich furs the king diſpoſeth of among
his kindred and friends; and ſometimes alſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21437:32"/>
hee exchangeth them with merchants, for
other wares wherewith they furniſh his Court.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of revenue conſiſteth in volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

whenſoever the king is to undertake a warre of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
or defenſive, he calls a Parliament, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he acquainteth the ſubiect with his purpoſe,
and what charges it is like to ariſe vnto: and
then the States of the kingdome agree vpon a
certaine ſumme anſwerable to the buſines to be
undertaken.</p>
               <p>But the Nobles and chiefe Gentrie, and their
tenants are for the moſt part freed from theſe
impoſitions, unleſſe upon very urgent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
occaſions. But if there be an extreame
neceſſitie, and there be not otherwiſe ſufficient
ſupply, then their vaſſals and tenants are tyed to
pay halfe of the taxe or ſubſidie, as well as thoſe
who are immediately ſubiect to the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, the ſubiect is tyed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

               <p>This fact his brother (otherwiſe very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)

This king <hi>Iohn</hi> conſtantly maintained the ſame

being before during his fathers life time in 1590
beene deſigned and appointed king of Poland
(being during his fathers life time, elected king
of Poland, where he alſo lived and reigned at the
time of his fathers death) was in the yeare 1599
crowned king of Sweden, and the very day of
the Epiphanie was appointed for this purpoſe.
Now there was to the kings company one <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus
mala ſpina,</hi> Biſhop of Vrlia in Italy, the
Popes <hi>Nuncto,</hi> whom the king and his followers
much deſired to performe the ſolemne rites of
the Coronation: and this Prelate was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if the States of Sweden had once given
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21437:44"/>
way to this beginning, the Romiſh religion
might more eaſily afterwards be againe intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
But againſt this with might and maine
did <hi>Adamus Andracanns,</hi> then Archbiſhop of
Vpſalia oppoſe, affirming, that it was flat againſt
the lawes and cooſtitutions of the kingdome
that any other but the Archbiſhop of Vpſalia
ſhould ſet the diademe royall upon his head:
and beſides, that he muſt now ſweare to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that religion now profeſſed within the
kingdome of Sweden, according to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtane</hi>
confeſſion, exhibited to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift
Emperour, profeſſed by his grandfather <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi>
and his owne father <hi>Iohn</hi> the 3. and by a late
ſynod holden at Vpſalia, by the whole states of
the kingdome confirmed; and that he ſhall not
aſſigne or grant any Church or Churches in any
towne of Sweden to any other religion then that
of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> confeſſion. And further, that
du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his abode in Sweden, he ſhould
be contented with the ſervice performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the private chapell of his owoe palace. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this did oppoſe the Peeres and Nobles of
poland that accompanied the king: howbeit the
Peeres of Sweden were reſolute in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
inſomuch that ſome dayes were thus ſpent
in alteration. At length about mid Ianuary, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no remedy, it was agreed that the biſhop of

he would doe iuſtice to all the Swediſh nation,
as well rich as poore, and that according to the
lawes and ſtatutes of the kingdome, he ſhould
governe the ſame, and that by the counſell and
conſent of his brother Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the
ſenate or counſell of the kingdome, that he ſhall
conſult with the natural inhabitants of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and not with ſtrangers: that hee ſhall
bring no ſtrangers within the realme; that hee
ſhall commit the caſtles and forts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the deſerts of Vpſalia to none but the
natiues of the countrey; that he ſhall impoſe no
new tribute or taxe upon the ſubiect, unleſſe in

he ſhould procure peace and tranquillitie to all

1594. as ſaid is, being but of a

his father dying in 1611. he being then but 17.
yeares of age, was crowned in 1617: Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Marquis of Brandenburg, one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Electors of the ſacred Empire, who although

ſhe was in a Parliament then holden at Stocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,
declared here apparent to the crowne of

his father <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth of that name died, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his warre with Denmarke; and withall hath
beene ſhewed, how at the ſame time the ſame
Prince had hot warre with the Prince of Ruſſia:
by which may eaſily appeare into what a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of troubles was this young king at his firſt
comming to the crowne involved. In both theſe
warres he carryed his affaires ſo well, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

himſelfe ever ſince a firme and inviolable
peace with that great Prince.<note place="margin">His war with the king of Denmarke.</note> He had with the
Dane divers conflicts, yet alwayes demeaned
himſelfe ſo worthily that he came off with great
honour and credit; ſo that at length that great
king ſeeing hee had to meddle with his match,
was willing to accoodate his Martiall thoughts,
to entertaine at treatie of peace: and ſo theſe two
great Princes of mortall enemies, became lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and kind friends, and have ſince confirmed
a ſtrait league of amity and friendſhip. As for the
Ruſſian Prince, he had with him yet ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficulty to undergoe, there reſting ſome
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21437:48"/>
ſtrong, and almoſt impregnable places to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the evidences concerning ſuch territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as the Ruſſian had, for good conſideration,
aſſigned his father, to bee recovered. Amd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my purpoſe bee not particularly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my ſelfe upon all the ſeverall occurrances
of this warre; yet are there in the ſame, ſome
things to be obſeraed, not unworthy the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
conſideration, whereof I will give but a
touch.</p>
               <p>After his fathers deceaſe then,<note place="margin">His war with the Ruſſian Prince.</note> having ſetled
the affaires of his kingdome at home, although
he had to deale with ſo potent an enemie as the
king of Denmarke, as hath beene ſaid already;
yet did he not neglect this warre againſt the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian;
and for this purpoſe prepared a great army
to proſecute that which his father had left unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
Now it is to bee underſtood that theſe
forts and places hee tooke in from the Ruſſian
Prince, are the ſtrongeſt holds, and as it were, the
very keyes of all the Ruſſian dominion. That
countrey is corruptly called Rexholme,<note place="margin">The countrey of Carelia corruptly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Reaholme taken in.</note> from a
ſtrong City and Caſtle ſeated in two little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
in the mouth of the river Woxen, in the
one of which the Caſtle, and in the other the
City is ſeated; although the right name of this
countrey among Hiſtorians be knowne by the
name Carelia. But, among all theſe ſtrong holds
&amp; caſtles, none is to be compared with the ſtrong
fort Notteburg,<note place="margin">The invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of Notteburg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> which hath therefore hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ever beene holden invincible, untill now of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21437:49"/>
late experience hath taught us the contrary. It
is built in a little Iland in the mouth of the ſwift
river Nerva, and by reaſon of the breadth of the
river could not be battered with ordnance. This
ſtrong cattle therefore being of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
was never unfurniſhed. But the great God
of heaven, who according to his good will and
pleaſure, diſpoſes of all theſe ſublunary things,
and infatuates the wiſedome of the wiſe, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this inuincible fort into the hands of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Prince: a preſage, no doubt, of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
great and glorious victories. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is yet more admirable: for within the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were not unfurniſhed of ſufficient foode,
and the enemies force (as ſaid is) they needed not
much to feare;<note place="margin">The ſtrange manner of taking in the Caſtle of Noneburg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> but within their mouthes and
throats there grew ſo many great warts, that
although they had food ſufficient, yet could they
not feed on the ſame, nor yet ſwallow down any
ſuſtenance, for the which cauſe they were forced
to ſurrender this ſtrong fort into his maieſties
hands. And ſo he that made the walls of <hi>Iericho</hi>
at the found of a rammes horne to fall downe, to
make a way for his owne people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to enter
this City, found out this way to take in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
fort. And whoſoever ſees not the ſame
providence accompanying &amp; proſpering him in
this ſo great a warre now undertaken againſt the
whole power of the <hi>Austrian</hi> houſe and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
league, I thinke is more then pur-blind.
There is in that ſame countrey another ſtrong
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21437:49"/>
Caſtle <hi>Iuanogorod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The taking in of the ſtrong fort Iuanogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</note> ſeated on the top of a high
rocke, in an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or narrow plaine, a great
part thereof being environed with this ſwift ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
And although on the weſt ſide, as it loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
towards the river it might be batered; yet
both that way, as likewiſe both the ſouth and
north parts were well defended by this river; and
on the eaſt there was a low valley, digged by
natures owne induſtry, where the people had
their habitation, the countrey about being plain
and levell, and ſo high that the ordnance could
touch onely the tops of the turrets, and goe no
lower. Neither yet was there any undermining
by reaſon or that ſoile which was altogether
rockie. This fort notwithſtanding, together
with the former 2. and many more were by this
ſame king taken in the yeare 1617, in ſo much
that this great Prince was then put in no ſmall
feare of looſing all or the greater part of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
whereof there was then no ſmall
danger. Wherefore the great Knezor or Duke,
<hi>Michael Feodorouitz,</hi> ſonne to the former perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Iuani Vaſilienitz Suſki,</hi> earneſtly ſuing for
peace, it was at length by the mediation of king
<hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory effected, and in the
yeare 1618. fully finiſhed and agreed upon.
And thus were thoſe aforementioned townes
and forts, and divers others belonging to this
<hi>Carelia Ruthenica,</hi> or countrey of Rexholme, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all the deeds and evidences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
pertaining, reſigned over and delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21437:50"/>
to the hands of this king, and for ever annexed
unto the Crowne of Sweden; and all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
during this warre taken from the Ruſſian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to him reſtored, as in the articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 18. more at length is to be ſeene. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was this king then part 21. yeares of age,
when he had brought to a happy end two ſo
great and important warres. Now after this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and peaceable concluſion, having eſtabliſhed
peace in al his Prouinces, he gave not himſelf over
to his luſtfull pleaſures (as is often too cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with young Princes) nor to drowne himſelfe
with ſinnefull delights; but gane himſelfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beautifie and adorne this peaceable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whereof ſhee was now fully poſſeſſed:
which could no better be effected, then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the ancient good and wholeſome lawes
and conſtitutions of the kingdome,<note place="margin">Confirmation of the ancient lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning trafficke and commerce betwixt the ſea townes.</note> adding ſome

was already touched, he not onely rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
the former lawes and conſtitutions
concerning trafficke and commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſea townes, but added alſo divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
tending to that ſame purpoſe; together
with many other things, whereon for brevity. I
may not now inſiſt.</p>
               <p>But that he might leave a perpetuall memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the Chriſtian world, that he was as well a

thereof a ſufficient proofe to all after ages. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

in the ſame City a colledge of 4 profeſſors;
and afterwards the number of profeſſours being
increaſed, together with an addition of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meanes, it was in the yeare 1476. by Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4. erected into the forme of an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie,
and adorned with the like priviledges,
as that of Bononia. This Vniverſitie by iniurie

not onely reſtored to former dignity and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,

now it may well be compared with many of the

any time hereafter by reaſon of the want or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of meanes come to ruine or decay,
did in the yeare 1624. out of his owne revenues
ſettle upon the ſame very great and large means,
and confirmed the ſame in moſt large and ample
manner, and made the poſſeſſion of theſe lands
and rents, as ſure and firme as the beſt Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>This Prince, after he had lived a few yeares
in peace, was againe intangled in a new warre
with his Vncle <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> king of Polonia, in the

which he tooke from him many ſtrong townes

loſſe to himſelfe (for he made warre in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
countrey) both in the kingdome of Poland,
it ſelfe, in the Duchie of Lithuania, and in the
rich countrey of Pruſſia; ſo that if this king had
continued as he began, and affaires of a higher
nature and ſtraine had not invited him another
way, not with ſtanding the ayde the Emperor his
brother in law ſent him, he had, perhaps, ere now
beene deprived of a great part, if not of all his
great dominion. The which by him wiſely, and
in time foreſeene, he earneſtly ſued both to our
gracious kings maieſtie now living, and to the
king of France to mediate a faire agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his nephew; the which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
performed the 29. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1629.

much increaſed his hereditary dominions; the

This Prince likewiſe ſpared no paines,
