         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whereof, by his great and vnſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
I haue bene employed whether I woulde or no,

nature it ſelfe, and eſpeciallie Gods ordinance hath

which will neuer be guilty of their owne dammage

in refuſing to trie al the lawful means, which
he hath ordained and appointed for the deliuerie of
his children, out of the hands of their malicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
But ſeeing vnto this care of my priuate ſafe

trueth, from all the ſlaunders, wherewith the
iniquitie of mine aduerſaries by my vnjuſt trouble
would take occaſion to ſtaine the ſame: may not all
men clearely ſee, that I am drawen into this action
with a twofold coard (which as the wiſe man ſaith,
is not eaſily broken) of vnanſwerable neceſsitie?</p>
            <p>The vnjuſt dealing of the Archb. of Canterb. &amp;
others of the high commiſſion, is ſuch towards me,
and of a long time hath bin, as in the dayes of peace
and publike tranquillity, of my gracious and dread
ſoueraigne Queene ELIZABETH: I may nowe juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
account my ſelfe, to be one, that in regarde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and quietnes, am vnjuſtly bereaued of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

the ſame is, that my conſcience will not ſuffer me
(whome the Lord of his infinite goodnes, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
with the knowledge of the ſauing trueth
of his goſpell) to beholde with ſilence, the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
miſery of ſoules, wherein my countrymen the
inhabitants of Wales liue at this preſent, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their great ignorance and the greeuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of gods ſanctuary among them. And I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
not the ſame, becauſe vnto my ſmall ability, I
haue labored and doe labour to effect ſome redreſſe
of their foreſaide miſery, by lamenting their caſe,
ſhewing vnto them and your Hh. their griefe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the medicine, which the lord hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as his owne ordinance to cure ſuch maladyes.
An vnworthy preſident to be conueyed vnto poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
that it ſhould not be lawfull for a man in the
time of knowledg, to lament the ignorance of his
bretheren, in the time of the ſauing health of mens
ſoules, to withſtand their violent perdition, in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1294:3"/>
time of Sions building, to lament and repaire the
ruines thereof. And that in a ſtate profeſſing enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
vnto the Romish religion, it cannot be ſafe for a
man to ſpeake againſt the fornication of that ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
and humbly to intreat, that the holy temple
may be cleanſed of all her pollution. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
ſuch is my caſe for bewailing the ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of my countrimen, for ſhewing vnto them the
way whereby they might be reſtored vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
liberty of the ſonnes of God, for crauing that
they may be trained in this way, and for mocioning
that gods holy ſanctuary among them may be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
I am teſted from poſt to piller, and permitted
to haue no aſſurance of quiet aboade in any of her
majeſties territories and dominions, by the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed,
beſides the injurious impriſonment,
wherein heretofore they haue deteined me for this
ſame cauſe. And to the ende I may truely acquaint
you of the parliament with my troubles, and the
true cauſes thereof, you are to vnderſtand, that the
beginning of theſe mens hatred towards me, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from the goodwill I beare vnto the glory of my
God and the good of his church, and that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
thereof, is for the ſame cauſe. For vntill ſuch
time, as the Lorde vouchſafed to vſe me (moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie,
I acknowledge from the bottome of my
heart) as an inſtrument to motion the parliament,
holden by prorogation, in the 29. yere of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
raigne, in the cauſe of Gods truth, I was a man
altogether vnknowne vnto th'Archb. or any other
of the high commiſſion, by whome I am now perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
My ſuite then vnto the parliament was, that
the goſpell of Chriſt might in a ſauing meaſure, be
made knowen and publiſhed amongſt the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1294:4"/>
of wales, my deare &amp; natiue countrimen. The
equitie of this petition; I manifeſted in a publiſhed
treatiſe, allowed to be printed by publike authority.
The ſupplication,<note place="margin">Maſter Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee.</note> together with the printed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
were preferred by a worſhipfull gentleman of
my countrie, being himſelf a member of the houſe,
who alſo ſhewed the equitie of the petition, and in
effect auouched the truth of that which in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
was ſet downe. The ſuit I was perſwaded, would
haue beene verie plauſible in a chriſtian ſtate, and
the parliament ſhewed no diſliking thereof, though
they ſinned in the careleſſe reſpect they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
Th'Archb. and his aſſociates were contrarie
minded, they thought the enterpriſe to be intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
And yet was there no alteration of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
gouernment of Biſhops at that time ſought
for. The diſlike of the petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did not conceal,
and therfore preſently diſpatched their warrants to
call in the printed bookes, and to enquire for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
The books in nomber about 500. togither with
my ſelfe, were faſtened vpon by the wardens of the
Stacioners, M. Biſhop and Denham, accompanied
with Cole the Purſiuaunt, wherevpon being caried
before the high commiſſioners, I was for enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the former action, charged by th'Archb. owne
mouth, not onely to be a factious ſlaunderer of her
Majeſties gouernment: but alſo to haue publiſhed
flat treaſon and hereſie in my ſaide treatiſe, I was
threatned very bloodily, and reuiled vpon in a moſt
vnchriſtian ſort, with earneſt proteſtation, that they
woondered how I durſt ſollicite the parliament in
that petition. See the curſed and outragious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenes
of theſe, whom the Lorde hath in his juſt
judgement giuen ouer to withſtande the mightie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1294:4"/>
power of his word! As though the matter were to
be aſtonied at, that they ſhould be more forward in
hindring the cauſe of Gods glory, then meaner men
ſhould be to promote the ſame. If they had beene
the true gouernours of Gods Church, they woulde
haue ſhewed themſelues the moſt earneſt fauorers
of that ſupplication. For it is well knowen, in what
a taking the country of wales is, for want of the true
knowledge of God. And aſſuredly they, who of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
mallice withſtood that motion, ſhal one day
feele the price and reward of their diſobedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their neuer ending woe. VVell, mine offence in
preſuming to ſpeake in the cauſe of God, oppugned
by my betters, was accounted ſo haynous, as in cloſe
priſon I muſt be kept 12. daies, at the keepers vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
perill. Before my departure from the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
vnderſtanding their intent to commit me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the particuler cauſe why I was ſo hardlie
dealt with. Anſwere was made, that they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
me againe and then I ſhould know. After a
moneths impriſonment I was deliuered without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
examination, or anye mention of the crimes of
hereſie and treaſon wherewith I had bene charged.
And ſo vnto this daie, I remaine ignorant of anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
cauſe wherefore, they either tooke away my
books, or debarred me of my libertie, and readie by
the grace of God, both to conuince the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of moſt injurious dealing in the premiſes, &amp;
to cleare my ſelfe of anie crime they can lay to my
charge, whenſoeuer, before you of this honorable
aſſembly, or any other equall judgement ſeat they
darebe tried with me.</p>
            <p>Since the time of my releaſe, I ſawe my ſelfe
bounde in conſcience, not to giue ouer my former
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1294:5"/>
purpoſe, in ſeeking the good of my countrymen, by
the rooting out of ignorance and blindnes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. And as it pleaſed the lord to increaſe
this my care, ſo haue mine aduerſaries augmented
their rage and fury towards me, and eſpecially to
the cauſe that I maintaine. This furye of theirs, at
diuers times ſhewed by many of their inſtruments,
did eſpecially manifeſt it ſelfe on the 29. of Ianuary
laſt. At which time one Richard Walton hauing a
commiſſion from the Archb. and others, wherein
all her maieſties officers were chardged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
in her name, to aſſiſt the ſayd VValton to
make entry into all houſes, ſhops, &amp;c: to apprehend
all thoſe whome he ſhould any waies ſuſpect, and
to commit them at his diſcretion vnto the next
Gaol or priſon, vntil farther order ſhould be taken
with them, came into the place of mine aboad at
Northampton, ranſacked my ſtudy, and tooke away
with him all ſuch printed books and written papers
as he himſelf thought good, what they were as yet
I cannot juſtly tel. And not contented to keepe him
ſelf within the immoderate limits of a larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
then as I thinke can be warranted by lawe,
he offered violence vnto diuers perſons, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
not only to breake open doores (hauing noe
ſuch commiſſion) but alſo to vntile houſes, vnleſſe
he could find me where in deed I was not. At his
departure he charged the Maior of the towne, who
then attended vpon him, to apprehend me as a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
giuing out that he had found in my ſtudy both
printed bookes and alſo writings, which conteined
treaſon in them. Whereas the bookes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of geateſt diſgrace (eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſight of his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter)
which he could there finde, were, one printed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1294:5"/>
coppy of the demonſtration of diſcipline, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
vnto maſter D. Some in writing, both which
he caried away with him. The treaſon conteined in
either of thoſe books, is no other then that which
Amaſiah the high prieſt at Bethel, found in Amos
the prophet,<note place="margin">Amos 7.</note> euen the cleare words of truth not to
be abidden in a corrupt ſtate of a church I graunt.</p>
            <p>Behold nowe my Lordes, and you the reſt of this
high court, the original and continuance of theſe
mens enmity towards me. And judg whether I haue
not greate reaſon, both for mine owne ſafety, and
for the clearing of the cauſe wherein I ſtand, to vſe
this lawful meanes of Appelation vnto your Hh. and
worſhips from their tirannous and vngodly dealing
with whome neither mine owne innocency, nor yet
the equity of the cauſe can any whit preuaile. They
are knowne to be very mighty, and haue felt them
very vnjuſt and tiranous. The only juſtice which I
can expect from them, if I fall into their hands, is to
be kept languiſhing in priſon during their pleaſure,
and neuer ſuffered to come to the triall of my cauſe.
If I hoped for any other meaſure, I ſhould reaſon
contrary vnto mine owne experience, againſt which
no conceite ought to take place.</p>
            <p>In conſideration wherof, being now by the lords
prouidence kept out of theire handes, and that in
the time of the meeting and aſſembly of the higheſt
councell of this kingdome, I doe in moſt dutifull &amp;
humble ſort, make this my juſt appelation from the
Archb. of Canterbury and the reſt of his colleagues
in commiſſion, vnto you of the honorable and high
court of parliament, humbly referring my ſelfe and
my cauſe vnto your determination according vnto
juſtice. My only ſuite and petition is, that either I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1294:6"/>
may haue aſſurance of quietnes and ſafety, or that
the cauſes of my trouble being laide open by mine
aduerſaries, I may receiue condigne puniſhment of
mine offences. Where it may be ſeene that I craue
no immunity, let me haue juſtice and that is all I
craue. This in regard of your places you are bound
to affoard me,<note place="margin">If the high commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can juſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly charge me vvith anye crime, I doe them a great benefite, and greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage my ſelfe, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing vnto the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as in the day of judgment you ſhall
anſwere before him vnto whome no vnrighteouſnes
is acceptable. I doe mine aduerſaries no injury in
appealing from them vnto you. For they may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of juſtice at your hands, if they will adueuture
to purſue their ſuite. And me they cannot blame in
repairing vnto you for judgment and equitie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their tribunal ſeat, I am like to receiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but gal and woormwood. If their cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me be good, if it be ſtrong, if it be to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
nowe let them not be aſhamed to bring it
out into the face of the ſunn, here they may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of juſtice, without any ſuſpition of partiallity.
My reaſons vſed in my laſt ſupplication vnto your
Hh. againſt their gouernment are but a fewe, if D.
Bridges, or any of their ſide can anſwere them, I wil
grant my ſelfe to haue oppugned the truth, and ſoe
wil deſtroie my ſelfe that which I haue built amiſſe,
otherwiſe they ſhewe them ſelues to be but vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of a ruinous building, and the repairers of that
which wanteth a foundation. They can not refuſe
you of the Parliament to be their judges, vnleſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they think much to be tried by you, or becauſe
as it is in the prouerb, they which do euil hate the
light.</p>
            <p>They will it may be, alleage the prerogatiue of
their commiſſion to be very large, what then? doe
they think, herby to haue libertie to oppreſſe whom
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1294:6"/>
they will, doe they thinke hereby to be aboue the
parliament, whereunto al courts in the land are and
ought to be ſubiect, and from whence the highe
commiſſion deriueth al the prerogatiue it hath? Are
al courts, yea and al perſons in the land ſubiect vnto
the parliament only the Archb. and the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
excepted? What elſe were this but for them
to claime a forreine authority vnto them ſelues, and
to begin after the manner of their prediceſſors, to
ſhake of the yoke of the ciuil authoritie? Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
ſuſpicion as they would cleare themſelues, ſo muſt
they be content, to yeeld that the parliament may
be the judges betwene vs. Except they be aſhamed
of their cauſe and their proceedings therein, they
cannot poſſibly refuſe this offer of juſt trial. And no
reaſon they ſhould, for they cannot pretend them
ſelues either to be greater in power, or more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in good wil to adminiſter juſtice, then the R.
honourable aſſembly of parliament is well knowne
to be. Though I feare me R. honorable &amp; worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that the Lord wil enter into judgment with you
for the ſmal care you haue to yeld his ſonne Chriſt
Ieſus his right in this kingdome.</p>
            <p>If heere they ſhould demaund by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
either I may lawfully appeale from them,<note place="margin">That I am bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue mine Appellation.</note> or by

vnto my complaint: although both be alredy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet a farther anſwere vnto both are to enſue as

can receiue no equitie,<note place="margin">Act. 25.</note> by the ſame commiſſion,
that the apoſtle Paul and the prophet Ieremy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed

judg, and the deliuery of Ieremy by the princes of
Iudah from the ſlanderous accuſations and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
proceedings of the wicked prieſts and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
(beſides many other vnanſwerable reaſons)
do neceſſarily bind me to appeale, and the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to denie me the ſhadowe of their winges,
vnder which I may be kept from the violence of
mine enemies. when Feſtus willing to get fauour
with the Iewes, vſed this ſpeech vnto the apoſtle
wilt thou goe then to Ieruſalem and there be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of theſe things before me, Paul knowing that at
Ieruſalem the malice of his enemies would be more
likely to take effect then elſe where, anſwered I ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
at Ceſars judgment ſeate, where I ought to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If I haue done wronge, or committed any thing
woorthy of death, I refuſe not to dye: but if there be
non of theſe things true whereof they accuſe me, no
man can deliuer me vnto them, I appeal vnto Ceſar,
his appellation was receiued of the Pagan judge.
Nowe my ſtate being not in reſpect of danger, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
vnlike the condition, wherein the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
was at this time, mine anſwere vnto the high
commiſſion is I appeale vnto the parliament, where
I ought to be judged. If I haue done any wronge or
committed any thing worthy of death, I refuſe not
to dye. The parliament wil not be partial in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
juſtice vnto me according to my deſerts. But
if there be nothing laied to my charge, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Gods cauſe, and the oppugning of impietie
and corruption, no man ought to deliuer me into
your hands, whoe care not whome you aflict in the
maintenance of your owne kingdome, I appeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the parliament. I am in regard of my ſafety as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
driuen therunto, as the Apoſtle Paul was ro
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1294:7"/>
appeale vnto Ceſar, or rather more. For he might
conceiue ſome hope of juſtice, when he was to be
judged of Feſtus, who did not ſo mortally hate his
cauſe as the high prieſt and others his accuſers did,
whereas I am to haue you for my judges, who alſo
are mine accuſers, and ſworn enemies vnto the cauſe
I appeale to the ciuil ſtate, I hope by their meanes
to be heard and deliuered from your tyrannie. As
the prophet Ieremie was in the like caſe by meanes
of the princes in his time. The high prieſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
judged him wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hie to die, the princes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

him out of danger.</p>
            <p>The whol action is ſet downe cap. 26. of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
in theſe words. Now when Ieremy had made
an end of ſpeaking all that the lord had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to ſpeak vnto al the people,<note place="margin">Iere. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. 6. 7.</note> then the priſts
and the prophetes and all the people tooke him,<note place="margin">It is no nevv thing to find the ſuppoſed pillers of the church to be the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof</note>
and ſaid thou ſhalt die the death. Why haſt thou
propheſied in the name of Iehouath, ſaying, this
houſe ſhalbe like Shilo, and this city ſhall be deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
without an inhabitant. And al the people were
gathered againſt Ieremy in the houſe of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d.
And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the princes of Iudah heard of theſe things
they cam vp from the kings houſe into the houſe of
the Lord, and ſate downe in the entry of the newe
gate of the Lords houſe. Then ſpake the prieſts and
the prophets vnto the princes and to al the people
ſaying: <hi>this man is worthy to dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he hath propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt this city as you haue heard with your eares.</hi>
Then ſpake <hi>Jeremiah</hi> vnto all the princes and to all
the people ſaying, <hi>the Lord hath ſent me to propheſie
againſt this houſe, &amp; againſt this city al the things that
you haue heard. therefore now amend your waies and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1294:8"/>
your workes, and heare the voice of the Lord your god,
that the lord may repent him of the plague that he hath
pronounced againſt you. As for me: behold I am in
your hands, doe with me as you think good &amp; right: but
knowe you for certaine that if you put me to death, you
ſhall ſurely bring innocent bloud vppon your ſelues,
vppon this City &amp; vppon the inhabitants thereof: for
of a trueth the lord hath ſent me vnto you, to ſpeake al
theſe wordes in your eares.</hi> Then ſpake the princes &amp;
al the people vnto the prieſts &amp; prophets: <hi>this man
is not worthye to dye, for he hath ſpoken vnto vs in
the name of the lord our god.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let my cauſe now right Honourable, be weighed
with the prophecy in this place, thereby it ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
vnto you, that neceſſitie is laied vppon me to
appeale from mine aduerſaries, and that yee are
bound to heare my cauſe, by the example of theſe
noble men. <hi>Jeremy</hi> was judged by his enemies wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to dy, and I aſſure my ſelfe it was not their falt
that he was ſuffered to liue. They wanted but pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and opportunity to diſpatch him. They did what
in them lay when they apprehended him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
him woorthy to die for ſpeaking againſt the
State. The princes hearing the greeuouſnes of his
accuſation, thought them ſelues bound to try out
the matter, and ſitting in judgment, heard the cauſe
equally on both ſides, and ſo cleared the prophet.
Nowe had Ieremy done wel, if hearing the greuous
accuſations of his enemies, he would not haue taken
th'oportunitie offered him by the lords prouidence
to haue judgment at the hands of the princes? he
had not out of queſtion, or had the princes don wel
in beleeuing th'accuſations and ſlaunders of the
priſts and falſe prophets againſt him, and ſo in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1294:8"/>
the prophet to be debarred of his libertie,
without any farther examination of the matter, or
had they done wel in ſitting ſtil, while the pore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and his mighty aduerſaries tried out the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
They ſawe an other duty to be required of them
and therefore preſently without delay they holpe
him that was ready to periſh. The caſe is now with
me as it was then with the prophet: I am judged by
th'Archb. of Canterbury and others in commiſſion
with him, to be a man vnworthy to liue in any State
And I haue more cauſe to thanke the Lord for the
peaceable gouernment of her right excellent maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any fauour of mine enemies that I now
breath aboue the earth: I muſt either appeale from
them, or be guiltie of mine owne blood. I appeale
therefore vnto the high court of Parliament, and if
ye therein aſſembled, either credite the ſlaunders of
mine aduerſaries before ye know the cauſe, or ſit ſtil
in rejecting my juſt Appellation, and ſuffer them to
perſecute mee without a cauſe. <hi>Festus</hi> an heathen
Iudge, and the princes of Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, will riſe vp in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt you. For the ſame God that required
at their hands the deliuery of his ſeruants out of the
handes of their rauening enemies, requireth of you
th' equall hearing of my cauſe. And if ye ſuffer me
to fall by their meanes, you ſhall bring innocent
blood vpon your owne ſelues and this whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>My caſe at this time is the caſe of the poore, the
fatherleſſe, the ſtranger and the widdowe, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
in that reſpect, ye ought to haue a ſpecial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of it. For not to deliuer the widdowe and
the fatherleſſe from the violence of the oppreſſor,
when it lieth in your power, what is it elſe but for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1294:9"/>
to oppreſſe the poore the widow and the fatherles,
concerning whome the Lord hath thus ſpoken,<note place="margin">They are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors vvhich vvill not if they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</note> 
               <hi>If
thou vex or trouble ſuch, &amp; ſo he cal and cry vnto me,
ſurely I wil heare his cry. And then ſhal my wrath be
kindled &amp; I wil kil you with the ſword, and your wiues
ſhalbe widowes, and your children fatherleſſe.</hi> Either
then by graunting vnto me righteouſe judgment,<note place="margin">Exod.22.23.</note>
ye of the parliament muſt deliuer me from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and wrong, or I muſt be forced to account you
among the number of mine oppreſſors. And you
knowe, that being oppreſſed and troaden downe, I
am bound to cry to the Lord for aide, otherwiſe, I
ſhal diſobey his commaundement, Pſal. 50. 15. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with my griefe he hath promiſed to
heare my ſuite, what will followe thereof, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
I am ſure be ignorant. For then he hath proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his wrath wil be kindled againſt you &amp; that
he will deuour you with the ſword, and cauſe your
wiues to be widowes, and your children fatherleſſe,
doe ye not then ſee your ſelues bound to receiue
mine appellation with ſuch a bond, as in wiſdome ye
ought to take heede that ye incurre not the danger
thereof.</p>
            <p>Although then I be a thouſand degrees inferiour
vnto mine aduerſaries, in regard of outward things:
yet by the mercies of the Lorde, I haue the vpper
hand of them, in the goodneſſe and equitie of my
ſuite. For I come vnto you in the name of God,
moſt humbly intreating, and earneſtly beſeeching,
that in a good matter, euen in my right, I be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen
by the power of vnconſcionable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and therefore many waies, I come not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
th'vnreaſonable ſupport of my peticion. I come
euen with that warrant, by the vertue whereof the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1294:9"/>
poore, the widowe, the fatherleſſe and the ſtranger
are of due to haue their right againſt the mightieſt
potentate vnder the ſunn. And that is the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the Lord of heauen and earth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
th' adminiſtration of juſtice without partialitie:
<hi>you ſhal haue no reſpect of perſons in judgment ſaieth
the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but ſhal heare the ſmall as the great, you ſhal

And again, <hi>you ſhal not doe vniuſtly in iudgment. Thou
ſhalt not fauour the perſon of the poore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 15</note> 
               <hi>nor honor the
perſon of the mightie, but ſhalt iudg thy neighbour
righteouſly,</hi> Theſe ye knowe are the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the land, wherby ye are bound to heare me
vnleſſe ye think you may haue reſpect of perſons in
judgment, for if the Archb. or any of his aſſociats
came vnto you to be heard againſt me, you would
eaſely condiſcend vnto the motion. The like fauor
are ye bound to ſhewe vnto me, becauſe you are to
heare the ſmal as well as the great, and ought not
to fauour the perſon of the mightie. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
vnto you, what the prophet Eſaiah ſpake of
the judges in his time,<note place="margin">Eſai. 1. 23. 24</note> becauſe they would not help
the fatherleſſe to his right, nor ſuffer the widowes
cauſe to come before them, would ye avoide the
juſt deſert of that reprehenſion? Then I beſeech you
helpe me to my right, and ſuffer my cauſe to come
before you, leaſt it may be truely ſaide of you, that
you execute no judgment, no not the judgment of
the fatherles and oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>And albeit you wil not doe this in regarde of my
perſon which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as the fatherleſſe, as the poore and

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1294:10"/>
aduerſaries, from whome I can neither hope for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in my trial, nor ſafety from danger. The cauſe
of this my trouble and perill (as before hath bene
briefly touched) is only that the Lord vouchſafed
me the fauour, to motion a redreſſe of the great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and corruption which at this day raigneth
in the church within my country. And becauſe I doe
not conceile that which in conſcience I am bounde
to lay open:namely, that the blindnes and ignorance
of our blind &amp; ignorant guides, the tiranny, vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bondage, and vnjuſt oppreſſion of Gods church
by vngodly, and tiranical Lord Biſhops, with the
reſt of th'vnlawful church gouernoures (who euen
by vertue of their places cannot chuſe but oppreſſe
the church of God) are the ready and direct waie,
not only to kepe my countrimen from eternal life,
but alſo to bringe the Lords wrath vppon vs, our
prince, maieſtrats, people, and the whol kingdome.
So that I am moleſted for ſoliciting the cauſe of
God, the cauſe of mens ſoules, the cauſe of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
and the State, with whome the Lord (with
out ſpeedy repentance) is not likely to beare any
longer, for the manifold corruptions of our church.
I am moleſted becauſe I cannot be content that
my countrymen ſhould want the means of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and ſo run headlong to their owne eternall
ruine, and becauſe I am not ſilent at the miſerable
prophanation of Gods ſanctuary, by ſwine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
beaſtes: I am moleſted becauſe I ſuffer not
without any ſhewe of diſlike, the holy miniſtery of
the Lord and the ſacred gouernment of his church,
to be a pray vnto ſuch men as are not worthy to liue
in any wel ordered common wealth, much leſſe in
a reformed church: I am moleſted becauſe I hold it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1294:10"/>
vnlawful for any man to take vppon him the care,
charge, and ouerſight of thoſe ſoules, whome he
cannot poſſibly feede, guide, and direct in the paths
and paſtures of eternal life: I am moleſted becauſe
with the holy Apoſtle Peter, I think it vnlawfull
for any miniſter to be <hi>Lord ouer gods heritage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 1. 2.</note> and
thinke the judgment of our Sauiour to be ſounde,
who held it vnlawful for his miniſters to <hi>Rule like
Lordes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 25.</note> I am moleſted becauſe I hold that which is
ſet downe Heb. 3. 6. to be true, whereby I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confeſſe, that as non but Moſes or ſome other
prophet, by the expreſſe commaundement of God,
was to ordaine th'officers of the church vnder the
lawe. So non but our Sauiour Chriſt, or his apoſtles
in the expreſſe written word, are to ordaine the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the churche gouernement vnder the newe
couenaunt. I am alſo moleſted, becauſe (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by the former ſcripture, Hebr. 3. 6.) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that our Sauiour lefte an externall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of his Church, and ſo is equall with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
and ſuch a gouernement as cannot be changed
by any but himſelfe, and ſo is ſuperior vnto Moſes.
I am driuen to confeſſe this vnchangeable forme of
externall church gouernement ordained by him, to
be a gouernment, th' execution whereof, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to theſe 4. officers: namely, <hi>Teaching Pastors</hi> &amp;
<hi>Doctors, gouerning Elders, &amp; ministring Deacons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I finde non other officers or offices, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
or included in the Newe Teſtament: Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Prophetes and Euangeliſtes onely excepted,
which being remooued out of the Churche by the
Lord himſelfe, the boldnes of our Biſhops &amp; their
defenders is intolerable, in demanding why Paſtors,
Doctors, Elders and deacons, ſhould be permanent:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1294:11"/>
ſeeing Apoſtles, Prophets and Euangeliſts were but
temporarie. As though the Lord himſelfe were not
of ſufficient wiſedome to ordaine what he thought
good in the gouerment of his Church: or as though
he were bounde, either to continue Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Euangeliſts, or to abrogate th'other 4. of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
&amp; vnder the Goſpell to haue no gouerment of
his appointment, muchleſſe vnchangeable. I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted
becauſe I made it knowne, that to maintaine
a Churche gouernement, which at the pleaſure of
man according to the diuers eſtates of the Church
may be changeable: is flatly to ouerthrowe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue,
whereby Chriſte Ieſus is aboue Moſes, in
th'ordering of his owne houſe. Th'outwarde rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof, cannot be held chaungeable vnder
the Goſpell, according to times, places, countries &amp;
ſtates, but Chriſt Ieſus muſt be made inferior vnto
Moſes, contrary to th'expreſſe decree and counſell
of th'eternall God, Heb. 3. 6. Briefly, I am moleſted
becauſe I made it knowen, that the gouernment of
the Church by L. Biſhops and Archbiſhops, (being
as they themſelues graunt, a temporarie gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fit for the Church in time of peace,<note place="margin">D. Bridges page 284.</note> but not of
perſecution,<note place="margin">T. C. pa. 135. 76.</note> and neuer ordained by the Lorde, but
inuented by man to preuent ſchiſmes, &amp;c.) is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
in Gods Church, becauſe it maketh Chriſt
Ieſus to haue ordained, either a changeable church
gouernement of his owne houſe, or none at all, and
ſo to be far leſſe faithfull in Gods houſe then Moſes
was.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like (my Lordes) are the cauſes
why th'Archb. and his, are ſo bloodily affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
me. And I haue (as mine aduerſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
confeſſe) alleadged vnto you the true cauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1294:11"/>
of their hatred and enmitie. For if th'Archb. &amp;c.
were demaunded by this honourable aſſembly, why
they impriſoned me, why they rifeled my ſtudie, &amp;
tooke away my writinges, why they now ſeeke for
me: their preſent anſwere would be, that I am an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to the preſent gouernment of the cleargie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
by her Majeſties prerogatſue and the
conſent of the State. And what is this in effect, but
becauſe I thinke Chriſt Ieſus to be more faithfull in
the gouernment of his owne houſe then Moſes was.</p>
            <p>I know in deed, that for this cauſe they giue out,
that I am an enemie to her Majeſties gouernment,
a ſeditious and diſcontented ſubject, guiltie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
attemptes and practiſes againſt her royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue,
and one that intendeth nothing els, but the
vtter innouation of the ſtate: wherein I doe
acknowledge th' auncient<note place="margin">The crimes vvherevvith.</note> and perpetuall ſlaunder
of Gods trueth and his ſeruants in all ages.<note place="margin">Gods, trueth and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue bene char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For it

which his inſtruments haue maintained in Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

from this ſlaunder, then could they not ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcrie themſelues (as they doe) to be their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſucceſſors, whoſe roomes in this age, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
in the defence of the kingdome of darkeneſſe
and ignorance.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour Chriſte was guiltie of ſo many and
ſo outragious practiſes, againſt the State wherein
he liued, as Pilate the Iudge could not ſaue his life,
and be a friend vnto Ceſar.</p>
            <p>This did the high prieſt openly proteſt againſt
him, Iohn. 19. 12. And can we then maruel that his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1294:12"/>
trueth in this age among our high prieſts is ſubiect
vnto the ſame obloquie? <hi>Tertullus</hi> th'orator would

againſt al that ſeeke the reformation of our church,

of this doctrine, for aſſoone as any ſhewe their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of theſe corruptions, with a deſire to ſee Chriſt
bearing ſway in the church of England by his owne
lawes, they preſently exclaime, that theſe are the
men which ſubuert the ſtate of the Realm, and that
gainſay the decrees of her maieſtie, affirming that
there is an other Soueraigne, whoſe alone lawes
muſt be harkened vnto, and whoſe alone offices are
to be allowed of in the gouernment of the church,
and that is Chriſt Ieſus th'eternall ſonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

God: in deed if to defend the prerogatiue
which he ought to haue in appointing th'officers &amp;
gouernors of his church, be ſedition and treaſon, I
doe confeſſe in deed, that after the way which they
cal ſedition and treaſon: ſo ſerue I the God of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But this is non other treaſon then that where
vnto our Sauiour Chriſt and his apoſtles before me
haue giuen their hands and conſented: and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
treaſon then that, wherevpon all Kings and
Queenes do firmly lay the foundation of their roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
crownes and Scepters. And therefore ye of the
parliament, ought to be ſo farr from being mooued
with theſe ſhamefull reportes, nowe raiſed by our
Biſhops againſt Chriſt Ieſus, againſt his trueth and
his members, as ye ſhould not permitt ſuch profane
mouthes, that preſume in this ſort, to whette their
tongues againſt heauen, and him that ſitteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

againſt the members of Chriſte, which in deede
hath bene th'armour wherewith the diuell in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
hath furniſhed his champions againſt the truth.
And I cannot blame our Biſhops for being skilfull
in this accuſation, ſeeing ſo many of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
haue in the like cauſe, troaden the like path be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Amos no ſooner began to vtter the trueth in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,
but Amaſiah the high prieſt there preſently
ſmelled out his dangerous attempts. And therefore
like a good ſubiect in the ſingular good will he bare
vnto his Soueraigne Lord, Ieroboam the ſonne of
Ioaſh king of Iſrael, he waded farther into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and at length found Amos his treaſon and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1294:13"/>
to be ſo intollerable, as the Land was no longer
able to beare it. Eſpecially ſeeing th'enterpriſes of
the prophet were taken in hand even in the middeſt
of the kingdome, to ſtir vp the ſubiects to innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in regard whereof, the high prieſt ſawe him ſelfe
bound in conſcience to ſend Ieroboam this meſſage.
<hi>Amos hath conſpired againſt thee,</hi>

               <hi>in the middeſt of the

for he hath openly ſpoken that which the Lord hath put

then kings and princes ſhould be honored with the
maintenance of a perfect building of Gods church,
they can preſently finde no leſſe then ſedition and
treaſon in their purpoſes, that indeuoure to further
that worke.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> began to be reedified, in the
daies of Artaxerxes, the men beyond the riuer knew
well enough, that the building of Gods church and
th'eſtabliſhing of his true ſeruice amongſt men, is
ſtraight way a wicked and a rebellious enterpriſe.
For which cauſe they ſent word vnto the king, that
if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a city rebellious and wicked, ſhould be
once built, the kings tribute thereby ſhould be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and becauſe they had bin brought vp in the
kings court, and that it was not meet for them to ſee
the kings diſhonor, they ſent him word, that if hee
would ſearch the booke of the Chronicles of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he ſhoulde finde the true Churche of God to
haue bene alwaies rebellious &amp; noiſome vnto kings

for which cauſe alſo it had bene deſtroyed. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1294:13"/>
they certified him that if he would ſuffer the

beyond the riuer ſhould not be his.<note place="margin">Ezra. 2. 19.</note> Nor long after
this time Nehemias with the Elders of the Iewes
ſtrengthened their hands to finiſh the building of

what a thing is this you doe? will you rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

could not chuſe, but be a rebellious interpriſe. You
ſee by theſe examples right honorable, that it is the

men, and traitors vnto princes and ſtates, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they doe, but ſet their faces towards the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

theſe teſtimonies, that it is no newe found ſlaunder
which the high commiſſioners haue forged againſt

            <p>Which may be the better manifeſted if you doe

            <p>The ſpilling of my blood for this cauſe, though

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1294:15"/>

gouerning Elders, miniſtring Deacons, that
you haue not onely committed two euils, the one in

of Archb. Lord Bb. which can holde in them
nothing profitable to Gods Church: but alſo think
thoſe that plead for Chriſts intereſt vnworthie your

vnworthie your defence? The Lord I ſaye, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
what iniquitie you finde in the gouernment of
his ſonne, that you haue thus altogether rejected
and forſaken the ſame, and cannot abide (I ſpeake
now vnto ſuch as are enemies therevnto) to haue it
conſulted vpon in your meeting. The beſt anſwere,
which in this point you can make, are of late publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

            <p>Firſt, it is ſaide that this hierarchie is eſtabliſhed
by the authoritie of her Majeſtie &amp; the parliament.<note place="margin">T. C. Epiſt. page 2.</note>
The Lord anſwereth, that for this cauſe, the Nauie
of the Spaniarde of late, threatned our deſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that for this cauſe we haue had extreme famine
in all our quarters, deare yeares, and many an vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

as haue bene villanouſly attempted within

of this honorable courte, that vnleſſe you woulde
feele his heauie hand vnto your deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this
wicked and peſtilent gouernment of L. Bb. ſhoulde
be no longer maintained by your prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">T. C. pa. 16. &amp; page 140.</note> it is alleaged, that this gouernment by
Paſtors, Doctors, Elders and Deacons, was inuented
by, they know not whom, and that it is not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that any ſuch gouernment was in the primitiue
Church.</p>
            <p>VVhy this is more then ſhameleſſe impudencie,
Is not that prooued in the 31. yeare of the raigne of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to haue bene at all in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, which our booke of common prayer,
in the beginning of her Majeſties raigne, teſtified
to haue beene therein, and to ſhewe the neceſſitie
thereof, declareth that we are to wiſhe for the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
then practized? Thus you may ſee, that our
Bb. to ſaue themſelues harmeleſſe, take leaue when
they thinke good,<note place="margin">Before the Comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvedneſdaye</note> to croſſe the booke of Common
prayer in that which is moſt true, and which their
owne writings graunt to be true, whereas they crie
treaſon, treaſon, when other men do not allow that
which is amiſſe therein. And you may alſo ſee howe
fit they are to lead others in the way of life, who are
now growne ſo ſharpe ſighted, as they will ſweare,
that at noone dayes they can ſee no light, whereas
in the very morning they themſelues ſawe the vpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

the Lord maketh it knowne vnto the parliament of
England, that his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, was the author

vncleane mouthes affirme, to be inuented by they

be a popiſh interrogatorie, is yet ſatiſfied without
any greate labour. For the church of Rome, Phillip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,
Epheſus,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. 7.</note> Derbe Liſtra,<note place="margin">8. Act. 20. 28. &amp; 14. 23.</note> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> with many others me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the word, practiſed this gouernment by
Paſtors, Doctors, Elders, and deacons. And if Chriſt
Ieſus be as faithful in Gods houſe, as Moſes was, it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1294:16"/>
is cleare that no church, as before was touched in
what age or ſtate ſoeuer, can haue any lawful gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
eſtabliſhed, but only this, by Paſtors, Doctors
Elders, and Deacons, becauſe no church vnder the
lawe could haue any lawful eſtabliſhed gouerment
but that preſcribed by Moſes.</p>
            <p>Whereby the pretence that other churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the Goſpel haue not this gouernment,<note place="margin">T C. pag 82. Our Bb. 5. rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
ſhewed to be nothing elſe, but a profe that
other churches haue their imperfections and are not
as yet ſo farr built, as the Lord requireth. Aſa was a
godly King, and reformed many things in the houſe
of God: yet the Idolatrous high places remained al
his daies. Theſe high places were the blemiſh, and
imperfections of his gouernment. Nowe were it any
reaſon becauſe he was a godly King, that therefore
the ſpots of the church vnder him ſhould be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of Ioſiahs reformation, and that the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould ſtil be continued? It muſt needs be ſo if
our Bb. manner of reaſoning againſt the Lords holy
ordinances be good and allowable.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place the inconueniences of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this gouernment of the Lords ordaining are
ſaide to be ſo greate,<note place="margin">T. C. pag. 16 Our Bb. 6. reaſon.</note> that the attempting thereof
might bring rather the overthrowe of the Goſpell
heere amongſt vs, then the end that is deſired. If the
receiuing of the Lordes diſcipline, be inconuenient
vnto any ſtate, that is not the fault of god his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but the ſinne of men, which haue made their
eſtate out of ſquare, as Chriſt cannot be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
thereunto without their likely detriment.
To gainſay the trueth, becauſe an inconuenience
wil followe the embracing of it, is an argument not
to be heard of amongſt chriſtians. For our Sauiour
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1294:17"/>
Chriſt him ſelfe affirmed it, to be no light matter to
enter into the kingdome of heauen, and therefore
declareth them to be vnfit diſciples for him,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 14. &amp; 14. 26.</note> that wil
not enter thereunto through manye tribulations:
yea and forſake all earthly comforts,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 24</note> much leſſe the
maintenance of their outward eſtate,<note place="margin">Mark. 8. 35.</note> rather then
not to followe him in all the waies wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
their obedience. To pretend inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
then, in this cauſe bewraieth an hollowe hart
vnto Gods glory. And yet it is not halfe ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to bring in Chriſtes gouernment, as it was
to expel popery. If her maieſtie and the parliament
would agree to eſtabliſh the ſame, al inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would be ſoone preuented. The feare of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the Goſpel by that meanes, is a ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſurmiſe, and vndutiful vnto her maieſty and the
ſtate, vnleſſe our Bb. be guiltie vnto them ſelues of
ſome ſuch purpoſes, I knowe not why this ſhould be
aleadged.</p>
            <p>The inconueniences are, firſt the alteration of
the whole ſtate of the lawes of this realme, as the
vtter ouerthrowe of the ſtudie of the ciuil lawe and
the alteration of the ciuil and common lawe. As
though al theſe things coulde not be helped by one
act of parliament. Popery had more ſhew and coulor
of trueth to reaſon thus for it ſelfe, in the raigne of
our late Soueraigne of famous memory, King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the 8. So had heathen Idolatry in the daies of
Ioſiah, or Hezekiah. They that vſe ſuch arguments
ſhew them ſelues to be giuen ouer to withſtand the
trueth. I hope the Parliament wil admit of no ſuch
reaſon, as theſe are. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus must not be allowed
by his owne lawes to rule in ſtate, he muſt needes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creede
by our lawes inferiour vnto Moſes, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1294:17"/>
we wil not aulter the ſtate of our lawes, we wil not
haue the ſtudye of the ciuil lawe ouerthrowne.</hi> We muſt
not greatly wonder, that papiſts and Mahometiſts
doe kepe Chriſts holy and ſacred verity out of their
dominions: ſeeing in a ſtate profeſſing the true God,
ſuch godleſſe men are found, as tremble not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and vtter their vngodly conceits in this ſort, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Gods heauenly ordinances: and eſpecially,
ſeeing in a ſtate profeſſing the true God, ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are of force to keepe out Chriſts ſoueraigne
and kingly gouernement. I hope that you who are
parliament men, ſee this kinde of reaſoning to bee
ſuch, as will ſtand in no account at the dreadfull day
of judgement. That which is ſpoken of Ciuillians, is
alſo ſlanderous. For they liue by temporall courts,
and therefore it is not neceſſarie that their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould decay, when the Antichriſtian gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Archb. and Lord Bb. is expelled out of our
Churche. Further our Archb. and L. Bb. vſurpe the
determination of many ciuil cauſes, in the deciding
whereof, Ciuillians might be well imployed. And is
it more reaſon in deede, that the true Churche of
God ſhould want the vſe of Chriſts holy lawes and
ſtatutes, then the ſtudie of the Ciuill law? O moſt
ſhamefull ſpeeche to be conceiued, much more to
be publiſhed in print (and that by Biſhopps) in the
dayes of the Goſpell. But what dare not they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
who profeſſe themſelues to gainſay the way of
trueth?</p>
            <p>And therefore they are not aſhamed to giue out,<note place="margin">T. C. pag. 8.</note>
that the deſired alteration of Church gouernment,
would bring the judiciall law of the Iewes into our
ſtate. This is a lewd ſlaunder. For Chriſts gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
neceſſarily, requireth no part of the Iewiſhe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1294:18"/>
lawe, to be receiued into any common wealth: but
that which is morall.</p>
            <p>It is further objected,<note place="margin">T. C. pag. 87.</note> that the lawes maintaining
the Queens ſupremacy in gouerning of the church,
and hir prerogatiue in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, muſt
be abrogated, or els Chriſte cannot raigne in our
ſtate. The reaſon whereof (right honourable) you
haue heard before alleaged, both by the Iewes vnto
Pilate: namely, that our Sauiour Chriſte Ieſus, is a
deadly enemie vnto Ceſar, and alſo by Rehum, and
the men beyond the riuer vnto Artaxerxes. For as
they noted, the building of the true church of God
cannot chuſe, but be an hindrance vnto princes. For
Ieruſalem is knowne of olde to be a rebellious ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But remember then, O my God, if they belong
not vnto thee, that thus ſlander the trueth, and the
vpright ordinances of thy ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, and if
they be thine, conuert them ſpeedily. My Lords, &amp;
you the reſt of the parliament, as you haue any care
of the glory of your God, ſee that the enemies of
reformation, may either deciſt from their forgerie
againſt the trueth, or prooue their accuſations. The
Lord will judge you, euen as you judge his cauſe,
now offered vnto your conſideration. Wherefore as
you will anſwer before him, &amp; as you mean to haue
any fauor at his hand, deliuer the cauſe of his ſonne
Chriſt Ieſus from this ignomie.</p>
            <p>There is yet in this point, another fault founde
with the gouernment of Chriſte,<note place="margin">It is reaſon that all ſtates should be maintained ſauing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat of chriſts kingdome.</note> and another great
reaſon alleaged, why the hierarchie of Bb. ſhoulde
be maintained: and it is, that the one of the 3. ſtates
vpon the authoritie, whereof the lawes of England
haue hitherto ſtood, cannot without great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
be now ouerthrowen. Wherevnto the Lord
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1294:18"/>
replieth, that the goſpell of his ſonne, was brought
into this kingdome by the 2. Eſtates, to wit, by the
temporall Lords of the vpper, and the commons of
the lower houſe: whereas ſince a thirde Eſtate, vz.
Lords ſpirituall (as they are called) was added vnto
the 2. former, little or no good hath bene enacted
for the glorye of God by that counſell. And if our
State had bene contented, according to the order of
nature, to ſtand vpon two legs, it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that all the wounds and ſores of our church
had bene healed, and Chriſts diſcipline long ago e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
to our comfort, and to the vnſpeakeable
good of our poſterities. Moreouer, the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
aſſuredly, becauſe of this monſtrous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
leg: wherevpon our lawes vnto this day, are
falſly ſaid to haue ſtood, and by the power whereof,
all the world knoweth, this kingdom to haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the right of his ſoone, to laye our whole ſtate
euen with the grounde, ſo that it ſhall haue nothing
whereby it may be vpheld. And L. Bb. haue no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intereſt to vphold our lawes then Lorde Abbots
haue. The ſtate may as well want the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with as ſmall inconvenience.</p>
            <p>There is added as a concluſion of theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,<note place="margin">T. C. pa. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that it is dangerous to pick quarrels with
lawes ſetled: but there is no daunger to quarrell
with the lawes of Chriſts kingdome. They of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ouerthrowne, and troaden vnder feete without all
danger, and yet in our ſtate are they no quarrellers,
that abuſe the ſonne of God. The time will come,
wherein it ſhall appeare, that it had bene better for
all ſuch wretches, that the wombe had beene their
graue, then that they ſhould haue bene giuen ouer
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1294:19"/>
to runne into their owne deſtruction. Our ſtate
hath well profited in religion, that nowe after 31.
yeares of the goſpell enjoyed,<note place="margin">T. C. p. 92. 93</note> Ieſus Chriſte in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding

ſet downe page 92. 93. of this booke concerning the
likelihood of altering our ciuill gouernment into a

and alſo of excommunication by the whole
Church, are meer cauils, and anſwered before in the
generall, and therefore here, needleſſe to be ſtoode
vpon.</p>
            <p>Now the high court of parliament hath heard of
all the iniquitie that can be found in the Lord, and
his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus and you haue heard of all the
reaſons (your careles and wilfull negligence to deal
in the Lords matters onely expected) whereby hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
you haue bene enduced to refuſe the church-gouernment,
which he himſelfe hath laid downe &amp;
preſcribed in his word, and to imbrace in ſteed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
a confuſed and an imperfect conſtitution of mans
deuiſe: whether theſe reaſons ſet downe by our Bb.
themſelues, will be a ſufficient warrant vnto you in
the day of judgement, to refuſe Chriſt Ieſus to rule
ouer you and your people, to maintaine the popiſhe
hierarchie of L. Bb. and to countenaunce their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges,
who are wholy beſtowed (for the moſt
part) in perſecuting and moleſting thoſe, who open
their mouthes in the cauſe of God and his people,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1294:19"/>
for the reſtitution of thoſe lawes and liberties into
our Church, whereof they haue tyrannouſly berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it. But if you thinke as the trueth is, that theſe
figge leaues, iſſuing out of the dark vnderſtandings
of wicked men, can ſerue you in no ſteed againſt the
wrath of the lambe. Enter more narrowly into this
cauſe, grant the ſame, and thoſe that ſtande in it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
againſt their enemies, leaſt it be layde to your
charge, that you haue called good euill, and euill
good, and leſt it be laid to your charge, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
your owne wayes equall, and the wayes of the
Lord vnequall, &amp; that you haue executed no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no not the judgement which concerneth the
ſincere and true worſhip of the eternal. Vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of my cauſe, which yet (as ye ſee) is not mine,
but the Lords, let this alſo be joyned, that mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie
can lay nothing to my charge, wherby I can
be proued to haue broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any penal law of the land.
I doe thinke my ſelfe in the cauſe, wherin the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
and the reſt, that are joyned with him, are
become mine enemies, to haue incurred, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of non of our laws, inaſmuch, as I haue not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
the lawe of God. For I ſuppoſe my ſelfe to
liue in that ſtate, the laws whereof are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of no force, which make him puniſhable, whoe
before the Lord is an innocent and guiltleſſe. The
duty of a chriſtian ſubiect draweth from me this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
that our ſtate and gouernment vnder her
maieſtie, eſtabliſhed by the authority of this houſe,
wil not account any lawe to be forcible, but that
which is agreeable with the law of God, and that,
non are puniſhable by any lawe in force amonge vs,
but thoſe only, who are offenders againſt the lawes
of God. For with what face can it be auouched,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1294:20"/>
that he is to be puniſhed, againſt whome the Lord
doth not commaunde the ſword to be drawne. And
thriſe miſerable is that ſtate, wherein theſe lawes
are in force, which commaund them to be ſmitten,
which are not euel doers. Of which number non are
to be accounted, ſaue thoſe only who by violating
humane poſitiue lawes, break alſo the lawe of God.
They that hold the contrary, are not worthy to liue
in a chriſtian ſtate. They highly derogate from her
maieſties credit, and the good lawes of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And non can poſſibly hold ſuch a poſition, but
thoſe, that vnder a pretence of authority, either doe
or would take occaſion to oppreſſe, and tiraunize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
her maieſties ſubiects, Nowe mine accuſers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proue me to haue broken the lawe of God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the ouerthrowe of their places, vntil they haue
firſt prooued their own callings to be lawful, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word, vnto which time, if I could haue
bin aſſured of quietnes at their hands, this mine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
had bene needleſſe.</p>
            <p>Whereas nowe I am of neceſſitie conſtrayned
thereunto as wel for the reaſon before mentioned,
as alſo, becauſe I can nether haue aſſurance of ſafety,
nor juſt trial at their hands. I can hope for nether of
theſe from them. For they haue wholly vowed them
ſelues with all their might and maine, to ſlaunder,
aſſaile, reſiſt, and hinder, the cauſe of Gods honor,
the ſaluation of his church, in the defence whereof,
farbeit but I ſhould ſpend my bloud (as by the grace
of God I will) when I am thereunto neceſſarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
wherefore except ether mine aduerſaries (which
I hartily wiſh) would leaue the ſmothering of the
trueth, and the vnjuſt defence of their intollerable
corruptions, or that I ſhould ſurceaſe, (which I truſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1294:20"/>
ſhal neuer come to paſſe) mine indeuours, to haue
the Goſpel planted in my country, and the houſe of
God cleanſed from pollution, I can look for nothing
elſe but al extremities at their hands.</p>
            <p>Heereby alſo it is manifeſt, that theſe men wil be
ſo far, from graunting me either any releaſe from
their tirannous Perſecution, or yet equity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
as they cannot poſſibly yeeld either of the
twoe, without the dangerous inpairing of their own
ſtate. My courſe by the aſſiſtance of God I meane
not to alter. The cauſe of my poore country, I mean
to reſpect as long as I liue, and neuer meane to giue
ouer, the diſcouering of thoſe wicked men, who in
this cleare light of the Goſpel, detaine the trueth in
vnrighteouſnes.<note place="margin">In my ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the parliament.</note> If I may haue (rather if Chriſt Ieſus
may haue) juſtice againſt them, I haue lately proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vnto you, that not one of theſe men, (I meane
Lord biſhops, and whoſoeuer depend vppon them)
ought to be maintained within theſe domminions.
Nowe ſeeing both the obtaining and alſo the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this ſuite, muſt needs be joyned with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of the Archbiſhop of Canterburies eſtate &amp;
the reſt in commiſſion with him, who ſitt in theſe
vnlawful chaires of Lord biſhops, or any wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vppon them, how can they without their owne
irrecouerable loſſe adminiſter juſtice or graunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
vnto me? Doe they meane to yeeld vnto the
knowne trueth, and to giue ouer their places? Why
then am I moleſted by them? Doe they meane to be
ſtil the men, which hytherto they haue bene, that is
enemies vnto Chriſts holy diſcipline, and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Then cannot they poſſibly affoard me any vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
triall. For if they ſhould, the church of God
would be ſoone disburdened of them. And in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1294:21"/>
they cannot let me go on quietly in my courſe,
for the more the trueth is opened, the neerer are
they to their fall. My cauſe being thus, what may be
ſaide of the parliament, if I be not releeued by your
meanes, in my moſt equal, moſt reaſonable, and moſt
chriſtian ſuite.</p>
            <p>Yea but ſeeing mine aduerſaries, are ſo mighty,
as they are knowne to be, and this ſuite ſo vnl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kely
to preuaile againſt them in our dayes, were it not
better forme, to let them runn on in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
then thus to ſtriue to mine owne hinderance,
and extreame peril in a gainleſſe enterpriſe? And
what calling haue I to deale in this cauſe? That is it
I knowe that the Diuel would haue, euen to be lett
alone, and permitted quietly to cary all before him
at his owne pleaſure, without any controlement?
As though the ſtones of the ſtreet, had not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
calling to gainſay the wickedneſſe of men, when
the ſeruants of God are tongtied. And either it muſt
be ſaid, that ſinne at ſome age and time, hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to goe vncontroled, or that the meaneſt in
Gods church, may ſpeake in the behalfe of Gods
honor, when other men are ſilent, at the treading
thereof vnder foote. The general deſolution then,
and the oppreſſion of Gods church in my country,
joyned with the deepe ſilence of all other men, doe
make it lawful and warrantable for me, to ſeeke the
ouerthrowe of Sathans kingdome, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that I acknowledg my ſelfe, euery way vnfit for
ſo greate aworke. And if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord
to ſtir vp any of place, and guifts, to deale in the
cauſe, I would ſoone ſet my hand vppon my mouth
and be ſilent. But I hope that the Archbiſhop, and
his bretheren, are not growne to that paſſe, as they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1294:21"/>
will take the liberty to continue in vnlawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and to moleſt thoſe, that gainſay the badd
courſe, becauſe they ſee not what calling any one
man can haue to finde fault with their proceedings.
And I hope that you of the parliament, conſidering
the equity of my ſuit, wil vonchſafe me the hearing
in ſo reaſonable a petition.</p>
            <p>Conſider the matter which way you wil, and you
ſhal find mine Appellation on all parts to be juſt:
but eſpecially in regard of the proceedings of mine
aduerſaries. The conſideration whereof is not to be
ouerpaſſed by the parliament, if any portion of the
equitie, and juſtice, ſometimes floriſhing in that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
benowd therein remaining. Their vnlawful
proceedings appeare, firſt, in that they aſſume vnto
them ſelues, the hearing of thoſe cauſes, wherein
by vertue of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, they haue no warrant
to deale, whereat the parliament cannot winke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they would ſuffer an Anarchie to take roote
in our ſtate. This they doe in a double ſort. For firſt
as before hath bene ſet downe, they lay treaſon to
my charge, and therefore ſend for me by their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuants.
What hath the high commiſſion to doe,
with men ſuſpected of treaſon? Is the place at Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
now become the palor, where traitors ſhould
be araigned? The Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the
biſhops of London, Wincheſter, Doctor Coſin, &amp;c.
nowe become judges in thoſe cauſes? Whether they
incurr not the danger of lawe, by entering into ſuch
matters, as are not within the compaſſe of their
commiſſion, you of this honorable aſſembly are beſt
able to judge. The trueth is that the Archbiſhop,
&amp; his aſſociates, when I was examined before them
in the 29. yeare of her maieſties raigne, enforced
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1294:22"/>
me to cleare my ſelfe vppon mine oath, of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which they gaue out to be contained in the 40.
page of my booke at that time written vnto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Tollerate this courſe, and what parloure
or chamber may there be ſo priuate, wherein the
Archbiſhop and his aſſiſtants wil not arraigne their
ſeditious traitors as they faulſay account them.</p>
            <p>Secondly they preſume to determine of thoſe
ſuites, the hearing whereof are referred vnto the
higher courts, and ought not to be vſurped vppon
by inferiors, vntil the higher councels haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they will not determine of them. In this
point, I had triall of their dealing the laſt parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
At which time they preſumed contrary vnto
right and lawful cuſtome, and to the infringing of
the auncient liberties of this noble houſe, to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
vnto them ſelues, the determining and finall
ending of that ſuite, wherein I moued the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and not the high comiſſion. And they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
impriſoned me in the time of the parliament,
for becomming a ſuiter even in the cauſe of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that aſſembly whereas by the priuiledges of this
high counſel, I was not to be moleſted by any, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your ſeſſion, but only by your honors, vnto
whom I became a peticioner. It nothing preuailed
me to ſhewe the high commiſſioners, that I was a
ſuitor vnto the higheſt court in the land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be troubled by any inferior vnto them,
during the time of their aſſembly, for the ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I had thereunto preferred. Neither did
it any thing auaile me, to manifeſt it to be diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vnto this houſe, &amp; to their honors therein met
together, that they ſhould not be the judges of thoſe

The injury which at that time they offered vnto
the liberties of this honorable court, (to commit,
their tiranny to me wards) had not bene ſo intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vnleſſe they, who vſurped vnto them ſelues
the deciding of my cauſe, had bene al of them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

all parliament men at that inſtant. Now judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not againſt all right, that ſome fewe of the

in reſpect of manye, I might juſtly account the men

the judgement of a cauſe preferred publikely
vnto the whole parliament. The time hath beene,
wherein this high courte woulde not haue taken a

whether it ſtands not with the honor and credit of

their liberties thus infringed and diminiſhed, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior

            <p>But whether this be behoofefull vnto the ſtate or

be enforced vpon mine oath to accuſe my ſelfe. I am

cannot be denied vnto me with any reaſon. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our law affoordeth this equitie vnto knowne

is vnſpeakable, in conſtraining men to accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
Porcious Feſtus an heathen idolator, when
the Iewes woulde haue judgement againſt S. Paule,
before they had by witneſſes conuinced him of any
crime:<note place="margin">Act. 25. 16.</note> anſwered, as the holy ghoſte noteth, that it
was not the maner of the Romanes (being Gentils
and ignorant of the true God) for fauor to deliuer
any man to death, before that he which is accuſed
haue his accuſers before him, and haue place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himſelfe concerning the crime. And may not
the men, who profeſſe they know God, be aſhamed
in their own cauſe, for the fauor which they vnjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

they will not be their owne accuſers? And yet all

that as yet we know nothing wherewith you may

            <p>And will the high court of parliament ſuffer this
bloodie and tirannous inquiſition, to be practized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer within this kingdom? What can the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
inquiſitors of Spaine do more, then by this
ſnare, inueigle mens conſciences, &amp; conſtraine them
to ſpill their owne blood? It is wel knowne, that no
ſuch maner of iniquitie can be warranted vnto the
high commiſſion, by the poſitiue lawes of this land.
For in a criminall cauſe, they inforce no man to be
his owne accuſer. And againſt the law of God, (by
which no man ſhoulde be punniſhed vnder two or
three witneſſes) and of nature, all men knowe this
manner of proceeding to be. For admit that the law
of blaſphemie were now in force among vs, &amp; that
a man in the dayes of his iniquitie had blaſphemed
the God of Iſrael, were it not both againſt the lawe
of God and of nature (the Lorde hauing vouchſafed
him repentance of his ſinn, and in his prouidence ſo
diſpoſed of the fact, as no witneſſes could be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt him) were it not I ſaye, both againſt the
word and againſt nature, for him in this caſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelfe? And yet the Archb. and his fellow of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
would either impriſon a man <hi>ex officio,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the oathe in this point, or compell him to be
his owne vnnatural murtherer. O miſerable judges,
before whom a man muſt needes, either tranſgreſſe
the lawes of God and of nature, or thruſt himſelfe
into inevitable daunger. If they ſay, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed,
that without juſt cauſe of ſuſpition, they
will put no man to his oathe: therein they proteſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1294:25"/>
no more then the Iewes did in accuſing our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt, and the inquiſitors of Spaine, draw with
them in the ſame line. For the Iewes, they thought
much,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 30.</note> that Pilate ſhould demand of them, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
they coulde laye to our Sauiour Chriſtes
charge, and therefore ſaid vnto him, if he were not
an euill doer, we would not haue deliuered him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee. Where we may euidently ſee, the wiſedom
and diſcretion of the enemies of God and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauts
to be ſuch, as they neuer accuſe any man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vnto right, equitie &amp; conſcience. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Spaniſh inquiſition, it is well knowne,
that that holy houſe, conuenteth no man, without
great ſuſpition of hereſie. No more doe the high
commiſſion, offer an oath vnto anye, without great
cauſe, at the leaſt, without vehement ſuſpition of his
enimitie to Lord Bb. and their gouernment.</p>
            <p>And they are not only moſt injurious, in them
ſelues, but they commit the execution of their tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
proceedings vnto thoſe very often, whiche an
honeſt man would be aſhamed to entertaine in his
family. To haue a warrant for the apprehending,
and touching of whomeſoeuer it pleaſe you to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
is a charge of greate waighte, and ought not to
be committed vnto any, but vnto ſuch, as are known
to haue a rare and choiſe gouernment, ouer them ſelues.
Otherwiſe if a lewd and an vndiſcreete tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
fellowe, be armed with this overlarge and
vnbrideled commiſſion, is not vnlikely but he will
abuſe halfe the ſubiects hir maieſtie hath. And I
pray you, what is likely to inſue thereof? Euen this.
The intolerable vexation and bondage, of her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
free borne ſubiects and people, and in time it is
to be feared the great diſhonor, if not the contempt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1294:25"/>
of laweful authority it ſelfe. The Archb. of Cant.
with his colleagues, ſendeth abroad his warrant to
apprehend, whomeſoeuer the meſſenger therein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
doth ſuſpect. Ought not this waighty charge
to be very waightely handeled? What choiſe then
make they of the meſſenger? Surely Richard Walto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is a man fit for the purpoſe. For they know his good
behauiour, approued ſufficiency, and wiſdome to be
ſuch, as for his outragious lewdnes, diſhoneſty, and
want of gouernment ouer him ſelfe, amongſt all the
roiſters in this land, they could not choſe a more
knowne, and notorious lewd perſon, and more vnfit
for ſo waigh ie a charge to be the purſiuant, he was
ſomtimes bedle vnto a company in London, (of the
blacke Smithes I thinke.) The office though but
meane, yet was that company aſhamed, to haue a
perſon of that ſlanderous looſe behauiour for their
bedle, and therefore, for his detected crimes, heere
not to be named, they put him out of his place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſhamed to retaine him. And yet this is the man
Right honorable, vnto whoſe diſcretion the Archb. of
Cant. will commit the moleſting and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of whomſoeuer he ſhal ſuſpect. Admit that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ppes, ſom of his companions, doe bribe
him to apprehende the honeſteſt and beſt affected
ſubiect in a country, he may doe it by his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for his knowne lewdnes he is not vnlikely
to attempt the fact. The magiſtrate is to aſſiſt him.
And when he hath offered you this injury you haue
your amends in your hands, for he did no more then
by his commiſſion, he is warranted, &amp; thoſe who ſet
him a worke are the high commiſſioners, who haue
a prerogatiue aboue lawe, as they would beare the
world in hand. May not her maieſties ſubiects then,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1294:26"/>
thinke them ſelues to be in a good taking, when
their libertie ſhal depend vpon the pleaſure or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſuch as are the ofſcouring and refuſe of men.
And I doe thinke it neerely concerneth your Hh.
of the parliament, to ſee that this abuſe of the high
commiſſion by theſe men, be no longer tollerated
in our ſtate. For what care the high commiſſioners,
howe tirannouſly they deale with hir maieſties moſt
louing ſubiects, as long, as they hope that no mans
accuſation and complaint, howe juſt ſoeuer, though
in the behalfe of the intereſt of Chriſt Ieſus, can be
heard and countenanced againſt them? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are growne ſo inſolent, as they dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine
hir maieſties officers, either at their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to worke impoſſibilities, or vpon the peril
to anſwere the matter before them. Form this inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of theirs it is, that of late they haue in their
mandatory letters, enjoined the Major of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,
to ſurceaſe the execution of his office in the
gouernment of that towne vnder hir maieſtie, and
either to become their purſiuant, in apprehending
one of his neighbours, or elſe perſonally to appeare
before them at London, and not to departe their
court without ſpecial leaue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his affaires in her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
ſeruice,<note place="margin">M. Sharpe book binder of Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> and the diſtance of Place betweene
Northampton &amp; London, nothing conſidered. And
yet required they of him that which he coulde not
bring to paſſe, becauſe the party whome he was to
apprehend, being wel known to be a dutiful ſubiect,
and for the loue he beareth vnto Gods truth to haue
bene heeretofore ſo cruelly? dealt with at ſome of
their hands, by long impriſonment, and ſo euil dealt
with, as his cauſe comming to be heard before the
Ll. of her maieſties priuy counſel, their Hh. judged
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1294:26"/>
the biſhops proceeding againſt him, to be againſt
lawe and conſcience, and ſo were the meanes of his
deliuery, the party I ſay, nowe fearing the like inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that hee ſometimes taſted of, was compelled
with the hinderance of his family to abſent himſelf
from his calling. And from this hope, that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings
ſhal neuer com into queſtion, it alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
to paſſe, that they giue out that I am an Anabaptiſt,
an vnderminer of the chair of the magiſtrat, a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
&amp; a dangerus ſubiect many waies. For otherwiſe
they would neuer haue permitted by their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
any ſuch bookes to be publiſhed againſt me,<note place="margin">M. D. Some table page. 3. line 20.</note> yea
but I hold her maieſtie with many thouſandes of hir
beſt ſubiects to be vnbaptiſed,<note place="margin">M. D. Some Epiſt. pag. 2</note> and the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
maſter Doctor Some and me is, whether
ſuch as were and are baptiſed by popiſh prieſts and
vnpreaching miniſters haue and doe receiue a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If mine aduerſarie himſelfe had not cleared
me of this accuſation by his publike writings,<note place="margin">Page 53.</note> his
ſlander might at the leaſt haue bin probable, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
nowe his owne writings doe giue him and his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
the ſhameleſſe vntrueth. <hi>But howe can they be
held no miniſters, but that the Elements adminiſtred by
by them, ſhould be denied to be ſacraments?</hi> I truſt the
one may be held, &amp; the other not denied, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reaſon by far, then the Archb. of Cant. can hold
baptim deliuered by women, whome al the worlde
knowe not to be miniſters,<note place="margin">M. D. Some pag. 185. line 3. 31.</note> to be a ſacrament. And
howe wil maſter D. Some anſwere himſelfe in this
point, which hath confeſſed al vnpreching miniſters
both popiſh prieſts, and proteſtant Idoles, to be no
miniſters?<note place="margin">M. D. Some table pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>But it is an Anabaptistical error to account
magiſtracie for an human ordinance.</hi> As though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ordained by man could be Gods ordinance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1294:27"/>
Or that the places Rom. 12. 1. &amp; 1. Pet. 2. 13. were
irreconcileable? And that it were a more Anabaptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtcal,
and intollerable error in me, to affirme the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
and offices of the common wealth, to be
humaine conſtitutions, which is true then, for our
Biſhops to hould the gouerment, and offices of our
churches to be the ordinances of man, which is moſt
falſe? Theſe and al ſuch accuſations laid againſt me
and Gods trueth, as by the grace of God in mine
anſwere to maſter D. Some, which are it be long I
hope to publiſh, notwithſtanding they haue it in
their hands, they ſhalbe proued to be palpable ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.
So I do moſt humbly intreat you of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
aſſembly, in regard of the Lords eternal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
againſt which theſe vntrueths are giuen forth,
to ſee that either mine accuſers ſhall prooue theſe
crimes, wherewith I am charged, or ceaſe to ſlander
and trouble me for profeſſing the trueth. The cauſe
is the cauſe of God, as I haue proued, it is the cauſe
of the church, and ſo the cauſe of many thouſandes,
of the moſt truſty, moſt ſure, moſt louing ſubiects,
that her maieſtie hath, whoſe harts by the repelling
of this my ſuite, muſt needes be vtterly diſcouraged
and throwne downe? when they ſhal ſee the cauſe of
God to haue taken no place in the higheſt court in
the land. And being the cauſe of God &amp; his church,
and that againſt ſinne, againſt impietie, againſt that
which is likely to be the vndoing and ouerthrow of
her Majeſtie and our ſtate: it deſireth no fauor but
to be heard, and to cleare it ſelfe, euen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the aduerſarie, that vpon good groundes
you may either acquite it, or condemne it. It will
prooue it ſelfe by Gods aſſiſtance, to be the author
of no tumulte, no ſedition, nor treaſon. It will alſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1294:27"/>
prooue, that no danger or inconuenience, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
enſue the receiuing of it into any ſtate: &amp; that
the bookes and writinges, ſincerely fauouring the
ſame (for any vnſound, or any vnjuſtifiable bookes,
that haue bin publiſhed, which might ſeem to yeeld
any countenance vnto it, the cauſe is not to anſwer)
haue not bene invented of late, or ſtamped by mans
brain, but haue had their beginnings from the daies
of our Sauiour Chriſte, and his Apoſtles, and were
penned by the ſpirite of God himſelfe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
ſide, it offereth to conuince the aduerſaries
cauſe, as an author of tumult and ſedition from time
to time, both in Churche and common wealth, as
traiterous vnto the Majeſtie of Ieſus Chriſte, a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enemy vnto princes and ſtates, and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all confuſion and inconvenience, not to bee
repaired. And it offereth to prooue this cauſe &amp; ſide
of our Bb. to haue no other original and beginning,
then the good intents of mans invention, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the word, euen corruption it ſelfe. And to
be now ſupported and maintained, onely by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
inſtitutions of man.</p>
            <p>So that it is nowe manifeſted vnto your honors,
by how many waies you are bound before the Lord
to accept and giue eare vnto this mine appellation,
and I to appeale. Mine only hope is in you, be not
vnmerciful and pittileſſe towards me. I am perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and oppreſſed for the cauſe of God, by thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
that cannor poſſibly affoard me either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
judgment, or releaſe from trouble, without
their owne likely ouerthrowe. I deſire, but that
which is moſt chriſtian, namely that I may not haue
them both for mine acuſers and judges, who before
any ſeate of juſtice, dare not ſtand to their accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1294:28"/>
againſt me, and whome their proceedings with
me, and alwaies heretofore with the cauſe I defend,
doe manifeſtly conuince, that all trueth and equitie
is periſhed from among them. Either the cauſe, and
their doings haue no trueth, no ſtrength, and no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
in them, or elſe they wil now ſhe we the ſame
in your preſence, non haue authority to exammine
their proceedings, whether they dare this attempt
or no. I do heere before Heauen and earth, before
hir maieſtie and this aſſembly, before euery eſtate in
this land, and al ages to come, cleare my ſelfe, and
the cauſe I defend, from the grieuous and vngodly
ſlaunders, whereby they doe continually loade the
ſame. I offer my ſelfe, and my cauſe to be tried by
any lawful authoritie, ſo dare not mine aduerſaries,
let them proue that I haue done any thing whereby
in equitie I deſerue puniſhment, &amp; I will not grudge
to ſuſtaine the ſame: So that mine aduerſaries be
not my judges, and the judges of my cauſe, vnto
whom they cannot chuſe but be vtter enemies. I do
not here ſet downe all, that coulde be ſaide againſt
them, and their proceedings, which are moſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
and intollerable diuers wayes. I omit that
they are fallen from euill to worſe, ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her Majeſties raigne vnto this houre, and
that they are likely to proceed in this courſe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their reſtrainte) vntill they haue brought the
Lords hand to execute his vengeaunce againſt vs &amp;
our land. Their errours are growne intollerable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the maine pointes of religion, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
not onely vnto the written word of God: but
euen to the writings, that haue bene and are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by authoritie, euen by themſelues. They allow
a forme of morning prayer, joyned vnto all printed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1294:28"/>
Pſalmes in meeter, allowed alſo by publike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Therein it is flatly and expreſly ſet downe, that
it is not poſſible for anye man ordinarily to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but by preaching: and yet behold theſe men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
our Bb. eſpecially the Archb. of Cant. haue and
doe maintaine, that men may heare, beleeue, and ſo
ordinarily be ſaued without preaching. And by the
practize of this monſtrous errour,<note place="margin">Rom 10. 14. 1.</note> contrarie to the
word of God,<note place="margin">Cor. 1. 21.</note> contrarie vnto the eſtabliſhed,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 21.</note> &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged
doctrine, allowed and practized in this
kingdom in the beginning of her Majeſties raigne.
They are the verye knowne cauſe of the perdition
(without the Lordes ſecreete and vnreuealed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
of infinit thouſandes of ſoules in this land. But
although I ſay, that in their vngodly proceedings,
they neither agree with the Lord and his word: nor
with themſelues and the receiued and eſtabliſhed
doctrine in our Church: yet I do here omit to make
any catalog of their damnable errors and practiſes.
