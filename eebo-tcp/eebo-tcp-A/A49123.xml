            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in GOD
THOMAS
LORD BISHOP
OF
EXETER.</head>
                  <p>IT was propheſied of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
that <hi>the Government ſhould
be upon his ſhoulders,</hi> Iſ. 9. 6. and
though he have devolved that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon mortal men, which is
<hi>Angelicis humeris formidandum,</hi> yet
doth he <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his ſhoulder and help them to
bear it, or they would ſoon ſink
<pb facs="tcp:97676:4"/>
under it. For however it fares
with the Church, whether it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
perſecution, none are ſo much
expoſed to a fiery trial as they; or
whether it enjoy peace and plenty.
Pride and contention ſwels up ſome
corrupt members to the daily vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of their Heads &amp; Governors.
And how blameleſs ſoever their
Perſons be, their Office is made a
Crime.</p>
                  <p>Better things might have been
expected from the Author of the
Treatiſe hereafter conſidered,
wherein there is ſo much contempt
poured out upon the Epiſcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and on all Church authority
and adminiſtrations, that the Ink
is not more black than the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But where ſhould the <hi>impetus</hi>
of diſcontent and faction vent it
ſelf, but againſt thoſe rocks that are
ſet by God Himſelf to give check
and bounds unto it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97676:4"/>
Now that in the Apoſtles days
this ſacred Order was appointed
(among other great ends) as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
againſt Schiſm, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by ſuch as are its reputed
Adverſaries: <q>In the Church of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> from the time of St.
<hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt they were
continued as a bulwork againſt
Schiſm,</q> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> 
                     <q>And in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to ſay, <hi>I am of Paul and I of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
this Office was appointed,
that the ſeeds of Schiſm might be
taken away,</q> ſaith the ſame Father
on the firſt Chap. to <hi>Titus.</hi> And
he tells the <hi>Luciferians</hi> in a Dialogue
with them, <q>That unleſs an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and uninterrupted power be
by all given to the chief Paſtors,
there will be as many ſchiſms as
there are Prieſts.</q> In all this St.
<pb facs="tcp:97676:5"/>
                     <hi>Hierom</hi> followeth the more ancient
Fathers—<hi>Paſſibus aequis,</hi> for <hi>Ignatius</hi>
adviſed the <hi>Trallians</hi> to do nothing
without their Biſhop. Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he repeating again, tells them:
<q>It is not my word, but the Word
of God; and if ye ſuſpect me to
ſay this, as underſtanding that
there are Diviſions among you, he
is my witneſs for whom I am in
bonds, that it was not man, but the
Spirit that declared this to me.</q>
St. <hi>Clemens</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.
p.</hi> 57. ſays, <q>That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
foreſeeing that Diviſions
would ariſe as Chriſt had foretold,
did eſtabliſh Biſhops.</q> And the
32. Canon of the Apoſtles ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>That if any Presbyter or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
ſhould make conventions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Biſhop, he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</q>
In the 4th. Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> conſiſting
<pb facs="tcp:97676:5"/>
of 630. Fathers, there was read
an Ancient Canon of the Council
of <hi>Antioch</hi> to this effect: <q>If any
Presbyter or Deacon contemning
his Biſhop ſhall ſeparate and erect
another Altar, and will not obey
the Biſhop, calling him home
once and again, we do utterly
condemn ſuch a one.</q> Which
Canon being read by <hi>Aetius</hi> an
Arch-Deacon, the Fathers with
one conſent proclaimed This is a
righteous Canon of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
In the Second Council of
<hi>Carthage</hi> by the Eighth Canon it
was provided, <q>That if any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
lifted up with pride ſhould
make a Schiſm againſt his Biſhop,
let him be accurſed.</q> But in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of all theſe Canons and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they have been accounted the
only bleſſed Men in our times,
who have moſt vehemently decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:97676:6"/>
this holy Order, and ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
maintained a Faction againſt
them. To whom, if they are yet
capable of any Counſel, I would
commend the moderation of Mr.
<hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſpeaking of Popiſh
Biſhops, <hi>Inſtit. l. 4. c. 10. S.</hi> 6.
ſaith, <q>If they were true Biſhops,
I would yield them though not
ſo much authority as they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
yet as much as is requiſite
for the well-ordering of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Government.</q> And what
he means by <hi>true Biſhops</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
<hi>S.</hi> 1. <q>The form of the
Ancient Church ſets before our
eyes a pattern of the Divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
for the order of governing
his Church. For though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of thoſe times did ſet forth
many Canons, in which they
ſeemed to expreſs more than was
expreſſed in the Holy Scripture;
<pb facs="tcp:97676:6"/>
yet they compoſed their whole
Oeconomy with ſuch caution, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that only rule of God's
Word, that you may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that they held nothing in
this reſpect differing from the
Word of God.</q> And in <hi>S.</hi> 4.
he repeats the ſame: <hi>Si rem intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emur,
reperiemus veteres Epiſcopos non
alium regendae Eccleſiae formam voluiſſe
fingere ab eâ quam Deus verbo ſuo
praeſcripſit.</hi> With how much truth
and reverence doth this Learned
man ſpeak of thoſe ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
of whom he ſays not only
that they <hi>did not</hi> actually ſwerve
from God's Word as to their
Government, but that they <hi>would
not.</hi> This Candor is much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſuch as pretend to be Mr.
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Diſciples, with whom
this Sacred Function and all its
Adminiſtrations are defamed as
<pb facs="tcp:97676:7"/>
Antichriſtian and Popiſh, and a
Covenant for extirpating them
root and branch is ſtill pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
adhered to. But though the
authority of theſe men be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yet methinks that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
who hath made them his
Ambaſſadors, (and <hi>Apoſtolus cujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
is eſt quiſque</hi>) and hath told us,
<hi>Luke 10. 16. He that heareth you,
heareth me; he that deſpiſeth you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
me, and he that deſpiſeth me
deſpiſeth him that ſent me]</hi> ſhould
not be rejected, nor thoſe ſevere
penalties under which he exacts
our obedience to his Officers be
ſlighted. For whoever <hi>will not
hear the Church, is to be accounted
as a Heathen or Publican:</hi> and <hi>Mark
6. 11. Whoſoever ſhall not receive you
nor hear you—It ſhall be more tolerable
for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of
Judgment than for them.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:97676:7"/>
though wicked men do ſecurely
deſpiſe the cenſures of the Church,
yet hath Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18.
of his Officers, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall
bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
which authority the Church
of God would not have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the pureſt and moſt primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times by ſo many and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Anathema's, if their great Lord
had not authorized them, or if
they had not experienced the good
effects of them. Did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in vain derive a power to the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Epiſt ch. 5.
v. 5. <hi>In the name of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt to deliver ſuch a one</hi> (as the
Inceſtuous perſon) <hi>unto Satan for
the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the
ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of our
Lord Jeſus?</hi> Or can we think the
Records of the ſeveral Churches
in thoſe firſt Ages, which relate
<pb facs="tcp:97676:8"/>
the divers painful and languiſhing
Diſtempers of Body, as well as
the anguiſh and trouble of Mind,
which ſeized on ſuch as by the
Cenſures of the Church were caſt
out of Chriſtian communion into
the power of Satan, to be falſe
or forged? The Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which purſue ſuch as in our
times have been deſervedly eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

for it. I have only endeavoured
(as I was able) to ſilence the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and contradictions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Men, by whoſe ſtrivings
the burden of Government, which
of it ſelf is weighty enough, is
made to ſit more uneaſie on the

Againſt whom, it is no difficult
work to maintain that aſſertion of

<q>That as long as any particular

<pb facs="tcp:97676:9"/>
to his Canonical Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
ſo long the departure of any

                  <p>when all other arguments have failed, to
cut the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot of our preſent peace
and unity in pieces.</p>
                  <p>It is my endeavour by the following
Exercitations to take this Sword out of
the Enemies hands, or at leaſt to blunt
the edge of it, and make it unſerviceable
to evil deſigns. When I firſt apprehended
it, I only let it fall on the Anvil by its
own weight, and every one may perceive
how it yielded to that gentle Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
wherefore I was encouraged by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
cenſure to lay it on the Anvil again,
and I hope with a few strokes I have ſo
broken it, that there is ſcarce an Artist
among the Factions can ſo ſolder it, as
to make it hurtful or formidable again.
I could wiſh they would at last turn this
and other ſuch Swords into Plow-ſhares,
as Men of Evangelical Spirits ought to
do, and ſtudy to be quiet, and do their
own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>But I think it not enough to deprive
our Adverſaries of this Weapon, I ſhall
attempt to vindicate the fame and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Venerable Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> of
whoſe authority, the Churches adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do often make uſe to the maintenance
<pb facs="tcp:97676:10"/>
of Faction against her, as ſometime they
did of the King's for raiſing a Rebellion
against Him.</p>
                  <p>It is an aggravation of ſorrow, that
the Church, like the Eagle, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its moſt dangerous wounds by the
darts which are feathered from her own
wing. And that that learning and piety,
which is wanting in the adverſe party,
to inforce their own arguments, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their cauſe, ſhould be ſupplied by the
Revolt (as in the Apoſtates to Popery)
or the Captivity (as in the caſe of Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi>) of ſome unſetled and unwary Sons
of the Church, of whoſe parts and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
the Enemies on both ſides have
made more advantage than of their
own.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the beginning and
growth of Errors and Schiſmes, when
Men of ſubtile parts, and popular eſteem,
raiſe doubts and arguments againſt the
truth, and inſtill them into weaker judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and unſtable minds, who are apt
for want of underſtanding to take their
Sophiſtry for ſolid reaſoning, and through
affection to their Perſons, to adhere to
them, as to the most faithful guides,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:11"/>
and—<hi>jurare in verba magiſtri.</hi> But it is
a very prepoſterous method to judge of the
cauſe according to the reputation of ſuch
as eſpouſe it. <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine gives us a
ſafer rule, <hi>nec cauſa cauſae, nec per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona
perſonae praejudicet,</hi> Let both cauſes,
and perſons, ſtand or fall according to
their own merit.</p>
                  <p>That little which I can gather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> (all which and a great
deal more, I charitably believe he did well
deſerve) is to this effect compiled by
Mr. <hi>Lloid</hi> in his <hi>Memoires p.</hi> 606. In
writing of which it ſeems he conſulted
the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Faringdon</hi> his familiar friends.
<q>Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> was born in <hi>Kent,</hi> and bred
Fellow of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, where he
was choſen Greek Profeſſor of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
Sir <hi>Dudley Carleton</hi> made him his
Chaplain, when he was at the <hi>Hague;</hi>
about the buſineſs of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi>
whereof (being ſent thither to that
purpoſe) he wrote a daily and exact
account, completed, as appears in his
<hi>Remains,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Balcanquel.</hi> At
which Synod, he hearing <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>
well preſſing as he thought that of
<pb facs="tcp:97676:11"/>
Saint <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. he ſaid, <hi>There I
bad</hi> John Calvin <hi>good night.</hi> After
this he was Fellow of <hi>Eaton,</hi> and then
Prebendary of <hi>Windſor,</hi> in the firſt
of which places he was Treaſurer, but
(which is ſtrange) ſuch was his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and charity) to his loſs in point of
Eſtate; And Fellow (ſuch his prudence
in avoiding the Oaths of the times)
without any ſnare to his Conſcience. A
perſon of ſo large a capacity, ſo ſharp,
quick, piercing and ſubtile a wit, of ſo
ſerene and profound a judgment beyond
the ordinary reach, built upon unordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
notions, raiſed out of ſtrange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
and comprehenſive thoughts
within himſelf, and of ſo aſtoniſhing an
induſtry, that he became the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
maſter of polite various and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
learning, beſides a deep inſight
into Religion: In the ſearch after which
he was curious, and of the knowledge
of it ſtudious, as in the practice of it
he was ſincere. And as ſtrictly juſt in
his dealings, ſo he was extraordinarily
kind, ſweet, affable, communicative,
humble and meek in converſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitably
as well as unuſually charitable,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:12"/>
giving away all that he had but his
choice books, and was forced to ſell them
at laſt. He was as good a man as he
was a great Scholar, and as Biſhop
<hi>Pearſon</hi> ſaid of him, It was near as
eaſie a task for any one to become as
knowing, as ſo obliging. He had ſo
long and with ſuch advantage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality
judged of all books, things and
men, that he was the Oracle conſulted
by all the learned men of the Nation,
Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
&amp;c. in caſes that concerned either.
Whereupon he uſed to ſay of learned mens
letters, <hi>That they ſet up tops, and
he muſt whip them for them.</hi> There
are no monuments of his learning (ſave
the great Scholars made by his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and aſſiſtance) extant, but Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Savil</hi>'s <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> which he
corrected with great paines in his
younger dayes, and illuſtrated with
admirable notes, (for which he is often
honourably mentioned by Mr. <hi>Andrew
Downs</hi> Greek Profeſſor of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>)
and a Collection of ſome choice
Sermons and Letters made by Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait.</hi>
He was very tender of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:97676:12"/>
any but himſelf, and never ſpake
with complacency of any of his own works,
but his Sermon intitled <hi>Dixi, Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam,</hi>
on Pſalm 36. 1. </q>(And indeed
had he been as good at the <hi>Cuſtodiam,</hi>
as he was at the <hi>Dixi,</hi> he had been an
incomparable man.) <q>For Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi>
in his Preface to his <hi>Remains</hi> ſaith,
He was a man of as great ſharpneſs,
quickneſs and ſubtilty of wit, as ever
this, or perhaps any Nation bred. His
Induſtry did ſtrive if it were poſſible to
equal the largeneſs of his capacity. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to his reading was his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which furniſhed him with a
judgment beyond the vulgar reach of
man. So that he really was a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
example, of an acute and piercing
wit, of a vaſt and illimited knowledge,
of a ſevere and profound judgment. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this may ſeem, as in it ſelf it
truly is, a grand <hi>Eulogium,</hi> yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſteem him leſs in any thing which
belongs to a good man, than in thoſe
intellectual perfections. And had he
never underſtood a Letter, he had other
ornaments ſufficient to endear him. As
a Chriſtian, none ever more acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:97676:13"/>
with the nature of the Goſpel, becauſe
none more ſtudious of the knowledge of
it, or more curious in the ſearch: which
being ſtrengthned by thoſe great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
before mentioned, could not prove
otherwiſe than highly effectual. He
took indeed to himſelf a liberty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not of others but for himſelf. And
if ever any man might be allowed in
theſe matters to judge, it was he who
had ſo long, ſo much, ſo advantagiouſly
conſidered, and which is more, never
could be ſaid to have the leaſt worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in his determinations. He was
not only moſt truly and ſtrictly juſt in
his ſecular tranſactions, moſt exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
meek and humble notwithſtanding
his perfections, but beyond all example
charitable, giving unto all, preſerving
nothing but his books to continue his
learning, and himſelf; which when
he had before digeſted, he was forced at
laſt to feed upon; at the ſame time the
happieſt and moſt unfortunate <hi>Helluo</hi> of
books, the grand Exemplar of learning,
and of the envy and contempt which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
it. None was more ſolicited to
write, and thereby to teach the world,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:13"/>
than he; yet none more reſolved againſt
it; yet did he not hide his Talent, being
ſo communicative, that his Chamber
was a Church and his Chair a Pulpit.</q>
So far Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> who teſtifieth alſo,
that of all the Sermons, Miſcellanies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
then publiſhed for his, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
they were his.</p>
                  <p>And now you ſee the reaſon, why Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi> (the famed Author of ſuch a work)
was ſo highly eſteemed by the Brethren
of the Factions, as that ſuch, of either
the Presbyterian or Independent faction,
as defended their diviſions and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
made him their <hi>Coryphaeus,</hi> he
being for parts and learning, head and
ſhoulders above the talleſt of them. The
Treatiſe was printed, as I find, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. and although
I am of the mind, that by the weakneſs
of the Arguments, the Author intended
rather to betray than defend the Schiſm,
yet the Separatiſts wanting better reaſons,
made a great noiſe with theſe, as if they
were juſtified in their Schiſm by this work,
notwithſtanding the demerits of their
own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97676:14"/>
The fame of this and ſome other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of our Author came to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of that great Lover of learning,
and learned men, Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who
ſent for him on purpoſe to admoniſh him
of his faults; and he being come to the
Palace in the morning, the Arch-biſhop
preſently gives order to delay Dinner,
(probably that he might have the more
time for diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>) and
taking him to his Garden with him, they
continued their conference for ſome hours;
after which they were very good friends,
the Arch-biſhop studying to prefer him,
and he praying for the Arch-biſhop as his
Chaplain. And whereas he had been
heard to ſay in his former days, that he
thought he ſhould never dye a Martyr,
yet he was known to live a Confeſſor, and
if we will believe Mr. <hi>Marvel,</hi> he dyed
little leſs than a Martyr for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Diſcipline of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> being by the enemies thereof
deprived of all his livelihood, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſuch extremities as did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the ſhortning of his days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97676:14"/>
Dr. <hi>Heylen</hi> in the Life of the Arch-Biſhop,
tells us of another Book, called
<hi>Diſquiſitio brevis,</hi> aſcribed to Mr.
<hi>Hales,</hi> in which ſome of the principal
<hi>Socinian</hi> Tenents were cunningly inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
pretending them for the best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
to appeaſe ſome controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and <hi>Rome.</hi> And that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Schiſm not then Printed, was
tranſmitted from hand to hand in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Copies, intended chiefly for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of our great Maſters of wit
and reaſon to deſpiſe the Authority of the
Church, the diſperſing of which gave
the Arch-Biſhop occaſion to ſend for him
to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> And that the Arch-biſhop
knew his abilities while he lived in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
For (Dr. <hi>Heylen</hi> ſays) he was a
man of infinite reading and no leſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
free of diſcourſe, and as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
of his knowledge as the celeſtial
bodies of their light and influences. And
that after the diſcourſe above intimated,
which continued from Nine of the Clock
till the uſual time of Dining, was past,
and the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Honor being there, ſome of the
Servants thought it neceſſary to give him
<pb facs="tcp:97676:15"/>
notice how the time had paſſed away; and
then coming in high coloured and almost
panting for want of breath, enough to
ſhew there had been ſome heats between
them, Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> met with Dr. <hi>Heylen,</hi>
with whom he was acquainted, told him
that he found the Arch-biſhop (whom he
knew before to be a nimble Diſputant) to
be as well verſed in Books as buſineſs;
That he had been ferreted by him from
one hole to another, till there was none
left to afford him further ſhelter; That
he was now reſolved to be Orthodox, and
to declare himſelf a true Son of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> both for Doctrine
and Diſcipline, <hi>p.</hi> 361, 362.</p>
                  <p>If it be demanded why our Author did
not refute this Tract in his life-time; I
anſwer 1. he did do it as effectually as the
Philoſopher confuted him that denied
motion, when he aroſe from his ſeat, and
walked up and down before him; for his
long profeſſion, and practice, contrary to
what was there written, was <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
contraria facto.</hi> 2. The Tract car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
its confutation with it, as appears
in the examination. 3. It's not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb facs="tcp:97676:15"/>
that he foreſaw how it might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Royal Party, whom their
adverſaries had begun to revile and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
as <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts:</hi> and
in ſome caſes, poyſon well tempered and
rightly applied may become medicinal.
4. He might be confident ſuch weak ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as he made uſe of, though they
might pleaſe the factious multitude who
knew no better, yet they could do no great
hurt among Judicious men. And becauſe
we cannot gueſs at the Author's aim,
which is ſecret, we ought to judge by his
actions which were publick. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> made uſe of a like Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to break the Presbyterian power,
and to countenance Diviſions between the
Factions, which were too much united
against the Loyal Clergy: for in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Propheſying, he inſiſts on the
ſame Topicks of Schiſm and Hereſie, of
the incompetency of Councils and Fathers
to determine our Eccleſiaſtical controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and of ſcrupulous Conſciences, and
urgeth far more cogent arguments than
our Author did, but still he had prepared
his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an Antidote to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any dangerous effect of his diſcourſe.
<pb facs="tcp:97676:16"/>
Not unlike to ſome Mountebanks (Pardon
the Compariſon) who to amuſe the vulgar,
and to effect their own ends do admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to their <hi>Merry-Andrews</hi> a certain
Doſe of Poiſon, but immediately give
them ſuch an Antidote as cauſeth them to
cast it up again, and hinders the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
operation of it. For the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reader may perceive ſuch a reſerve
(though it lay in Ambuſcado, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
in a narrow compaſs) as may eaſily
rout thoſe Troops, which began too ſoon
to cry <hi>Victoria,</hi> and thought of nothing
elſe but dividing the Spoil. And if the
learned Biſhop did this and was blameleſs,
the goodneſs of the End in ſuch caſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominating
the Action, I ſee no cauſe why
our Author, whoſe ends (as we ought in
charity to believe, conſidering the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of the Perſon) were for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of peace, ſeeing he repreſented the
cauſes of War ſo frivolous and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
ought to be repreſented as a Criminal
or adverſary.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have endeavoured to reſcue
the Author's Perſon, as well as his Papers
from the Enemies tents, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:97676:16"/>
advice of <hi>Tully</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Muraena,
Tolle Catonem de Causâ,</hi> that by any
means he ſhould take off <hi>Cato</hi> from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
as an Enemy, or an Evidence
against him, leſt the Opinion of <hi>Cato</hi>'s
vertues ſhould create him more prejudice,
than the strength of his Arguments were
like to do.</p>
                  <p>I have only to acquaint the Reader that
the reaſon why in the following Cenſure
I have ſometime named the Author as
diſtinct from Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> is becauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is applied by too many to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
as the Author never thought of;
and as the Epigrammatiſt ſaith of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating,
ſo ſhall I ſay of ill applying other
mens books,
<q>—Malè dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot certainly calculate the time
when this Tract of Schiſm was first
penned, but I ſuppoſe it to be about
Forty Years ſince, it being quoted by
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> in his Anſwer to
<hi>Knott,</hi> which wants but little of that
age. And unleſs my conjecture, and
<pb facs="tcp:97676:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
credible information do both fail me,
the occaſion on which it was written
was this: Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
were of intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and beſide a conſtant correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by Letters they had frequent
converſe with each other, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> came
ſo far in his Anſwer as to Vindicate
our Church from Schiſm which was
charged on her by <hi>Knott,</hi> He conſulted
with Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> concerning the nature
of Schiſm, and after diſcourſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> to write his thoughts
about it, which he did in this Tract,
out of which Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ſome arguments, which I think are
the worst in all his Book. Sure I am
that they cauſed ill reflections not only
on the private reputation of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> but on the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if that did fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Infidelity Unmasked</hi> writing
against Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> tells him
that his arguments concerning Schiſm
were conceits borrowed from a Letter
of Mr. <hi>John Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> written
<pb facs="tcp:97676:17"/>
to a private Friend of his (as I am
credibly informed, ſaith that Author,
by a Perſon well known to them both
at that time, and who ſaw the Letter
it ſelf.) And he farther affirms, of
his own certain knowledge, that Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi> was of a very inconſtant judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
One Year (for Example ſays he)
doubting of, or denying the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and the next Year profeſſing and
adoring the ſame. And another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in a Pamphlet called the <hi>Total
Summ,</hi> written against Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
reviles him on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in theſe words. In this you ſhew
the Adamantinal hardneſs of your <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
forehead and <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
The truth is, that ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
borrowed. from the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
and urged firſt by Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> and from
him by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to that imputation. But as for
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> he had ſufficiently
ſecured his reputation in the Preface
of his Book, where he thus profeſſeth:
I believe the Doctrine of the Trinity,
the Deity of our Saviour, and all other
<pb facs="tcp:97676:18"/>
Supernatural verities received in the
Scripture, as truly and as heartily as
any man. And whereas he dyed in the
Faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he
hath given aſſurance that he was then
no <hi>Socinian.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was when he wrote this Tract
of Schiſm, and ſome others, yet as his
Adverſary ſays, he did afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
and adore the bleſſed Trinity. And
for the Reader's ſatisfaction, as well
as for Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his Vindication, I ſhall
tranſcribe that account which he gives
of his Faith concerning the Trinity in
his <hi>Golden Remains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Mr. HALES's Confeſſion of the

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Summ of whatever either the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

is compriſed in theſe few Lines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD is One, numerically one,
more one than any ſingle Man is one,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:18"/>
if Unity could <hi>ſuſcipere magis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
yet God is ſo One, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of diſtinction, and ſo admits of
diſtinction that he ſtill retains Unity.
As he is One, ſo we call him GOD,
the Deity, the Divine Nature, and
other Names of the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as he is diſtinguiſhed, ſo we call
him Trinity, Perſons, Father, Son,
and Holy Ghoſt. In this Trinity
there is One Eſſence, Two Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Three Perſons or Relations, Four
Properties, Five Notions. (A Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is that by which any Perſon is
known or ſignified.) The One Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is GOD, which with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that it doth generate or beget,
makes the Perſon of the Father; The
ſame Eſſence with this Relation, that
it is begotten, makes the Perſon of
the Son; The ſame Eſſence with
this relation, that it proceedeth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt.
The Two Emanations are, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and to proceed, or to be
breathed out. The Four Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are; <hi>First,</hi> Innaſcibility and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emanability;
<pb facs="tcp:97676:19"/>
the <hi>ſecond</hi> is to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
theſe belong to the Father;
the <hi>third</hi> is to be begotten, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Son; the <hi>fourth</hi> is to
proceed, or to be breathed out, this
belongs to the Holy Spirit. The
<hi>five</hi> Notions are, <hi>first,</hi> Innaſcibility;
the <hi>ſecond</hi> is to beget; the <hi>third</hi> is
to be begotten; the fourth <hi>Spiratio
paſſiva,</hi> to be breathed out; the <hi>fifth
Spiratio activa,</hi> or to breath; and
this Notion belongs to the Father
and the Son alike; for <hi>Pater &amp; fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
ſpirant Spiritum ſanctum.</hi> Hence
it evidently follows, that he who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
thus much, can never
poſſibly ſcruple the Eternal Deity of
the Son of God. <hi>And then he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
concludes:</hi> If any Man think
this Confeſſion to be defective (for
I can conceive no more in this point
neceſſary to be known) let him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
what he conceives deficient, and
I ſhall thank him for his labour.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: The confutation of
this Treatiſe of Schiſm will appear to
<pb facs="tcp:97676:19"/>
be neceſſary not only to wipe off the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions
of the Papists, but to ſilence
the Objections of Factious Perſons, who
often take Arguments from it to defend
themſelves in their ſeparation, as will
appear by that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>had ſaid,</hi> p. 207. <hi>
                           <q>That
the Church might be in any number
more or leſs, in any place, Country
or Nation, it may be in all, and for
ought I know it may be in none,
without prejudice to the Definition of
the Church, or the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</q>
This strange notion is contrary
to what Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>delivers in his</hi>
Golden Remains, p. 260. <hi>
                           <q>When we
appeal (ſaith he) to the Churches
Testimony, we content not our ſelves
with any part of the Church actually
exiſtent, but add unto it the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſucceſſive teſtimony of the Church
in all Ages ſince the Apostles time.</q>
And,</hi> p. 186. <q>
                           <hi>This ſucceſſion of the
Church is ſufficient to prove where our
Church was before</hi> Luther.</q> 
                        <hi>This
strange notion I ſay, That the Church
<pb facs="tcp:97676:20"/>
viſible may totally decay, prevailed too
far with Mr.</hi> Chillingworth, <hi>who
ſaith, p.</hi> 239. It is not certain that
the truth of the Article <hi>[of the Holy
Catholick Church]</hi> depends upon the
Actual exiſtence of a Catholick
Church, but rather upon the right
that the Church of Chriſt, or rather,
to ſpeak properly, that the Goſpel
of Chriſt hath to be univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
and therefore the Article
may be true though there were no
Church in the World. <hi>Now though
this were only a probleme, which Mr.</hi>
Chillingworth <hi>defends not, but in the</hi>
14. p. <hi>of his Preface overthroweth,
ſaying,</hi> I believe that our Saviour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince his Aſcenſion hath had in
ſome place or other a viſible true
Church on Earth, and that there
will be ſuch a Church to the Worlds
end: <hi>yet his Adverſary, p. 779. of</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
Unmasked, <hi>falls heavily on
him, and tells him, that this notion is
not only against the Scripture,</hi> Eph. 4.
11. <hi>but againſt all Protestants and all
Christians; and ſends him to</hi> Calvin<hi>'s</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:97676:20"/>
Inſtitutions, <hi>l. 4. c. 1. and to</hi> Volke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
<hi>whom he calls his Socinian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
de verâ Rel. <hi>l. 6. c. 5. who prove
a Succeſſion of Paſtors and Doctors to
have been always in the Church.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſit
Doctorum Paſtorúmque offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,
nec non alia quaedam. <hi>And
indeed Dr.</hi> Potter, <hi>whom Mr.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth
<hi>defended, had ſaid truly,</hi>
That it was an error in the nature,
and matter of it properly Heretical
to ſay, the Church remained only in
the party of <hi>Donatus,</hi> and that it was
much worſe to ſay ſhe remained no
where; for this were to overthrow
the Article of the Catholick Church,
<hi>and is little leſs than blaſphemy, ſaith
Arch-biſhop</hi> Laud.</p>
                     <p>Again, Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> p. 218. ſaid,
<q>It is alike unlawful to make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of known or ſuſpected falſhoods,
as to put in practice unlawful or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
actions.</q> This argument Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> improveth, <hi>p. penult.</hi>
of his Preface to <hi>Charity maintained.
If a Church</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſuppoſed to
<pb facs="tcp:97676:21"/>
want nothing neceſſary, require me
to profeſs againſt my Conſcience,
that I believe ſome error though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo ſmall and innocent,</hi> which I
do not believe, <hi>and will not allow
me her communion but upon this
condition; in this caſe the Church
for requiring this condition is Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
and not I for ſeparating
from the Church.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks
much more like a Conformist in this
caſe, than either Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> or Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth: If a Church</hi> (ſaith
he, p. 464. of <hi>Reaſons for Chriſt.
Relig. S. 15.) which in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
is pureſt and beſt, will impoſe
any ſin upon all that will have any
local communion with it, though
we muſt not ſeparate from that
Church as no Church, yet muſt we
not commit that ſin, but patiently
ſuffer them to exclude us from their
communion.</hi> And I think it is more
rational peaceably to diſſent until we
are actually excluded, than preſently to
pronounce that Church Schiſmatical,
which requires ſuch conditions of our
<pb facs="tcp:97676:21"/>
communion. For if that which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be an error, (being, if an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but ſmall and innocent) be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of me by a Church which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all neceſſary things, I ought
rather to ſubmit to, or at least peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
with-hold my communion from that
Church, than to violate its communion
by my ſeparation; becauſe that Church
which GOD hath preſerved in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
truths, may probably know that
which I believe to be an error (and
but a ſmall one, if an error) to be an
important truth; or if ſhe be miſtaken
in ſuch ſmall things, it is not ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
in her to require my profeſſion,
who may well be reſolved of my doubt,
when ſo many wiſer and better than
my ſelf after mature deliberation think
fit to require it.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>as Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>ſaith,</hi> p. 100.
In all right and equity that which
the Church hath ſo long received
and held for good, that which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
approbation hath ratified, muſt
carry the benefit of preſumption
<pb facs="tcp:97676:22"/>
with it to be accounted meet and
convenient. <hi>And, p.</hi> 55. This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
That the Authority of Man
affirmatively in matters Divine is
nothing worth, being once inſerted
into the minds of the vulgar ſort,
GOD knows what it may grow
unto. Thus much we ſee, It hath
already made Thouſands ſo head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong,
even in groſs and palpable
Errors, that a Man whoſe capacity
will ſcarce ſerve him to utter five
words in ſenſible manner, bluſheth
not in any doubt concerning matter
of Scripture, to think his own bare
Yea as good as the Nay of all the
Wiſe, Grave and Learned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are in the whole World;
which inſolency muſt be repreſt, or
it will be the very bane of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion. <hi>And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes:</hi>
The certain commands of the
Church muſt be obeyed in all things
not certainly unlawful. <hi>And page</hi>
144. That which the Church by
her Authority ſhall probably think
and define to be true and good,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:22"/>
muſt in congruity of reaſon over-rule
all other inferior judgments whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And as to Orders eſtabliſhed
(by the Church) ſith equity and
ſeaſon favour that which is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till orderly judgment of Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
be given againſt it, it is but
Juſtice to Exact of you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
in you it would be to deny
thereunto your willing obedience.
Not that I judge it a thing allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Men to obſerve thoſe Laws
which in their hearts they are ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
perſwaded to be againſt the
Laws of God; but your perſwaſion
in this caſe ye are all bound for the
time to ſuſpend, and in otherwiſe
doing ye offend againſt GOD by
troubling his Church without any
juſt or neceſſary cauſe. Be it that
there are ſome Reaſons inducing you
to think hardly of our Laws, are
thoſe Reaſons demonſtrative, are
they neceſſary, or but meer probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
only? An argument neceſſary
and demonſtrative is ſuch, as being
propoſed unto any Man and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:23"/>
the mind cannot chooſe but
inwardly aſſent.—But if the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
among you can ſhew that all
the Books ye have hitherto written
be able to afford any one Argument
of this nature, let the inſtance be
given. As for probabilities, what
thing was there ever ſet down ſo
agreeable with ſound reaſon, but
ſome probable ſhew againſt it might
be made? Is it meet that when
publickly things are received and
have taken place, general obedience
thereunto ſhall ceaſe to be exacted,
in caſe this or that private perſon,
led with ſome probable conceit,
ſhould make open proteſtation, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
or <hi>John</hi> diſallow them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them naught?—So that
of peace and quietneſs there is not
any way poſſible, unleſs the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice of every intire Society or
Body Politick over rule all private
of like nature in the ſame Body.
Which thing effectually proveth,
that GOD being Author of Peace
and not of confuſion in the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:97676:23"/>
muſt needs be Author of thoſe Mens
peaceable reſolutions, who concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe things have determined
with themſelves to think and do as
the Church they are of Decreeth,
till they ſee <hi>Neceſſary cauſe</hi> enforcing
them to the contrary. <hi>And p. 144,
145. Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>ſaith,</hi> That which
the Church by her Authority ſhall
probably think and define to be true
and good, muſt in congruity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
over-rule all other inferior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatſoever. <hi>And</hi>—where our
duty is Submiſſion, weak oppoſitions
betoken Pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now as the Name of Mr.</hi> Hales
<hi>prevailed with Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>to
imbrace ſome unſound Opinions of his,
ſo hath it done with others of great
note. The Author of the</hi> Irenicum, <hi>p.
108. repeats the first and part of the
ſecond Page of this Tract, with this
Commendation:</hi> It is well obſerved
by a Learned and Judicious Divine,
<hi>That Hereſie and Schiſm, &amp;c. And p.</hi>
120. I ſhall ſubjoyn the judgment
<pb facs="tcp:97676:24"/>
of as Learned and Judicious a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as moſt our Nation hath bred
in his Excellent though little Tract
of Schiſm. <hi>And then he repeats, p.
210. In thoſe Schiſms, &amp;c. to p. 212.
And in p. 120, and 121. of the</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,
<hi>he quotes Mr.</hi> Hales, <hi>from p.
215. And were Liturgies, &amp;c. to p.
218. and adds,</hi> So far that Excellent
Perſon, whoſe words I have taken
the pains to tranſcribe becauſe of the
great wiſdome, judgment and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
contained in them, and the
ſeaſonableneſs of his Counſel and
Advice to the preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
among us. <hi>And p.</hi> 394. Thus
that incomparable Man, <hi>Mr. Hales,</hi>
in his often quoted Tract of Schiſm,
<hi>p. 223. to p. 225. adding,</hi> Thus that
grave and wiſe Perſon, whoſe words
ſavour of a more than ordinary tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of a true ſpirit of Chriſtianity,
that ſcorns to make Religion a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool
to pride and ambition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Author of the</hi> Rehearſal Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros'd,
<hi>ſpeaks marvellouſly of Him</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:97676:24"/>
I ſhall conclude (<hi>ſays he</hi>) with a
Villanous Pamphlet, of which a great
Wit was the Author; and whereas
<hi>Mr. Bayes</hi> is alwayes defying the
Non-conformiſts with <hi>Mr. Hooker's
Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> and <hi>the Friendly
Debate,</hi> I am of Opinion, though I
have a great reverence for <hi>Mr. Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
that this little Book of not full
Eight Leaves hath ſhut that <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Polity,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Beyes</hi> too our
of Doors: It is one <hi>Mr. Hales</hi> of
<hi>Eaton,</hi> a moſt Learned Divine, and
one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
moſt remarkable for his ſufferings in
the late times, and for his Chriſtian
patience under them. And I reckon
it not one of the leaſt ignominies of
that Age, that ſo eminent a Perſon
ſhould have been by the iniquity of
the times reduced to thoſe neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
under which he lived. As I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it no ſmall honour to have
grown up into ſome part of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and converſed a while
with the living Remains of one of
the cleareſt Heads and beſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:97676:25"/>
Breaſts in Chriſtendom. <hi>I</hi> hope
it will not be tedious though <hi>I</hi> write
ſome few (and yet whatſoever <hi>I</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>I</hi> ſhall have left behind more)
material paſſages. (<hi>And then he fills
up near Eight Pages of his Book, out
of Mr.</hi> Hales his <hi>Eight Leaves.)—
It was not amiſs in the Scribes and
Phariſees to build the Tombes of the
Prophets, and garniſh their Sepulchres;
but to perſecute their Succeſſors, and
Christ himſelf under pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
the Ancients, was an impiety,
full fraught with malice and envy.
And a uſual thing it is for ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to trample on ſuch Worthies as
are preſent and stand in their way, to
expreſs great reſpect to thoſe that are
removed out of it:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>—Sed niſi quae terris ſemota ſuiſque</l>
                           <l>Temporibus defuncta videt, faſtidit &amp;
odit.</l>
                        </q>
Yet by that Author's leave I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much leſs out of the Reverend Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> in this <hi>Parergon,</hi> yet enough
<pb facs="tcp:97676:25"/>
to confute all that he or Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
have ſaid in Defence of Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is another late Pamphlet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
Separation no Schiſm, <hi>which in
p. 40. telleth us,</hi> That a meer ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of ſin is a ſufficient ground for
withdrawing Communion, in the
judgment of very learned Men; <hi>and
then quotes Mr.</hi> Hales—So ſays that
Univerſally admired Man, <hi>p. 210. and
p. 216, 217, 218. and infers,</hi> Theſe
Teſtimonies are ſo clear, and backt
with ſuch Unanſwerable Reaſons,
that not only where the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sin, but the doing any thing
that is ſuſpected to be ſinful, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as a condition of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there a withdrawing is lawful,
and not at all Schiſmatical.</p>
                     <p>Now when Men of ſo much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Judgment, as ſome of thoſe
whom I have mentioned, have upon the
reputation of the Venerable Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
improved ſuch Notions and Arguments
as are destructive to the Government
<pb facs="tcp:97676:26"/>
and Peace of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
it is not strange that Men of little
Learning and great Prejudices ſhould
aſſume them, whereby (as far as they
are able) to juſtifie their Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
practices; nor that the Scepticke of
this Age ſhould be fond of ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as may tend to the Subverſion of
what hath been ſo long, and ſo well
establiſhed among us. We may rather
wonder, how ſo Villanous a Pamphlet
(as the <hi>Reherſal</hi> calls it; yet) ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to just exceptions, ſhould have
continued ſo long in Vogue without a
Confutation from ſome more Learned
Hand, that the Infection of it might
proceed no farther, but its weakneſs be
made manifeſt to all Men.</p>
                     <p>As for Doctor <hi>Parker,</hi> he hath no
leſs judiciouſly and ſucceſsfully acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Himſelf against any thing objected
by Maſter <hi>Hales,</hi> or <hi>Marvel,</hi> than
Maſter <hi>Hooker.</hi> To instance in that
one particular, of pretending Scruples
of Conſcience against the Commands
of Publick Authority; he faith more
<pb facs="tcp:97676:26"/>
in One Page, than all the Objectors
will be able to Anſwer.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p> Though
this pretence (ſaith he) might be
allowed of in the Dayes of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when it was first star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet after ſo long time, and ſo
much enquiry, it is intolerable. For
if after all their ſearch and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
they have not been able to
deſcry, the evils they ſuſpected, this
is a ſufficient Principle of Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
that their Jealouſies are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded:
ſo that if they are now
able to object any certain crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, then this Plea of a
Doubtful Conſcience ceaſeth, and the
Certainty is to be pleaded in ſtead of
the Doubt; if not, an Hundred and
Fifty Years is a ſufficient time to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
or to cancel ſcruples,—And
a ſcrupulous Conſcience is of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,

trifling and inconſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the material parts of Duty

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Communion
is the ſtrength and
ground of all ſociety,
Sacred and Civil: whoever therefore
cauſeth a breach, if in civil occaſions,
is guilty of Sedition, or Rebellion; if
in Eccleſiaſtical differences, is guilty
of Schiſm: ſo that Schiſm is an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Sedition, as Sedition is a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiſme,

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the definition of Schiſm?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Schiſme is an unneceſſary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">p. 195.</note> from that part
of the viſible Church of which they
were once Members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> When is Separation neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Separation is then neceſſary,
when nothing will ſave us from the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe two things make Schiſm
complete. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The choice of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in oppoſition to the former. <hi>2ly,</hi>
The erecting a new Church and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<note place="margin">p. 196.</note>
for the dividing Party to meet in
publickly. As in the late famous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
in <hi>Holland, de Praedeſtinatione,</hi>
as long as the diſagreeing Parties went
no further than diſputes, the Schiſme
was unhatched; but as ſoon as one
Party ſwept an old Cloyſter, and by a
pretty Art ſuddenly made it a Church
(by putting a new Pulpit in it) for the
ſeparating Party to meet in, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was a Controverſie became a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Schiſme, <hi>p.</hi> 197.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the danger of Schiſm?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What the Ancients ſpake by
way of cenſure of Schiſme in general,
is moſt true,<note place="margin">p. 198.</note> (and they ſpake moſt
ſtrange things of it) for they ſaw, that
unadviſedly, and upon fancy, to break
the knot of union betwixt man and
man (eſpecially among Chriſtians, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the tye of love and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
doth eſpecially reſt) was a crime
<hi>hardly pardonable,</hi> and that nothing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
a Man from the guilt of it, but
true and unpretended Conſcience. And
<hi>p.</hi> 192. Hereſie and Schiſme are things
of great moment, the one offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Truth, the other againſt Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and both are deadly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was the Schiſme of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
any way excuſable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, they were compleat Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,<note place="margin">p. 196.</note>
upon the grounds before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
nor was there any neceſſary
cauſe for their Separation, for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the Schiſme was an Opinion,
that where good and bad were mixed,
there could be no Church,<note place="margin">p. 205.</note> by reaſon
of pollution evaporating (as it were)

was the Schiſmatick,<note place="margin">p. 208.</note> yet might
not any one communicate with them,
if occaſion ſo required? if ſo be they

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You may not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with ſuch, becauſe of the danger
of Schiſme before mentioned. <hi>2ly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not lawful, no not for prayer,
hearing, conference, or any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
office whatſoever, for People to
Aſſemble, otherwiſe than by publick
order is allowed; for, why ſhould Men
deſire to do that ſuſpiciouſly, in private,
which may be performed warrantably
in publick? <hi>p.</hi> 229, 230.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what if they to whoſe care
the execution of the publick ſervice is
committed,<note place="margin">p. 209.</note> do ſome things unſeemly,
ſuſpicious, or unlawful? if their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be cenſured as, or indeed be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious?
what if the Geſture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
be uſed at the Altar? what if
the Homiliſt or Preacher deliver any
Doctrine, of the truth of which we are
not well perſwaded?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet for all this, we may not
ſeparate, except we be conſtrained to
bear a part in them our ſelves:<note place="margin">p. 210.</note> The
Prieſts under <hi>Eli</hi> had ſo ill demeaned
themſelves about the daily Sacrifice,
that they made it to ſtink, yet the
People refuſed not to come to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97676:30"/>
nor to bring their Sacrifices
to the Prieſts; for in Schiſmes which
concern fact, nothing can be a juſt
cauſe of refuſal of Communion, but
only the requiring of the execution of
ſome unlawful or ſuſpected Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What may we do when ſome
Perſons in a Church teach erroneous
Doctrines,<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> ſuppoſe of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
concerning the Trinity, or the
Perſon of our Saviour?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What to do in this caſe is not
a point of any great depth of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to diſcover,<note place="margin">p. 215.</note> ſo be it diſtemper
and partiality do not intervene. I do
not ſee, that <hi>Opinionum varietas &amp; Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium
unitas</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or that
Men of different Opinions in Chriſtian
Religion, may not hold communion
(<hi>in Sacris</hi>) in the publick Worſhip:
(This Argument holds, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> if
I may keep communion with ſuch as
teach falſe Doctrines, much more with
ſuch as practiſe only ſuſpected Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.)

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It evidently appears that all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97676:30"/>
Meetings upon unneceſſary occaſions
of Separation, are to be ſo ſtiled; ſo
that in this ſenſe a Conventicle is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is, and that perchance, not

and acknowledge: but that all
theſe things ſhould be done in publick,
by troops and ſhoals of Men, from
whence proceeded publick Temples,
Altars, Forms of Service, appointed
Times, and the like, which are required

as by the report of Chriſtians

other Meetings whatſoever beſides
thoſe, of which both time and place
were limited, they cenſured for routs,

Rules are fit to be obſerved for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and avoiding of Schiſme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Take heed of entertaining
ſcruples of Conſcience, about things
of little moment; for when ſcruples of
Conſcience began to be made, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
then Schiſmes began to break
in, <hi>p.</hi> 217.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What other Rule is neceſſary to
be obſerved?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That you do not endeavour
to advance one Biſhop againſt another,
(much more a Presbyter againſt the
Biſhop) which in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">p. 222.</note>
is <hi>Erigere Altare contra Altare,</hi>
to ſet up Altar againſt Altar, to which
he imputeth the Original of all Church
diſorders, and if you read him, you
would think he thought no other
Church-tumult to be a Schiſme, but
this;<note place="margin">p. 221.</note> For the general practice of the
Church, was, never to admit more
than one Biſhop at once in one See, but
it fell out among the Ancients, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
by occaſion of difference in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
ſometimes becauſe of difference
among thoſe who were intereſſed in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97676:32"/>
the choice of Biſhops, that two Biſhops,
and ſometime more were ſet up, and
all Parties ſtriving to maintain their
own Biſhop, made themſelves ſeveral
Congregations and Churches, each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to participate with others.<note place="margin">p. 223.</note> And
ſeeing it is a thing very convenient for
the peace of the Church, to have but
one Biſhop in a See, at once; Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
ſleeps not, who unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
or wantonly go about to infringe
it.</p>

HAving by a brief <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the
Treatiſe of Schiſm extracted the
genuine ſenſe of the Author, who,
as the <hi>Tranſproſer</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 175. was one
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (and as
ſuch I have endeavoured to repreſent
him) it is obvious to every one that
ſhall read that Tract, that inſtead of
Anſwering Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s or Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s
Tracts of Eccleſiaſtical Polity, it
hath fully refuted it ſelf and all other
cavils of the Schiſmaticks, who by
theſe two aſſertions of his will for ever
lye under a juſt condemnation. The
One is, <hi>p. 209. What if thoſe to whoſe
care the Execution of the publick ſervice
is committed, do ſomething either unſeemly
or ſuſpicious, or peradventure unlawful?
what if the Garments they wear be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
as, nay indeed be Superſtitious?
what if the geſture of Adoration be uſed
at the Altar? what if the Homiliſt or
Preacher deliver any doctrine, of the
truth of which we be not well perſwaded?
yet for all this we may not ſeparate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we be conſtrained perſonally to bear
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97676:33"/>
a part in them our ſelves</hi>—Then may
not any of the Laity who are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to bear a part in ſuch things,
ſeparate from our Congregations, and
by conſequence neither may their
Leaders draw them into a ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond Aſſertion is,</hi> p. 229.—It
is not lawful, no not for prayer, for
hearing, for conference, for any other
religious office whatſoever, for people to
aſſemble, otherwiſe than by publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is allowed. <hi>This concluſion our
Author infers from ſubſtantial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs I was ſo tender of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

only one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
but moſt remarkable for his ſufferings
in the late times, and for his Chriſtian
patience under them, which befel him,
as Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 148. <q>when
he had declared himſelf of another
Opinion, and obtained leave of
Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> (who converted
him) to call himſelf his Grace's
Chaplain, that naming him in his
publick prayers, the greater notice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97676:33"/>
might be taken of the Alteration:</q>
(which doubtleſs was the cauſe why
ſo eminent a perſon was by the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thoſe times reduced to thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
under which (the <hi>Tranſpoſer</hi>

The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that is obnoxious in

the Fathers they were called hereſies.</q>
So that our Author explodes the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Fathers who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe things for Hereſies, which he
thinks do ſcarce deſerve the name of
Schiſms. And a new notion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
is brought in by him, <hi>p.</hi> 214. <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Manicheiſm, Valentinaniſm,
Marcioniſm, Mahometaniſm are
truly and properly hereſies, for we
know that the Authors of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them not but minted them
themſelves, and ſo knew that which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97676:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they taught to be a lye; but can
any man avouch (ſaith our Author)
that <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and others
that taught erroneouſly concerning
the Trinity, or the perſon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
did maliciouſly invent what
they taught, and not rather fall
upon it by error and miſtake? Till
that be done, and that upon good
evidence, we will think no worſe
of all parties than needs we muſt,
and take theſe Rents in the Church
to be but Schiſms upon matter of
Opinion.</q> If this be true, in vain
did the Biſhops of the Primitive
Church aſſemble in the Councils of
<hi>Nice, Epheſus,</hi> and other places, to
condemn and ſuppreſs the Opinions of
<hi>Arrius, Neſtorius</hi> and other Hereſiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha's.
And the fears and jealouſies
of the preſent Church concerning the
growth of hereſies are groundleſs; for
though the erring ſpirits of this age
ſhould revive all the dangerous tenets
of <hi>Arrius, Eutychius, Neſtorius, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>
and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and all the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
of <hi>Manes, Valentinian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
or <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, yet ſeeing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97676:35"/>
they did not invent theſe errors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but fell on them by miſtake
(though they adhere to them never
ſo tenaciouſly, and wilfully defend
them) they deſerve but the name of
Schiſmaticks. And until ſome ſuch
perſons, as <hi>Simon Magus, Montanus,</hi>
or <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall ſet up for a new God,
or a Holy Ghoſt, or a Meſſias, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
oppoſition to the Goſpel of our
Lord and Saviour, we need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the world with the odious names
of Heretick, or Schiſmatick, which
are but Theological Scarcrows. For
<hi>p.</hi> 215. we are told <q>that the Rents
in the Church (occaſioned by thoſe
hereſies) were at the worſt but
Schiſms upon matter of Opinion.
In which caſe (ſaith our Author)
it is not a point of any great depth
of Underſtanding to diſcover what
we are to do, ſo be it diſtemper and
partiality do not intervene; I do not
yet ſee that <hi>opinionum varietas &amp;
Opinantium unitas</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or
that men of different Opinions in
Chriſtian Religion may not hold
communion <hi>in Sacris,</hi> and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97676:35"/>

Church, if there be no Arrianiſm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in their Liturgy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is expreſly contrary to what I
quoted from <hi>p.</hi> 229. <q>It is not lawful
for prayer, hearing, &amp;c.</q> and as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Rom. 16. 17.
Titus 3. 10. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
                  <p>What error and confuſion would
theſe wilde notions bring into the
Church, if falſe Prophets and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſhould be permitted to teach, and
the People not reſtrained from hearing
them, although they ſhould teach ſuch
damnable Doctrines as denyed the
Lord that bought them? I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
therefore from the Author to Mr.
<hi>Hales;</hi> who tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 192. <q>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Hereſie and Schiſm are but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
terms in the common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
yet the things in themſelves
are of very conſiderable moment,
the one offending againſt truth, the
other againſt Charity, and therefore
both deadly.</q> So deadly, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
compare them better than to that
<hi>Italian,</hi> who deſigned to kill his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
body and ſoul: for Truth being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97676:36"/>
the very Soul of the Church, and Peace
and Unity the great organ or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by which it becomes viſible and
proſperous, the toleration of Hereſie
and Schiſm will be as deſtructive to
the Church here, as they will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be to the Authors of them without
repentance hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There is a leſſer miſtake in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
definition of Schiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 195. by
which he excuſeth all ſuch from the
guilt of Schiſm, <q>as do ſeparate from
that part of the viſible Church
whereof they were not once mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</q>
On which account all ſuch
children as were born of Schiſmatical
Parents (though they defend the
ſchiſm never ſo obſtinately) are not
guilty: whereas it is the duty of all
Chriſtians to live in communion with
that part of the Catholick Church in
which they reſide, and not to ſuffer
themſelves (as our Author expreſſeth
it) like beaſts of burthen to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon by their Predeceſſors. The
Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> is by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
acknowledged to be a complete
Schiſm upon the grounds mentioned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97676:36"/>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 196. I demand therefore, whether
ſuch children, as were born to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Optatus lib. 1. contra Parmen. ſays, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianus whoſe grandfather was Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, that departed from the Chair of Cecilian &amp; S. Cyprian, was an heir of the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> and perſiſting in the opinions
and practices of their Fore-fathers trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> 300. years
together, were guilty of Schiſm or no?
or whether ſuch as among us were
born of Anabaptiſtical or Quaking
Parents, and ſtill perſiſt in and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Church-diviſions, are complete
Schiſmaticks or not? And if we ſhould
try them by our Author's own rules,
I am ſure they will be found guilty.</p>
                  <p>The next error of our Author is his
allowing of Separation upon Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and ſuſpicions, as <hi>p.</hi> 194. he ſays,
<q>When either Acts unlawful, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
juſt Scruple, are required of
us to be performed, conſent were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
and open conteſtation is not
faction or ſchiſm, but due Chriſtian
animoſity.</q> This juſt Scruple he calls,
<hi>p. 201. a ſtrong ſuſpicion,</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 218.
<q>Where ſuſpected Opinions are made
a piece of the Church-Liturgy, he
that ſeparates is not the Schiſmatick.</q>
It is like our Author forgat what he
ſaid a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 217. <q>that when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97676:37"/>
Scruples of conſcience began to be
made or pretended, then Schiſms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to break in;</q> as alſo what is ſaid,
<hi>p.</hi> 209. <q>What if the Preacher deliver
any Doctrine of the truth of which
we are not well perſwaded? yet for
all this we may not ſeparate, except
we be conſtrained perſonally to bear
a part in ſome ſuſpected Act.</q> Againſt
this error of our Authors I affirm, That
the Scruples and ſuſpicions of private
Chriſtians, concerning the lawfulneſs
of Actions required by their Superiors,
cannot warrant their ſeparation, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their obedience to Superiors in
things not unlawful is their duty, and
to omit a certain duty, upon a bare ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion,
is dangerous and ſinful. And
for a full anſwer to this error, I deſire
it may be conſidered what a ſcrupulous
Conſcience is, which I take to be ſuch
an act of the practical underſtanding
as reſolves what is, or what is not to
be done, but with ſome fear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety
leſt its determination be amiſs.
And it differs from a doubting Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which aſſents to neither part of
the queſtion, but remains unreſolved,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97676:37"/>
as doubting of the true ſenſe of the
rule; in which caſe it is reſolved, that
in all things doubtful we are to take
the ſafeſt courſe. And doubtleſs that
wherein the generality of wiſe and
good Men as well Ancient as Modern
are agreed, is much more ſafe than
that, in which a few leſs knowing,
prejudicated and guilty perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be doubtful. But where there
are only groundleſs fears and ſcruples
concerning ſome circumſtance annexed
to a known duty, it is the ſenſe even
of our Non-conformiſts, That if we
cannot upon ſerious endeavours get rid
of our Scruples, we ought to act againſt
them; And this is ſo lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that we cannot otherwiſe have
either grace or peace. See more to
this purpoſe in a Sermon at <hi>Cripplegate</hi>
on <hi>Acts 24. 26. p. 18, &amp;</hi> 19. And if
ſcruple and ſuſpicion were a juſt plea
for Separation, then every diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſon that is reſolved to contemn
his Superiours, every one that is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ignorant, and lazy, or refractory
to better information, every one that
hath melancholy humours and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97676:38"/>
or wants true Chriſtian Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or Charity, may make ſeparation,
and yet be guiltleſs. So that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of our Author's would be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
for all Separatiſts; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allowed, there neither was nor can
be any ſuch ſin as Schiſm. For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is ſufficiently known, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doctrine, or Worſhip of any
Church is ſo well conſtituted, but ſome
unquiet ſpirits have raiſed ſcruples and
ſuſpicions concerning them. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Church have power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
things lawful and no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Word of God (though
ſome giddy Perſons may ſcruple at
them) it is impoſſible that it ſhould
preſerve it ſelf from confuſion. The
Apoſtles I am ſure did practiſe this in
the Synod at <hi>Hieruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſilenceth the objections of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
and ſcrupulous Perſons with
the <hi>Cuſtome of the Churches of God,
1 Corinth.</hi> 11. 16. Every Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that pretends to have the face of a
Church requires the obedience of its
Members to all Orders for publick
Worſhip, as well as their conſent to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97676:38"/>
their Articles of Faith, and without
this it could not ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this with Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
advice in his <hi>Diſpute of Ceremonies,</hi>
Ch. 15. S. 3. <q>That the Duty of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being certain, and the ſinfulneſs
of the thing commanded being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and only <hi>Suſpected,</hi> we muſt
go on the ſurer ſide.</q> And the Author
of the Sermon on <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. gives
a good reaſon for it, ſaying, <q>If a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhould forbear praying or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacrament every time his
ſcrupulous conſcience tells him he
had better wholly omit the duty, than
perform it in ſuch a manner, he would
ſoon find to his ſorrow the miſchief
of his ſcruples. And he adviſeth—
In all known neceſſary duties always
do what you can, when you cannot
do what you would.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 202. falls on an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
controverſie concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> of which he gives
us this imperfect account, <q>That it
being upon error taken for neceſſary,
that an <hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt be kept, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97676:39"/>
upon worſe than Error (if I may
ſo ſpeak) for it was no leſs than a
point of Judaiſm forced upon the
Church) thought further neceſſary
that the ground for the keeping the
time of that Feaſt muſt be the rule
left by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> there
aroſe a ſtout queſtion whether we
ought to Celebrate with the <hi>Jews</hi> on
the <hi>14th.</hi> of the Moon, or the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following. This matter though
moſt unneceſſary, moſt vain, yet
cauſed as great a combuſtion as ever
was in the Church, the Weſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
from and refuſing Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Eaſt for many years
together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>An impartial relation of the ground
of this controverſie as it lies in Church
Hiſtory will ſufficiently diſcover how
odiouſly it is repreſented. Firſt then,
whereas he ſays, it was upon error
taken for neceſſary that an <hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt
be kept: I anſwer, if it were an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
the Church had it from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
themſelves; for although the
contending parties differed among
themſelves in the day, yet both agreed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97676:39"/>
on the neceſſity of obſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi>
in Commemoration of our Saviour's
Reſurrection: And the Controverſie
concerning the day puts it out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
that there ought to be a day
obſerved. Some learned men have
thought the ſetting a-part of an <hi>Eaſter</hi>
day to be grounded on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8.
where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Paſſover, ſays, <hi>Let us keep the
Feaſt;</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves that the
word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which ſignifieth to abſtain
from all work for the offering up of
holy things to God. If the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any day be neceſſary unto
Chriſtians, this of <hi>Eaſter</hi> is, becauſe
it is the Mother and ground of our
weekly Sabbath, and is ſuppoſed to
be the ſame which S. <hi>John</hi> calls the

not ſeek expreſs authority from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to make it neceſſary; the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Apoſtles teſtified by ſuch
early and authentick witneſſes, and the

know the Scriptures to be the word
of God. <q>When (ſaith he) we appeal
to the Churches teſtimony, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not our ſelves with any part of
the Church actually exiſtent, but add
unto it the perpetually ſucceſſive
teſtimony of the Church in all Ages

its firſt beginning, and out of both
theſe draw an argument in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
of that force as that from it
not the ſubtileſt Diſputer can find
an eſcape. For who is it that can
think to find acceptance and credit
with reaſonable men by oppoſing not
only the preſent Church converſing in
earth, but the uniform conſent of the
Church in all ages?</q>—So that the
Church in all Ages agreeing that an
<hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt be kept, it was not taken
up upon Error.</p>
                  <p>Nor, ſecondly, was it upon worſe
than error, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as our Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97676:41"/>
                     <q>a point of Judaiſm grounded
on the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that
the obſervation thereof was by ſome
Churches ſolemnized on the <hi>14th.</hi> day
of the Moon.</q> For the Eaſtern Churches
alledging the practice of S. <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> for the <hi>14th.</hi> day, had a better
ground for it than a Jewiſh cuſtom,
namely that of Chriſtian Charity;
and <hi>Baronius</hi> notes it as worthy of our
obſervation, that the Apoſtles had
anciently appointed, that though
<hi>Eaſter</hi> were obſerved on the Lords day
by the generality of Chriſtians, yet
they ſhould gently tolerate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing
Converts, which were of the
circumciſion, and were in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the Eaſtern parts. See <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s
Annals <hi>ad Ann. 167. p.</hi> 168. Now
the Weſtern Churches pleaded for
their practice (which was the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Sunday following) the
Authority of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who had fully convinced the Gentile
converts, that all Jewiſh rites were
to be laid aſide, as having had their
full completion in Chriſt; but yet,
as in other like caſes, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97676:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to bear with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as for
ſome time they did; for the firſt time
that this controverſie was agitated
was between <hi>Anicetus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Polycarp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> who
according to the cuſtom of other <hi>Aſian</hi>
Churches celebrated <hi>Eaſter</hi> day on the
<hi>14th.</hi> of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>For which practice <hi>Polycarp</hi> alledged
the Authority of S. <hi>John.</hi> And <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
in an Epiſtle mentioned by <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
l. 5. c.</hi> 18. tells us, that <hi>Polycarp</hi>
came to <hi>Rome</hi> to diſcourſe with <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus</hi>
concerning this and other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
obſervations between the Eaſtern
and Weſtern Churches; and having
after ſome conference amicably agreed
other controverſies, they ſtill differed
about this obſervation, but without
any violation of the bond of Charity,
for they communicated together,
<hi>Anicetus</hi> giving leave to <hi>Polycarp</hi> to
perform the offices of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in his Church; and it was then
concluded, That both Churches ſhould
be at liberty to obſerve the Ancient
cuſtomes delivered to them from
their Predeceſſors. But about the year
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97676:42"/>
of Chriſt, 198. <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
revives the controverſie with <hi>Polycra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who was then
65 years old and came within a little
time of S. <hi>John,</hi> being cotemporary
with <hi>Polycarp. Victor</hi> pleads that the
cuſtom of his Church was derived
from the Apoſtles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and that all his Predeceſſors had cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Lords day. See
<hi>Euſebius lib. 5. ch.</hi> 21, 22, 23. And
<hi>Nicephorus l. 4. c. 36. Polycrates</hi> in his
Epiſtle mentioned by <hi>Euſebius, l. 5. c.</hi>
24. replies, That all the Provinces
of <hi>Aſia</hi> obſerved it according to an
Ancient tradition received long before
(<hi>i. e.</hi> before the ſecond Century)
from S. <hi>John</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> from <hi>Thraſeas</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Eumenia, Sagaris</hi> of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,
Papirius</hi> and <hi>Melito</hi> Biſhops of
<hi>Sardis,</hi> who always practiſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſame Canon, and all the
Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> then living conſented
to and ſubſcribed his Epiſtle. Upon
this, <hi>Victor</hi> beginneth to ſtorm, and
threatneth to Excommunicate the
Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> as Heterodox, and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97676:43"/>
that end he aſſembleth the Biſhops
under his Juriſdiction, who with one
conſent declared for peace, deſiring
his forbearance, and diſliking his too
great ſeverity. The Epiſtle of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
to <hi>Victor</hi> on this occaſion is yet
extant, in which he declares, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for his part he was reſolved
to obſerve the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the
<hi>Sunday</hi> according to the practice of the
Weſtern Church in which he lived,
yet he could not approve that the
Eaſtern Church ſhould be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
for obſerving an Ancient
cuſtom; and mindeth <hi>Victor</hi> that the
Biſhops before him had never broken
the Churches peace on this occaſion.
But no mediation would prevail;
<hi>Victor</hi> was <hi>Victor</hi> ſtill, and proceeds to
denounce an impotent ſentence againſt
the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſays
ſomething to excuſe the ſeverity of
<hi>Victor (viz.</hi>) That as long as thoſe
Churches were Catholick and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
they of <hi>Rome</hi> thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to tolerate that cuſtom; but
when from that cuſtom, Schiſm and
Hereſie brake in upon the <hi>Aſian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97676:43"/>
(for <hi>Montanus</hi> having diffuſed
his Hereſie through <hi>Aſia,</hi> thoſe Aſians
began to plead that they had received
this Tradition from their Paraclete,
that the <hi>Paſcha</hi> ought to be celebrated
on the <hi>14th.</hi> of the Moon and on no
other day, and that all ſuch as practiſed
otherwiſe were in an error) then
<hi>Victor</hi> thought it his duty to reſtrain
this error.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 10, 11.</note> 2. This Opinion of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Eaſter</hi> after the Aſian manner was
taken up by many Hereticks, and ſo
ſpread it ſelf that it invaded the very
boſom of the Roman Church, and
pluckt thence one <hi>Blaſtus</hi> who in the
face of that Church maintained the
Aſian againſt the Roman Cuſtom. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
ſpeaks of this <hi>Blaſtus</hi> in his
book <hi>de Praeſcriptionibus, c.</hi> 53. ſaying,
that he endeavoured to bring in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,
affirming that the Chriſtian
<hi>Paſcha</hi> was not to be kept otherwiſe
than was preſcribed by the Law of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> And this opinion of <hi>Blaſtus</hi>
drew away ſo many after him, that
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> wrote a book of <hi>Schiſm</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
purpoſely againſt <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> but
could not recal him. And now let
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97676:44"/>
the indifferent Reader judge whether
the ſubject of this controverſie were
<hi>moſt unneceſſary, moſt vain</hi> (as our
Author declaims.) <hi>Victor</hi> indeed did
proſecute it with too much heat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that the Cardinal knows not
what to ſay in his excuſe. <hi>An verò
quod poteſtate, jure faciebat, recténe
fecerit dubitatum eſt,</hi> ſaith the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Doubtleſs the Aſian Churches
were (<hi>ſui juris</hi>) not under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of <hi>Victor,</hi> or if they had been,
yet was he not unblameable in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
all the Churches of
<hi>Aſia</hi> for the fault of ſome few that had
crept in among them, whom in due
time they would have reſtrained by
their own authority. He was alſo
too precipitate in not yielding to the
mediation of his own Biſhops in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of thoſe Churches. And laſtly,
he was much more culpable for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this obſervation on the Aſian
Churches as a matter of Faith, and
judged them to be heterodox and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
that would not ſubmit.
<hi>Baronius</hi> his words <hi>ad annum Chriſti
198. p.</hi> 191. of the <hi>Antwerp</hi> edition
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97676:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are, <hi>Totius Aſia Eccleſias cum aliis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
imis tanquam alterius fidei &amp; opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
à communi unitate Eccleſia amputare
conatur.</hi> Nor were the Aſian Churches
without fault for yielding ſo long to
a Jewiſh Ceremony, which might
long ere that time have been decently
buried as other Jewiſh cuſtomes had
been: And alſo for ſuffering ſome
among them to teach a neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Chriſtian <hi>Paſcha</hi> on the
<hi>14th.</hi> day and no other. So that (to
conclude) though the Roman Church
was in this particular ſtronger in the
Faith, yet (as our Author ſaith) they
ſhould have born with the imbecillity
of their weaker Brethren, a thing
which (he obſerves) S. <hi>Paul</hi> would
not refuſe to do, <hi>p.</hi> 218. To which I
ſay, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did comply for a
while with the Jewiſh Converts in
the Caſe of Circumciſion, but when
ſome of them pleaded for a neceſſity
of Circumciſion, he thunders againſt
that Opinion as loudly as <hi>Victor</hi> did
againſt this, ſaying, That <hi>if they were
Circumciſed (i. e.</hi> with an Opinion of the
neceſſity of it) <hi>Chriſt ſhould profit them
nothing, Gal.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97676:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now from this Hiſtory (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had contrived it) he drew ſeveral
wilde inferences: As <hi>firſt p.</hi> 203. <q>In
this fantaſtical Hurry I cannot ſee
(ſaith he) but all the World were
Schiſmaticks.</q> To which I reply. That
all the World were not concerned in
it, there being ſome Nations that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from both theſe in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> as <hi>Socrates, l. 5. c.</hi> 21.
hath obſerved: for even among the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Converts, ſome that agreed on
the <hi>14th.</hi> day differed in the Moon, and
Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> obſerves that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which the <hi>Pope</hi> pretends to have
been his Converts) did in thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times obſerve their <hi>Easter</hi> on
the <hi>14th.</hi> day (which by the way is
an argument that we at firſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Chriſtian Faith, not from the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> who exploded this
cuſtome, but more Anciently from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or from St. <hi>Philip,</hi>
who, as many good Authors affirm,
planted the Chriſtian Religion in our
neighbour Nation of <hi>France,</hi> and as
the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches affirm, was one
of them that taught them this cuſtom)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97676:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor do we read that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for Hereticks for ſo doing.
Neither did thoſe Eaſtern Churches
who differed in the Moneth anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
each other; and <hi>Socrates (ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra</hi>)
gives this reaſon for it, They that
agree in the ſame Faith may differ from
each other in reſpect of Rites. (as the
Reformed Churches do at this day)
And though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did
excommunicate the <hi>Aſian,</hi> yet were
they never the more Schiſmaticks for
that, being they were (<hi>ſui Juris</hi>) not
under the <hi>Roman</hi> power. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Authors definition of ſchiſm,
they being never members of that
Church from which they were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
could not be guilty of ſchiſm
notwithſtanding <hi>Victors</hi> rigor. We ſay
therefore they were ſtill members of
the Catholick Church. And as for
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church what ſhould make
them Schiſmaticks? For though <hi>Victor</hi>
did arrogate too much as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his proceedings, yet as to the
matter, his proſecution againſt a <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
ceremony when it grew into an
Opinion of being neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97676:46"/>
was his duty, and approved
by the practice of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note>
And while there was a controverſie
between their Governors, the People
and Clergy too of both Parties conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in due ſubjection to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
and in mutual charity to one
another. So that the Separatiſts of
our Age can have no excuſe for their
Schiſm from this inſtance.</p>
                  <p>But our Author infers, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <q>that this fell out through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or (<hi>which he mentioneth alſo</hi>) the
malice of their Governors, and that
through the juſt judgment of God on
the People, becauſe through ſloth and
blind obedience they examined not
the things which they were taught,
but like beaſts of burthen patiently
couched down and indifferently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
whatſoever their Superiors
laid upon them.</q> To which I Anſwer.
It doth not appear there was any
charge of ignorance to be imputed to
<hi>Victor,</hi> or his People, for the reaſons
above mentioned; much leſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
Our preſent Sectaries do call their
oppoſition to Ceremonies (more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97676:46"/>
than that) by the name of zeal,
and love to the cauſe of God. Nor
was there any thing impoſed on the
Churches of either ſide, that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Faith, nor any cuſtome or
rite (<hi>de novo</hi>) but only the <hi>Aſian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were deſired to tranſlate the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of obſerving <hi>Eaſter,</hi> from a day
which gave offence not only to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſeveral other
Churches. <hi>Petavius</hi> ſays, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was not <hi>de Catholico dogmate, ſed
de Ritu, ſeu Ritûs potiùs tempore.</hi> And
if the Superiors in the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches
had thought the Alteration fit, (as
ſhortly after they did) it had doubtleſs
been the Peoples duty to ſubmit; for
every Church hath power in thoſe
things which are indifferent, and much
more in ſuch things as give offence to
other Churches, to appoint and alter
rites and ceremonies for the publick
Worſhip of God; and the People ſhew
themſelves not beaſts of burthen but
Chriſt's Free-men, in ſubmitting to
their Governors as far as Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
doth permit. If <hi>Victor</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
new Articles of Faith, as <hi>Pius
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97676:47"/>
Quintus</hi> did in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
doubtleſs thoſe Primitive Chriſtians
would have reſiſted even to bloud;
of which they gave too many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
when they conſtantly endured all
manner of torments rather than they
would renounce the Faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them.</p>
                  <p>Our Author therefore needed to ask
pardon for wounding the reputation
of theſe Ancient Worthies in cool
bloud, as well as for maſſacring at once
the authority of all the Fathers in the
heat of a temptation, <hi>p.</hi> 204. where
he ſays thus: <q>You may plainly ſee
the danger of our appeal to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for reſolution in controverſies of
Faith, and how ſmall relief we are
to expect from thence; for if the
diſcretion of the chiefeſt Guides of
the Church did in a point ſo trivial,
ſo inconſiderable, ſo mainly fail them,
as not to ſee the truth in a ſubject
wherein it is the greateſt marvel, how
they could avoid the ſight of it; Can
we without the imputation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
groſsneſs and folly, think ſo
poor ſpirited perſons competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97676:47"/>
of the queſtions now on foot in the
Churches? Pardon me, I know not
what temptation drew that note from
me.</q> To this I reply: 1. Whoever
he be that ſo contemptuouſly rejects
the Authority, and trampleth on the
reputation of the Fathers, hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
excuſed thoſe that ſhall ſlight
his own. This is the Author's own
ſenſe, <hi>Golden Remains, p.</hi> 260. 2. I refer
it to the judgment of the Reader whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> condemning
ſome of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
too tenaciouſly to a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which was of ill conſequence to
thoſe and other neighbouring Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
were not more excuſable than a
private perſon, living many hundred
years after the fact, (and never rightly
knowing, or elſe wrongfully repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it) inſolently and cauſleſly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Ancient Fathers, not of one
or two Ages or parts of the Church,
but all in general; as if the failing of
one man in a point ſo trivial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
(as our Author calls it)
were ſufficient reaſon to condemn
them all for indiſcreet and poor ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97676:48"/>
perſons; And to impute extreme
groſsneſs and folly to all that ſhould
think them competent Judges of our
differences. This is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> beyond
that of <hi>Abailardus,</hi> who was wont to
ſay, that the Fathers for the moſt part
did think this or that to be right, but
I think otherwiſe, as if his ſingle au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
could out-weigh all theirs. 3.
He muſt pretend to have ſome new
light for his guide, and be either an
Enthuſiaſt, or Socinian, that can ſee
any danger in appealing to Antiquity
for reſolution in controverted points
of Faith. For ſeeing there is ſcarce
any point of Faith but ſome unhappy
Wits have controverted it, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Opinions have put the
Scriptures on the rack to make them
ſpeak their own ſenſe; how can points
of Faith delivered in the Scriptures be
better underſtood and confirmed than
by the joynt conſent of ſuch Ancient
Doctors who converſed with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
or their immediate Succeſſors,
and are rightly called <hi>Apoſtolici,</hi> many
of which were Perſons of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Eloquence, and ſo could not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97676:48"/>
be charged with ignorance? And
doubtleſs they were very induſtrious
in inquiring into the grounds of the
Chriſtian Faith, for which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
all temporal accommodations, and
moſt of them their lives, and againſt
all oppoſition have not only handed
down to us the Scriptures themſelves
pure and incorrupt, but the proper
and genuine ſenſe of them. We do
not make them <hi>Judices</hi> but <hi>Indices fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi>
not the Authors but the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to confirm and give evidence in
matters of Faith. 4. The Papiſts
do calumniate the Reformed Divines
as if they rejected the judgment of the
Fathers; whereas they do with one
conſent (and none more readily than
they of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) appeal
to their Authority for confirmation of
the Faith which they profeſs. I could
eaſily fill a Volume with the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of our Modern Divines concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the authority of the Ancients, how
competent Judges they are of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
now on foot. The naming of
ſome few will reſolve us whether our
Author's Opinion or theirs deſerves
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97676:49"/>
the imputation of groſneſs and folly.
<hi>Calvin</hi> in his controverſie with <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,

From this general contempt of the
Fathers our Author proceeds, <hi>p.</hi> 206.
to caſt a ſlurr on <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> For
having mentioned <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he maintained againſt the
<hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which was, <hi>Unitatem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae
per totum Orbem diſperſae propter
nonnullorum peccata non eſſe deſerendam;
(i. e.</hi>) that the Unity of the Church
ſpread over the whole world ought
not to be forſaken for the ſins of ſome
few that were in its communion, he
adds, <q>that though it were <hi>de facto</hi>
falſe, that <hi>Donatus</hi> his party ſhut up
in <hi>Africa,</hi> was the only Orthodox
party; yet it might have been true
notwithſtanding any thing <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
brings to confute it. And
contrarily though it were <hi>de facto</hi>
true that the part of Chriſtians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
over the face of the Earth
were the Orthodox, yet it might
have been falſe notwithſtanding any
thing <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> brings to confirm
it.</q> As if that learned Father who
was as cloſe and exact a diſputant as
the Church hath enjoyed ever ſince,
had wholly miſtaken the queſtion,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97676:52"/>
or were unable to urge one argument
<hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con, (i.e.</hi>) either for confutation
of that wretched Schiſm, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Catholick Church. That
learned Father wrote a very large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
againſt thoſe Schiſmaticks,
which contains ſo much both of wit
and Argument, that there would not
need any thing elſe to be ſaid for the
confutation of Schiſmaticks to the
worlds end if his arguments were
well underſtood and applyed. And
when our Author proves the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
in two lines to be complete Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
firſt for chooſing a Biſhop
in oppoſition to the former, ſecondly,
for erecting new places for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
party to meet in publickly, I
wonder with what confidence he
could deny that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> had done
ſo much in ſo many writings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.
But when I conſider how

may I not go if occaſion require to

he ſays expreſly <q>that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to aſſemble otherwiſe
than by publick order is allowed.</q>
And if our Author knew not that as
well the Schiſm of the Donatiſts as
the hereſie of the Arrians was often
condemned and forbidden by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and Councils of that age, he
was very ignorant indeed.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon which our Author
gives, why <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaid nothing
to the queſtion, is as ſtrange as any
thing elſe. <q>
                        <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (ſaith our
Author) brought nothing to prove
that the Orthodox were the true
Church, or the Donatiſts were Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.
For the Church may be
in any number, in any place, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
or nation, it may be in all, and for
ought I know it may be in none,
without prejudice to the definition
of a Church or the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</q>
He might as well have told us
of a Church in <hi>Utopia,</hi> which is the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97676:53"/>
ſame with a Church in no place,
country or nation. What Idea of the
Church our Author conceived I cannot
imagine, but that which he expreſſeth
concerning it is as contrary to the
truth of all the Prophecies of the Old
Teſtament, as well as the deſcription
of it in the New, from whence the
definition is taken, as light is to
darkneſs. For <hi>Acts 2. 41. ad finem,</hi>
the Church is deſcribed to be a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men (not all nor none) called
out of the world by the preaching of
the Apoſtles, and joyning themſelves
to their Spiritual guides by Baptiſm
and breaking of Bread, by publick
Prayers, and hearing the Word. Theſe
in <hi>verſe</hi> 47. are expreſly called the
Church, and to this Church the Lord
added daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.
Now ſuch Churches were by Chriſt's
commiſſions to be planted in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which we believe was really
effected; and the truth thereof is ſtill
apparent, that God hath given his Son
<hi>the heathen for his inheritance, and the
utmoſt parts of the earth for hs poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi>
and therefore to ſay that a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97676:54"/>
Church may be in none, either num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or place, (for I ſuppoſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
intends both, becauſe if it may
exiſt in no place, it muſt not conſiſt of
any number, nor ſo much as admit of
one) as contrary to ſenſe and Reaſon
as to the Truth of the Goſpel. And
is ſuch a fancy as that of Mrs. <hi>Trask,</hi>
who having ſhifted from one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
to another in <hi>New-England;</hi>
and at laſt on pretence of impurity
in their ordinances and members, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them all, affirmed, that
ſhe alone was the Church and Spouſe
of Chriſt. But I think Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
himſelf ſufficiently refutes this fancy
of our Author. <hi>Page 185, &amp;</hi> 186. of
his <hi>Golden Remains</hi> he tells us, <q>that
to prove the exiſtence of our Church
before <hi>Luther,</hi> all that is neceſſary
to be proved in the caſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but this; that there hath
been from the Apoſtles times a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
ſucceſſion of the Miniſtry to
preach and to baptize, of which by
the providence of God there remains
very good evidence to the world, and
ſhall remain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:97676:54"/>
Having told us that the Church
may be in no place, that is in effect
that there may be no Church, he doth
with the more confidence affirm, <hi>p.</hi>
213. <q>That Church Authority is
none, and tradition for the moſt part
but figment.</q> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to traditions
in general I defend them not, nor can
any man elſe; but for ſuch as bear
the Characters, which <hi>Vincentius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinenſis</hi>
deſcribes, <hi>quod ubique, quod
ſemper, quod ab omnibus,</hi> we have all
reaſon imaginable to inforce the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of ſuch traditions as have
been received and delivered to us by
all the Churches of Chriſt, in all
ages and in all places, unleſs we were
of the Authors opinion, that Church
authority is none; and this can never
be made good but by proof of our
Authors fiction of a Church in <hi>Utopia.</hi>
For if our Saviour did out of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
redeem a Church by his own
bloud; if he planted it by his Apoſtles,
and promiſed his preſence with it to
the end of the world; if he made it
the ground and Pillar of Truth, and
promiſed to hear her prayers, and to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97676:55"/>
bind in heaven what they bound on
earth, and that the gates of Hell, <hi>i.e.</hi>
neither perſecutions, nor hereſies, nor
ſchiſms ſhould prevail againſt it:
doubtleſs there is a Church, and that
Church hath ſome authority granted
to her by her dear Redeemer, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
that peace and unity, as well as
thoſe truths, which he bequeathed to
her. Did our Saviour take care for
the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, or did
he not alſo mind the Chriſtian Church,
when <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 17. he enjoyns us
even in private differences among our
ſelves, much more in thoſe which
concern the publick peace of the
Church, as in the caſe of ſcandals
mentioned in the context, <hi>v.</hi> 7. to <hi>go
tell the Church;</hi> and if any ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to hear the Church, that he
ſhould be unto us <hi>as an heathen man
and a Publican, i.e.</hi> Excommunicate
from that holy Society; which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
being ſpiritual doth clearly
evince, that the cauſes ſubmitted to
the judgment of the Church were
ſpiritual alſo. But I demand farther,
did the Apoſtles uſurp more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97676:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than was given them, when they
aſſembled together, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 6. about
the caſe of Circumciſion; and after
the difference had been fully debated
by <hi>Peter, Paul, Barnabas</hi> and <hi>S. James</hi>
in the preſence of the Elders and the
multitude, they all agreed, and that
by the approbation of the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>v.</hi> 28. to impoſe upon the Churches
certain conſtitutions as neceſſary to be
obſerved at that time for the peace
of the Church? If they did not,
then the Church had ſome authority.
And ſo when <hi>S. Paul</hi> pleaded the
cuſtom of the Churches of God againſt
contentious perſons in the Church of
<hi>Corinth, 1 Epiſt. c. 11. v.</hi> 16. And doth
not the ſame Apoſtle tell us, that when
our Saviour aſcended up on high, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 11. he placed rulers and governors
in his Church, whoſe care it ſhould
be to provide that the people ſhould
not be <hi>thenceforth</hi> as children toſſed
to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of Doctrine by the ſlight
of men, and cunning craftineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they lie in wait to deceive, <hi>v.</hi> 14.
If Church authority be none, to what
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97676:56"/>
end did S. <hi>Paul</hi> injoyn <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſee
that women ſhould keep ſilence in the
Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. not only to
teach but command, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 11. to
give charge concerning widows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. 1, 7. how to receive accuſations
againſt Elders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. how to
ordain, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. and ſee that they
held faſt the form of ſound words,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. to ſuppreſs ſtriving about
vain words and prophane bablings,
ſuch as were the diſcourſes of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
and <hi>Philetus,</hi> which did eat as
a canker and overthrew the faith of
ſome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 16. to rebuke (au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively)
ſuch as would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſound doctrine, but agreeably to
their own luſts did heap up teachers to
themſelves, having itching ears, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 2, 3. And in like manner that <hi>Titus</hi>
ſhould ſuffer no man to deſpiſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>Titus</hi> 2. 15. but diligently
diſcharge the duties for which the
Apoſtle ſetled him in <hi>Crete, i. e.</hi> to ſet
in order things which were wanting,
and to ordain Elders in every City,
<hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. and to reject hereticks
after a ſecond admonition, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97676:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beſides we find the Spirit of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Angel of the Church of
<hi>Epheſus</hi> for ſhewing her hatred againſt
the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and blaming the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating
the Doctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi> and
the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and the Angel of
<hi>Thyatira</hi> for permitting the Doctrine
and practice of <hi>Jezebel, Rev. 2. 6. &amp;c.</hi>
Nor did I ever hear yet of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
that pretended to have the
face of a Church, that did not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
ſome authority over their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
for as the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
No order nor peace can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Church, if it ſhould not
be lawful for it ſo to judge of its own
members, as to reſtrain within bounds
wavering and unſetled ſpirits. This
hath been the practice of the Churches
of all Ages; the particulars to which
their authority did extend are not now
to be reckoned, nor the arguments
for vindication thereof neceſſary to be
inſiſted on: I ſhall ſhut up this with
that of <hi>Beza, de pace Eccleſiae: Neque
enim Dei gratiâ ignoro Eccleſiam eſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis
teſtem, extra quam non ſit ſalus,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97676:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; Orthodoxorum conſenſum in Synodis
adversùs Haereticos plurimi fieri par est,
&amp; Patrum in interpretandis Scripturis,
in refutandis erroribus, in admonendis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis,
labores adeò non contemni oportet, ut
ſecundo à Scripturis loco meritò habeantur.</hi>
Theſe things do certainly infer, that
Church-authority is ſomething. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 224. dares to tell
us, that <q>They do but abuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us, that Biſhops by Chriſt's
inſtitution have any ſuperiority above
other Men further than of Reverence.</q>
And the reaſon which he gives for it
is this, <q>For we have believed him
that told us, that in Jeſus Chriſt there
is neither high nor low, and that in
giving honour every Man ſhould be
ready to prefer another before himſelf.</q>
Which reaſons do as certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
againſt Magiſtrates as Biſhops,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there is no obedience, no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
or homage due to them by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
inſtitution, nothing further than an
airy ſuperiority of reverence, which
if the other were denyed would be but
a mockery; Like that wherewith the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97676:57"/>
late Royal Martyr was Reverenced,
when the Uſurpers robbed him of all
that God and the Laws inveſted him
withall, and gave him only the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of reverence in a Noble Death.
But as to Biſhops, let our Author's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
Anſwer it ſelf: For <hi>first,</hi> It
grants that Biſhops were by Chriſt's
inſtitution, becauſe by his inſtitution
they had a ſuperiority of reverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other Men. <hi>2ly,</hi> This ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was grounded on their Office as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
that is, Overſeers of the Flock
committed to their charge, which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was aſſigned to them by the Holy
Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. And now I would
have the Reader conſider whether
thoſe that by the inſtitution of Chriſt
and of the Holy Ghoſt were made
Rulers and Governors of the Church,
have no other ſuperiority above other
Men beſide that of reverence? There
is more expreſſed, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 17. in
theſe words, <hi>Obey them that have the
rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi>
And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs <hi>Timothy</hi>
in the office of a Biſhop, he tells him
how he ſhould learn to <hi>rule</hi> the Houſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97676:58"/>
of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. by ruling well
his own houſe, having his children in
ſubjection with all gravity. Again,
when he chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Ep. 5. 17.
to provide that thoſe Presbyters that
did not only rule well but laboured
(above others) in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ſhould be counted worthy of
double honour, he intended ſomewhat
more than a ſuperiority of Reverence,
namely an Honorary maintenance,
ſuch as was the portion of the elder
Brother under the Law, not a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Eleemoſynary ſtipend, but that
which was as due to them as the hire
is to the labourer; and I ſuppoſe that
this is by Chriſt's inſtitution, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
aſſuring us, that as it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a Divine inſtitution under the
Law, <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained
that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould
live of the Goſpel, 1. Cor.</hi> 9. 14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Apoſtle grounds the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of Reverence on that of the
office of governing, labouring and
watching for the Souls of the People.
So 1 <hi>Theſſal. 5. 12, 13. We beſſeech you
Brethren to know them which labour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97676:58"/>
among you, and are over you in the Lord
and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them
very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi>
And that the Apoſtles were ſuperior
in office not only to the People, but
to the 72. Diſciples, and to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
is clearly evinced by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
for upon the miſcarriage of
<hi>Judas</hi> another being to take his office,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 20. the Apoſtles met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in a ſolemn aſſembly after
prayer and ſupplication the lot fell on
<hi>Matthias,</hi> who was one of the 72. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and had accompanied the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
all the time that the Lord Jeſus
went in and out among them. And
this method was to continue, by Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. Ep. 3. 13.
where ſuch as had uſed the office of a
Deacon well, are ſaid to purchaſe to
themſelves a good degree, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the
Aſſembly expound it, doth deſervedly
purchaſe to himſelf the honour of a
higher office in the Church. And
whereas we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. that our
Saviour Chriſt after his Reſurrection
converſed 40. days with his Apoſtles,
ſpeaking of the things pertaining to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97676:59"/>
the Kingdom of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and governing of his Church;
and when he aſcended up on high he
gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not only for the work of the Miniſtry,
but preventing of falſe Doctrines and
Schiſms, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 11-14.</hi> compared
with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25, 28, 29. it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
there was a ſuperiority of office
as well as of reverence given to the
Teachers &amp; Governors of the Church.
For God hath ſet theſe ſeveral orders
in his Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily
Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all are not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
nor all Prophets, nor all Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
there were ſome even by God's
inſtitution above others in place and
office as well as in reverence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we cannot expect a better proof
than the Univerſal practice of the
Churches of Chriſt even in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
days, and immediately after their
deceaſe. For unleſs we could conceive
that all the Churches ſhould even in
thoſe Primitive times conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to caſt off ſome other government
appointed by Chriſt, and admit of this
to which they could have no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97676:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or inclination, the People and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
both, being then as ſheep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to the ſlaughter, we muſt needs
conclude, that a ſuperiority of office
and government, as well as of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was their due. Now not only
the Perſons that were ſet over the
Churches, and had the Characters of
Epiſcopal Power and Juriſdiction, are
plainly recorded in the Writings of
the Ancients; but their power and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
over Presbyters and Deacons,
their ſupreme care and inſpection of
the affairs of the Church are ſo fully
explained, as if they had been written
on purpoſe to prevent the objections
of theſe later days. For inſtance, we

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97676:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>
ſpeak largely of them. I ſhall hope
to ſatisfie the Reader with a paſſage or

no Friend of Epiſcopacy, yet in his
Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Whatever
Aaron and his Sons and the Levites could
vindicate to themſelves in the Temple,
the ſame may Biſhops, and Presbyters and
Deacons challenge to themſelves in the
(Chriſtian) Church.</hi> Here you have a
plain diſtinction of Orders. And in
his Epiſtle to <hi>Riparius</hi> you have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Power, for ſpeaking of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius</hi>
an Heretical Presbyter, he
ſaith, <hi>Miror ſanctum Epiſcopum in cujus

ejus furori, &amp; non virgâ Apoſtolicâ, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gâque
ferreâ confringere vas inutile, &amp;
tradere in interitum carnis, ut ſpiritus
ſalvus fiat; I wonder the holy Biſhop in
whoſe Dioceſe the Heretical Presbyter
is ſaid to be, doth not reſtrain his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and with his Apoſtolical rod as with
an Iron rod break that unprofitable Veſſel,
and deliver him for the deſtruction of the
fleſh, that his Soul may be ſaved.</hi> So
that there was a <hi>ſub</hi> and <hi>ſupra</hi> by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97676:61"/>
Chriſt's inſtitution, it did not all come
from compoſition and agreement of
Men among themſelves, as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
and our Author do affirm.</p>
                  <p>But if there were indeed a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of reverence due to Biſhops by
Chriſt's inſtitution, I fear the Author
ſinned againſt that inſtitution when he
ſpake ſo irreverently of them, as in

about the body of Moſes, durſt not bring
against him a railing accuſation:</hi> but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97676:61"/>
this Author (whether <hi>Aerius</hi> revived,
or the Ghoſt of that Monſter <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus</hi>
become incarnate, (no Archangel
I am ſure) doth not only deſpiſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and ſpeak evil of Dignities,
but breaths out fire and utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
againſt Epiſcopacy root and
branch. Who the contending Biſhops
were of whom he ſpeaks, I have told
you in the controverſie between <hi>Victor</hi>
and <hi>Polycrates,</hi> the one contending
too violently for a truth, the other
too tenaciouſly defending an ancient
but erroneous cuſtome. The errors of
both would extract pity and prayers
from any Chriſtian ſpirit, that were
ſenſible of humane infirmities. When
there aroſe a contention among <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
own Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 46. which
ſhould be the greateſt; And when the
diſpute about circumciſion ſomewhat
like this aroſe between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi>
and them that came down from
<hi>Judaea,</hi> did Chriſt or his Apoſtles think
themſelves as unconcerned at theſe
contentions, as at a Cock-fight? or
had it been a fit option to wiſh that
they might all periſh? How deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97676:62"/>
are the curſes of ſuch men, when
their prayers, their beſt wiſhes are for
deſtruction? There appears more of
the Serpent in this raſh vote, than in
all <hi>Victor</hi>'s contention.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> thinks he may be
well excuſed for this uncharitable vote
againſt Biſhops, ſeeing <q>they had ſo
little charity as by their frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
to make butter and cheeſe of
one another,</q> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 220.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſad ſtory to read the great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences
acted by ſome Biſhops, and the
indignities and tortures indured by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in that period of time to which
<hi>Socrates</hi> confines his Hiſtory: for in
the cloſe of it he ſays, it contained the
Hiſtory of 140. Years from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Empire unto the
17. conſulſhip of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> In all
which time <hi>Socrates</hi> relates with as
much ſorrow, as our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems to
do with merriment, what agonies and
convulſions the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie made in
ſome Churches, and the Schiſm of the
<hi>Donatists</hi> in others, where the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(being cruel and implacable) as
often as they got any power, did not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97676:62"/>
only make butter and cheeſe but ſhed
the bloud of the Orthodox and more
peaceable Biſhops. There are ſtill
ſome ſuch as would gladly reduce them
again to butter and cheeſe, and like
vermin corrode and devour them too.
If any be of the Authors mind, I hope
and pray that God would give them
repentance, that they may live ſo
peaceably under the Biſhops of
the Church here, that they may
live eternally with the Biſhop of
their Souls hereafter: Or if they ſhall
deſpiſe my advice, I intreat them to
conſider that of Mr. <hi>Hales, p.</hi> 223. <q>It
being a thing very convenient for the
peace of the Church, (to have but
one Biſhop in one See, at one time)
neither doth it any way ſavour of
vice or miſdemeanor, their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſleeps not who unneceſſarily
and wantonly go about to infringe
it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I meet with one obſervation more
fit to be animadverted on under this
head which is in <hi>page 218, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>The
third thing I noted for matter of
Schiſm, was, Ambition, I mean
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97676:63"/>
Epiſcopal ambition, ſhewing it ſelf
in two heads; one concerning Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Biſhops in the ſame See,
another the Superiority of Biſhops in
divers Sees. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that
neceſſity cauſeth but ſmall faults, but
Avarice and Ambition were the
mothers of great crimes.</q> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth
in the Sees of <hi>Alexandria,
Conſtantinople, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am glad our Author found no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Epiſcopal ambition nearer
home; if there had been any, in all
probability he would have told us of
them. If he had been a friend to the
Epiſcopal Order, he would rather
have done as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaid he was
ready to do with his Biſhops, make
his royal robes a covering for their
infirmities, than like a <hi>Cham</hi> diſcover
the nakedneſs of thoſe Fathers. The
beſt of Biſhops are but men, and ſo are
ſubject to the like paſſions and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
as other men. I have already
inſtanced in the Apoſtles and other
diſciples of Chriſt; and certainly it
is not chriſtianly done ſo to aggravate
the faults of particular perſons as to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97676:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reflect upon the whole office. Beſides,
our Author might have mentioned as
many and as dangerous Schiſms made
by covetous and ambitious Presbyters
as by the Biſhops; <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the Hiſt. of <hi>Donatiſts.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Aerius</hi> and <hi>Arrius, Donatus</hi>
and his fellow Presbyters, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the Epiſcopal power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſhed more bloud, and
committed more outrages than were
done under any inſtance of Epiſcopal
ambition.</p>
                  <p>I will not inſiſt on any foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
our late Schiſm at home is
ſo freſh in our memories, and the
wounds made by it are yet ſo open,
that there needs no other Rhetorick
than our own experience, to teach us
that the little finger of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
was heavier than the Epiſcopal
loins. Let any perſon ſum up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the miſchiefs occaſioned by the
avarice and ambition of Biſhops
for 500 years together in this Nation
of ours, and I dare engage to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that for wickedneſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving,
for malice and cruelty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting,
for pride and arrogance in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97676:64"/>
uſurping, for obſtinacy and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs
in continuing and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
ſtill to perpetuate our unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled
confuſions; though many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have done wickedly, yet our
Presbyterians have exceeded them all.
For let me be informed whether for
a Juncto of Presbyters, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſworn obedience to their lawful
Ordinaries, as well as allegiance to
their Prince, to caſt off all thoſe ſacred
obligations, and dethroning one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Prince, to advance many
Tyrants, and by covenanting againſt
one Biſhop in a Dioceſs, erect 100, or
200, in the ſame See, and expoſe all
to contempt and miſery that would
not partake with them in their ſins,
whoſe tender mercies Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
found to be cruel, being deprived
of that plentiful eſtate which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
under the Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and reduced to that extremity
that he was forced to ſell his books for
the ſupply of his neceſſities: let me be
informed I pray, whether this be not
more than any Biſhop ever did or could
be guilty of? Such indignities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97676:64"/>
uſurpations and cruelties againſt
an Equal, as theſe men have acted
againſt their juſt, lawful and excellent
Governors both in Church and State,
I believe have not been acted ſince
<hi>Judas</hi> betrayed his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 225. Our Author infers from
the Scriptures before mentioned,
<q>That thoſe ſayings cut off moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
all claim to ſuperiority by title
of Chriſtianity, except men can think
that theſe things were ſpoken only to
poor and private men. Nature and
Religion agree in this, that neither
of them hath a hand in this heraldry
of <hi>Secundum Sub &amp; Supra.</hi> All this
comes from compoſition and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men amongſt themſelves.</q>
The firſt Scripture referred to by our
Author is, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Gal. 3. 28. There
is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free,
male nor female; for ye are all one in
Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here is not a word of
high nor low in this nor any other
Scripture that I can find in our authors
ſenſe; for the Apoſtle only ſhews, that
as to our acceptance by God in Chriſt
there is no reſpect of perſons; but as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97676:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had ſaid, <hi>verſe 26. ye are all the
children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
No difference from country, relation,
ſex or condition, but as the King's
Manuſcript, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
ye are all Chriſts: <hi>i. e.</hi> of
his myſtical body, <hi>utcunque alia ſunt
diverſa,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves, the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of King and ſubject, Parent and
child, Husband and wife, Maſter and
ſervant notwithſtanding. Not that
theſe relations are deſtroyed, for then
Chriſtian Religion would be of all
factions the moſt intolerable. <hi>Eſtius</hi>
on this place intimates, that leſt the
<hi>Galatians</hi> ſhould think they got advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
by being in Chriſt, he tells them
the <hi>Jew</hi> if he believed was as good as
the Gentile, the bond as the free,
which is therefore firſt named. And
if this ſenſe could be applied to this
Scripture which our Author gives,
then might the <hi>Quakers</hi> uſe it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
all their rudeneſs, becauſe there
is neither high nor low; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of love for all their carnality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is neither male nor female
in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97676:65"/>
The ſecond Scripture is <hi>Rom. 12. 10.
In giving honour let every one prefer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
before himſelf:</hi> which place is ſo
far from licenſing any Chriſtians to
deny honour to thoſe Superiors to
whom it is due, and ſtrictly injoyned
in the next chapter, that it obligeth
them to give it to equals and inferiors,
as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays, <hi>The firſt degree of
Chriſtian humility is, Inferiorem ſe exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
Aequali; ſecundus, Aequalem ſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere
Inferiori; tertius, Inferiorem ſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere
Inferiori,</hi> in all which the giving
honour to our Superiors, is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
being a duty that nature it ſelf
doth teach. The Aſſembly gives a right
ſenſe of this Scripture: <hi>Chriſtian humility
teacheth us not only not to prefer our ſelves
above our equals, nor to equal our ſelves to
our betters, but in ſome caſes to equal our
ſelves to our Inferiors.</hi> So that we need
not think theſe things were ſpoken to
poor &amp; private men, but were to be the
common duties of all Chriſtians without
prejudice to their particular relations, all
which Chriſtianity provides for. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
inſtructs <hi>Timothy, as the Servant of the
Lord to be gentle to all men, apt to teach,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97676:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>patient, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that
oppoſed themſelves.</hi> But withal he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
him <hi>to teach and to command,
to rebuke and reprove, to ſee that no man
did deſpiſe him,</hi> and leaves to him the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and care of the Church of
God at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Where there is true
Chriſtianity, there will be as much
humility and meekneſs in the hearts
and lives of Kings and Princes, Biſhops
and Prieſts, as of the meaneſt Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
And therefore the Monks of
<hi>Bangor</hi> were not adviſed amiſs; That
they ſhould know whether <hi>Auſtin</hi> that
was ſent by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great to be
an Arch-Biſhop, was a ſervant of
God or no, if he did meekly ſalute
them, and behave himſelf humbly
towards them as to his Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Both Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
agree in this Heraldry, that all
Families and Societies of men, and
therefore the Church of God alſo,
have ever born ſomething in chief;
the Father was ever above the Son,
and the Prieſt, who for a long time
was the Father of the Family, was
ſuperior to the people: All did not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97676:66"/>
come by compoſition and agreement.
To evince this, I ſhall aſſert theſe
three propoſitions: 1. That God is
to be Worſhipped, is a dictate of the
law of Nature. 2. That men ought
to gather themſelves into aſſemblies
for the Worſhip of God, is a reſult of
the ſame Law. 3. That in thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
there ſhould be a power and
government for the preſervation of it
ſelf is from the Law of Nature, and
by conſequence from the Law of God,
both which have directed a <hi>Sub</hi> and
<hi>Supra</hi> in all Societies, and ingraven the
principles of it in the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Nature teacheth us that
God is to be Worſhipped. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
we find in <hi>Adam,</hi> not only
before, but after the fall, who taught
his Sons, as well <hi>Cain</hi> as <hi>Abel,</hi> to
honour God with their ſubſtance. And
we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. That <hi>in proceſs of
time,</hi> that is ſay ſome, at the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a determined time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſcribed to be (in the Original)
at the end of days, others think it to
be meant of the Seventh or Sabbath
day, <hi>Cain brought of the fruit of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97676:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground an offering to the Lord, and Abel
alſo brought of the firſtlings of his flock
and the fat thereof.</hi> Whether they
brought it to a deſigned place, or to
their father <hi>Adam</hi> as their Prieſt, I ſhall
not now enquire. I ſhall only give
you an obſervation of the learned
Doctor <hi>Outram</hi> on this place: That
the period of days whereon <hi>Cain</hi>
brought his offering, was at the end
of Harveſt, and the time of <hi>Abels</hi>
offering was when his flocks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
at which ſeaſons both of them
being inſtructed by natural reaſon (for
no command doth appear) thought it
meet to return to God ſome part of the
bleſſing given them by God. And
whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 4. that
<hi>by faith Abel offered unto God a more
excellent Sacrifice than Cain,</hi> which
ſome think could not be ſaid to be
done <hi>in faith</hi> unleſs it had been in
obedience to ſome command of God;
He conſenteth with ſome others, that
this place doth evince the contrary,
becauſe if <hi>Abel</hi> had ſacrificed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome expreſs command, we
cannot conceive but <hi>Cain</hi> offered upon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97676:67"/>
the ſame command alſo, and ſo might
be ſaid to have done it by faith as well
as <hi>Abel,</hi> which is contrary to that text
which implies that <hi>Cain</hi> did not.
Whence it may be concluded, that
they did neither of them preſent their
offerings by virtue of any command,
but according to a dictate of nature
imprinted on their Souls as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their ſeveral bleſſings
received from him: which if <hi>Cain</hi> a
wicked man was inclined to do by
the light of nature, how much better
may it be ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> who was a
good man? But it will be demanded,
wherein that faith of <hi>Abel</hi> which is ſo
commended did conſiſt? And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is, in that he had ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Dominion, power and
goodneſs of God the author and giver
of all bleſſings, and Lord of life and
death, that he thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to offer the beſt of his flocks in
teſtimony of the Worſhip of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and of a thankful mind towards
him. And indeed the light of nature
might ſerve not only to direct the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Adam</hi> who had ſo much of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97676:68"/>
the knowledge of God, but others
alſo that were removed into a greater
darkneſs and ignorance, That as the
inviſible God had manifeſted his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
power and Godhead to them by
things viſible, ſo they ought to agnize
and honour their inviſible Creator and
benefactor by offering him ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe viſible and ſenſible bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
which he had vouchſafed them.
Theſe and ſuch like arguments ſaith
Dr. <hi>Outram, p.</hi> 7. did ſo prevail with
the Ancients, that they were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that men did firſt offer ſacrifice
from an inſtinct of natural reaſon and
not from any command of God, for
which he quoteth many learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and concludes with the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Euſebius de demonſtratione Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,
l. 1. c.</hi> 10. That <hi>Cain</hi> did of his
own accord offer the fruits of the
ground, but every good man as <hi>Abel,
Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> did by Divine
reaſoning or underſtanding ſacrifice
living creatures (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,)
which as the learned Doctor proves,
cannot be underſtood of a Divine
Command. I ſhall add but this one
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97676:68"/>
medium more for the proof of my firſt
propoſition, That the general inſtinct
and inclination of Mankind to worſhip
ſome thing as God, doth argue that
the Light of Nature doth direct them
that God is to be worſhipped; only
through the decay and weakneſs of
Reaſon they miſtake the Object, and
are become ignorant of the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſerving him, which hath been
the cauſe of all Idolatry. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obſervable that whereas other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature have been obliterated
and diſuſed among divers Nations, this
hath been conſtantly and univerſally
obſerved by all with great ſolemnity:
which is the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That God muſt be worſhipped by
Men in Society, is according to the
Law of Nature, which I ſuppoſe our
Author doth grant, <hi>p.</hi> 227. where he
ſaith, <q>It hath been at all times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
neceſſary, that God requireth
not only inward and private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when Men either in their hearts
and cloſets, or within their private
walls pray, praiſe, confeſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
but he further requires
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97676:69"/>
all thoſe things to be done in publick,
by Troops and Shoals of Men.</q> If this
was always neceſſary, then ſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was any poſitive command
for it, God requiring it by the Law of
Nature, which doth not only teach us
that God is to be worſhipped, but in
ſuch a manner as may beſt diſplay his
excellencies, and manifeſt that he is
glorious in praiſes, which cannot be
done in a corner but in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and therefore God ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
accepted the intention of <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s devotion in building him
that great Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where
all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Solemn times
ſhould meet together to offer up their
prayers, and to give thanks to the
Name of the Lord. And before we
read of any precept for this purpoſe,
we find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. that in the days
of <hi>Enos</hi> the Grand-ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Seth,</hi>
that is, as ſoon as there was a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number to make a Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<hi>Men began to call upon the
Name of the Lord,</hi> viz. in Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
as the beſt Expoſitors do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it. Which farther appears, in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97676:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that all Nations have built Temples,
ſet a-part ſolemn Feſtival days, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Prieſts, and myſterious Rites,
for the honour of their Gods; which
they have done without any previous
command or commerce with more
civilized or religious Nations. As
therefore it is ſaid of the riſe of <hi>Nile,</hi>
which in plentiful ſtreams ſpreads it
ſelf over <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet the Origin of
it cannot be found, that it comes from
Heaven: ſo theſe ſolemnities of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
and ſacred Rites for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God being found to abound
every where, and no humane inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be alledged as the riſe of them,
we may conclude them to flow from
Heaven into the Souls and Conſciences
of Men. But St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
10. asks how God came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it? and he anſwers, by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
only, and ſubmitting himſelf
to humane infirmities; which conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
<hi>Oecumenius</hi> thus expreſſeth:
<hi>Becauſe men had a conceit, that it was
convenient to offer up ſome part of their
ſubſtance unto God, and they were ſo
strongly poſſeſſed with this conceit, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97676:70"/>
if they offered it not to him, they would
have offered it up to Idols; God</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>rather than they ſhould offer unto Idols,
required them to offer unto himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Propoſition is, That it is
a reſult of the Law of Nature, that
ſuch Societies ſhould have a power to
preſerve themſelves. For ſeeing God
nor Nature do any thing in vain, and
without this power all Societies will
ſoon be diſſolved and periſh, it follows,
that both by the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thoſe Societies that are aſſembled
for the Worſhip of God, ſhould have
a power to maintain and preſerve
themſelves. This<note n="*" place="margin">Serm. on Joh. 18. 36. p. 146.</note> Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> affirms:
There is a neceſſity of diſproportion
or inequality between Men; for were
all perſons equal, the World could not
ſubſiſt. Now this inequality and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
implie a ſuperiority in ſome, and
a ſubordination in others; for, <hi>par in
parem non habet poteſtatem:</hi> if every
one were left at his own liberty, as
none could rule, ſo none would obey:
That therefore there ſhould be both
<hi>ſub</hi> and <hi>ſupra</hi> is of the ſame Law of
Nature, without which there could
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97676:70"/>
be no government or order at all either
in Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Societies. And
ſeeing, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved, that the
Paternal power was the Original of all
Government, <hi>Pol. l. 1. c.</hi> 2. every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
governing his Family both as a
Prince and as a Prieſt in the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times; it is evident, that both
by Nature, and Religion, there ought
to be a <hi>ſub,</hi> and <hi>ſupra;</hi> and if ſo, our
Saviour never did nor intended to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch Laws, but to reinforce and
to confirm them; which that he did
hath been already proved. However
whether this power ſhall be exerciſed
by one or more Perſons, and be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Succeſſion, or applied by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
this is to be regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome poſitive determination ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Divine or Humane. And if the
Law of God, or where that is ſilent
(which I think it is not in the caſe of
<hi>ſub</hi> and <hi>ſupra,</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical officers)
the Law of Man ſhall ſet up one or
more Governors for the government
of the Church, the Perſons advanced
by ſuch authority ought to have more
than a Superiority of Reverence, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97676:71"/>
of obedience and a willing ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all lawful and honeſt commands.
I conclude therefore with my Author,
<hi>p.</hi> 193. Communion is the ſtrength
and ground of all Society, whether
Sacred or Civil: whoever therefore
they be that offend againſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Society, and Friendlineſs of men,
and cauſe ſeparation and breach among
them, if it be in Civil occaſions, are
guilty of Sedition or Rebellion; if it
be by Occaſion of Eccleſiaſtical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
they are guilty of Schiſm.
And it ſhall alway be a part of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
From all ſedition, privy conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
and rebellion, from all falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Hereſie and Schiſm, from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of heart and contempt of thy
Word and Commandments, good Lord
deliver us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conſider only one inſtance
more of the Author's too great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to Schiſm and Hereſie; and then
leave it to the Reader to judge, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the opinion of the Ancients, as it
is generally received by our Modern
Divines, or the fond conceptions of
the Author, be more agreeable to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97676:71"/>
nature of the things, or conducing to
the peace and proſperity of the Church.
The inſtance is that of the ſecond
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of which he ſays,
<hi>p.</hi> 211. <q>That until that Rout did ſet
up Image-worſhip, there was not any
remarkable Schiſm upon juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fact.</q> To this our Author gives
an Anſwer himſelf, <hi>page</hi> 201. where
he deſcribes Schiſm on matter of fact
to be ſuch a ſeparation as is occaſioned
by requiring ſomething to be done by
us, which either we know or ſtrongly
ſuſpect to be unlawful; and concludes,
<hi>p.</hi> 202. that the firſt notable Schiſm
of which we read in the Church (<hi>viz.</hi>
that concerning the obſervation of
<hi>Easter</hi>) did contain in it matter of
fact. Now how can theſe two aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be reconciled? That until the
Schiſm occaſioned by ſetting up Image-worſhip
there was not any remarkable
Schiſm upon juſt occaſion of fact;<note place="margin">Anno 787.</note> And
that the firſt notable Schiſm that we
read of in the Church, (<hi>viz.</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Easter</hi>) did contain matter of
fact,<note place="margin">Anno 168.</note> and it was 600. Years before a
Schiſm ſo notable, as that our Author
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97676:72"/>
thinks, <hi>p.</hi> 203. all the World were
Schiſmaticks. And if our Author be
right, the occaſion of fact was juſt;
for he determines it to be ſo, when
ſomething is required to be done by us
which either we know or ſtrongly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to be unlawful. And the <hi>Aſian</hi>
Churches thought it unlawful for
them to ſubmit to the authority of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would impoſe
on them a rite contrary to an ancient
cuſtome of theirs, to be received as a
matter of faith: of which before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he inſtanceth in the Schiſm of
the <hi>Donatists</hi> which was a complete
Schiſm by our Author's own rules;
for they did not only <hi>erigere Altare
contra Altare,</hi> ſet up Biſhop againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
(to which, our Author obſerves,
that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> imputed the Original
of all Church-diſorders, <hi>page</hi> 222.)
but they erected alſo new Churches
and Oratories for the dividing Party
to meet in publickly, which ſerves to
make a Schiſm complete, <hi>p.</hi> 196. ſo
that there were notable Schiſmes long
before that occaſioned by ſetting up
Image-worſhip. To that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97676:72"/>
in our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 211. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Image-worſhip ſet up by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> I fully accord,
<q>That in this the Schiſmatical party
was the Synod it ſelf and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
with it. For concerning the
uſe of Images <hi>in Sacris, firſt</hi> it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by All, That it is not
a thing neceſſary; 2. That it is by
moſt ſuſpected; 3. It is by many held
utterly unlawful; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
of ſuch a thing can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but abuſe: And the refuſal of
communion here cannot be thought
any other thing than duty.</q> All this
is true; but our Author ſpeaks not the
whole truth: he calls that only ſchiſm
which was hereſie in a fundamental
point concerning the Worſhip of God
according to his expreſs will in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment. And when that
Council had the confidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them as Hereticks that were the
<hi>Iconoclaſtae</hi> or adverſaries to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of Images, we may with more
truth account them who were <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrae,</hi>
worſhippers of Images, Hereticks,
if not Idolaters. By the way let me
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97676:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obſerve, that if it be my duty to
withhold communion from ſuch as
ſet up a falſe way of worſhipping God,
as this Council did, it is my duty alſo
to withdraw from the Communion
of ſuch as profeſs falſe opinions of the
true God, as the Arrians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did, to
whoſe aſſemblies the Author ſees no
reaſon but we may joyn our ſelves,
<hi>p.</hi> 215. Though this be contrary to
his own rule, <hi>p.</hi> 218. <q>It is alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to make profeſſion of known
or ſuſpected falſhoods, as to put in
practice unlawful or ſuſpected Actions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope the Reader will not think
his patience injured, if on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I give him a brief account how
Images were firſt brought into the
Church of God, and what reception
they found in the Primitive times;
of both which I ſhall ſpeak briefly.
They were firſt brought in by lewd
hereticks, and ſimple Chriſtians new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
converted from Paganiſm, the
cuſtoms whereof they had not fully
unlearned. Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to <hi>Maloon, p.</hi> 508. gives this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> hereticks
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97676:73"/>
had ſome Images painted in colours,
others framed of gold, ſilver and other
matter, which they ſaid were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of Chriſt, made while
he was in the power of <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi>
The <hi>Collyridians,</hi> who at certain times
offered Cakes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> did
alſo cauſe Images of her to be made.
<hi>Carpocrates</hi> and <hi>Marcellina</hi> his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
brought the Images of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Anicetus,</hi>
and worſhipped them. But the more
plentiful ſeeds of this Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
were ſown by the heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> obſerves. <hi>We have
ſeen the pictures of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>and
of Chriſt himſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for that
of old they have been wont by a</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
cuſtom <hi>thus to honour them
whom they counted their benefactors or
Saviours.</hi> And the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
having for a long time rent the
Church of God and pulled down the
Fences both of Church and State,
they made way for vaſt numbers of
Infidels to enter, among whom the
Chriſtians being mixed and living in
ſubjection to them in divers places,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97676:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they learned this cuſtom alſo of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and honouring the Images of
thoſe whom they accounted their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and benefactors. Men of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
perſwaſions were the firſt that
were tainted, worſhipping the Graves
and Pictures of their Leaders, then
theſe painted toyes inſnared the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Second the worſhip of them is firſt
practiſed and defended, but at the ſame
time oppoſed by <hi>Leo Iſauricus</hi> and his
ſucceſſors. And in a Council at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
338 Biſhops condemned it,
<hi>Anno</hi> 754. the primitive Fathers having
before that time conſtantly diſputed
againſt the very making and painting
of Images as well as worſhipping them,
whoſe teſtimonies againſt Images it
will be in vain to heap up here. I
think it enough to obſerve, that ſince
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> challenged the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhew but one authority out
of the Ancients for ſetting up of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Churches and worſhipping
them, during the firſt 600 years,
there hath not yet been any tolerable
reply made. But in the year 787.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97676:74"/>
                     <hi>Hadrian</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Tharaſius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> like <hi>Herod</hi>
and <hi>Pilate</hi> were reconciled in this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
deſign, and having the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of a female Governeſs (for <hi>Dux
foemina facti</hi>) they prevailed with <hi>Irene</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to aſſemble a
<hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Nice</hi> (which the Papiſts call
the ſeventh Oecumenical Council, but
by the Ancients was condemned as a
Pſeudo-ſynod.) This <hi>Irene</hi> was a Pagan,
the daughter of a Tartarian King, and
an Imperious tyrannical woman, who in
deſpite to the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
that had decreed againſt Images, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
this Synod, which ſhe ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
that ſhe cauſed the eyes of her
own ſon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be pulled out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not conſent to the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
having of Images, as Bp. <hi>Jewel</hi>
obſerves in the Article of Images, where
you may ſee more of the ignorance and
impiety of this Synod. This was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that called this meeting of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and you may gueſs under what
fears they were of the cruelty of that
woman who was ſo unnatural to her
Son. He that will be ſatisfied more
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97676:75"/>
fully concerning the Ignorance of this
Synod, may read it in their Acts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Binius</hi> or <hi>Surius,</hi> or in Biſhop
<hi>Jewel</hi> concerning the Worſhipping of
Images (<hi>ubi ſuprá.) Mittens Irene
convocavit omnes Epiſcopos,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
ad annum</hi> 787. (ſo that the Pope
had not then the power of calling
Councils by the Cardinals own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.)
There was great intercourſe
of Letters between <hi>Hadrian</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſius</hi>
before this Council was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
which was done at laſt by <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſius</hi>
perſwading of <hi>Irene,</hi> and then
there met 350 Biſhops, who agreed
in this <hi>baſe</hi> decree for the adoration of
Images, as Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> calls it. In
this <hi>Synod</hi> the queſtion for admiſſion
of lapſed Biſhops and Presbyters was
firſt propoſed, and although the Biſhops
that were readmitted were tainted
with Arrianiſm, as appears by the
Synods demand, that they ſhould in
the firſt place make an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bleſſed Trinity; yet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>
ſlightly paſſeth over that, and
makes mention only of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to that point, which as well
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97676:75"/>
the Cardinal as that Synod chiefly
deſigned to advance, <hi>i.e.</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of images. <hi>Baſilius</hi> of <hi>Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Myrene,</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Amorium</hi> are firſt called,
and theſe three <hi>poſt confeſſionem San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſimae
Trinitatis</hi> (of which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
ſays nothing more) make a large
profeſſion of their ſorrow for having
adhered ſo long to the <hi>Iconoclaſtae</hi> or
oppugners of Image-worſhip, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a confeſſion of the Orthodox Faith
(as he calls it) in oppoſition to thoſe
errors and hereticks to which they
had adhered. Now what that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
faith was, appears by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
mentioned by <hi>Baronius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they did Anathematize them that
broke down the images, as Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators
of Chriſtians, and ſuch as did
aſſume the ſentences that are in the
Scriptures againſt Idols, and apply
them to the venerable Images; with
much more to the like purpoſe. But
concerning their reception into the
Church, the queſtion is greatly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated;
and the books being produced
by which it did appear that <hi>Athanaſius,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97676:76"/>
Cyril</hi> and other ancient Pillars of the
Church had received notorious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
into the Church, a Biſhop of the
Province of <hi>Sicilia</hi> objects, that the
Canons of the Fathers which had been
produced were enacted againſt the
<hi>Novatians, Encratiſts</hi> and <hi>Arrians, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
autem haereſis magiſtros quo loco habebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus?
but in what rank</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall we
place the Maſters of this hereſie?</hi> To
which it was replyed by a Deacon of
the ſame Province, that it ſhould be
conſidered, <hi>Minórne eſt quae nunc no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata
eſt haereſis, an major illis quae hacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
fuere, whether this new-ſprung he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
were greater or leſs than thoſe that
were before it.</hi> This is reſolved by
<hi>Tharaſius, malum perpetuò idem eſt &amp;
aequale, That evil is alway the ſame,</hi>
which ſounding too Stoical, one <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
a Deacon and repreſentative
of <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
ſolves it by ſaying, <hi>That it held true,
eſpecially in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical (Aquibus
decretis cùm parvis, tùm magnis errare
idem eſt, ſiquidem in utriſque lex divina
violatur,) for to erre from ſuch decrees
whether in ſmall matters, or great is a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97676:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contempt of the Divine law.</hi> But <hi>John</hi>
a Monk Deputy for the Oriental
thrones pronounceth this hereſie worſe
than all other hereſies, and of all evils
the worſt, as diſturbing the whole
Oeconomy of Chriſt. However their
penitents being but few, for we find
not above three or four mentioned,
they reſtore three of them to their
dignities, and one other, <hi>Gregory</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Neocaeſareae,</hi> who was judged
to be a chief Leader of the <hi>Iconoclaſtae</hi>
was admitted only to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, not to his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
although he declared for Image-worſhip.
But the <hi>Anathema</hi> is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt many others who abhorred
this Idolatrous practice, (profeſſing
they did reject all images made by the
hands of men, and worſhipped that
only, <hi>Qua filius Dei in Sacramento panis
&amp; vini ante paſſionem ſeipſum expreſſit,</hi>)
as did the whole Council of <hi>Fremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
Theodoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinnius</hi>
of <hi>Paſtilla, Baſilius</hi> and others.
And ſhortly after <hi>Charles</hi> the Great
aſſembleth a Council of the Biſhops of
<hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97676:77"/>
Anno</hi> 792. of the tranſactions
whereof we have four books yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
in which we have not only the
Canons of that Council, but many
Imperial Edicts for the taking
away of Images, and forbidding any
worſhip to be given them. Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman, p.</hi> 305. of his firſt Volume
of Councils acquaints us that <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great ſent a book to <hi>Offa</hi> King of
the <hi>Mercians,</hi> wherein Images were
decreed to be worſhipped by this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of <hi>Nice:</hi> of which he tell us
from <hi>Hoveden,</hi> That in that book ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things diſagreeing and contrary to
the true faith were found, eſpecially
that Images ought to be worſhipped,
<hi>which the Church of God doth utterly
condemn.</hi> And that <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> Maſter
to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, but by birth a
<hi>Britan,</hi> in an Epiſtle written in the
name of the Biſhops and Princes of
<hi>England,</hi> and ſent back to <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, did wonderfully overthrow that
opinion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Holy Scripture, which
moved him to call that Synod of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
conſiſting of 300 Fathers, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97676:77"/>
refuted and condemned this decree of
worſhipping Images: which is the
cauſe (ſaith that Author) why the
Monuments of that Synod are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.
And I ſuppoſe that all the
Reformed Churches, eſpecially the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> cannot but abhor
thoſe that eſtabliſhed ſo great an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
by a Law. I remember the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctor <hi>Jackson, p.</hi> 113. of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Church, ſaith, that by the
ſelf ſame ſtroke, by which this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
did <hi>de facto</hi> thruſt all other out of
the viſible Church that would not
worſhip Images, they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be excommunicated <hi>de Jure,</hi>
from the Holy Catholick Church, and
by conſequence from Salvation. When
therefore our Author endeavours by
his Rhetorical flouriſhes to make ſuch
deſtructive errors to dwindle into
ſchiſms, and allows only the names of
ſchiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 213. to Arrianiſm, Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chianiſm,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I thought I had juſt cauſe
to except againſt his firſt Paragraph,
eſpecially when I found how much it
took not only with the Fanaticks and
ſome witty men of our days, but with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97676:78"/>
perſons of real worth and learning,
one of which (whom I forbear to
name) repeats the whole clauſe in a
book of good note in theſe words: <hi>It
is very well obſerved by a learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Divine</hi> (quoting the Tract of
Schiſm, which he calls <hi>that little but
excellent Tract of Schiſm) that hereſie
and ſchiſm as they are commonly uſed,
are two Theological Scar crows with which
they who uſe to uphold a party in Religion
uſe to fright away ſuch, as making inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into it, are ready to relinquiſh and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, if it appear either erròneous or
ſuſpicious. For as</hi> Plutarch <hi>reports of
a Painter, who having unskilfully pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Cock, chaſed away all cocks and
hens, that ſo the imperfection of his Art
might not appear by compariſon with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
ſo men willing for ends, to admit
of no fancy but their own, endeavour to
hinder an enquiry into it, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of ſomewhat with it, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
truer, that ſo the deformity of their
own might not appear.</hi> This ſtory of a
Cock I ſhall Anſwer with another of
a Hen; for I have ſeen a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with the picture of a Hen Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97676:78"/>
artificially drawn on a ſtained
cloth, and a little Pipe to call the
Cock-pheaſants, to draw them from
place to place, until in purſuit of their
pleaſures they have been taken in a
Snare. The reputation of the Author
is as a Pipe which calls unwary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to view the Pictures on that ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cloth, whereof they that grow too
fond may follow them to their own
deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Our Author, <hi>page</hi> 215. gives his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for the compoſing of <hi>Liturgies:</hi>
                     <q>Were Liturgies and publick forms of
ſervice ſo framed, as that they admitted
not of particular and private fancies,
but contained only ſuch things as in
which all Chriſtians do agree, ſchiſms
on opinion were utterly vaniſhed. For
conſider of all Liturgies that are or
ever have been, and remove from
them whatſoever is ſcandalous to any
Party, and leave nothing but what
all agree on, and the event ſhall be
that the publick ſervice and honour
of God ſhall no way ſuffer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
to load our publick forms with
the private fancies upon which we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97676:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
differ, is the moſt ſoveraign way
to perpetuate Schiſm to the Worlds
end. Prayer, Confeſſion, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
Reading of Scriptures, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Scripture, Adminiſtration
of Sacraments in the plaineſt and
ſimpleſt manner, were matter enough
to furniſh out a ſufficient Liturgy,
though nothing either of private
opinion, or of Church-pomp of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of preſcribed Geſtures, of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magery,
of Muſick, of matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Dead, of many ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which creep into the Churches
under the Name of Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
did interpoſe it ſelf: for to
charge Churches and Liturgies with

in the framing of a Liturgy,
it is moſt certain we ſhould
never have any; ſeeing as
there is ſcarce any part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97676:79"/>
which ſome do not except, ſo
others are offended at the very form,
as being a ſtinting of the Spirit; and
the oppoſing of a Directory to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Liturgy, ſhews that this was
the ſenſe of the Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which appears alſo by this, that
when they had in the Grand Debate
given in their Objections to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
ſome of the Brotherhood had
prepared another form, but a great
part of their Brethren objected many
things againſt that, and never as yet
did (that I hear of) agree upon any
other, nor I think ever will. For let
it be conſidered that there is ſcarce any
part of our Liturgy which ſome have
not excepted againſt, and you will find
our Author's advice impracticable.
He himſelf would have no Abſolution,
as appears, not only by his omiſſion
of that Office, when he enumerates
the parts of a Liturgy, but by telling
us, that the power of the Keys belongs
to every one, Clergy or Lay, Male or
Female, not only for himſelf, but for
the benefit of others, <hi>p.</hi> 172. and <hi>p.</hi> 183.
that you may as well make your Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97676:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your Confeſſor, as your Pariſh-Prieſt;
Others will have no confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Some are diſpleaſed at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes,
others cannot be reconciled to
the Lord's Prayer, againſt the uſe of
which as the Leaders of one Faction
have Printed, ſo the Grandees of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
have often preached. The
Reader knows what ſort of People
cannot joyn in the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the
<hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds, and it
is well if they will ſtand to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The <hi>Te Deum</hi> and <hi>Magnificat</hi>
are diſpleaſing to ſome; the Collects,
becauſe they are too ſhort, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
becauſe it is too long, to others.
Some are angry at the Prayer for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
others not very well pleaſed
with thoſe for the King. If you read
what our Author ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 60. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
(as 1. that in the Communion
there is nothing given but Bread and
Wine; 2. The Bread and Wine are
ſigns indeed, but not of any thing there
exhibited, but of ſomething given long
before; 3. That Jeſus Chriſt is eaten
at the Communion-Table in no ſenſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97676:80"/>
neither ſpiritually by vertue of any
thing done there, nor really nor meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically
nor literally. 4. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
eating of Chriſt of common to
all places, as well as the Lords Table:)
you may ſee the Author was no friend
to the Office for Adminiſtration of the
Lord's Supper. And it's well known
who are enemies to that of Baptiſm.
Our Author diſlikes the conſecration
of Biſhops, to whom he denies any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
but that of reverence, others
oppoſe the Ordination of Prieſts. It
is ſad to conſider at what a Diſtance
many of our People yet keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and children from the Catechiſm
and Confirmation, and the burial of
the Dead; only that of Marriage they
are pretty well reconciled to. So that
I ſay, our Author's Propoſals are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
if not impoſſible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
either to remove from our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
whatever is (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſeems) ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to every Party, or to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what all agree on; and I
think we ſhall all agree ſooner in an
Univerſal character and language too,
than in ſuch a Liturgy.</p>

Our firſt Reformers have given us
undeniable Proofs that they were very
learned and very good Men, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<note n="*" place="margin">ubi ſuprá.</note> 
                     <hi>Jewel</hi> in their name profeſſeth
that they did conſult the ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
of the pureſt times, and adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ours to them. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> condemn
us for caſtrating as much as was thought
ſinful, muſt we be ſtill condemned for
retaining what is decent? If any thing
in our Liturgy had been contrary to
the Word of God, I am confident the
Church would have expunged it as
ſoon as its adverſaries had diſcovered
it: but if it be quarrelled at for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us to worſhip God according to
the Apoſtolical injunction in Decency
and order, we had rather be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beaſts of burden in ſubmitting to
the lawful Ordinances of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
than wild Aſſes for kicking againſt
our Maſters. It hath alway been the
practice of the Church of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the practice of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. when any opinions or
practices contrary to Faith or Unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to prevail, to aſſemble in Councils
and Synods, that by conference and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97676:81"/>
conſulting with the Scriptures and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
cuſtomes, they might raiſe a
fence againſt the growing torrent, and
as well confirm their own, as confute
the opinions and practices of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries:
as may be ſeen in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Canons made in the firſt 600
Years. And when by general conſent
and ſubſcription theſe Decrees were
approved, they did as occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
inſert ſometimes into the Liturgy
ſuch paſſages out of their own or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Articles, as might help to inſtruct
the People in the true Faith, and be
an antidote againſt thoſe poiſonous
errors that were become Epidemical.
Hence firſt the Apoſtles Creed, and the
<hi>Gloria Patri, &amp;c.</hi> and thoſe being not
expreſs enough againſt prevailing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds
were inſerted, and ſome whole Articles
were added to the Apoſtles Creed. And
if, as our Author ſaith, a man may go to
an <hi>Arrian</hi> Church, ſo there be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm
expreſt in their Liturgy, why
may not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Superiors require our
communion in the Liturgy which is
free from that and all other Doctrinal
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97676:82"/>
errors? And whereas our Liturgy is
in all things conform to our Articles
of Doctrine, which are ſo free from
the exceptions either of <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or
<hi>Arminians,</hi> as that both Parties appeal
to it as to the ſtandard whereby they
would have their Opinions tryed, as
appears in the late quiquarticular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
between Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Hickman;</hi> I ſee no reaſon why they
may not upon our Author's grounds
conform much rather to ours than unto
<hi>Arrian</hi> Liturgies. A Liturgy that hath
paſt many fiery Trials, firſt in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
days, when the Compoſers of it
imbraced it at their Martyrdom, after
which it appeared ſo inoffenſive to the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, which I account
no ſmall commendation, that for ſome
Years after Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to
the Crown, they omitted not to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the uſe of it, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our troubles when the <hi>Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctymnuans</hi>
heated the Irons, and made
it paſs the trial Ordeal, its innocency
was ſuch that it came off untoucht.
And when in the Grand Debate their
Succeſſors thought to have blown it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97676:82"/>
up by the fewel which they had heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in a mock-liturgy, their
plot was ſo confuſed and imperfect,
that a great part of the Brotherhood
were of the Opinion that the old was
better. And I am ſtill perſwaded, if
it were put to the vote whether this
Liturgy ſhould be retained, or any
other formerly uſed in the Primitive,
or now in uſe among the Reformed
Churches brought into its room, they
would give the like ſuffrage as I have
heard Sr. <hi>Harry Martyne</hi> did when
ſome of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Confidents had
moved the queſtion, whether They
ſhould have a King or no King, that
if they muſt have a King, they had
rather have the Old Gentleman (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King <hi>Charles</hi> of bleſſed memory)
than any other in the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Our Author begins to treat of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi>
from <hi>p.</hi> 226. and continueth
it to the end. The ſubſtance of which
I ſhall preſent to the Reader in theſe
ſeveral and divers Periods.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſays truly, that all meetings
upon unneceſſary occaſions of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are to be ſo ſtiled, ſo that in this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97676:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſenſe a Conventicle is nothing elſe
but a congregation of ſchiſmaticks.
And he had before, <hi>p.</hi> 196. determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them to be ſchiſmaticks, 1. That
do chuſe a Biſhop in oppoſition to the
former, and 2. That do erect a new
Church and Oratory for the dividing
party to meet in publickly. Now our
Author, <hi>p.</hi> 200. moves the queſtion,
<q>Who ſhall judge what is a neceſſary
occaſion of ſeparation? which queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he ſays, hath been often made
but never truly Anſwered; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a point of great depth or
difficulty truly to aſſoil it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the true ſolution carryeth fire
in the tail of it; for it bringeth with
it a piece of Doctrine which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
pleaſing to Superiors. To you
for the preſent this ſhall ſuffice, if ſo
be you be <hi>Animo defaecato,</hi> if you have
cleared your ſelf from froth and
grounds, if neither ſloth nor fears
nor ambition nor any tempting ſpirits
of that nature abuſe you (for theſe
and ſuch as theſe are the true impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
why both that and other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
of the like danger are not truly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97676:83"/>
Anſwered) if all this be and yet you
ſee not how to frame your reſolution
and ſettle your ſelf for that doubt, I
will ſay no more of you than was
ſaid of <hi>Papias</hi> S. <hi>Johns</hi> own Scholar,
you are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are not ſo good as I preſumed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This queſtion is ſo eaſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that (as our Author thinks</hi>)
every perſon may ſettle himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
what to do in it, if he be <hi>Animo
defaecato,</hi> and have cleared himſelf from
froth and grounds, if neither ſloth nor
fears nor Ambition nor any tempting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of that nature abuſe him.</p>
                  <p>One or more of theſe impediments
it is probable prevailed with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
not to determine the queſtion ſo
plainly as he ought, and moſt likely
that of fear; becauſe he ſaith it would
be diſpleaſing to Superiors, and would
carry fire in the tail of it. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
his fears were juſt, it could not
do otherwiſe than provoke his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
in a high degree, if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
delivered what he intimates
in diverſe parts of the Treatiſe to be
his Opinion, and when I ſhall collect
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97676:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them you will ſee they carry wild fire
and powder-plots in their tails enough
to blow up all Government.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, who ſhould judge
what is a neceſſary Occaſion of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
Which queſtion he intends
not to leave to the judgment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
whom he ſuppoſeth to give
the Occaſion and to whom the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would not be pleaſing, but to
thoſe that take the occaſion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he leaves it to private perſons to
judge of the Laws of their Superiors,
who if they cannot find will eaſily
ſeign ſome occaſion to excuſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
And our Author hath fitted
it to their hands, for he informs them,
<hi>p.</hi> 194. <q>That when either falſe or
uncertain concluſions are obtruded for
truth, and acts either unlawful or
miniſtring juſt ſcruple are required
of us to be performed, in theſe caſes
conſent were conſpiracy; and open
conteſtation is not faction or ſchiſm,
but due Chriſtian Animoſity.</q> And
<hi>p.</hi> 201. He makes it a juſt occaſion of
ſeparation, when <q>ſomething is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be done by us which either
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97676:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we know or ſtrongly ſuſpect, (which
in our Authors phraſe is the ſame
with juſt ſcruple) to be unlawful.</q>
And again, <hi>p.</hi> 218. <q>Whereſoever
falſe or ſuſpected Opinions are made
a piece of the Church Liturgy, he
that ſeparates is not the ſchiſmatick.</q>
So that now there needs no <hi>Oedipus</hi>
to unriddle the myſtery. For 1. if
our Governors ſhall at any time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
uncertain concluſions for truth
(how certain ſoever they be to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
if they appear not ſo to us:)
Or 2. if they require ſomething to
be done by us, which we may juſtly
ſcruple or ſtrongly ſuſpect: Or, 3. if
they ſhall make ſuſpected Opinions a
piece of Church Liturgy; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſufficient not only to juſtifie a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but to entitle the Separatiſts
to due Chriſtian Animoſity. And our
Author needed not the ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
to foretel that this would be
diſpleaſing to Governors and carry
fire in its tail; for it ſtrikes directly
at the foundation of all Government
both in Church and State. For in
both Governments when ſuch things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97676:85"/>
are by ſolemn Edicts commanded or
forbidden as are apparently good or
evil, we are to obey for Gods ſake;
but where things neither good nor
evil by any natural or poſitive law of
God are injoyned by our superiours,
it is undoubtedly our duty to ſubmit
to them. A ſcrupling Conſcience,
or the diſſent of private judgments to
the deliberate determinations of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
in theſe caſes can be no <hi>ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi>
to the obedience that is due from
ſubjects, as hath been already proved
from the Nonconformiſts own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and will yet more clearly
appear.</p>
                  <p>To which end I ſhall premiſe out of
Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> conceſſions, <hi>p.</hi> 408. of his
ſurvey of Eccleſiaſtical Polity. <hi>Thoſe
pretended errors in our caſe</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>are not in matters of faith, nor for the
moſt part in or about the Worſhip of God,
or that which is acknowledged ſo to be;
but in or about thoſe things which ſome
think it convenient to add unto it or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
with it. And what peace, what
quietneſs is like to be in the world, when
the ſword of vengeance muſt be drawn
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97676:85"/>
about theſe things?</hi> To which I only
reply, Let them that draw the ſword
in ſuch quarrels periſh with the ſword.
God hath put a ſword into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
hand, to be a terror to evil
works, and if unpeaceable men will
not be ſubject, neither for fear of wrath,
nor for Conſcience ſake, but will raiſe
tumults and ſeditious Factions againſt
their lawful Rulers upon ſcruples and
punctilio's, they are the Aggreſſors;
and unleſs the Magiſtrate will ſuffer
the ſword which God hath put into
his hands, to be wreſted from him,
he ought to be an Avenger to execute
wrath upon evil doers, their ſcruples
concerning the lawfulneſs of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
acts of Worſhip notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>2. I premiſe, that ſuch men as are
ſound as to the foundation of faith, and
careful thereupon to build a holy life,
and keep a Conſcience void of offence
towards God and man, (though in
ſuch things as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
they ſhould not be able through
their weakneſs of judgment, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
endeavours to get reſolution of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97676:86"/>
their ſcruples) if they do yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to them that God hath ſet over
them, though they ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
yet their errors would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
their Salvation. And on this
ground many of the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
hope well, of multitudes under
the Roman tyranny, and I doubt not
but the Nonconformiſts have ſo much
Charity as to have as good hopes of
ſuch honeſt Chriſtians as die in the
Communion of our Church.</p>
                  <p>3. If it ſhould happen that ſome
good and honeſt men who are both
ſound in the faith and unblamable in
life, do after ſerious inquiry remain
ſcrupulous ſtill, it is their duty to take
the ſafeſt way, and that is the way of
obedience to their Lawful Governors,
which being a moral duty and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyned by the word of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be diſpenſed with by ſcruples about
the lawfulneſs of rites and ceremonies
in the external worſhip of God. And
I may ſafely add,</p>
                  <p>4. That if honeſt and well meaning
men ſhall ſo far indulge to ſuch ſcruples
as to live in diſobedience to the Laws
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97676:86"/>
and conſtitutions of their Superiors,
their Superiors may juſtly puniſh them
for ſo doing, or the frame of their
Government will ſoon be
turned off its hinges:<note place="margin">The taſte of liberty is ſo ſweet, that except Kings maintain their Authority with as great violence as the People affect their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, all things will run to confuſion. <hi>Golden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> p. 149.</note> And
Governors not being able
to diſcern the hearts of
men, may equally ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert
upon all refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
perſons, or they muſt
let all go unpuniſhed; and
if they ſhould reſolve on this later,
farewell all Government. And ſeeing
the wiſdom of Man cannot prevent it,
it is better that a few miſtaken Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
ſhould be puniſhed, than the
peace and foundation of a Church or
Nation be overturned. <hi>Melius pereat
unus quàm unitas.</hi> Better is a private
inconvenience than a publick miſchief.
This is a foundation neceſſary to the
ſettlement of all humane Laws and
Conſtitutions. Thus in matters of
common right and intereſt, when the
ſeveral Courts of a Nation have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and publiſhed rules and orders
for the appearances and proceedings
of Perſons litigant, they who omit the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97676:87"/>
time, or miſtake the right methods of
pleading, and thereupon ſuffer damage,
though as to the merits of their cauſe
they be ſeverely dealt with, yet the
proceedings of the Law are right and
juſtifiable, becauſe it is more for the
publick peace and eſtabliſhment that
ſome perſons ſhould ſuſtain loſs for
their unwilling neglects and errors,
than that all wilful Offenders ſhould
go unpuniſhed, and publick Orders of
Court be contemned and diſobeyed.
And this Rule holds much ſtronger in
ſuch Eccleſiaſtical caſes as are now
under our conſideration; becauſe the
controverſie is not here between pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons, but between Superiors
and Subjects. If therefore one or more
private Perſons purely on miſtake, and
after humble and ſerious inquiry for
ſatisfaction (though I think few ſober
perſons uſing ſuch means can remain
unſatisfied in ſo plain a caſe, Whether
Scruples concerning ancient and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
rites in the external Worſhip of
God can juſtifie diſobedience to the
conſtitutions of lawful Governors)
ſhould ſtill judge contrary to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97676:87"/>
who impoſe ſuch things as
lawful and convenient, to be unlawful
and ſuperſtitious, and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to appear at their Courts and be
ordered by them; It is agreeable to
the Laws of all Societies that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould not go unpuniſhed. If a
Child or Servant ſhall neglect to obey
his Father or Maſter becauſe he hath
ſome Scruples againſt his commands,
I think ſuch Father or Maſter may
without Scruple correct that Child or
Servant, or within a ſhort time they
will become incorrigible. And the
Caſe is almoſt the ſame as if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
part of the Nation, who are
morally vicious, ſhould pretend ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of conſcience againſt ſuch Laws
of the Land as reſtrain their enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſuppoſe of Sabbath-breaking and
neglecting the Publick Worſhip, which
yet I think the Nonconformiſts would
not judge to be a tolerable plea.</p>
                  <p>I have inſiſted ſo long on this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not only becauſe our Author
mentioneth it ſo often, and ever makes
it a ground for ſeparation, telling us
that <hi>Not only in Reaſon but in Religion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97676:88"/>

<hi>John Owen</hi> for the Independents would
have ſome warrant from Scripture for
every thing that is required in the
Worſhip of God. But minding my
Reader of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s conceſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, to which I ſhall only
add the confeſſions of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who from the beginning oppoſed
our Rites and Ceremonies not as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
but only as inconvenient, as
Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> did in his ſecond Reply,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97676:88"/>
                     <hi>p.</hi> 262. and therefore perſwaded Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
rather to wear the Garments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by Law than ceaſe their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
And in his <hi>Evangelical Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
on <hi>Luke 22. à verſu 14. ad</hi> 19. ſaith,
That kneeling in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being incommodious in its own
nature, and made more incommodious
by <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſuperſtition, is not ſo to be
rejected, that for the ſake thereof we
ſhould abſtain from the Sacrament:
(His words are theſe, <hi>Geniculatio in
participatione ſuâ naturâ incommoda, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitione
pontificiâ longè facta eſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modior;
Nec tamen propterea ita rejici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda,
ut ejus nomine à Sacramento abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neamus,
ſi ejus caeteroquin participes eſſe
nequimus, quia res ſuâ naturâ non est
purè illicita</hi>) becauſe the thing is not
in its own nature utterly unlawful.
From whence we may conclude, that
ſuch things as are not purely unlawful
in their own nature, though they are
incommodiouſly applied and have been
groſly abuſed by <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſuperſtition, are
not a ſufficient cauſe to hinder our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of Divine Ordinances. And
yet to what miſchievous ends is this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97676:89"/>
forlorn ſcruple, of receiving that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Sacrament on our Knees, made uſe
of by Fanatick Perſons as a Bar againſt
the receiving of it at all? though it
be a poſture ſanctified by the Son of
God when in the days of his being in
the fleſh he offered up Prayers to God,
and hath been uſed by all ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in their publick and private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
and therefore moſt agreeable
to that Solemn Office, wherein we
cannot with ſufficient humility and
reverence receive at the hands of God
ſuch an ineffable bleſſing, nor worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſs our humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thankfulneſs to God. And
in the act of receiving beſides our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ſupplication to God to pardon and
abſolve us from all our ſins for Chriſt's
ſake, we joyn with the Miniſter to
pray, that the Body of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt which was given for us may
preſerve our Bodies and Souls to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; though the Church hath uſed
as plain and effectual a mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our being ſcandalized, and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
at it (by declaring in the Rubrick
<hi>that no adoration is intended or ought to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97676:89"/>
be done either to the Sacramental Bread
and Wine there bodily received, or to any
corporal preſence of Chriſt's natural fleſh
and bloud; for the Sacramental bread
and wine remain still in their very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſubſtances, and therefore may not be
adored, for that were Idolatry to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
of all Chriſtians. And that it
was intended for a ſignification of our
humble and grateful acknowledgment of
the benefits of Christ therein given to all
worthy receivers, and for avoiding ſuch
diſorder and profanation in the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
as might otherwiſe enſue</hi>) as the
wiſdom of Men can invent; yet the
outcry of Superſtition, Will-worſhip,
and Idolizing the Creatures of Bread
and Wine is kept up, and the hearts
of the People filled with invincible
prejudices and ſcruples, to the neglect
and contempt of this neceſſary duty
which by Chriſt's inſtitution and by
Primitive practice ought to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
performed, and by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the Church at leaſt three
times every Year, but hath been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
omitted by ſome very adult Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
all their lives; contrary to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97676:90"/>
advice and practice of former Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
as well as to the commands
of God and his Church. And what
can the end of theſe things be, but
hardning the People in their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and ignorance, in uncharitable
prejudices and diſtances from their
more pious and peaceable Brethren,
and provoking their Superiors to Acts
of rigor and ſeverity, unleſs they will
permit all things to run to confuſion?
And whereas upon the late Teſt all
Perſons that had any publick office or
imployment were required to receive
this Holy Sacrament according to the
Cuſtome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
or to forfeit that imployment, not one
of an Hundred of thoſe ſcrupulous
Perſons that were concerned continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Recuſant: I ſuppoſe they have
ſufficiently convinced the Magiſtrates
that the beſt way of removing theſe
Scruples is to require the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice of that duty under the
like penalties.</p>
                  <p>And now I hope the frivolouſneſs
of our Author's poſition, <hi>p. 218. That
whereſoever falſe or ſuſpected Opinions</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:97676:90"/>
(and he aſſerts the ſame of practiſing
ſuſpected Actions in the ſame period)
<hi>are made a piece of the Liturgy, he that
ſeparates is not the Schiſmatick,</hi> doth
evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>And if he that ſeparates be not the
Schiſmatick, then they that require
the performance of a ſuſpected action
are ſo, and by conſequence it will be
in the power of every ſcrupulous facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to denominate their Governours
to be the Schiſmaticks. As our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
determineth the caſe, a man may
as innocently disbelieve any Article of
his Chriſtian faith upon this pretence
of ſcruples againſt them, as diſobey
the command of his Superiors. <hi>For</hi>
(ſaith he, <hi>p. 194.) when uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
are obtruded for truth, or acts
miniſtring juſt ſcruples are required to be
performed, conſent were conſpiracy and
open conteſtation is not faction or ſchiſm,
&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 218. he gives this Reaſon
for it, <hi>It is alike unlawful to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of known or ſuſpected falſhoods, as
to put in practice unlawful or ſuſpected</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:97676:91"/>
Now ſuppoſe a ſubtle <hi>Socinian</hi>
ſhould meet with a ſcrupulous perſon
and tell him, that he doth well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to ſuſpend his Communion from
that Church which impoſeth thoſe
things to be practiſed in the worſhip
of God, which have no warrant from
thence, but are rather condemned as
Will-worſhip and Superſtition; but
yet while he ſtrains at a Gnat he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
a Camel, and ſuffers his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to be impoſed upon in matters
of Faith which are of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
and then inſinuate, that there
is no expreſs text in Scripture nor any
good Argument from Reaſon for a
Trinity of perſons in the Unity of the
Godhead, but both Scripture and
Reaſon affirm there can be but one
Supreme eternal God; and then by
wreſting the Scriptures, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him that the Doctrine of the
Trinity had its riſe from Eccleſiaſtical
Tradition not from the Scriptures,
and they that require the belief of it
<hi>do teach for Doctrines the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men:</hi> ſuppoſe, I ſay, by this
leaven the ſcrupulous humor is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97676:91"/>
and ſwells up into a ſtrong
ſuſpicion, and he begins to grow
ſowr and diſcontented with his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and likes the Arrian and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian
Doctors better; Doth not
this man proceed upon the Authors
grounds, and may be as much juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by them if he turn Heretick, as
if he become a Schiſmatick? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is not one Article of our
Faith but cunning Sophiſters may
work upon perſons diſpoſed to ſcruples
to have ſtrong ſuſpicions of them.
For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us in his <hi>Saints
everlaſting reſt, Part 1. ch. 7. Sect.</hi> 14.
That Profeſſors of Religion did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
almoſt all the Worſhip of God
out of Conſcience, which others did
out of Prophaneneſs. Upon this very
pretenſe ſome will not hear of Infant
Baptiſm, nor others of the Lord's day,
but turn Anabaptiſts and Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
and for ought I know others
may juſtifie rebellion, and not only
the Omiſſion of moral duties, but the
Commiſſion of any vice or impiety.
Experience hath evidently taught us,
that thoſe perſons who have been
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97676:92"/>
prone to entertain ſcruples in matters
of Religion firſt, have fallen next
into ſedition and rebellion, and then
to impiety and immoralities, to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm,
Atheiſm, unnatural affection
to Parents, and acts and practices of as
great cruelty and barbarity againſt
themſelves as againſt others.</p>
                  <p>But our Author grounds his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
on <hi>Rom. 14. 23. Whatſoever is
not of Faith is ſin;</hi> and <hi>He that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
is damned if he eat.</hi> And this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
ſeems to be inforced by the
Authority of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> who
<hi>p. 228. de Obligatione Conſcientiae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
ſaith thus: <hi>If any one through ſome
faſt rooted error of judgment do think
the Law to be unjuſt which is not ſo, the
obligation of the Law doth remain, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that error of mind, ſo that he
is not free from ſin if he do not obey; yet
that he ſinneth more grievouſly if he ſhould
obey, before that error be laid aſide.</hi> Which
eaſe the Reverend Caſuiſt intended to
ſpeak of more at large when he ſhould
come to treat of the compariſon of
both obligations, <hi>viz.</hi> (as I ſuppoſe)
the authority of the Magiſtrate and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97676:92"/>
of Conſcience. For I perceive the
queſtion to which he makes this an
Anſwer was, What aſſurance that any
Law is unjuſt, is required to ſecure a
ſubject in point of Conſcience that he
is not bound by that Law? But the
good Biſhop never came to that point
under which we might have expected
his farther judgment in that caſe;
and therefore I ſhall take a little pains
in finding out his reſolution, in ſome
other parts of his writings.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer. <hi>The Biſhop ſays:</hi> If a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
becauſe that probable reaſons do
appear on both ſides, knoweth not nor
can determine whether a Law be juſt or
no, ſo that his judgment hang <hi>in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio</hi>
not knowing to which to incline; in
this caſe the ſubject is bound actually to
obey; ſo that he ſinneth if he do not obey,
and if he do obey he ſinneth not. <hi>Now I
obſerve, that when the Biſhop comes
to give his reaſons why a ſubject ſhould
obey againſt a ſcrupulous Conſcience,
the ſame Reaſons do require his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
though his ſcruples he invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and obfirmed, yea in things
doubtful, as by theſe following Reaſons
of his may appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:97676:93"/>
His firſt Reaſon is, becauſe by a
Reaſon of Law, <hi>In dubiis potior eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio
poſſidentis;</hi> therefore where there
is a conteſt concerning a right betwixt
the Lawgiver and the ſubject, the
right is alway to be preſumed to be
on the Lawgivers ſide, as being in
poſſeſſion of the right, unleſs ſome fit
reaſon can be given to the contrary:
but in this caſe (<hi>i. e.</hi> in things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
no ſuch fit reaſon can be given,
becauſe it would deſtroy the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is, that the things are
equally doubted of.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon is taken from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rule of Law, That in a doubtful
caſe the ſafer part is to be choſen: and
it is certainly more ſafe to obey with a
doubting Conſcience, than not to obey
with a doubting Conſcience; Becauſe
ſecondly it is ſafer in giving honour to
Superiors to exceed that meaſure
which we owe, than to be defective in
it. Thirdly Becauſe from the ſame rule
it is generally more ſafe that he who
is free ſhould think himſelf bound,
than that he who is bound ſhould
think himſelf free: for ſeeing through
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97676:93"/>
the natural pravity of mans heart he
ſinneth more often through too much
confidence than through too much
fear, and we are more prone to carnal
licentiouſneſs than is fit, and we are
all too impatient to bear the yoke; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we do with full purpoſe of mind
reſolve to obey ſuch Laws as are not
evidently unjuſt, the wiſdom of the
fleſh and the craft of the Serpent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
added, will often ſuggeſt ſuch
excuſes as will hinder us from doing
our duty in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>In his Sermon on <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. the
Biſhop firſt ſhews what a doubting
Conſcience is, namely when the ſcales
hang even, ſo as a man cannot well
reſolve whether way he ſhould rather
take, <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. which he ſays, may be
becauſe reaſons ſeem to be probable
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and there are learned men
of the one opinion as well as of the
other; and <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. he ſays, If the
liberty of the agent be determined by
ſome Superior power to whom he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
obedience ſo as he is not <hi>ſui juris
ad hoc,</hi> to do or not to do at his own
choice, but to do what he is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97676:94"/>
this one circumſtance quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
the whole caſe, and now he is
bound in Conſcience to do the thing
commanded, his doubtfulneſs of mind
whether that thing be lawful or no
notwithſtanding. And afterward he
adds: Truly it is a great wonder to
me that any man endued with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and that is able in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to weigh the force of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and reaſons which bind inferiors
to yield obedience to their Superiors,

minded in caſes of like
nature.<note place="margin">As for Orders eſtabliſhed, ſith Equity and Reaſon favour that which is in being, till orderly judgment of deciſion be given againſt it, it is but juſtice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of you, and perverſeneſs in you it would be to deny thereunto your willing obedience. <hi>Mr. Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Preface,</hi> I aſſert, that as to things in the judgment of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and reformed Churches left undetermined by the Law of God, and in matters of meer decency and order, and wholly as to the form of Government, every one, <hi>notwithſtanding what his private judgment may be of them,</hi> is bound for the peace of the Church of God to ſubmit to the lawful determination of the lawful Governors of the Church. <hi>Idem.</hi>

in that caſe if the Magiſtrate ſhall

becauſe as Diamonds are not
cut but by Diamonds, ſo I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
of explaining his meaning but by
himſelf. And if the <hi>Reader</hi> will but add
to this, what Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> hath ſaid
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97676:95"/>
concerning this objection from <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 23. he may eaſily perceive that
neither that text nor any concluſions
to be drawn from it can be preſt for the
ſervice of our Separatiſts. For as he ſays,
<hi>p.</hi> 425. This rule muſt be applyed to
the ſpecial caſe intended, which is, that
wherever the omitting any action
is certainly free from ſin, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it appeareth to any perſon
doubtful, there to do that action is a
very evil and dangerous practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it containeth in it a chuſing to
run the hazard of Sin, which choice
is alway a ſin. But the caſe is much
different when both acting and
forbearing may be doubted of,
where the one of them is a duty, and
it is impoſſible that both of them
ſhould be forborn. For God having
commanded Superiors to rule and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors
to obey, to ſuſpend all action
here is to perform an inward moral
action of choice about a matter of
duty, which if it be not regularly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
is a ſin. And in this caſe ſo far
as concerneth the obedience of a
Child, Servant or Subject, they ought
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97676:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to account their Superiors command
to lay ſuch an obligation upon them
to duty, that they muſt be guided
thereby, unleſs they be able to prove
themſelves bound to act the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Having thus removed the Objection
concerning doubts and ſcruples, I may
take liberty to recreate my <hi>Reader</hi> with
a known ſtory of a Scrupling houſe
erected in <hi>Oxford</hi> by ſome of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1646.</p>
                  <p>There was in S. <hi>Peters the Eaſt</hi> a
place ſet a part for all people that were
diſſatisfied or troubled in mind to
meet in every Tueſday, for reſolution
of their doubts in a plain and familiar
diſcourſe. Many Sermons were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to commend the uſefulneſs of that
Ordinance, which they grounded on
ſeveral places of Scripture. One day
while <hi>Hen. Wilkinſon,</hi> Sen. was Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and Mr. <hi>Reynolds, Harris, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Corniſh, Lungly</hi> and <hi>Cheynel</hi> were
ſet down with him, ſome ſouldiers of
the Independent party, <hi>Erbury, Grymes,
Hewſon</hi> and others came to viſit the
Viſitors, and after a while <hi>Erbury</hi>
propoſeth his doubt, whether in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97676:96"/>
Church of Chriſt the Miniſtery was
committed to certain ſelect men, for
he thought all the gifted Brethren
might preach; and declared his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to diſpute it with them: but the
<gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap>  pretending an Order, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon for delaying the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Scruples a week after the firſt
propoſal, put off the diſpute until the
next meeting. Which being noiſed
through the Univerſity, a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Gentlemen, Scholars and
Souldiers attended it. And <hi>Erbury</hi>
who had been ſometime of <hi>Braſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſe
Colledge,</hi> after a bold Prologue
begun the Comedy, affirming, That
in the Church of Chriſt there was no
Commiſſion given to Select men for
preaching the Goſpel. And after ſome
diſcourſe about ſtating the Queſtion,
<hi>Erbury</hi> urgeth, that if they had ſuch
a commiſſion it was either Ordinary or
Extraordinary. The Anſwer was, that
it was Ordinary. He replies, then they
had it from the Biſhops, or ſome others.
At which the <hi>Doctores Reſoluti</hi> were
unreſolved what to Anſwer; for if
they ſhould ſay from the Biſhops, they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97676:96"/>
feared to diſpleaſe the people to
whom they had often preached that
they were Antichriſtian, and yet they
could not deny it, they having been
all Epiſcopally Ordained. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into ſome confuſion, and not
replying directly, but ſeeking ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges,
the ſouldiers were with great
acclamations proclaimed Victors, and
the ſcrupling houſe ſhut up, and the
Comedy ended. But <hi>nondum finitus
Oreſtes.</hi> I wiſh the Tragedies occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by theſe ſcruples were ended
alſo. But <hi>Quouſque tandem?</hi> How long
will theſe Scrupuliſts halt between
God and <hi>Baal,</hi> between the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſervice of God in his Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and the unreaſonable ſuggeſtions
of thoſe imperious maſters that Lord
it over their Conſciences? They that
inject theſe Scruples to the minds of
younger and weaker perſons are for
the moſt part men of age and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
underſtanding, and in ſo long a
time as they have been in travel with
them, and knowing that as well their
own temporal and eternal happineſs as
the eſtabliſhment of the Church and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97676:97"/>
State depends on the reſolution of
them, it may rationally be expected
that after their mutual conference
with one another in divers Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
to that end, and their ſolemn
ſeeking of God, they ſhould have been
able to diſcover where the ſinfulneſs
of theſe things which they ſcruple at
doth lye; or, that not being yet done,
nor I think poſſible for wiſer Men
than themſelves to do, they ſhould
deliver the Nation and themſelves
from thoſe throws and pangs which
ſuch falſe conceptions have occaſioned.
And when the Inventors of State fears
and jealouſies have been aſhamed and
confounded upon the diſcovery and
puniſhment of their villanous deſigns,
it is ſtrange that Men of ſuch tender
Conſciences as our Church-reformers
pretend to be, ſhould feel no regret
for all thoſe real miſchiefs and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which their fond ſuſpicions and
ſcruples have occaſioned. Others may
call this moroſe humour, conſcience
and conſtancy, but in truth it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a ſtubborn contumacy
and a proud contempt of Superiors.

to the Decrees of their Superiors in
order to publick peace, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
plainly requires,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Submit your
ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the
Lords ſake,</hi> ſo that nothing can excuſe
our diſobedience to Governors but
their requiring ſomething contrary to
the Command of God. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they injoyn ſome things that are
not unlawful in themſelves, and by
reaſon of ſome ſcruples we refuſe to
obey them; our very ſcrupling mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
that we know not, but they may
be agreeable to God's will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our not obeying is a violation of
the Law of God as well as of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.
The greater authority always
makes void the leſs. A Maſter cannot
oblige his Servant againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his Prince, nor a Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the command of God; nor can
our private Conſciences in any thing
for which we have not a command
from God, oblige us againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of our Prince. And when in all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97676:98"/>
other things we ſubmit our ſelves to
the determinations of others that are
wiſer than our ſelves, as in matter of
health to the preſcripts of Phyſicians,
in matters of right to counſel of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers;
I ſee not any reaſon why we
ſhould not in the externals of Religion
ſubmit our ſelves to them that have
the rule over us as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
unleſs we will give this as
a Reaſon, that we think our ſelves
wiſer and better than they, and that
every Man ſhould be left to his own
liberty, which is as much as in us
lyeth to make void the Ordinance of
God.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the nature of thoſe things
that come in competition ought to be
conſidered. The Magiſtrate injoyns
ſuch things for decency and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Worſhip of God, as after
mature deliberation conſulting the
Word of God and the precedents of
the moſt pure and primitive times he
hath found to be moſt for edification;
and the things which he injoyneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
he practiſeth himſelf, which he
would not do if he had not found them
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97676:98"/>
to be the beſt. Now if he be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it is but in an indifferent or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable
thing, the obſervance of
which by himſelf or his Subjects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be Men that follow peace
and holineſs, will not prejudice their
Salvation. Now on the Subjects ſide
there lies at ſtake the great duty of
Obedience to Governors, of reverence
and decency in the publick Worſhip
of God, of Charity and Unity with
their Brethren, wherein if they be
peccant, they withhold from <hi>Caeſar</hi>
the things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and from
God the things that are God's, and
from their Brethren the duties which
they owe to all Men, with whom as
far as it is poſſible, and as much as in
them lyeth they ought to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.
And can a little miſtake or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
in external Worſhip, if ſuch
ſhould happen, be thought ſo great an
evil, that for avoiding of it, we ſhould
throw our ſelves over the precipices
of diſobedience to Rulers, a contempt
of God's ſolemn Worſhip, and living
in debate, contention and perpetual
vexation of our Brethren? Thoſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97676:99"/>
things that are immutably and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
good or evil ought more to be
heeded than thoſe which are ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly
and by accident or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
only; and no good Man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
a doubtful ſcruple will run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a certain ſin. In ſuch things
therefore as I have now diſcourſed of,
it is certainly more ſafe to erre with
our Rulers than to be in the right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have diſcarded that
Maxime of our Authors, which he
ſaith not only in Reaſon but in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
too admits of no releaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 228. our Author ſaith—<q>While
Men were truly pious, all Meetings
of Men for mutual help of Piety and
Devotion, whereſoever and by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
celebrated, were permitted
without exception.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is great pity but it had been ſo,
yet that it was ſo will not appear. For
I ſuppoſe our Author doth not mean
by Men truly pious, thoſe that were
Governors; for the more pious they
were, the more care they alway had
of the publick Worſhip, and ſuch as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97676:99"/>
would not joyn in it, gave occaſion
to have their piety queſtioned. For
why, ſaith our Author, ſhould Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to do that ſuſpiciouſly in private
which warrantably may be performed
in publick, <hi>p.</hi> 230. He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be underſtood of pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that met for the Worſhip of God
in times of Corruptions and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as he expreſſeth it. Now that
ſuch Meetings whereſoever and by
whomſoever celebrated were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without exception, whoever ſhall
but run over the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory
will find exceptions enough againſt it.
Were not Chriſt and his Apoſtles and
ſuch Converts as met with them tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pious, and<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 26. 12.</note> yet their Meetings were
in great fear of being diſturbed, and
they were perſecuted as no Friends to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 12. 12.</note> but ſuch as turned the World
upſide down. And did not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
foretel his Diſciples how they
ſhould be hated and perſecuted for his
ſake? Never were there more pious
and peaceable Chriſtians than under
the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> that preceded
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yet they did generally by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97676:100"/>
them, as <hi>Pilate</hi> by the <hi>Galileans</hi> whoſe
bloud he mingled with their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and haled all ſuch to torments as
would not deny Chriſt and burn their
Bibles, and offer Incenſe to the <hi>Pagan</hi>
Gods. <hi>Trajan</hi> was one of the mildeſt
of thoſe Emperors, and <hi>Pliny</hi> the
Younger being required to certifie the
practices and behaviour of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in his days, acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
that they did meet together in
the Night and ſung Hymns to Chriſt
as to their God, which was their only
crime; for as to other things, They
bound themſelves by an Oath not to
run into any wickedneſs, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Thefts, Murders or Adulteries,
not to break their promiſes or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
any thing committed to their

                     </note> many Thouſands of pious
Chriſtians were martyred; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
were ſo far from permitting their
Meetings howſoever and by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
celebrated, that they hunted
out private Chriſtians, and upon their
confeſſions that they were ſo they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97676:100"/>
were inſtantly condemned. If a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Witneſſes will ſuffice, I ſhall
produce that of the Noble <hi>Thebean</hi>
Legion, conſiſting of 6666. Souldiers,
who when <hi>Maximinus</hi> was Emperor
and prepared to fight his Enemies,
though they had often given teſtimony
both of their valour and fidelity to his
Predeceſſors, and had by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed

(which Oaths <hi>Vegetius de Re militari,

required to luſtrate or expiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by offering ſacrifice to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gods; which they refuſing to
do, jointly profeſſing themſelves to be
Chriſtians, he decimates the whole
Legion, and ſlays every Tenth Man
with the Sword, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the ſame impiety from the reſt;
but their chief Commanders who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97676:101"/>
ſerve to be mentioned in all Hiſtories,
<hi>Mauritius</hi> Tribune of the Legion,
<hi>Exuperius</hi> their Standard-bearer, and
<hi>Candidus</hi> one of the Senatorian Order,
exhorting them to conſtancy in the
Chriſtian Faith, being required to
bring their Legion to the Emperor
at <hi>Octodurus,</hi> and there perform
thoſe Pagan rites, anſwered, That
they were ready in all things to
obey the Emperors commands in
fighting againſt his Enemies, only
being Chriſtians they could by no
means Sacrifice to his Gods.
Whereupon they ſuffered another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimation;
at which the remainder of
the Legion were ſo far from being
daunted, that they all profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the ſame reſolution, and
ſhould rejoyce to obtain the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Martyrdom. Whereupon
the Emperor Ordered his Army to
fall on them, and cut them in pieces,
which was accordingly done, not one
of them ſeeking an eſcape. <hi>Baronius
ad Annum</hi> 297. Nor were theſe Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
only committed in the times of
the ten perſecutions, but afterward
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97676:101"/>
when ſome Chriſtian Emperors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Arrianiſm had the power,
they made havock of the peaceable
and Orthodox Chriſtians, and denyed
them the priviledge of publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meetings. And our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 228. That Chriſtian
meetings under Pagan Princes, when
for fear they durſt not come together
in open view, were charged with
foul imputations, as by the report of
Chriſtians themſelves plainly appears.
And again, <hi>p.</hi> 227. That time had
taken leave to fix this name (of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles)
upon good and honeſt
meetings, and that perchance not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
without good reaſon. Which
reaſon he expreſſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 228. it was eſpied
that ill affected perſons abuſed private
meetings for Religion to groſs impiety,
and therefore both Church and State
jointly gave order for Forms, times
and places of publick Concourſe, and
all other meetings beſides thoſe of
which both time and place were limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they cenſured for routs and riots
and unlawful aſſemblies in the State,
and in the Church for Conventicles.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97676:102"/>
Upon which our Author concludes,
<hi>p.</hi> 229. It is not lawful no not for
prayer, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for people to
Aſſemble otherwiſe than by publick
order is allowed.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this conceſſion
our Author having diſtinguiſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
times of corruption and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 230. <q>That in
times of manifeſt corruptions and
perſecutions, wherein Religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
is dangerous, private
meetings, however beſides publick
Order, are not only lawful but they
are of neceſſity and duty.</q> And this
he ſuppoſeth a competent Plea as well
for the Papiſts in our days as for the
Proteſtants in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes:
<q>For elſe (ſaith he) how ſhall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the meetings of Chriſtians for
publick ſervice in time of danger
and perſecutions, and of our ſelves
in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days? and how
will thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
amongſt us put off the imputation of
Conventicling, who are known
amongſt us privately to aſſemble for
Religious exerciſe againſt all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97676:102"/>
order both in Church and
State?</q>—Now I willingly grant
that in times of manifeſt corruptions
and perſecutions, ſuch as the <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Marian</hi> were, private meetings
are lawful and neceſſary duties; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
if men do forbid what God
hath commanded, it is better to obey
God than man: But this rule will not
hold with that Latitude which our
Author annexeth to it, that ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are lawful <hi>however beſides publick
order:</hi> and <hi>p. 231. however practiſed.</hi>
For ſuppoſe that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> or Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> had publiſhed their Edicts that
on ſuch days ſuch a number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
or Proteſtants ſhould meet and
worſhip God in publick places allowed
them for that purpoſe, or as by the
late Act of Parliament, any Family
not admitting above five for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exerciſes were tolerated; it had
been their duty to acquieſce in ſuch
an Indulgence, and not by meeting
in greater numbers and in places and
times prohibited to provoke their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.
For certainly God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Soveraign authority a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97676:103"/>
power of regulating the External ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Divine Worſhip, nor can
the irregularity of good men make
void that Ordinance of God. And
therefore our Author concludes amiſs
when he ſayes, That all pious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in times of perſecution and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
however practiſed, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
or rather alone the lawful congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:
and publick Aſſemblies
though according to form of Law are
indeed nothing elſe but Riots and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
if they be ſtained with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and ſuperſtition. A Doctrine
that is very pleaſing both to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and other Sectaries, who being
perſwaded that we are corrupted and
they are perſecuted, may be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
once again to ſet up the good old
Cauſe, that is, the overthrow of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and Epiſcopacy in this Nation,
and the ſetting up of Popery and Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in their rooms. Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> tells
us in his Sermon on <hi>Luke 18. 1. p.</hi> 134.
of his <hi>Golden Remains,</hi> that <hi>Tully</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that <hi>Antony</hi> the Orator being to
defend a perſon who was accuſed of
Faction and Sedition, bent his wits to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97676:103"/>
maintain that <hi>Sedition</hi> was good, and
not to be objected as a fault: our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath ſtrained his wits to do the
like by Schiſm, and ſo far to excuſe
ſeparation as ordinarily to lay the
blame thereof upon Superiors, and to
make them the Schiſmaticks as often
as they endeavour to vindicate their
authority in lawful things againſt ſuch,
as find any Scruples againſt obedience
to their commands. Which Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
ſhall Anſwer for me: <hi>The taſte of
Liberty is ſo ſweet, that except Kings
maintain their Authority with as great
violence, as the people affect their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
all things will run to confuſion.</hi>

                  <head>TO THE
READER
Concerning the Pretence
OF
Conſcience for Separation.</head>
                  <p>THE Conſcience of Man is a
very ſacred thing; the great
King hath made it his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
to determine of ſuch caſes as are
not plainly determinable by his Law,
and hath given it a large Empire and
Power to abſolve or condemn. Of
this <hi>Seneca</hi> divinely informs his <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
(Epiſt. 41. Ita dico, mi Lucili, ſacer
intra nos ſpiritus ſedet, malorum bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rúmque
noſtrorum obſervator, &amp; cuſtos
hic prout à nobis tractatus est, nos tractat</hi>)
There is a Sacred ſpirit reſiding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us obſerving and recording all our
good and evil actions, and as this is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97676:106"/>
dealt with by us, ſo it deals with us.
If our Conſciences be firſt rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and then duly conſulted with
and obeyed, there is not a ſafer Guide,
a better Comforter, nor a more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judge: for (it is <hi>magni illius Judicii
praejudicium</hi>) as that acquits or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
us, ſo <hi>have we confidence towards
God, 1 Jo.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>It ought therefore to be our great
care that our hearts do not reproach
us for any wilful tranſgreſſion of the
Laws of God, or ſuch as he hath ſet
over us, whom he hath required us to
obey for Conſcience ſake.</p>
                  <p>And in the next place it is our duty
tenderly to commiſerate ſuch weak
Brethren whoſe Conſciences being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
doubtful of the lawfulneſs of thoſe
actions which are required of them,
dare not obey till they obtain a <hi>fiat</hi>
from them; but while they ſuſpend
their duties are peaceable and faithful
in the Land, and humbly and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
ſeek for ſatisfaction from them
whom God hath ſet over them. And
truly I have not more Charity for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thorow Conformiſts, than for ſuch
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97676:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meek and teachable Diſſenters. And
I doubt not but their Rulers and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Fathers would deal with them
in all gentleneſs and long-ſuffering,
with familiar and eaſie methods to
inform their judgments, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
their affections to the knowledge
and practice of the truth. But alas!
how ſmall is the number of ſuch, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that pretend conſcience,
not in things doubtful and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
but againſt plain and expreſs
commands in the Laws of God and
their Superiors, and under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
ſeek to be juſtified in notorious
and ſcandalous impieties? Who can
without indignation recount the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
villanies and miſchiefs that have
been acted in our Generation under
this pretence? or who can ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deplore the contumacy and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch as pretend Conſcience
againſt the means which God hath
appointed for their information? The
caſe ſeems to be well repreſented in
the entertainment of the Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> (for Conſcience
as an Angel of God is with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97676:107"/>
to ſave or to deſtroy) And in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>
19. we read only of <hi>Lot</hi> who with
great humility and reſpect met them,
and bowing his Face to the ground,
with great importunity preſſed them
to take their repoſe with him; and
he waſhed their Feet and feaſted them,
and they delivered him from that great
overthrow. But the Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi>
old and young, from all quarters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
violence to them, and would
have proſtituted them to their unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
luſts. And do not they declare
their ſin to be like that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> who
ſtifle the good motions of this Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-Angel,
and make it an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Pander to their carnal luſts?
inceſſantly abuſing it as the <hi>Gibeathites</hi>
did the <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine, even to
Death, <hi>Judges</hi> 19. And if a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Lot</hi> intercede for it, how do they
reply as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did, <hi>This fellow
is come to ſojourn, and he will needs be a
Judge. Now will we deal worſe, with
thee than with them, Gen.</hi> 19. 9. But
the puniſhment of the one ſhould make
the other to tremble and do no more
ſo wickedly, leſt thoſe Angels of Light
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97676:107"/>
leave them in darkneſs, and rain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

even horror and deſpair into their
Souls.</p>
                  <p>But beſide theſe wilful perſons there
is a ſort of weak people among us,
who have ſo intangled themſelves in
nets of their own weaving, partly
through ignorance, prejudice and
evil education, and partly by melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and ſuperſtitious apprehenſions,
fearing where no fear is, and taking
their own fancies and ſhadows for
Ghoſts and ſpectres, and laſtly by the
dark ſuggeſtions of ſeducing ſpirits
who deſpair of making any to be of
their perſwaſion till they have fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them out of their wits, that it is
with them as ſometime it was with
the people of <hi>Rome (nec ferre vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera
poſſunt, nec remedia</hi>) they can
neither endure their wounds nor ſuffer
the remedies. By their long ſtriving
againſt their Prince, their Prieſts and
their own Reaſon, they are ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and enſnared, that though their
grievances be almoſt intolerable, yet
they dread to diſcloſe them or to uſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97676:108"/>
the advice of ſuch Phyſicians as upon
their ſubmiſſion might through God's
bleſſing heal and reſtore them. Every
Quack that can adminiſter <hi>Opium,</hi> or
ſtupifie the part affected, is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to them than a Colledge of
able Phyſicians who diſcerning the
cauſe could with more eaſie methods
and at a cheaper rate cure their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
For the Nets that entangle moſt
of theſe, are but like the ſpiders webs,
ſtrong enough to captivate them out
of whoſe bowels they were ſpun: But
a man of reaſon may diſſipate them
with the breath of his mouth. The
Lion in the Fable was once thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled,
and all his ſtrugling did but
involve him more: yet when he was
toyled and lay quiet, a very little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
came and corroding the threads
ſet the Royal Captive at liberty. There
needs no great art if they would be
patient and follow regular preſcripts,
to reduce ſuch men to a ſenſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of their Chriſtian Liberty.
If they would but follow the beſt of
their own Leaders, two of which I have
hereafter propoſed to them, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97676:108"/>
and practices might ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
them. For in truth it is not
Conſcience but nice ſcruples, falſe
opinions and prejudice and diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Lawful Guides and Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of their Souls, and a fond admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of ſome cunning perſons that
lay in wait to enſnare them, and keep
them in bondage, that they may make
merchandiſe of them, which have ſo
perplexed them. Can that be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
that cauſeth men to ſtrain at a
Gnat and ſwallow Camels? to ſtart
at a ſhadow and throw themſelves over
Precipices? ſo to abhor a Ceremony
as to commit Sacriledge, and rob the
Church of Chriſt of his laſt and beſt
Legacy, that of Peace? Can Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
perſwade a man who confeſſeth
his own ignorance (by his doubting) to
judge of the things in controverſie, to
conclude that his Superiors are in an
error, and that they who diſobey and
oppoſe them are in the right? or can
we think that they did caſt themſelves
out of their own Cures on a principle
of Conſcience, who againſt all good
Conſcience intruded upon other mens
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97676:109"/>
and ſtill invade their rights? Is
it Conſcience that teacheth them to
interpret the actions and conſtitutions
of their Superiors in the worſe ſenſe,
and by their corrupt gloſſes to make
faults where they can find none? Is
it conſcience that cauſeth men who are
under Oaths and obligations of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and peace, to withdraw cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
into factious and ſeditious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
to the diſturbance of the Church
and State, where they might lead quiet
and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and
honeſty? Is it conſcience that teacheth
men to ſcruple at Ceremonies, and to
omit the weighty matters of the Law?
Or can we think that they do really
believe in their Conſciences that to
live in Conformity to the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is a ſin, who do educate their
children (the care of whoſe Souls
next to that of their own is incumbent
on them,) in ſuch profeſſions as will
neceſſarily engage them to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts?
The Ancient Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
thought themſelves bound in
Conſcience to uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prevent ſeparation from the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97676:109"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to ingage
their people to frequent the publick
Worſhip. And can it be a point of
Conſcience in the preſent Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
ſo induſtriouſly to promote Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and as much as in them lyeth
to bring the publick Worſhip into
contempt? Or can they pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
for deſpiſing the prayers of the
Church, who at the ſame time reject
our Lords prayer alſo? Is it conſcience
that makes private and illiterate men
to think themſelves wiſer and better
than their Rulers and ſpiritual Guides,
whom God hath ſet over them? Is it
conſcience that doth diſpenſe with the
ſame men to conform and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with the Church when they
are required to do ſo under ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and ſevere penalty (as on the late
Teſt) and to ſhun it at other times?
Laſtly, who can believe that they err
through weakneſs or doubtfulneſs of
Conſcience, who refuſe to make uſe
of thoſe obvious and probable means
for their ſatisfaction, which God
hath appointed for them? That is, in
ſuch doubtful caſes which their own
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97676:110"/>
ſon cannot determine, to conſult with
thoſe to whom God hath committed
the conduct of their Souls. For what
is Conſcience but a mans judgment
concerning things and actions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Gods Word, and Right Reaſon
inlightned and directed thereby? For,
ſeeing the Word of God hath not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
determined of all things and
actions, we ought by our Reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
one place of Scripture with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and drawing concluſions from
them, to be guided and acted in ſuch
things as are not determined in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
and if our own Reaſon be too
ſhort-ſighted and dull, to apprehend
the nature of the things doubted of;
we ought to uſe ſuch Inſtruments and
helps as God hath provided, who hath
ſaid by his Prophet, that <hi>the Prieſts
lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and the
people ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth,
for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts,
Mal.</hi> 2. 7. where the peoples duty is
plainly aſſerted. And by his Apoſtle,
that we ſhould <hi>know them that are over
us in the Lord, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. And
<hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97676:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for
they watch for your Souls as they that
muſt give account, &amp;c.</hi> But as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
complains, <hi>p.</hi> 570. of his <hi>Saints
Reſt,</hi> 
                     <q>Few of the Godly themſelves
do underſtand the Authority that
their Teachers have over them from
Chriſt, they know how to value the
Miniſters Gifts but not how they are
bound to learn of him and obey him
becauſe of his office.—People are
bound to obey and learn of their
Teachers, as Scholars of their Maſters.</q>
And if the people were as willing to
do their own duties, and as apt to
learn of their Miniſters as they are
forward to teach them, or blame them
for not doing theirs, they might ſoon
eaſe their Conſciences of much guilt
as well as of many doubts and ſcruples,
whereby for want of an humble and
teachable ſpirit they ſo much trouble
themſelves and others. And it is but
reaſonable, that the eſtabliſhed Clergy
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
as great a ſubmiſſion from their
people as the <hi>Worceſter</hi> Miniſters who
required their people to acknowledge
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97676:111"/>
in theſe words: <hi>I . . . do conſent to be
a Member of the particular Church of
Christ at . . . . whereof . . . . is Teacher
and Overſeer, and to ſubmit to his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and miniſterial guidance and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
according to God's Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Men therefore whoſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are truly tender, ought in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
caſes, to apply themſelves to the
means which God hath inſtituted (and
will therefore moſt probably bleſs) for
their information; as firſt, their own
Paſtor; or if he be thought defective,
ſome neighbour Miniſter, of whom
the doubting Perſon hath a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for his parts and piety; if no
ſuch can remove his doubts, he ſeems
to me to be a Perſon capable to read
the Works of Learned men that have
written of the things in controverſie,
and he may take in the help of Foreign
Divines, and perhaps inquire into the
practice of the Church in the moſt
pure and primitive Ages. And if he
find that they do all agree, as Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay, That the
certain commands of the Church we
live in, are to be obeyed in all things
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97676:111"/>
not certainly unlawful, I cannot think
that ſuch as will ſtill pretend doubts,
and eſpouſe Parties, and diſobey their
Governors, and promote Schiſm and
Diviſions, do erre out of weakneſs of
Conſcience, but out of pride, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs,
through great prejudices or
for ſome little intereſts and concerns of
their own, which they value more
than the Peace of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now that Man doth judge extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncharitably of his Rulers, whoſe
Conſciences are as tender, and their
Judgments better informed than his
own, and who being at liberty to
chooſe and propoſe what may moſt
conduce, as well to their own, as the
Peoples ſalvation, ſhall upon mature
deliberation in ſolemn Aſſemblies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
ſuch a Diſcipline and Rites as
they think moſt agreeable to the Word
of God and the practice of the pureſt
Churches in all Ages; that Man, I
ſay, muſt judge moſt uncharitably of
them who ſhould think that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on him any thing that is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
(without a very clear evidence of
its unlawfulneſs) ſeeing that therein
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97676:112"/>
they ſhould not only wound their own
Conſciences and hazard their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but draw upon themſelves the
guilt of the Peoples ſins, by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
iniquity by a Law, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the People to comply with it by
their examples, and ſo like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>
make the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God to Sin.</p>
                  <p>But if in a deed done by a doubting
Perſon, at the command of one that is
indued with lawful authority, there
be a ſin, it muſt go on his ſcore that
requireth it wrongfully, not on his
that doth but his duty in obeying;
nor is the Salvation of an obedient
ſubject hazarded by a peaceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with his Superiors commands
in ſuch doubtful and diſputable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> reſolves a caſe
that will put this out of doubt, Sermon
on <hi>Rom. 14. 23. p.</hi> 92. <q>A Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
his Subjects to ſerve in his
Wars, it may be the quarrel is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
it may be there may appear to
the underſtanding of the Subject great
likelihoods of ſuch injuſtice, yet may
the ſubject for all that fight in the
quarrel, yea he is bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97676:112"/>
ſo to do, nay he is deep in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
and treaſon if he refuſe the
ſervice, whatſoever pretenſions of
Conſcience he may make for ſuch
refuſal.</q> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks almoſt as
much, <hi>p.</hi> 461. of his Five <hi>Diſputations:</hi>
                     <q>Every War that is unlawfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by the Prince, is not unlawful
in all his Souldiers. Some of them
that have not opportunity to know
the evil of his undertaking, may be
bound to obey; the caſe of others I
determine not.</q> But a greater than
he (as I have ſhewn) hath determined
it, and the practice of the Primitive
Chriſtians, which ſtoutly fought the
Battels of Heathen Emperors, have
confirmed that determination. Now
it is worthy of our conſideration, to
think what manner of Souldiers ſuch
ſcrupulous Perſons would make in caſe
of a War begun againſt a juſt Prince
by ſome of his Subjects, that ſhould
pretend a Reformation of the Laws,
and arm themſelves to redreſs abuſes
in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, can
we think, that they who are apt to
diſobey upon I know not what ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97676:113"/>
of the lawfulneſs of innocent Rites
and Ceremonies injoyned by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
will be ready to fight againſt
their Brethren (that herein agree with
them?) would they not rather ſide
againſt him, (as their Predeceſſors
have done?) I ſuppoſe there are very
few that are ſcrupulouſly factious in
the Church, but would in ſuch a caſe
be ſeditious and rebellious in the State.
I am ſure they would find more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
pretences, as, That the Prince
commands ſuch things as are to their
Conſciences unlawful, and that they
durſt not ingage with him, leſt they
draw innocent bloud upon their heads;
they think they are rather bound to
help the Lord's People againſt the
Mighty, to rebuke even Kings for
their ſakes, and if they ſee it meet;
to bind their Kings with Chains and
their Nobles with fetters of Iron, and
to execute upon them the Judgment
written: This Honour have all his
Saints. And yet that learned Caſuiſt
ſays, that the fears of ſuch ſcrupulous
Perſons need not trouble them, no not
in this grand caſe, leſt they ſhould
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97676:113"/>
bring upon themſelves the guilt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud; for the bloud that is
unrighteouſly ſhed in ſuch a quarrel,
he muſt anſwer for, that ſet them on
work, not he that ſpilt it. <hi>Is damnum
dat, qui jubet dare; ejus verò nulla cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa
est, cui parére neceſſe est:</hi> He doth
the wrong that commands it to be
done, not he whoſe obedience is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
duty. <q>And truly (ſays the
ſame Caſuiſt) it is a great wonder to
me, that any Man endued with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and that is able in any
meaſure to weigh the force of thoſe
precepts and reaſons which bind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors
to yield obedience to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
ſhould be otherwiſe minded
<hi>in caſes of like nature.</hi> For whatſoever
is commanded us by thoſe whom God
hath ſet over us either in Church,
Common-wealth or Family (<hi>quod ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
non ſit certum diſplicere Deo,</hi> as
ſaith St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) which is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contrary to the Law and Will
of God, ought of us to be received
and obeyed no otherwiſe than as if
God himſelf had commanded it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God himſelf hath commanded
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97676:114"/>
us to obey the higher Powers, and to
ſubmit our ſelves to their Ordinances.</q>
And if theſe things ſhould not be ſo,
either Government or Chriſtianity
would in a ſhort time be rooted out
as incompetent one with the other, for
by ſuch Men Chriſt is really repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as an enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
will be, to have him crucified
again in his members, and put to
open ſhame.</p>

ARGUMENTS.</head>
                  <p>THe ſame wiſe and Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Almighty God which
over-ruled the Actions of thoſe Armies
that had kept us long in confuſion and
made them inſtrumental for the ſetling
of peace in the State, hath ſo directed
the conſultations and publick tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of ſuch as intruded on the
affairs of the Church, that if they
would practiſe according to their own
principles, and acquieſce in their own
arguments, we might ſee peace and
unity eſtabliſhed alſo in the Church.
For beſides the Arguments of the Non-conformiſts
before 1642. who both
by example and publick writings
ſhewed their abhorrence of open Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97676:115"/>
I do confidently affirm, that
if there were a collection made of thoſe
reaſons which were urged by the
Presbyterians to prevent the other
Factions from ſeparating from them,
as well in their Annotations, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
publick debates, Sermons, books
of Schiſm, Separation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there
needed no other ſecurity to the people
of this Nation, that they might with
good Conſcience conform to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip of God as it is now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
I have formerly publiſhed
Mr. <hi>Calvin's</hi> arguments to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and now I preſent the Reader
with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, not only becauſe
I thought them moſt rational and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive,
but becauſe I believe he was
not acted by (a <hi>ſtudium partium</hi>) any
ambitious or private deſign, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them as an <hi>Irenicum</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
peace and reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all ſober diſſenters. And I hope
he will pardon me for proſecuting his
own deſign, while I do it in his own
words publiſhed in ſeveral Treatiſes
ſince he firſt ſet forth his <hi>Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Reſt,</hi> in the Epiſtle to which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97676:115"/>
he tells us he <hi>ſhould fear of being a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
in Hell, if he ſhould be a firebrand
in the Church.</hi> I was much moved to
ſee what <hi>odium</hi> he contracted from ſome
of his Brethren, of whom he deſerved
better things, for endeavouring to heal
our diviſions; yet was he not aſhamed
to write himſelf in the title page of
his ſecond admonition to <hi>Bagſhaw, a
long-maligned and reſiſted endeavourer of
the Churches unity and peace;</hi> and in
<hi>pag.</hi> 11. of that book, he thus declares
his Chriſtian temper and reſolution.
<hi>If injuries or intereſt would excuſe any
ſin, I think there are few Miniſters in</hi>
England <hi>who have more inducement to
the Angry ſeparating way than I have;
But ſhall I therefore wrong the truth and
Church of God and my own and others
Souls? God forbid!</hi> And page 52. he
farther tells us—<hi>I repent that I no more
diſcouraged the ſpirit of peeviſh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with Superiors and Church-orders,
and (though I ever diſliked and oppoſed
it, yet) that I ſometimes did too much
incourage ſuch as were of their temper,
by ſpeaking too ſharply againſt thoſe things
which I thought to be Church corruptions,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97676:116"/>
and was too loth to diſpleaſe the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
for fear of being uncapable to do
them good, (knowing the prophane to be
much worſe than they) and meeting with
too few religious perſons, that were not too
much pleaſed with ſuch invectives.</hi> And
as an Argument of his repentance, he
defends himſelf againſt <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> who
objected that he choſe on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day to
communicate in a very populous
Church purpoſely that it might be
known, ſaying, <hi>p. 76. If a man by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years forbearing all publick prayers
and Sacrament ſhould tempt others to
think that he is againſt them or counts
them needleſs, how ſhould he cure that
ſcandal but by doing that openly pleading
for it, which he is ſuppoſed to be againſt?
Miniſters being bound to teach the people
by Example as well as Doctrine, p.</hi> 78.
And what he practiſed himſelf he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
perſwaded the people, to avoid
ſeparation and hold communion in the
parochial Churches. For the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he maintained againſt <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi>
was—<q>It is lawful to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with ſuch Chriſtian Churches
as have worthy or tolerable Paſtors,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97676:116"/>
notwithſtanding the Parochial order
of them, and the Miniſters confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and uſe of the Common Prayer-book:</q>
and with two limitations
concludes, <hi>p.</hi> 89. <q>That we ought to
do ſo when ſome ſpecial reaſons (as
from Authority, ſcandal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it.</q> And whereas by theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and writings, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had ſo
provoked the diſſenting parties, that
it was objected, as himſelf intimates
in a ſecond objection, in the Preface
of his <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> That his
writings differing from the common
judgment had already cauſed offence
to the Godly; in the fourth Anſwer,
he ſayes: <q>If God bleſs me with oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and help, I will offend ſuch
men much more, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further than ever I have done
the quenching of that fire which
they are ſtill blowing up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
the folly and miſchief of thoſe
Logomachies by which they militate
againſt Love and Concord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and tear the Church of God,
and let them know that I am about
it.</q>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:97676:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe are reſolutions becoming a
Miniſter of Chriſt, an Ambaſſador
of the Prince of Peace, taken up after
long and ſerious deliberation, well
rooted and fixed in his judgment and
Conſcience, by reaſon whereof he was
enabled through the Grace of God to
withſtand manifold temptations and
violent oppoſitions to the contrary.
Nor can I think that ſuch a man as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can flee and deſert ſo good
a cauſe, and after Vows to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
and render himſelf guilty of
all thoſe calumnies and reproaches
which his enemies have endeavoured
to fix upon him: Nor can I think, that
having brought our preſent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
to ſo narrow a compaſs of ground,
he will contribute to the building of
a <hi>Babel</hi> upon it. This were to make
good thoſe hard ſpeeches of Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi>
againſt him, who tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 152.
That one worthy of Credit told him
that the Learned and Judicious
Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> having read that cryed up
book of his, ſaid, It had been happy for
the Church of God if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
friends had never ſent him to School;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97676:117"/>
and that Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> had the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it. And that another perſon
as knowing in the Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as either of them told a friend of
his, that notwithſtanding the noiſe
about him, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would end in
fleſh and bloud. And in a word, this
would ſet home his own fears upon
his ſpirit, that he might be a fire brand
in hell for being a fire-brand in the
Church.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore charitably believe,
that though he ſeem to look another
way, yet he is labouring to bring the
people that adhere to him, to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Eccleſiaſtical peace and unity;
that he doth ſtill preach up not holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
only, but peace too, without
which he knows no man ſhall ſee
God; nor can I think that he doth
now practiſe in contempt of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
what himſelf had condemned in
others; or that he intends to harden
the people in ſuch a Separation, as he
had ſo long, ſo paſſionately, ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
declaimed againſt. I rather hope
that he hath ſome diſpenſation from
his Lawful Superiors, and that by a

                     <hi>pia fraus</hi> having greater advantages of
doing good put into his hands, he will
by degrees improve them to the glory
of God and the peace of this diſtracted
Church.</p>
                  <p>If he drive any other deſign, I
would deſire him to conſider, firſt,
how he can Anſwer his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto men; and ſecondly, how
to give an account to God for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practices.</p>
                  <p>But I have a very great confidence,
that he who hath with great induſtry
and faithfulneſs provided ſo many ſolid
materials from the Scriptures and right
reaſon for the ſupporting and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a Temple of peace, having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and guilded them over with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Proteſtations of his own pacifick
intentions, and variety of Rhetorick to
perſwade others, will not be a Leader
of that rabble, which ſhall firſt break
down the carved works with axes
and hammers, and at laſt (though
ſore againſt his will) raze the very
foundations, and cry Down with it,
down with it even to the ground.</p>

Lawful things, page 483. of his
five Diſputations.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. LEST Men that are apt to run
from one extream into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhould make an ill uſe of that
which I have before written, I ſhall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97676:120"/>
here annex ſome Reaſons to perſwade
Men to juſt obedience, and preſerve
them from any ſinful nonconformity to
the commands of their Governours,
and the evil effects that are like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thereupon.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. But firſt I will lay together
ſome Propoſitions for deciſion of the
Controverſie; How far we are bound
to obey Mens Precepts about Religion?
Eſpecially in caſe we doubt of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of obeying them? and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey them in faith?</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Briefly: 1. We muſt obey
both Magiſtrates and Paſtors in all
things lawful which belong to their
offices to command. 2. It belongs not
to their office to make God a new
worſhip; But to command the Mode
and Circumſtances of worſhip belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to their office: for guiding them
wherein God hath given them general
rules. 3. We muſt not take the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
commands of our Governours to be
unlawful. 4. If we do through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or perverſneſs take Lawful things
to be unlawful, that will not excuſe
us in our diſobedience. Our error is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97676:120"/>
our ſin, and one ſin will not excuſe
another ſin. Even as on the other ſide,
if we judge things unlawful to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that will not excuſe us for our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to God in obeying men.
5. As I have before ſhewed, many
things that are miſcommanded, muſt
be obeyed. 6. As an erroneous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not excuſe us from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our Governours, ſo much leſs
will a <hi>doubtfulneſs</hi> excuſe us. 7. As
ſuch a doubting, erring judgment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey in (plenary) faith, ſo much
leſs can he diſobey in faith. For it is
a known Command of God, that <hi>we
obey them that have the Rule over us:</hi>
but they have no word of God againſt
the act of obedience now in queſtion.
It is their own erring judgment that
intangleth them in a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(till it be changed.) 7. In doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
caſes, it is our duty to uſe God's
means for our information: and one
means is to conſult with our Teachers,
and hear their words with teachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and meekneſs. 8. If upon advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with them we remain in doubt
about the lawfulneſs of ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97676:121"/>
of order, if it be ſuch as may
be diſpenſed with, they ſhould diſpenſe
with us: if it may not be diſpenſed
with without a greater injury to the
Church or cauſe of God, than our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
will countervail, then is it
our duty to obey our Teachers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch doubts: For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their office to Teach us, it muſt be
our duty to believe them with a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
faith, in caſes where we have
no Evidences to the contrary:<note place="margin">☞</note> And the
Duty of Obeying them being certain,
and the ſinfulneſs of the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
being uncertain &amp; unknown,
and only ſuſpected, we muſt go on the
ſurer ſide. 9. Yet muſt we in great
and doubtful caſes, not take up with
the ſuſpected judgment of a ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
but apply our ſelves to the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Paſtors of other Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
10.<note place="margin">☞</note> Chriſtians ſhould not be over-buſie
in prying into the work of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
nor too forward to ſuſpect
their determinations: But when they
know that it is their Rulers work to
guide them by determining of due
Circumſtances of worſhip, they ſhould
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97676:121"/>
without cauſleſs ſcruples readily obey,
till they ſee juſt reaſon to ſtop them in
their obedience; They muſt not go
out of their own places to ſearch into
the Actions of another Man's office,
to trouble themſelves without any
cauſe.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. And now I intreat all humble
Chriſtians readily to obey both Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Paſtors in all lawful things;
and to conſider, to that end, of theſe
Reaſons following. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. If you
will not obey in Lawful things, you
deny authority, or overthrow Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it ſelf, which is a great ordinance
of God, eſtabliſhed in the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
with promiſe: And as that
commandment reſpecting ſocieties and
common good, is greater than the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
commands, as they reſpect the
private good of our neighbours, or are
but particular means to that Publick
good, whoſe foundation is laid in the
fifth commandment; ſo accordingly
the ſin againſt this fifth commandment
muſt be greater than that againſt the
reſt.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. In diſobeying the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97676:122"/>
commands of our Superiors, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
Chriſt, who ruleth by them as
his officers. Even as the diſobeying a
Juſtice of Peace or Judge is a diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſoveraign Power; yea in
ſome caſes when their ſentence is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.
Some of the ancient Doctors
thought that the fifth commandment
was the laſt of the firſt Table of the
Decalogue; and that the Honouring
of Governors is part of our Honour to
God, they being mentioned there as his
officers, with whom he himſelf is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
or diſhonoured, obeyed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed:
For it is God's Authority that
the Magiſtrate, Parent, and Paſtor is
endued with, and empowred by to rule
thoſe that are put under them.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. What confuſion will
be brought into the Church if Paſtors
be not obeyed in things lawful? For
inſtance: If the Paſtors appoint the
Congregation to Aſſemble at one hour,
and the People will ſcruple the time,
and ſay, it is unlawful, and ſo will
chooſe ſome of them one time, and
ſome another, what diſorder will here
be? and worſe, if the Paſtors appoint
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97676:122"/>
a Place of worſhip, and any of the
People ſcruple obeying them, and will
come to another place, what confuſion
will here be? People are many, and
the Paſtors are few: and therefore
there may be ſome unity if the People
be Ruled by the Paſtors; but there can
be none, if the Paſtors muſt be ruled by
the People, for the People will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
among themſelves: and therefore
if we obey one part of them, we muſt
diſobey and diſpleaſe the reſt. And
their ignorance makes them unfit to
rule.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Moreover, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in matters of <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> will
exclude and overthrow the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of
the worſhip it ſelf. God commandeth
us to pray: If one part of the Church
will not joyn with a ſtinted form of
Prayer, and the other part will not joyn
without it, both Parties cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and ſo one part muſt caſt off Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it ſelf, or ſeparate from the reſt. God
commandeth the reading, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hearing of the Scripture, and
the ſinging of Pſalms: but he hath left
it to Man to make or chooſe the beſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97676:123"/>
Tranſlation of Scripture, or verſion of
the Pſalms. Now if the Paſtor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
one verſion and Tranſlation, and
the Church joyn in the uſe of it, if any
members will ſcruple joyning in this
Tranſlation or verſion, they muſt needs
forbear the whole duty of Hearing the
Scripture, and ſinging Pſalms in that
Congregation. If they pretend a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
againſt the appointed time or place
of worſhip, they will thereby caſt off
the worſhip it ſelf. For if they avoid
our <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> they cannot meet
with us, nor worſhip with us.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. And when they are
thus carried to ſeparate from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
upon ſuch grounds as theſe,
they will be no where fixt, but may be
ſtill ſubdividing, and ſeparating from
one another, till they are reſolved into
individuals, and have left no ſuch thing
as a Church among them. For they can
have no aſſurance or probability, that
ſome of themſelves will not diſſent
from the reſt in one Circumſtance or
other, as they did from their Paſtors
and the Church that they were of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97676:123"/>
§. 9. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. By this means the
wicked that are diſobedient to their
Teachers, and reject the worſhip of
God it ſelf, will be hardened in their
ſin, and taught by Profeſſors to defend
their ungodlineſs: For the very ſame
courſe that you take will ſerve their
turns. They need not deny any Duty
in the ſubſtance, but deny the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and ſo put off the ſubſtance of
the Duty. If a wicked man will not
hear the word preached, he may ſay
<hi>[I am not againſt preaching; but I am
unſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of your Time
or Place, I am in judgment againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your Steeple-houſe, or againſt the
Lords Day.]</hi> And ſo he ſhall never hear,
though he ſay he is for hearing. If a
wicked man will not be perſonally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
or admoniſhed, or be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Church or Paſtors for any
ſcandals of his life, nor ſubmit to any
diſcipline, he may ſay <hi>[I am for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
I know it is my duty to be inſtructed:
but I am not ſatisfied that I am bound to
come to you when you ſend for me, or to
appear at ſuch a place as you appoint: the
word of God nameth no time or place, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97676:124"/>
you ſhall not deprive me of my liberty.]</hi>
If a wicked Man would not hear or
read the Scripture, or ſing Pſalms, he
may ſay that he is for the duty, but
he is only againſt this and that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
and verſion: And ſo while eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
verſion is excepted againſt, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is as much evaded as if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it ſelf. By this device it is that
the Rebellion of unruly People is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended:
They run to the <hi>circumſtances</hi>
of the duty, and ask, [Where are
they bound to come to a Miniſter? or
to be examined by him in order to a
baptiſm or Lords ſupper? or to ſpeak
their conſent to be Church-members,
or to ſubſcribe to a Profeſſion, or to
read an Engliſh Bible, or to hear in
a Steeple-houſe, with many ſuch
like.] Thus alſo it is that they put
off Family-prayer, and ask, <hi>[Where
are they bound to pray in their Family
Morning and Evening?]</hi> and ſo keep
no conſtancy in Family-prayer at
all, under pretence of denying only
the circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>§. 10. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. By this diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in things lawful, the members
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97676:124"/>
of the Church will be involved in
contentions, and ſo ingaged in bitter
uncharitableneſs, and cenſures, and
perſecutions, and reproaches of one
another: which ſcandalous courſes
will nouriſh vice, diſhonour God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
the enemies, grieve the Godly
that are peaceable and judicious, and
wound the conſciences of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
We ſee the beginning of ſuch
fires are ſmall, but whither they tend,
and what will be the end of them, we
ſee not.</p>
                  <p>§. 11. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. By theſe means alſo
Magiſtrates will be provoked to take
men of tender conſciences for factious,
unruly, and unreaſonable men, and
to turn their enemies, and uſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
againſt them, to the great injury
of the Church: when they ſee them
ſo ſelf-conceited, and refuſing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in lawful circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>§. 12. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. By this means alſo
the converſion and eſtabliſhment of
ſouls will be much hindred, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
poſſeſſed with prejudice againſt the
Church and ordinances, when they
take us to be but humorous people,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97676:125"/>
and ſee us in ſuch contentions among
our ſelves. To my knowledge, our
late difference about ſome ſuch leſſer
things, hath turned off, or hindered
abundance of people from liking the
holy doctrine and life which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
                  <p>§. 13. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. It will ſeem to the
wiſeſt, to ſavour of no ſmall meaſure
of <hi>Pride,</hi> when people on the account
of lawful circumſtances, dare ſet
themſelves againſt their Governors
and Teachers, and quarrel with the
Ordinances of God, and with the
Churches: Humble men would ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſuſpect themſelves, and quarrel
with their own diſtempers, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to thoſe that are wiſer than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and that are ſet over them for
their guidance by the Lord. There
may more dangerous <hi>Pride</hi> be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in theſe matters, than in Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and ſuch lower trifles.</p>

be free from all men, yet have I made my

that are under the Law, as under the Law,
that I might gain them that are under the
Law: To them that are without Law,
as without Law (being not without Law
to God, but under the Law to Chriſt)
that I might gain them that are without
Law. To the weak I became as weak,
that I might gain the weak: I am made

paſſages of Scripture require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion

nature, and ſhew that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God doth not conſiſt in them.</p>
                  <p>§. 17. And <hi>Matthew 12. 1, 2, to</hi> 9.
you find that hunger juſtified the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt for plucking and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the ears of Corn on the Sabbath
dayes. And hunger juſtified <hi>David</hi>
and thoſe that were with him, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the houſe of God, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſhew-bread, which was not
lawful for him to eat, nor for them
which were with him, but only for
the Prieſts: And the Prieſts in the
Temple were blameleſs for prophaning
the Sabbath day.] Now if things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accidentally evil, may by this
much Neceſſity become lawful and a
duty, then may the commands of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
or Paſtors, and the Unity of
the Church, and the avoiding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,

be alſo ſufficient to warrant us in

of believers. Not only in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Chriſt immediately, but alſo
to him in his officers, 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 22.
[Behold to obey is better than Sacrifice,</hi>
&amp;c.] Col. 3. 20, 22. <hi>[Children obey
your Parents in all things</hi> (that is, all
lawful things) <hi>for this is well-pleaſing
to the Lord] [Servants Obey in all
things your Maſters according to the fleſh,
&amp;c.]</hi> And Obedience to Paſtors is as
much commanded, 1. <hi>Theſ. 5. 12, 13.
[We beſeech you brethren to know them
which labour among you, and are over you
in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and
eſteem them very highly,</hi> &amp;c.] Heb. 13.
17. <hi>[Obey them that have the rule
over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for
they watch for your ſouls as they that
muſt give account,</hi> &amp;c.] So <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. &amp;
24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>§. 19. As the General Commiſſion
to a Parent, or Maſter, or Magiſtrate
to Govern their inferior relations, doth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97676:127"/>
authorize them to many particular acts
belonging to their office, that were
never named in their commiſſion: ſo
your general command to obey them,
obligeth you to obey them in the ſaid
particulars. And ſo it is alſo betwixt
the Paſtors and the flock, in matters
belonging to the office of a Paſtor.</p>
                  <p>§. 20. If a Child ſhall ask a Parent,
<hi>[Where doth Gods word allow you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me to learn this Catechiſm, or read
this Divines writings, or repeat this
Sermon, or write it?</hi> &amp;c.] doth not the
queſtion deſerve to be anſwered with
the rod? The General Commiſſion for
Parents to Govern their children is
ſufficient. So if a Schoolmaſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Scholars to come to ſuch a
place to School, and to take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in ſuch an Order, and to learn ſuch
books, and do ſuch exerciſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
General Commiſſion that he hath to
teach and Govern them, will allow
him to do all this. (Though it will
not allow him to ſet his Scholars to
any Artifice or Manual Operation
alien to his profeſſion.) So if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
determine of the variable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97676:127"/>
of worſhip, as what place
the people ſhall come to, and at what
time, to be Catechized, examined,
inſtructed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Tranſlation
or Verſion of Pſalms to uſe, what
Utenſils to make uſe of about Gods
ſervice, or ſuch like, he is warranted
for this by his <hi>General</hi> Commiſſion.
And if he miſs it in the manner, by
chooſing inconvenient circumſtances,
or by unneceſſary determination of
points that ſhould rather be left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to liberty, though this be his
own ſin, it will not excuſe the people
from obedience; unleſs the error of
his directions be ſo great as would
fruſtrate the Ordinance it ſelf, or do
more harm than our diſobedience
would do; which in Circumſtantials
is rarely found.</p>
                  <p>By long experience I am aſſured,<note place="margin">Freface to Chriſtian Direct. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
                     </note>
that practical religion, will afford both
to Church, State, and Conſcience
more certain, and more ſolid peace,
than contending diſputers, with all
their pretences of Orthodoxneſs, and
zeal againſt errors, for the truth, will
ever bring, or did ever attain to.

                     </note> but in
the unchriſtian and Church-diſſolving

followeth; contrary to that humility
and love, which is the viſible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Chriſtians, and to that One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is ſtill in Scripture aſcribed
to the viſible Church. Alas, that
pride and ignorance ſhould have ſuch
power among believers, that men
cannot be of ſeveral judgments in leſſer
points, but they muſt needs be of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches. God will make us
value peace and union a little more,
before we ſhall taſte of the perfect
everlaſting peace and union; yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhall ſee the bleſſing of union
in the Church. Wounding is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding,
healing is a re-uniting; a
Building is of many ſtones or pieces
orderly conjoyned; a Church is an
aggregation of individuals, an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97676:128"/>
of Believers: what then is it
to demoliſh, but to ſeparate and disjoyn?
and what is it to diſſolve Churches,
but to break their aſſociation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to individuals, to cut them
into ſhreds?</p>
                  <p>As for the differences in way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
between the moderate
<hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Epiſcopal,</hi>
and <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> I make no doubt, but
if mens ſpirits ſtood not at a greater
diſtance than their principles, they
would quickly be united. But of all
the four ſorts there are ſome that run
ſo high in their principles, that they
run out of the hearing of peace or
truth.—For <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> and <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm</hi>
God ſpake effectually againſt
them, by thoſe wondrous Monſters
in <hi>New-England;</hi> but wonders are
over-lookt, where the heart is hardned,
and God intends to get his juſtice a
name. The fearful doluſions, that
God hath formerly given them over
to, and the horrid confuſion which
they have introduced where they have
ſprung, hath ſpoken fully againſt both
theſe later Sects. The weeping eyes,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97676:129"/>
the bleeding ſides, the lacerated mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of theſe Churches, the reproach
of the Goſpel, the diſappointed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

the reproached, ſlandered, and
ejected Miniſters, the weak that are
ſcandalized, the Profeſſors apoſtatized,
the wicked hardned, and the open
enemies of the Goſpel, that now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult;
all theſe do deſcribe them more
plainly to <hi>England,</hi> than words can
do, and cry loud in the ears of God,
and man. What will be the Anſwer,
time will ſhew: but from <hi>Rev. 2. 14,
15, 16, &amp;c.</hi> we may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
                  <p>He that is not a Son of peace, is
not a Son of God. All other ſins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Church conſequentially, but
diviſion and Separation demoliſh it
directly. Building the Church is but
an orderly joyning of the materials, and
what then is disjoyning but pulling
down? Many doctrial differences
muſt be tolerated in a Church, and
why, but for unity and peace? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97676:129"/>
diſunion and ſeparation is utterly
intolerable. Believe not thoſe to be
the Churches friends, that would
cure and reform her by cutting her
throat. Thoſe that ſay, no truth muſt

your very hearts, if I ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Do not your hearts bleed to
look upon the State of <hi>England,</hi> and
to think how few Towns, or Cities
there be (where is any forwardneſs in
Religion) that are not cut into ſhreds
and crumbled as to duſt, by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and diviſions? to think what a
wound we have hereby given to the
very Chriſtian name, how we have
hardned the ignorant, confirmed the
Papiſts, and are our ſelves become the

of our friends, and how many of our

though an Angel from Heaven ſhould

practices in the Church, keep
your ſelves innocent, with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

would have him received, that is
weak in the faith, and not un-church
whole pariſhes of thoſe that we know

ſhould prove a fire-brand in hell, for

for all the intereſt I have in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and affections, I here charge you,
that if God ſhould give me up, to any
factious, Church-rending courſe,
(againſt which I daily pray) that
you forſake me, and follow me not a
ſtep. And for peace with one another,
follow it with all your might, <hi>if it be

(mark this.) When you feel any ſparks
of diſcontent in your breaſts, take them
as kindled by the Devil, from hell, and
take heed you cheriſh them not. If
the flames begin to break forth,
in cenſoriouſneſs, reproaches, and hard
ſpeeches of others, be as ſpeedy and
buſie in quenching it, as if it were
fire in the thatch of your houſes. For
why ſhould your houſes be dearer to

Hath God ſpoke more againſt any ſin

ſchiſms, contempt of Magiſtracy, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,

dead Carrion to breed worms and
vermine. Believe it from one, that
hath too many years experience of it;
it is as hard a thing to maintain even
in your people, a ſound underſtanding,
a tender Conſcience, a lively, gracious,

as to keep your Candle lighted

and fierce diſputings about the
circumſtantials of diſcipline, or other
queſtions, that are far from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
they oftner loſe the truth
than find it. Wo to thoſe Miniſters,
that make unneceſſary diviſions, and
parties among the people, that ſo they
may get themſelves a name, and be
cryed up by many followers. The
way to proſper your labours is to
quench all flames of contention, to
your power. Study the peace and
unity of your Congregations, keep
out all occaſions of diviſions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the doctrine of Separation, and
popular Church-Government, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Seminary of faction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
contentions. If once the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

the banks in their rage; and now
where is that peaceable aſſociation of

that children being baptized have all

they have all things neceſſary

which is but what the Ancients were

but they never meant, that the infidel

becauſe he was baptized, but that all

Not, that all the baptized, but that
all the baptized ſeed of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are pardoned, juſtifyed, adopted,

Amen?<note place="margin">P. 856.</note> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The people bear an
equal part in ſinging the Pſalms, which
are prayer, and praiſe, and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
if they may do ſo in the Pſalms
in metre, there can be no reaſon
given, but they may lawfully do ſo
in Pſalms in Proſe; for ſaying them,
and ſinging them, are but modes of
utterance, and the Ancient ſinging
was liker our Saying, than our tunes.
The Primitive Chriſtians were ſo full
of zeal, and love to Chriſt, that they
would have taken it for an injury, and
a quenching of the Spirit, to have
been wholly reſtrained from bearing
their part in the praiſes of the Church.
The uſe of the tongue keepeth awake
the mind, and ſtirreth up God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in his ſervants. It was the decay
of zeal in the people, that firſt ſhut
out the Reſponſes: while they kept
up the ancient zeal, they were inclined
to take their part vocally in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97676:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this was ſeconded by the
pride and uſurpation of the Prieſts
thereupon; who thought the people
of God too prophane to ſpeak in the
Aſſemblies, and meddle ſo much with
holy things. Yet the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of former zeal cauſed moſt
Churches to retain many of the words
of their predeceſſors, even when they
loſt the life and ſpirit which ſhould
animate them; and ſo the ſame words
came into the Liturgies, and were uſed
by too many, cuſtomarily, and in
formality, which their Anceſtors had
uſed in the fervour of their Souls. And
if it were not, that a dead-hearted,
formal people, by ſpeaking the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
careleſly and hypocritically, do
bring them into diſgrace with many,
that ſee the neceſſity of ſeriouſneſs,
I think, few good people would be
againſt them now.—It is here the
duty of every Chriſtian, to labour to
reſtore the life and ſpirit to the words,
that they may again be uſed in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and holy manner, as heretofore.

the Honor of the Church, and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and of God, and more to our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and edification, to have God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
performed ſolemnly, publickly, and
in great Aſſemblies, than in a corner,
ſecretly and with few. 2. It is a great
mercy, where Rulers allow the Church
ſuch publick Worſhip. 3. <hi>Caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
all Chriſtians ſhould prefer ſuch
publick Worſhip before private, and no
private Meetings ſhould be kept up,
which are oppoſite, or prejudicial to
ſuch publick Meetings. And therefore,
if ſuch Meetings, (or any that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary,
to the ends of the Miniſtry,
the ſervice of God, and good of Souls)
be forbidden by lawful Rulers, they
muſt be forborn. And it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that Rulers, that are Infidels,
Papiſts, Hereticks, or Perſecutors, that
reſtrain Church meetings, to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of mens Souls, muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97676:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from pious Princes, that only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
Hereticks, and real Schiſmaticks,
for the Churches good. 2. And that
times of hereſie and ſchiſm may make
private meetings more dangerous, than
quiet times. And ſo even the <hi>Scottiſh</hi>
Church forbad private meetings, in the
Separatiſts days of late. And when
they do more hurt than good, and are

That it is not unlawful to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

2. Nor yet, for any evil in
this particular form, for in this part
the Common-prayer is generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
3. Nor yet, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
for a command maketh not that
unlawful to us, which is lawful before,
but it maketh many things lawful, and
duties, that elſe would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
accidentally. 4. And the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Commanders we have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to do with. And for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
they muſt be weighed on both
ſides, and the conſequents of our refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
will not be found light. In general,
I muſt here tell the People of God, in
the bitter ſorrow of my Soul, that at
laſt it is time for them to diſcern that
temptation, that hath in all ages of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97676:147"/>
Church almoſt, made this Sacrament
of our union, to be the grand occaſion
or inſtrument of our diviſions. And
that, true humility, and acquaintance
with our ſelves, and love to Chriſt, and
one another, would ſhew ſome men
that it was but their pride and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and ignorance, that made them
think ſo heinouſly of other mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of worſhip. And that, on all ſides,
among true Chriſtians, the manner of
their worſhip is not ſo odious, as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and faction, and partiality repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
it. And that God accepteth
that, which they reject. And they
ſhould ſee, how the Devil hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the common People, by this
means, by teaching them every one
to expect ſalvation for being of that
Party which he taketh to be the right
Church, and for worſhipping in that
manner which he, and his Party, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
beſt. And ſo wonderful a thing is
prejudice, that every Party, by this, is
brought to think that ridiculous and
vile, which the other party accounteth
beſt.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſtian Direct.</hi> p. 48.</note> But to magnifie any one Church
or Party, ſo as to deny due love and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97676:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
communion to the reſt, is Schiſm. To
limit all the Church to your party, and
deny all, or any of the reſt, to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and parts of the Univerſal
Church, is Schiſm, by a dangerous
breach of Charity. It is Schiſm alſo,
to condemn unjuſtly any particular
Church, as no Church. And it is
Schiſm, to withdraw your bodily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from a Church that you were
bound to hold communion with, upon
a falſe ſuppoſition that it is no Church,
or is not lawfully to be communicated
with. And it is Schiſm, to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
or Parties in a Church, though
you divide not from that Church.
The holineſs of the Party that men
adhere to,<note place="margin">p. 49.</note> is made a pretence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Schiſm; but this muſt make but
a gradual difference in our eſteem and
love to ſome Chriſtians above others.
If really they are moſt holy, I muſt
love them moſt, and labour to be as
holy as they: But I muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
unjuſtly deny communion, or
due reſpect to other Chriſtians, that
are leſs holy, nor cleave to them as a
Sect, or divided Party, whom I eſteem
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97676:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moſt holy. For the holieſt are moſt
Charitable, and moſt againſt the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
among Chriſtians, and tendereſt
of their unity and peace. Own
the beſt, as beſt, but none, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Sect; eſpouſe not their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
intereſt; confine not your eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
love to a party, but extend it to
all the members of Chriſt. Deny not
local communion when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for it, to any Church, that hath
the Subſtance of true worſhip, and

is, 1. That a ſtinted Liturgy is

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97676:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where it is not neceſſary, it may not

if the form of words be not from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
This is thus proved: 1. That
which is not directly, or conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
forbidden by God, remaineth
lawful. A ſtinted Liturgy is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
or conſequentially forbidden
of God: Therefore it remaineth law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The major is undoubted, becauſe
nothing but a prohibition can make a
thing unlawful; where there is no
Law, there is no tranſgreſſion. Yet I
have heard very reverend men anſwer
this, That it is enough that it is not
commanded, though not forbidden,
which is plainly to deny both Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and Civil principles. Now for
the Minor, That a ſtinted Liturgy is
not forbidden, we need no other proof,
than that no prohibition can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.<note place="margin">p. 36<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

away all our Chriſtian liberty, and
make all things unlawful to us, by
commanding them. You would take
it for a wild conceit in your children
or ſervants, if they ſay, when you
bid them learn a Catechiſm, or uſe a
form of prayer, It was lawful for us
to do it till you commanded us, but
becauſe you bid us do it, it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
If it be a duty to obey Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
in all lawful things, then it is
not a ſin to obey them. 3. It is not
your knowing before hand, that makes
it unlawful: for 1. I know in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
before-hand, that all imperfect
men will do imperfectly: and though
I know not the particular, that maketh
it never the lawfuller, if foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it ſelf did make it unlawful.
2. If you know that (<hi>e.g.</hi>) an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian,
or ſome miſtaken Preacher,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97676:151"/>
would conſtantly drop ſome words for
his error, in praying or preaching,
that will not make it unlawful in
your own judgment, for you to joyn
(if it be not a flat hereſie.) 3. It is
another mans error or fault that you
foreknow, and not your own. 4. God
himſelf doth as an univerſal cauſe of
nature concur with men in thoſe acts
which he foreknoweth they will ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do, yet is not the Author or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover
of the ſin.</p>
                  <p>We (the Commiſſioners 1663.) all
thought a Liturgy lawful,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 38.</note> and divers
learned and reverend Nonconformiſts
of <hi>London</hi> met to conſider how far it
was their duty or lawful to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Pariſh Churches, where
they lived, in the Liturgy and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I proved four propoſitions:
1. That it is lawful to uſe a form;
2. That it is lawful to joyn with ſome
Pariſh Churches in the uſe of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
3. That it is lawful to joyn
with ſome Pariſh Churches in the
Lords Supper; 4. That it is to ſome a
duty to joyn with ſome Pariſh
Churches three times a year in the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97676:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lords Supper: and none of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſeemed to diſſent, but took the
reaſons to be valid.</p>
                  <p>Were I in <hi>Armenia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 176.</note> 
                     <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> or
among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I would joyn in a
much more defective form than our
Liturgy, rather than none. And this
is the judgment of many <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Miniſters, conform to the old
Non-conformiſts, who did ſome of
them read the Common-Prayer, and
the moſt of them judged it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to joyn in it, or elſe Mr. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Rich. Rogers, &amp;c.</hi> would

am not able to bear the thoughts of

all, or the far greateſt part, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe forms of Liturgy which now
are moſt diſtaſted,<note place="margin">Cure of Diviſions, <hi>p</hi> 200.</note> were brought in
by the moſt zealous religious people
at the firſt: the many ſhort invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

the people uſe, were brought in when
the Souls of the faithful did abound
with zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in holy fervors break
out in ſuch expreſſions, and could not
well endure to be bare Auditors &amp; not
vocally to bear their part in the praiſes
of God and prayers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewed at large,<note place="margin">p. 174.</note> How far
God hath given men power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and impoſe forms for others,
and commanded others to obey them:
when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>When ye pray, ſay,
Our Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 179.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he bound the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in duty to do as he bid them:
How forms may be impoſed publickly
on the congregations of Believers,<note place="margin">p. 185.</note>
and on the Miniſters, yea though the
forms impoſed be worſe than the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their own gifts, (though among
us no man be forbidden to uſe his own
gifts in the Pulpit.) The Phariſees
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97676:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
long Liturgy (it is like) was in many
things worſe than ours; yet Chriſt
and his Apoſtles often joyned with
them, and never condemned them.
I ſhall now only add that the Lord's
prayer is a form directed to God as in
the third perſon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Five Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi> p. 363.</note> and not to man only
as a directory for prayer in the Second
Perſon: it is not, <hi>Pray to God your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in heaven that his name may be
Hallowed, his Kingdom come, &amp;c.</hi> But,
<hi>Our Father which art in heaven, hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
be thy name, &amp;c.</hi> And it ſeems by
the diſciples words that thus <hi>John</hi>
taught his diſciples to pray, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1.
and we have in the Scripture the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many Set forms of Service to
God, which therefore we may well
uſe. And I deſire the Reader again
to Note, that though Prayer was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Phariſees, yet Chriſt
uſually joyned in their Synagogues,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17. and never medled with
our controverſie about the lawfulneſs
of Set forms. [This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> infers

touching the introduction of ruling

as have power to preach as well as
rule. On this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reflects, <hi>p.</hi>

yielded to the ſtating of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<hi>durante vitâ,</hi> if he prove not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
which was one point that I
propounded to him; and I make no
doubt, but he would have yielded to
a voluntary conſent of Presbyters, <hi>de

                     <p>As for your Queſtion about Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I am very near you in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Opinion. The point was never
ſtated nor debated in the <hi>Iſle of Wight;</hi>
I did for my part decline the diſpute,
for I could not maintain the cauſe as
on the Parliament ſide; And becauſe,
both I and others were unwilling, it
was never brought to open debate.
The Commiſſioners did argue it with
the King, but they went upon grounds
of Law and Polity, and it was only
about Biſhops Lands; for they then
averred the continuance of Dean and
Chapter Lands to the uſe of the
Church. Some deny that there is
any ſin of Sacriledge under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and if there be any, they agree
not in the definition. Some hold an
Alienation of Church-goods, in caſe of
Neceſſity, and then make the neceſſity,
what, and as extenſive, as they pleaſe.
The moſt are of Opinion, that while
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97676:157"/>
the Church lyes ſo unprovided for, the
donations are not alienable, <hi>ſine Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio.</hi>
If there were a Surpluſage above
the competent maintenance, it were
another matter. It is clear enough,
the Donors wills are fruſtrated, and
that their general intention, and the
general uſe (<hi>viz.</hi> the maintenance of
God's Worſhip, and Miniſters) ſhould
ſtand, though the particular uſe might
be ſuperſtitious. I cited in my laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
before the Parliament a place out
of Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sacriledge. It did not pleaſe. If

                     <note place="margin">Anſw. to Exceptions <hi>p.</hi> 170.</note> an Aſſiſtant to Mr. <hi>Ralph
Smith</hi> Paſtor at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where,
having vented divers ſingular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he was diſmiſſed, went to <hi>Salem,</hi>
which place in a years time he filled
with principles of rigid Separation,
tending to Anabaptiſtry, as, That it
is not lawful for an unregenerate man
to pray, or take an Oath, in ſpecial
not the Oath of fidelity to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.
He forbad any of his Church-members
to hear the godly Miniſters
of <hi>England</hi> when occaſionally they
went thither. He taught that the
Magiſtrate had nothing to do in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the firſt Table; that there
ſhould be an unlimited toleration of
all Religions; that to puniſh any man
for his Conſcience was Perſecution. He
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97676:160"/>
ſeparated not only from the Churches
of <hi>Old,</hi> but of <hi>New-England</hi> alſo, as
Antichriſtian. After that, he would
not pray, or give thanks with his own
wife or family, becauſe they went to
the Church-aſſemblies. He kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meetings by way of ſeparation
from, and oppoſition to the Church-aſſembly;
and being baniſhed as a
diſturber of the peace, he ſate down
at a place called <hi>Providence,</hi> and there
fell to Anabaptiſtry, renouncing Infant
baptiſm. And after a while he told
his people, that he was out of the
way himſelf, and had miſled them, for
he could not find that any on earth had
power to adminiſter baptiſm, and
therefore their laſt baptiſm was a
nullity as well as the firſt, and that
they muſt wait for the coming of
new Apoſtles; and ſo they diſſolved
and turned Seekers.</p>
                  <p>The caſe of the <hi>Summer Iſlands</hi> as

have the hearty thanks and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Papiſts.<note place="margin">p. 52.</note> Nor am I cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
afraid, that if we ſuffer the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

Popery will get by it ſo
great advantage as may hazard us all,
and we may loſe that which the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parties do contend about.</p>
                  <p>Three ways eſpecially Popery will
grow out of our diviſions, 1. By the
odium and ſcorn of our diſagreements,
inconſiſtency, and multiplied Sects,
they will perſwade people, that we
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97676:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
muſt either come for unity to them,
or elſe all run mad, and crumble
into duſt and individuals. Thouſands
have been drawn to Popery, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in it, by this argument alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And I am perſwaded, that all
the Arguments elſe in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and
all other books that ever were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
have not done ſo much to make
Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> as the multitude
of Sects among our ſelves. Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Religious ſtrictneſs and great
eſteem for Godlineſs, having run from
Sect to Sect, and finding no conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
turned Papiſts themſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. Who knows not how fair a game
the Papiſts have to play by our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
Methinks I hear them hiſſing
on both parties, ſaying to one ſide,
Lay more upon them, and abate them
nothing: And to the other, Stand it
out, and yield to nothing: hoping
that our diviſions will carry us to ſuch
practices, as ſhall make us accounted
ſeditious, rebellious, and dangerous
to publick peace, and ſo they may
paſs for better ſubjects than we, or
elſe, that they may get a toleration
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97676:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
together with us. And ſhall they uſe
our hands to do their work? We have
already ſerved them unſpeakably, both
in this, and in abating the odium of
the Gunpowder plot, and other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>3. It is not the leaſt of our danger, leſt
by our follies, extremities and rigors
we ſo exaſperate the common people,
as to make them readier to joyn with
the Papiſts, than with us, in caſe of
competitions, invaſions or inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

peace.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts account, that if the
Puritans get the day,<note place="margin">Key for Cathol.</note> they ſhall make
great advantage of it; for they will
be unſetled, and all in pieces, and not
know how to ſettle the government.
Factions and diſtractions (ſay they)
give us footing for continual attempts.
To make all ſure, we will ſecretly
have our party among Puritans alſo,
that we may be ſure to maintain our
intereſt.</p>

                  <p>But I have obſerved that Profeſſors

in all matters of God's worſhip, faith

For firſt, it contradicteth the expreſs
revelation of the will of God in the
Holy Scripture. <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
had to do in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 423. of his 5. <hi>Diſputations,</hi> he
lays down this as the ſumm of what
he had ſaid, That Man may determine
of modes and circumſtances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
neceſſary and commanded <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>
but not determined by God <hi>in
ſpecie, Sect.</hi> 65. and then infers, <hi>Sect.</hi>
67. If the miſchooſing of ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
by Church-governors be but
an inconvenience, and do not deſtroy
the Ordinance it ſelf, or fruſtrate the
ends of it, we are to obey. 1. For he
is the Judge in his own work, and not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97676:170"/>
we. 2. The thing is not ſinful though
inconvenient. 3. Obedience is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to our lawful Governors. <hi>Sect.</hi>
70. And when we do obey in a caſe
of miſcommanding, it is not a doing
evil that good may come of it, as ſome
do miſconceive; but it is only a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to that which is ill-command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not evil in him that doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
It is the determiner that is the
cauſe of the inconvenience, and not the
obeyer. Nor is it inconvenient for
me to obey, though it be worſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to him that commandeth: while
he ſinneth in commanding, he may
make it my duty to obey, <hi>p. 461. Sect.</hi>
6. The reaſons of this are obvious
and clear, even becauſe it is the office
of the Governors to determine of ſuch
circumſtances: It is the Paſtor's office
to guide and over-ſee the Flock, and
when he determineth theſe, he is but
in his own way, and doth but his own
work; and therefore he is therein the
Judge, if the caſe be controvertible.
If none ſhall obey a Magiſtrate or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
in the works of their own office,
as long as they think he did them not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97676:171"/>
the beſt way, all Governours then
would be preſently overthrown, and
obedience denyed. We are ſure that
God hath commanded us to <hi>obey them
that are ever us in the Lord, 1 Theſſ.
5. 12. Hebr. 13. 7. 17, &amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a certain duty may not be forborn
on uncertain conjectures, or upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
miſcarriage of them that we owe it
to. This would un-church all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
(as they are Political Societies:)
for if Paſtors be taken down, and the
work of Paſtors, the Church is taken
down. S. 7. And the things in which
the Paſtor is now ſuppoſed to err, are
not of themſelves unlawful, but only
by ſuch an accident as being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed
by another accident ſhall ceaſe
to make them unlawful. For inſtance,
<hi>p. 461. Sect.</hi> 4. If of two Tranſlations
of Scripture or two Verſions of the
Pſalms the Paſtor uſe the worſer, (ſo
it be tolerable) we muſt obey. And
<hi>Sect.</hi> 7. If the Paſtor appoint a more
imperfect Verſion of the Pſalms to be
ſung in the Church (as is commonly
uſed in <hi>England</hi>) the obeying of him
in the uſe of this will not bring ſo
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97676:171"/>
much hurt to the Church, as the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
on that account would do. For
beſides the ſin of diſobedience it ſelf,
the Church would be in a confuſion
if they forſake his conduct that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the union; and ſome will be
for this and ſome for that, and ſo the
Worſhip it ſelf will be overthrown.
And let it ſtill be remembred, that we
allow both Magiſtrates and Paſtors to
ſee to the execution of God's Laws,
and to determine of circumſtances in
order thereto that are neceſſary <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>

Conſciences which will be ſhortly
awakened; and to the great Shepherd
of the flock who is at the door, and
who told even the Devils Agents that
a houſe or kingdom divided cannot
ſtand, <hi>&amp;c. p. 253. H. C.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The Magiſtrate will quickly find
that the diſtractions of the Church
will quickly breed and feed ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
in the Common-wealth, as
may make them wiſh they had quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the fire while it was yet quencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Our unity is not only our ſtrength
but their ſtrength, and the fire that
begun in the Church, may, if let
alone, reach the Court. <hi>Of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Now from theſe premiſes I ſuppoſe
the concluſions following may be truly
inferred, a Conformity to which
would be a great means to deſtroy
Nonconformity to the Church and
publick Worſhip, both in Miniſters
and people.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe that are ſilenced by a juſt
power (or rather have ſilenced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and uncharitably deſerted the
eſtabliſhed Worſhip of God) ought
not to gather congregations in place
and manner diſtinct from the publick
Worſhip. By the firſt propoſition.</p>
                  <p>2. Communion with our Pariſh
Churches being lawful, and the peoples
duty by the ſecond propoſition, They
who by ſuch dividing practices as tend
to undermine and deprave the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and diſſolve the very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Parochial Worſhip, and to
encourage and harden known Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
in their ſeparation, (for if
the like ſhould be generally practiſed
through the nation, it would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſcandalize the eſtabliſhed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
alienate the affections of their
people, and renew diviſions among
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97676:175"/>
them) do act very irregularly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully.</p>
                  <p>3. Such practices do unfix the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and cauſe them to run into diviſions
and ſubdiviſions, reproaches and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of one another, propoſition
3. And who knows into what confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſuch practices may carry us?</p>
                  <p>4. Miniſterial conformity being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to by many of the Aſſembly of
Divines, and no ſinful act required to
make it unlawful (which if there
had been, they or ſome others would
and ought to have diſcovered it, and
then I doubt not it would by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have been taken away, but that
being not done) the Miniſters ought
to conform by the ſame rules as the
people ought, which is granted by
propoſition 4. and confirmed by Mr.
<hi>Baxters</hi> practice in receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Paſtors as inſtead
of concurring to heal the flock of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
principles, do rather joyn with
backbiters and incourage them in their
miſreports and ſlanders, becauſe it
tends to the ſuppoſed intereſt of their
party or themſelves, cannot Anſwer
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97676:176"/>
it to their Conſcience nor to the great
Shepherd of the flock. Propoſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>5. If ſuch Miniſter or people do
continue the diſtractions of the
Church, it is the Magiſtrates duty
and intereſt ſpeedily to quench the
fire which they are kindling, or if
may ruine both Church and State.
By Propoſ. 6.</p>
                  <p>And let Miniſters ſee that no Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
creep in among the people, or it
they do, be diligent to countermine
them and preſerve their people from
the inſection of hereſies and ſchiſms.
<hi>Saints Reſt. p.</hi> 543.</p>
                  <p>6. Let ſuch men conſider, whether
any ſober, rational or good men, that
have loved and followed them,
can heartily reſpect them, or make
them their ſpiritual Guides, when it
appears that they do ordinarily and
conſiderately act and practiſe contrary
to their own irrefragable arguments,
proteſtations and perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, if ſuch Miniſters cannot
fully conform themſelves (which
would be an acceptable ſervice to God
and the Church, (they having oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:97676:176"/>
and advantages to add
many thouſands to the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and to confirm others that are
wavering through their examples)
yet that they would conform in what
they may, and continue to teach by
example as well as precept what may
help to repair our breaches, leſt we be
expoſed again to a common ruine and
confuſion.</p>
                  <p>And now methinks that Summons
which troubled <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi>
ſhould alway run in the minds of ſuch
men: <hi>Quintili Vare, redde Legiones:</hi>
you that have intruded upon the cure
of Souls committed to others, reſtore
thoſe Legions which are withdrawn
from Chriſt's fold, and remember,
