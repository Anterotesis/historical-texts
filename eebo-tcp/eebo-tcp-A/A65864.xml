            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not for Disputation or Contention sake that we thus appear in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, but singly for the Truth's sake, and the Information of the Honest-Hearted, who are enquiring after God's Way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himself to the Soul: And that they may not be stumbled by those Groundless, Blind and Confused Assaults that some ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and scornful Minds do make against God's Immediate Way of Illuminating, Inspiring and Teaching his People, who obey and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the World, even in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Way in some degree, which we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in Opposition to meer man's Teaching, and to that dark and unlearned State, wherein People have been kept ever learning under Humane Traditions and Un-sent Teachers; for this we are mis-represented to the World, as opposing God's Teaching by Instruments, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41160:3"/>
true Ministers, which is a gross Perversion; for though we have often cal'd <hi>people</hi> to <hi>cease</hi> from man &amp; mans teaching (who speaks Divinations of his own Brain, and not from the Mouth of the Lord) that they might wait upon God to be taught; yet not to cease from or reject Christ's Ministers, or his speaking by them; but have owned Christ's Teaching both immediately &amp; instrumentally, as he pleaseth, by his Light and Testimony, in order to bring man to God, who is Light, and the All-sufficient Teacher: it being written in the Prophets, That they shall be ALL TAUGHT OF GOD, which is his very Way and Method of drawing men to his Son. <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But our Opposer of <hi>Embusiasm</hi> (as he stiles our owning Immediate Illumination or Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without man's Teaching) he confines Immediate Revelation from Christ to the first Promulgators of the Gospel, and saith, <hi>God's ordinary Way and Method of trans-mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Knowledge and Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>downwards to others successively was by such mens teaching it to others, as had themselves learned it of the Apostles, or others that taught the same Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41160:3"/>
               <hi>Papists:</hi> But this his Method of transmitting the Knowledge of the Faith successively in Opposition to immediate Illumination and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, we can no more allow of as any real Proof of this man's Ministers being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called and authorized to preach (nor yet that he and his Fraternity have this way recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Knowledge of true Faith, which stands in the immediate Power of God) then we can own the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Successor.</hi> Surely the Virtues and Fruits of God's Spirit, which are necessary to the true Ministry, are not successively derived to them by outward Tradition: Besides, the successive transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Apostles Doctrine to Posterities, doth no more prove the Priests Ministers of the Gospel (as he calls them) then it proves the <hi>Quakers</hi> or any others <note place="margin">p. 123.</note> (who have the same Doctrine) such Ministers.</p>
            <p>Its true, that <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and others, who had Gifts in them for the Ministry, were approved by <hi>Paul</hi> and others of the primitive Elders for the VVork; <note place="margin">pa. 24.</note> but this is no Proof that this Opposer's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are either so gifted or approved.</p>
            <p>But if we run them backward to prove their Race and Call successively, its most likely to stop and center in the Pope, if they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41160:4"/>
in denying an immediate Mission or Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from God as their VVarrant.</p>
            <p>VVhilst this Anti-Enthusiast construeth Christ's enlightening every man that cometh into the World, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 9. to be <hi>only with natural Light, a created Light,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 15, &amp; 41, 24, 33.</note> unto which he opposeth Gospel-Light and the Faith of Jesus Christ, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with himself, in granting, that by <hi>this Light</hi> (which he also calleth <hi>the Faculty of Reason &amp; Understanding) man may know that there is a God, and that he is to be worshipped, and that it may possibly be a Light sufficient to direct the</hi> Heathen <hi>to as much as God expects from them;</hi> As also, that <hi>most of the Precepts of the Gospel are desirable in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pa. 79.</note> 
               <hi>themselves,</hi> viz. <hi>to love and worship God; to Repent of that which hath been ill done; to be Sober, Chaste and Temperate; to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as we would be done to our selves, in Point of Equity, Fidelity and Charity; to be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Meek, Patient and Contented, and the like, &amp;c. and these with theer certain Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a future happy State. And that there is no man that acts according to the best Reason of his Mind, but would chuse</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 80.</note> 
               <hi>these things, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe, Serious Reader, here, that this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41160:4"/>
universal Light of Christ in man, which he calls <hi>Reason,</hi> directs men to chuse those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Gospel, which tend to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happy State; and why then he should deem this Light (wherewith Christ enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth all men) but <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>created?</hi> we see neither Reason nor Scripture-Proof from him, that there should be two such inward Lights, as a <hi>Gospel-Light</hi> peculiar only to some, and a <hi>Created Light,</hi> common to all, that directs man to chuse those Preceprs of the Gospel which tend to a future Happiness (no more then he shews for two kinds of inward Darkness) This Distinction appears both Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural and Contradictory; and the most gross Contradiction, to render this Universal Light as not sufficient to direct men to believe in the Son of God, when it <note place="margin">p. 42.</note> shews those weighty Precepts of the Gospel, which tend to a future happy State.</p>
            <p>Again, Our Antagonist, as if he were set upon it, to divert peoples Minds from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light of Christ, and from attending thereto for God's immediate Teaching, he perverts the Scripture, where on 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. he saith, <hi>That the Mind of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, before and under the old</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 76.</note> 
               <hi>Covenant, was but obscurely made known by dark
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41160:5"/>
Prophecies, which are therefore said to be a Light shining in a dark Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is, as if in the Dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and New Covenant the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Believers back to those dark Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under the Old, to take heed thereunto, as unto a Light shining in a dark Place; or as to read his words after this man's sense thus, viz. <hi>We have also more sure Dark Prophecies under the Old Covenant, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed</hi> (And what then is not so sure as they?) Whereas it was that living Word or Light of Christ in them, whereunto they did well to take heed, as unto a Light shining in a dark place, until the Day dawned, and the Day Star arose in their Hearts: This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light, though for a time it shineth as in a dark place in man, yet it leads them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and follow it to the Day of Christ, who is called the <hi>Bright and Morning-Star,</hi> and who is the only Way and Rule to all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light.</p>
            <p>But this Writer, as but a meer Literal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and Traditional Out-side <hi>Christian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes against those that (he saith) <hi>have vented high Speculations, and almost or</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 98.</note> 
               <hi>altogether unintelligible Notions, and new-coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phraises &amp; Expressions concerning the Work
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41160:5"/>
of God in the Soul, and of Union with Christ, and Communion with God, of living by Faith, and walking in the Spirit, and that these have been accounted Evangelical Preachers:</hi> And tells us, <hi>That this Way obtained a great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among a great many of</hi> Christian <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and that many Persons have been tempted hereby, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the serious Readers may take a View of the man's Ignorance and Scorn, thus to sleight and contemn those Serious and Serip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Expressions, of the Work of God in the Soul, Union with Christ, Communion with God, living by Faith, and walking in the Spirit; such Phrases as these he counts unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and new-coyned: You may easily perceive what little Understanding he hath in the Mysteries of God, and how much void of the true and spiritual Speculation concerning the Dispensation of the New Covenant, and Spiritual Condition of true <hi>Christians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Again, This Opposer concludes, <hi>That if we do not make the Doctrine of Christ in the Scriptures the adequate Rule of the Motions and Inclinations of our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 110.</note> 
               <hi>Minds, and Actions of our Lives, whereby to know when they are of God, and when not;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41160:6"/>
we have then no certain Rule to go by, but are continually liable to most Horrible Mistakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here how he hath shut out all Divine Light, Spirit, and God's immediate Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both from being in us, and from being any certain Rule (though we do not oppose what the Spirit teacheth, to Christ's Doctrine; for the Spirit teacheth the same immediately) Yet what is it but to promote <hi>Atheism,</hi> to exclude God, and Christ, and Spirit, and Light within, as no certain Rule, and to exalt the Scriptures above them all, and to give the Scriptures that high Epithete which no where they give themselves, as, <hi>Adequate Rule of Inward Motions and Inclinations;</hi> Whereas the inward Light of Christ, which makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest all things that are reproved, is therefore the most suitable Rule to try inward Motions; for unto this Light he that doth Truth cometh, that his Deeds may be manifest that they are wrought in God; and it is the same Light that reproveth the Evil Deeds of those that hate it, see <hi>John</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21. It is not two kinds of inward Lights, one Natural, and another Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The kind of Language which this Writer treats us withal and applyes to us, is such cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious, harsh and scornful Stuff as follows,

            <p>We have Information of his Name, and what an uncertain Temporizer he hath been in his latter years about Religion; but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that in former times he has had a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in him, &amp; believing that he hath sought after Good Things and more Spiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters formerly then now, we forbear publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name at present (seeing he was not willing to it himself) desiring that he may secretly consider these things, and this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Answer; and that the Lord may give him Understanding, to acknowledge his Truth:

For, God knows, we would not have him dye under the Guilt of his Apostacy, and Iniquity he hath brought upon him by his Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and Fruitless Opposition against God's Truth and People.</p>
            <p>The Substance of the following Answer was written soon after his Book came out, but the Accomplishment and Publication was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by other Matters of more Weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing.</p>
            <p>I desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that makes for us, and against our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser (on the behalf of God's immediate—Mission, Inspiration and Teaching) out of the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> namely, <hi>J.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41160:8"/>

                  </note> of God; And who is he that can worthily Resist against the Holy Ghost? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore is led by the Spirit of God, albeit his Bishop doth say him Nay, let him go free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the Law is not appointed for the Just Man: Where the Spirit of God is, there is Liberty; and if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.</q> From whence he infers thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Behold, here it is affirmed, that the sending by God through Inspiration is not bound under the Bondage of the Law; for that Law is more worthy then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Law: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Law is made for Transgressors and Offenders, and not for the Just: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That whosoever is led by the Spirit of God, although his Bishop stand against him, he may proceed unto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life. Whereby it is evident, that a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con or Priest disposed to preach, and being led by the Spirit of God, may freely preach the Gospel of Christ, without the Spiritual Licence of his Bishop: it is evident for so much as it is good that a Deacon or Priest do live well, and preach fruitfully, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Idleness unto the Labour &amp; Office of Preaching, and so unto a better Life.</q>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41160:8"/>
See here how plainly these things make for us, and against our Opposer, and his Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying the Immediateness of Christ's saving Illumination, &amp; the sending the Spirit to guide all <hi>Christians</hi> by its immediate Motions, wherein his Opposition <note place="margin">P. 47, 61.</note> tends to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and to reject the Saving Knowledge of God and Christ; for that which may be known of God is manifest in man: And the true and living Knowledge of him is by the Revelation of his Son, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of whose immediate Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is beyond all Outward Teaching, Words or Expressions.</p>
            <p>Again, It manifestly tends to <hi>Atheism</hi> to conclude, that no Divine or Saving Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is immediately conveyed to man's Soul by his Maker but only by such mediums, as the Scriptures or Man's Teaching; for then what is Man? and in what Capacity is his Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he either know the Scriptures, or have man's Teaching? or if there be nothing of a Divine Nature, Life or Light in men imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, who have not those Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, how are their Souls Immortal, and capable of Future Rewards? And what better then a Beast doth it render man (as to a future Condition) to suppose he hath no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life and Illumination from his Maker,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41160:9"/>
but only that all must be infused into him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally, through his natural Organs or Sense? And how should he receive a Gospel-Ministry or Advantage by it, if he have no Gospel-Light in him, before conveyed to his Soul immediately by his Maker himself?</p>
            <p>To conclude this <hi>Introduction,</hi> let these Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions be seriously considered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> to Deny the True God, who is Light, is <hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Deny his Immediate <hi>Light</hi> in Man, is to deny the <note place="margin">John 1. 4. 9.</note> True God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To oppose that which gives the Knowledge of God, and his Glory in the Face of his Son (and therefore to be without his Knowledge) is <hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to oppose God's Immediate Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or In shining Light in man, is to Oppose that which would give him the Knowledge of God, and so to <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> be void of his Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To Deny the Immortality of the Soul is <hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to deny the Immediateness of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life [which is Light] in the Soul, by which it immortally subsists, is to Deny the Soul's Immortality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41160:9"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And to go about to stop the Mouth of God from teaching his People Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, is the very Way to introduce and set up <hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because of this <hi>Anti-Enthusiast,</hi> his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Immediateness of Divine Light, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and Illumination of God's Omni pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and his immediate Life in the Soul (without which the Soul cannot Immortally subsist, either in a State of Happiness, or as to its own Being) I therefore conclude him, and all who are of his Opinion, to be therein guilty of <hi>Atheism;</hi> which I desire the Lord to give him and them a Sence of unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Acknowledgment of the True and Living God, and Jesus Christ, and his Light within unto Salvation.</p>

               <p>As for <hi>E.

And <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s saying, that our Belief concerning the Scriptures, is that inward Testimony, that we have received from the holy Light within us, to the Truth of those Sayings; wherefore the Scriptures are so far from being the great Rule of Faith and Practice, that the Light of Christ within is both our Warrant and Rule for Faith in and Obedience to them.</p>
               <p>And is this either contrary to God's Method, or quite different from his Way, as this Man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41160:11"/>
grounds his Objections, let the spiritually minded judge, how he hath opposed the very <hi>Tenour</hi> of the New Covenant, and God's Promise therein; namely, his Spirit put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inward Parts, which should guide into all Truth: And this Opposer himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>That</hi> Christians <hi>are said to be one Spirit with Christ; and by this Spirit and Temper, when given us, we know that we dwell in him, &amp; he in us; and if any Man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ in some Measure, he is none of his,</hi> p. 119. This is the Man that undertakes to overthrow <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and doth not own God's Immediate Enlightning &amp; Teaching in these Dayes; but counts it contrary to his Way and Method; but now it is by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we know that we dwell in him, and he in us; and he that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his: See how the Man hath broke the Neck of his own Cause; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if God dwell in us, and we in him; and his Spirit be our Rule to know this, he must not be limited to Silence, or to a being mute from immediately teaching those who are confessed to be made one Spirit with him: And what gross Ignorance is it to limit God's Teaching or Saving Illumination to a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or Instrumental Way of Man's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as this Man doth, in his denying an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41160:12"/>

And what is this but to limit the Holy One, &amp; set him and his People at a Distance, when they are his Tabernacle, and he dwells and walks in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That God, Christ, the holy Spirit, do by Immediate Illumination of our Minds, and without external Teaching by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or by Men, shew us, or reveal to us, what we ought to do; and that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are taught of God, and need not any other Teacher, <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he excepts against, as <hi>quite different from God's Method and VVay;</hi> wherein he hath opposed plain Scripture Testimony; <hi>They shall all be taught of God; they shall not teach every Man his Neighbour, &amp;c. But the Anointing which ye have received abideth in you; and ye need no Man to teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth you of all things, &amp;c.</hi> We do therefore assert the Sufficiency of this Divine Illumination or Heavenly Unction, as being of it self able to shew and reveal to us what we ought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41160:12"/>
to believe and do in all things; for that it was sufficient, both to make true Prophets and Preachers, and to inable the Holy Men of God to give forth what they spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: And without the Inspiration of the Almighty men cannot truly understand the Scriptures; yet we do not confine the Holy One only to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching, or an Immediate Way; though the Sufficiency thereof to them that are turned to it, we do assert; yet by this Divine Inspiration or Immediate Teaching God hath been and is pleased to call out In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to testifie and preach forth what their Eyes have seen, and Ears heard, and Hands handled of the Word of Life, even the same VVord of Life which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and this only is the effectual and powerful Preaching, which flows from the VVord of Life or divine Unction within, and not that which comes only by Tradition, Reading and Hear-say, without the Spirit's Guidance. And therefore while we own the holy Scriptures, and outward Teaching, as proceeding from divine Illumination and the immediate Unction within, and as a Proof of the Sufficiency thereof, the Man wrongs us, in his endeavouring to begeta Suspicion of us, as if we had <hi>an aking Tooth</hi> against
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41160:13"/>
outward Teaching, of <hi>as if the VVork and Office of the Gospel-Ministry it self were the Eye-Sore to us;</hi> as also <hi>with dissembling the Matter, heaping Contradictions, with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation and Shuffling,</hi> p. 83, &amp; 92, &amp; 94. And why so? but <hi>because we teach Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, give forth Books, &amp;c.</hi> VVhile yet it is our Judgment, <hi>That Men may be sufficiently taught of God himself by his Light and Spirit within, now under the New Covenant,</hi> p. 93. But how proves he this either a Dissembling or Contradiction, when we do not pretend to preach, teach or write without God's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Aid, wherein we proclaim the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency thereof, exciting Men to turn from Darkness to the Light, and from Satan's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God; for Power, Life, Spirit, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Teaching immediately, as he hath taught us; which is no more Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then was in the Prophets, Christ or Apostles, who preached and proclaimed the same thing, as that all God's People and Children should be taught of him; and the Anointing which they had received from the Holy One should teach them so, that they should need no Man to teach them, but as the same Anointing taught them of all things (a plain Proof of its Sufficiency)</p>

His supposing, that we direct Men to <hi>a Natural Light in them,</hi> p. 15. is not true, but contrary to his own Citation before of our VVords, <hi>That God's pure Spirit, and the Light of Christ within us, as both our VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He grants that Jesus Christ himself revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Gospel to his Apostles; and after his Ascension, he, by sending them the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, immediately inspired them with the clear Knowledge and Understanding of it: But for us to assert Immediate Inspiration, and the sole Sufficiency thereof, he deems now <hi>a changing of Gods Method,</hi> which he confines to <hi>Man's Teaching and the Scriptures;</hi> and yet in plain Contradiction to himself, he is made to confess, <hi>That the Scriptures attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it</hi> (viz. the saving Work of Grace) <hi>to God, to Christ, to the Holy Spirit,</hi> p. 18. And further saith, <hi>Indeed the VVork of Grace in Men is most properly attributed to God, to Christ, because he is the principal Cause of it, and all other but subordinate; yet the Effect is some times attributed to subordinate and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes also, though less properly,</hi> p. 19. So that we, in attributing the saving VVork of Grace in men to God, to Christ, we take
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41160:14"/>
the most proper VVay and Method; how then is this contrary to God's Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod? And our referring Men to his inward Light, to be immediately taught by him, doth both shew our owning his making Use of Instruments and outward Teaching, in order thereto, and as subordinate; as also, that they shall be sufficiently taught of God, when they are come unto him to depend upon his Teaching, as his Instruments are in their Ministry: And this man hath confessed <hi>a Concurrence of the Operation of his Grace and good Spirit, together with the rational Evidence of the Truth of the Gospel, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Men,</hi> p. 15. And is not this Grace and good Spirit Immediate, when it operates in the Hearts? &amp; though God is pleas'd to make Use of Instruments for the Help and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the weak, it follows not, that either there shall be alwayes need of such a mediate Way of Help, or that he will not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately teach and operate in these Dayes; for that were still to limit him and his People to a Distance one from another; whereas it is confessed, <hi>That the VVork of Grace in M<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

of the Gospel, as communicated to Men's Minds by the Scriptures, or by Men's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Doctrine which is contained in the Scriptures.</hi> And this in Opposition to our Way (as he calls it) of God's own <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Working, <hi>p.</hi> 16. where observe: <hi>First,</hi> He limits the Spirit's inward Work, either to the Scriptures or mens Teaching, which excludes all that have not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or mens Teaching, from the saving Work or Change in them; and confines all God's People, as Children under Tutors and Governours, that they may be alwayes lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and then when shall they know the Truth? And of whom do their Teachers learn, and receive the Understanding of the Scriptures? <hi>2dly,</hi> To his saying, <hi>That the Doctrine contain'd in them is the Rule of Faith and Practice:</hi> He should rather have said, A RULE subordinate to the great Rule of Faith and Practice, to wit, that divine Light which was the true Prophets and Apostles Rule, in giving forth the Scriptures, &amp; is now the true Believers Rule, in truly believing, understanding and obeying the wholesom Doctrine contained in them, which none tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own, but they who believe in the Light, and follow and walk in the Spirit, which the

               <p>His accusing us <hi>with opposing mens being enlightened and taught by Christ, to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught by the Scriptures,</hi> is not true, unless he intended the Scriptures without Christ's Light within; for we assert his immediate Illumination and Teaching, in Opposition to mens preferring the Scriptures before the Spirit, and excluding its immediate Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these Dayes: we do not oppose Christ's Enlightning men to the true Knowledge or Understanding of the Scriptures, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thence.</p>
               <p>His rendering the Spirit and the Word <hi>two several Causes that produce the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> viz.

               <p>And while this man hath granted, <hi>That Christ is God, and God every where present, and so in all Men,</hi> p. 20. He must grant an Immediateness, both of his Presence, Light and Teaching in Man, or else he allows man no Preheminence above a Beast, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to limit God to Silence in man, unless when he hears outward Teaching or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which cannot profit him without God's immediate Teaching and inward Speaking.</p>
               <p>His accusing us <hi>with jumbling about Christ's being in all Men,</hi> and saying, that <hi>in Respect of his vertual Presence as Mediator, as when he rules and operates in Men's Hearts by his Authority, and by the Evangelical Law; in this Sense he is not in all Men,</hi> p. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>And when did we ever say, that he was in this Sense in all men, that is, <hi>as ruling,</hi> &amp;c. or to dwell in the Hearts of all men by Faith? But while 'tis granted, that as God Christ is every where present, and so in all men; it's granted, that he is in all men in some Sense, and his Presence is immediate; and though he does not rule in wicked mens Hearts by his Evangelical Law and dwells not by Faith in the Hearts of Unbelievers; yet by his Light he reproves them for Sin often, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in their Consciences, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

               <p>Note here, Reader, that he pretends to own super-natural Revelation, but not in a immediate Way, and a being savingly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, but not immediately; and yet pretends to own that Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, which directs both to God's Teaching, and Hearing, and learning of the Father, and coming to Christ for Life, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what the Spirit saith, and to wait for the Revelation of Christ from Heaven, and to look for the Appearance of the great God the Father, whom no Man knows but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him: And therefore this man's denying,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41160:17"/>
that Christ Jesus doth savingly enlighten, or afford super-natural Revelation in an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Way, hath at once excluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed both the Knowledge of God and Christ: and this is the very Way to bring in <hi>Atheism;</hi> for what shall assure us either of the Knowledge of God, Christ, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or true Preaching, if immediate Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be denyed us?

               <p>ANd this Opposer will have his Sense and Meaning upon some plain Scriptures, contrary to their very Import; as upon 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>But ye have an Unction from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One, and ye know all things.</hi> And again, ver. 27. <hi>But the Anointing which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and is no Lye; and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him:</hi> About this he appears very much puzled, and cannot tell how to wind off the plain Words on the Behalf of the Anointing, and its full and plentiful Teaching: And after he hath spoken doubtfully about the Sense of this Scripture, he concludes our Notion of the holy Spirit's Teaching Men, that live under the Gospel, <hi>cannot be the Sense of it;</hi> when the Words are plain, <hi>Ye need not that anyman teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41160:18"/>
you of all Things:</hi> Nor would this render the Design of <hi>John</hi> in this Epistle and other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>needless, p.</hi> 64. while his Epistle and Writing proclaims the Sufficiency of the Anointing, wherein he writes both to little Children, young Men and Fathers; and what he writes, was, as he had received from the Anointing, and not meerly as <hi>Man's Teaching,</hi> and argued no Defect in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing at all, but rather exalts it, and tends to encourage others to continue in it, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Truth; it being confest, <hi>That both the Apostles &amp; other Believers were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in Christ, by the Anointing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 22. As also, That <hi>they were induced at the first to believe the Doctrine to be from God, because they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Anointing of God to be upon them that preached it,</hi> p 66, 67. So that here it is confest, that Believers Establishment in Christ (both Preachers and Hearers) was by the Anointing of God upon them <hi>(as he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God)</hi> and that they were induced to believe the Doctrine to be from him, because that they perceived that Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be upon (or in) the Preachers: Surely then there was a spiritual Eye opened in them, so to perceive. And this is our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41160:19"/>
Method, both for believing, obeying, and saving Men, which one while this Man hath opposed, as contrary to God's Way; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while he confesseth to it; but then he darkens the Matter again upon the Words, Ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all Things; he gives this Meaning, viz. <hi>Not that by this U<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ction the commmon</hi> Christians <hi>were immediately inspired with the Knowledge of all Truths; but that by it they were assured of the Truth of all things which the Apostles had taught;</hi> and further adds, <hi>It is not said, that this Anointing did teach them all Things, but that it did teach [of] all Things, that is, of or concerning the Truth of all Things, to which it was a Witness or Evidence,</hi> p. 66, 67.</p>
               <p>He seems to lay a great stress here upon the Particle [Of] as if the Anointing did only teach them <hi>Of,</hi> or concerning those Doctrines which the Apostles preached, but not the Doctrines themselves; and then who taught the Apostles to preach? Was it not the Anointing? And did not several Gifts flow from one Spirit? But the man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the Words of the Apostle cited by him, viz. <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth you:</hi> and did not this Anointing teach the Believers in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41160:19"/>
the Apostles Absence, and when they had not their Epistles read among them? Or was it only a Witness or Evidence to what they spoke or preacht? Or did it abide in them, not to speak to them in the Absence of the Apostles and their Epistles, but only in their Presence? What a strange Limitation would this be, that indeed endeavours to stop the Mouth of the Anointing? And his denying, that by this Unction the <hi>common</hi> Christians were immediately inspired with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Truths, leaves the Matter still doubtful on his Part, and seems at least to be a Sense twarting the Apostles Words, <hi>Ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all Things.</hi> He should have told, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he believes that the common <hi>Christians</hi> (as he calls them) were inspired with any Truths necessary to Salvation? If he denies this, then he bids adieu to all divine and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge, as to those <hi>Christians:</hi> Whereas the same God that anointed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to preach, and established them in Christ, did both anoint and establish those Believers, to whom they preached; so, their Ministry was effectual only through that Anointing, which enabled them to preach; And we never denyed the Apostles Preaching, in order to direct men to that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41160:20"/>
All which still prefers the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as the principal Means and Rule, and owns true Preaching, as in Subordination to it; But does not therefore oppose or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Anointing's immediate Teaching, or Sufficiency to save them that believe in, and obey it: And because all are not converted, or come to this divine Unction within, or Dispensation of the New Covenant; God hath been, and is pleased to make Use of such effectual Means, and to accommodate his divine Truth to mens low Capacities, by Preaching and Demonstration of the Spirit, as may be for their Help and Advantage, in order thereto: So that the Controversie is brought to this narow Compass, viz. our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Opposer pretends to own super-natural Revelation and divine Illumination; but <hi>not now in an immediate Way,</hi> but only in a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Way of Preaching and Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We</hi> own and assert divine Illumination and super-natural Revelation in an immediate Way; as also, that God is pleased to make Use of such mediate Wayes and Means, as are attended with his Presence and divine Illumination, without which no outward Means can be effectual, or to any real Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Soul.</p>
               <p>This Opposer reckons that God operates
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41160:20"/>
now only in a <hi>mediate</hi> Way; we own, that God works both <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>mediately;</hi> as also we assert, the sole Sufficiency of the Spirt's immediate Illumination and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both as the Ground of the Effectual Ministry, and of saving Knowledge to all that receive it, and attend upon it. And this is the direct and <hi>proper Way</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of God's bringing Men to Salvation, as is assented to one while; but another while, saving Illumination in an <hi>immediate</hi> Way, is denyed by this contradictory Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser, p. 47. though in Contradiction to himself, again he confesseth, <q>Christ is the Light of the World by <hi>his Spirit,</hi> by his Word, by his Works, both miraculous and exemplary, p, 48.</q> whereby he hath granted Christ to be the Light of the World, both in an <hi>immediate</hi> &amp; in a <hi>mediate Way:</hi> How then not in an <hi>immediate</hi> Way (manifest Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) And yet he charges us <hi>with abusing at unawares that first Chapter of</hi> John, ver. 9. And why so? Because we own Christ to be that true Light that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, in an immediate Way, which is no Abuse; seeing, <hi>1st,</hi> the very Life that was iin hm is the Light of men: <hi>2dly,</hi> He attempts not to prove that men universally are lighted in such mediate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41160:21"/>
Wayes, as he proposes; as namely, by the Scriptures outward Teaching, Works and Example, seeing all men have not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and but few knew Christ's Works and Example.</p>
               <p>His Accusation of <hi>impertinently alledging of</hi> Joel 2. 28, 29. cited by <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2. 17. <hi>Behold the Dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, &amp;c.</hi> He convinceth us of no Impertinency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while from hence we assert this pouring out of the Spirit to be immediate; as, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord:</hi> Is not this immediate (as done by himself?)

Hereby he hath confessed some Persons to be extraordinarily qualified for outward Teaching and enabled to prophesie by the Pourings out of the Spirit: It seems he owns the Teachers &amp; Prophets to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taught, but the Hearers may not; so that from this Man's Method, the Danger of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> is not in the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but in their ordinary Sort of Hearers or weak <hi>Christ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

weak State, ever learning, and never allows them the Priviledge of their Teachers, that is, to be Teachers immediately illuminated and taught: And what is this, but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Trade of Preaching, that People may be alwayes paying? which is not to desire, that all the Lord's People were Prophets; nor, with <hi>Paul,</hi> to pray, that God would give them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Knowledge of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17. nor to bring People to the divine Anointing within, that is sufficient to teach them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this man appear in the Apostle's Mind, who said, these things I write unto you, that you may have Fellowship with us; and truly, our Fellowship is with the Father and the Son: Whereas this man's Method tends to keep the Hearers from this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which is in the divine immediate Light of God and Christ.</p>
               <p>He seems highly to commend God's Way and Method of Salvation, as to the <hi>Plainness</hi> and <hi>Fulness</hi> of the <hi>Revelation thereof under the New Covenant, by which it is fitted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Capacity, and the innate Goodness of the Laws thereof, fitted to attract and draw mens Wills to accept, embrace and chuse them.</hi> These sayes he, <hi>Are the Things, I conceive, foretold in that Prophecy,</hi> Jer. 31.

               <p>A plain and ample Confession, <hi>1st,</hi> To the New Covenant and the innate Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Laws thereof: <hi>2dly,</hi> To God's putting his Laws into the Mind, and writing them in the Heart: <hi>2dly,</hi> So that they shall not teach every man his Neighbour, &amp; every man his Brother.

To his Addition, <hi>That it is not then said, that they shall not be taught neither by Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors or Teachers; but they shall not teach every man his Neighbour, or every Man his Brother,</hi> p. 81. But who these Apostles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Pastors or Teachers are, that he would have us alwayes depend upon for outward or mediate Teaching, he does not shew us; nor who they are that pretend to be such by Vertue of an immediate Call or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Qualification, which he hath seemed to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41160:22"/>
grant before (which surely comes not by Succession from men) He does not tell us who he means, as thus called and qualified, as the true Apostles, Evangelists, &amp;c. were, who were sent of God, and endued with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertue and immediate Gifts for their VVork, which neither <hi>Baptist, Independent</hi> nor <hi>Presbyterian-</hi>Preachers do now pretend to, as heretofore, when they bore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of extemporary Praying and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, for which they are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> though undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly.</p>
               <p>However this man's VVork appears very lame, while he proclaims a <hi>mediate</hi> VVay of Teaching and Illumination by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Orall Tradition,</hi> and by Apostles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 47, 73, 81. as God's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod unto Salvation; and all this to oppose an <hi>immediate Way</hi> of Enlightning thereunto. Now suppose we should believe the former with him, in Opposition to the latter; yet still he leaves us in the dark, and at a Loss, in not directing us to those Apostles, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, Prophets, Pastors and Teachers, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified and called, as where, or among what People they are: As if he should tell us, that the VVay to Heaven, is, to follow certain Guides; but not at all direct us where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41160:23"/>
to find those Guides: But although we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that God doth with Power endue and send forth his Messengers to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; yet this no VVay doth oppose his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Illumination &amp; Teaching of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the New Covenant, but is a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proof and Testimony thereof; seeing they are immediately illuminated and inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that Work, and their Ministry recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the immediate Light and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God within, tends to direct men to him, that they may be taught of him; and therein are helpful to men: in order to turn them from Darkness to the Light, which no wayes does imply any Defect in the Light within, but an Alienation in man's Mind, till he be converted; for there can be no Defect or Insufficiency n God, because he maketh Use of apt Instruments, suited to mens VVeakness, and causeth his own VVorks to praise him; for he will not have his VVorks idle and useless. Now the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's immediate Illumination or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VVork of Power, and his working instrumentally by Ministers or Preaching, lyes here; the one is the Cause, and the other an Effect; the one is the absolute VVay or Rule of knowing God, and building up in his Knowledge; the other a subordinate Help
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41160:23"/>
for Direction to that VVay and Rule: He who is the true Light lighteth every man that cometh into the VVorld: This is not said of his Ministers, but they are sent to direct &amp; turn men's Minds to the Light: <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, saith the Lord:</hi> But so is it not said of his Ministers, though they direct to wait for it, <hi>I will write my, Laws in their Hearts saith the Lord;</hi> but the doing of this is not asscribed to his Ministers, though they bear witness therof: <hi>Ye have an Unction from the Holy One;</hi> it is not said, Ye have it from the Ministers. though it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Ministry, and they are taught thereby, and direct others to it, and to abide in it: <hi>He that establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God, who also work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all our Works in us:</hi> It is not said, that his Ministers do so establish, anoint and work all in us, though they be instrumental in God's Hand, to direct men to God and Christ (who is with them) in whom is Life and Salvation, and from whom every good and perfect Gift comes; and to whom be the Glory, and not to man.</p>

               <p>Observe here, serious Reader, that the plain Text of Scripture, fore-telling God's writing his Laws in the Hearts of his People, that they shall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, know the Lord, but all should know him: This he slightly turns off with this Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or <hi>[May be]</hi> that they shall not <hi>so much</hi> need to teach every man his Neighbour, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, know the Lord <hi>under the second Covenant as under the first;</hi> yet implying, that they shall still much need to say, know the Lord under the New Covenant, though not so much as under the Old: But how agrees this with the plain VVords, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my People; and they shall no more</hi> [or they shall not] <hi>teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, saying, know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least to the greatest?</hi> see <hi>Jer. 31. 33, 34. Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. But these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, the man reckons, are used impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and hyperbolically; and what is his Rule for thus censuring the plain VVords of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41160:25"/>
the Prophet and Apostle, and reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, equally with us, as <hi>improperly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing God's Method and New Covenant Way, to be his own <hi>immediate</hi> Teaching and Knowledge of himself, wherein they shall not teach every man his Neighbour; and yet in Contradiction to himself hath confessed, <hi>That the Work of Grace in men is most proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to God, to Christ, &amp;c.</hi> p. 19. His Instances for such limited Meanings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several Hyperbolical Expressions (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) in Scripture, if granted, prove not these very Texts so improper or hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as he renders them; and he evinceth not what his Rule is for thus rendering these particular Texts improper and hyperbolical, which so plentifully make for God's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Way of Illumination, Teaching and VVorking under the New Covenant: If he say, other Instances of Scripture compared are his Rule herein; I must deny that they prove these very Texts lyable to such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Limitation as he puts upon them: If he say that Reason is his Rule, then he owns another Rule, as Judge and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Sense of the Scripture, then the Scriptures themselves: But if he pretend the Spirit to be his Rule in this, then the Scriptures are not: Howbeit, the Spirit
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41160:26"/>
will not contradict its own Sayings in the Scriptures; and we do not own his limited Sense, Restriction, or private Interpretation of such an eminent Prophecy, as this of the New Covenant; for no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation; for the Prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And they who deny the immediate Illumination therof, are not like, truly to understand those Prophecies and Scriptures that proceeded thence.</p>

                  <p>Our Clearness from Error and Incongruity about the Light within, and our Opposer justly chargeable with both.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is true, that we affirm the Light of Christ within to be <hi>an absolute Rule,</hi> teaching men that follow it what they ought to know, believe and do; and that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to call upon Men to believe and obey it, forasmuch as many do not: But I must look upon this man's Inference upon us in this Case <hi>[as supposing for Truth that which is a manifest, gross, and most dangerous and pernicious Error]</hi> to be unjust, viz. <hi>That we suppose, it is not as well necessary to teach men by the Scriptures and by the Ministry to know and believe what is necessary to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it is to perswade them to do what is necessary therete,</hi> p. 83, 84. Which falsly supposeth a Defect in the Light and in our Ministry, directing thereto: Whereas the Light of Christ is able to teach men, to know, believe, and do what is necessary to Salvation (and to open the Scriptures) as Christ said,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41160:27"/>
                  <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light.</hi> And how could they be such if the Light did not teach them, both to know, believe and practise what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation? yet that many men are not come into the Light, though it shine in their Darkness, is very plain, while they rebel against the Light, and know not the Wayes of it, because they abide not in the Paths of it: But what is this to those who are come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the divine Light, and holy Unction within? As for his charging us with <hi>Incongruity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and Practice, dissembling the Matter, Tergiversatton and Shuffling, Inconsistency of Pretences and Practices, Pretences for a blind, a perfect Piece of</hi>—p. 93, 94, 95.

               <p>Here is no more Incongruity then in God's Teaching, both immediately and instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, in both which his own Power appears and operates: We take not upon us to teach People our selves, nor to hold forth man's Ministry; but Christ teacheth in us and by

               </p>
               <p>As for being <hi>against all other mens Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but our own,</hi> p. 94. And yet <hi>for the Teaching of the Light within:</hi> Unto this I say, we are satisfied that our Ministry is from God and his Light, and have no Reason to have any mens Teaching whatsoever impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon us, which does not flow from the Light, nor from God's immediate Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Teaching, which they opposing, their Ministry is but of man, and by the Will of man. And therefore it is no Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in our Principle and Practice to confess to the Teaching of Christ's Light within, and to teach others as that teacheth us, in order to turn them to the Light, that they may be taught, as we are; and so to deny all <hi>meer mens Teaching,</hi> who are not taught by the Light within, but gain-say God's immediate Teaching in these Dayes, as this man doth;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41160:28"/>
who also falsly accuseth us with this Error, viz. <hi>That God doth by a Light, created in every man, sufficiently teach them what they ought to believe and do,</hi> p. 87. But this is his Mistake and false Foundation, on which much of his Structure is framed; as also in p. 15. &amp; p. 41, 42. he takes it for granted, that 'tis but <hi>a natural Light</hi> in men that we direct them to; but this is contradicted by himself, in his confessing, <hi>That it is God, Christ, the holy Spirit, by immediate Illumination of our Minds, that doth shew us what we ought to believe and do; and that this is our Notior,</hi> p. 13. But his is, <hi>not by God's immediate Teaching and Operation,</hi> p. 40. So, be sure, God was not with him, in his Study, as his Teacher, in bringing forth his Book against God's immediate Teaching and Operation: And the man is grosly mistaken, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to be a <hi>created, natural Light in man,</hi> whilst he confesseth, <hi>We ground our selves much upon</hi> Joh. 1. 9. where it is said of Christ, <hi>That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the World,</hi> p. 41. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that true Light was neither created nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as a Thing made; for in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. This Life was not created nor natural in that Sense, but supernatural and divine: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41160:29"/>
this man gives us his Sense of this Scripture cited, viz. <hi>That Christ indeed as God, Creator, doth enlighten every man that comes into the World, with the Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Understanding, by which he may know that there is a God, that he is to be worshipped, and that he is placable, and the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween moral Good and Evil in many things,</hi> p. 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this he calls Natural Light, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it</hi> sufficient to direct the <hi>Heathen</hi> to as much as God expects from them; but not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct those that live under the Gospel, to believe, and do what they are bound, <hi>viz.</hi> To believe, Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and that upon Pain of Damnation, p. 42.</p>
               <p>Serious Reader, Consider the Tendency and Import of these Things; as, <hi>first,</hi> He grants, that Christ enlightens every man that comes into the World with such a Light, as that <hi>he may know that there is a God, that he is to be worshipped, and that he is placable:</hi> And <hi>2dly,</hi> grants this, <hi>a Light sufficient to direct the</hi> Heathen <hi>to as much as God expects from them.</hi> And is not this then in order to Salvation? If they obey what God expects from them, shall they not be saved? See the man's Contradiction, having before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41160:29"/>
that Christ lighteth every man, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Salvation without outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when here it is granted, he enlightneth every man, even the <hi>Heathen,</hi> with a Light sufficient to direct them to as much as God expects from them: But <hi>3dly,</hi> in calling this <hi>a natural, created Light,</hi> he egregiously errs; for how should the <hi>Heathen</hi> or any man else, know that there is a God, that he is to be worshipped, and that he is placable, or be directed to as much as God expects from them, by that which is natural and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, when the Things of God are beyond the natural man's Reach and Understanding, and only to be discerned spiritually? <hi>4thly,</hi> Whereas this man supposeth two such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Lights from Christ in man, viz. the one which he calls the <hi>Faculty of Reason and Understanding</hi> in the <hi>Heathen,</hi> sufficient to direct them in the Knowledge and Worship of God, and to as much as he expect from them; and the other in them that live <hi>under the outward Preaching of the Gospel;</hi> the first saving only to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> the second only to the professed <hi>Christians;</hi> the first sufficient to give the Knowledge of God and his Worship, the second the Knowledge of Christ and Salvation by him. I must deny his Distinction of two such Lights in men,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41160:30"/>
as unscriptural an unsound; and I must tell him, he hath brought us no Scripture-Proof to convince us thereof, that there are two such different Lights in man, thus limited or distinguished, the one as from God to <hi>Heathens,</hi> the other as from Christ to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> and yet both directing to the same End, to wit, Salvation. This kind of mangled confus'd Work is fit to darken Peoples Minds from the Knowledge of God and Christ, and Salvation; whereas that first Chapter of <hi>John</hi> is plain, without any such confused Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Light, or Division between God and Christ, as this man makes about the Light; for there it is, <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>And that was the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World,</hi> ver. 9. Mark here, this Life or Light of Christ is but one and the same forever, the Light of men throughout all Generations; yea, he was that true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the VVorld, whose Life or Light cannot (without Blasphemy) be deemed natural and created: Besides, it appears gross Confusion and palpable Contradiction in this Opposer, to conclude that Light not sufficient to direct men to believe Jesus to be Christ, the Son of God, and Saviour of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41160:30"/>
the VVorld, which yet is sufficient to direct the <hi>Heathen</hi> to as much as God expects from them, that is, to moral Goodness, to know and worship God; and consequently, to lead them to Salvation; for in every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he that fears God and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, is accepted: Now how they should know and worship God, and be saved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some living Knowledge and Belief of his Son, Jesus Christ, I cannot see nor understand, since that by no other Name under Heaven can men be saved; and he that believeth not the Son of God shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abides on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. cited by this man, who also confesseth the Son of God to be the Saviour of the World, p. 42. Again, no man comes unto God, but by his Son, who is therefore universally held forth, and given for a Light to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> to be God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth; and it is the World's Sin that they believe not in the Son of God, and for this his Spirit reproves them. But since it is granted, that the <hi>Heathen</hi> by that Light of Christ in them, may know and worship God, and practice good Morality, and as much as God expects from them; its grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may be godly, and serve God by the Light in them: but how any should
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41160:31"/>
be godly Men &amp; no <hi>Christians,</hi> I must confess we are yet to seek, and not like to have any Scripture-Proof thereof from our Opposer, or any else of his Perswasion; for it were as uncharitable to judge all void of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> who have not the Name <hi>Christian,</hi> as it were untrue to reckon all <hi>Christians,</hi> who have but the Name and Profession of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> seeing that it is not the Name or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession outward that makes true <hi>Christians,</hi> but the divine Life, Power, Unction and Possession of the Nature of <hi>Christianity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; as he is not a <hi>Jew</hi> that is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is a <hi>Jew</hi> that is one inward; and Circumcision is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter.</p>
               <p>And as for this man's Knowledge of Christ, that he has by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> and that he reckons is derived down <hi>successively by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching without immediate Revelation</hi> or <hi>Illumination,</hi> p. 47, 84. It is no living or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge; &amp; such Method as this man proposes for the Knowledge of Christ (as in Opposition to his <hi>Immediate Enlightning)</hi> is not God's Means: He talks something like a <hi>Papist;</hi> and his Work against immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Illumination tends to divert peoples Minds from God's inward Illumination, and and from waiting for the Revelation of his

Son in them: And what is this, but to lead People to be subjected under the <hi>Pope</hi> and Traditions, although many of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have confessed to the Truth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination and immediate Inspiration more then this man hath done, though in Practice, she manifests her self to be both apostatized and estranged from the divine Light within.</p>

caused many to stumble, whom the Lord hath made contemptible and base before the People, who have not <note place="margin">p. 90, 91.</note> kept his Wayes, but have been partial, And so the false Prophets that have seen Vanity, and divined Lyes, saying, Thus saith the Lord, when God hath not spoken (and these are highly guilty thereof, who now oppose God's immediate Inspeaking) and have done so to get Peoples Money by pleasing them, in prophesying Peace to them, when the true Prophets prophesied of Judgment, and were persecuted for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 25, 28.</p>

               <p>But again, to what he grants of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of some publick Ministers, who are wordly and fleshly Daubers and Betrayers, I shall grant to what he further adds, <hi>That it is unreasonable and Unchristian to condemn the Righteous with the Wicked, and to censure all for somes sake:</hi> This indeed were unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but unjustly cast upon us, p. 92.

And that can prove their Call &amp; Authority to preach, to be from

               <p>And yet in Contradiction to himself, he takes upon him to judge and vilifie us, to speak Evil of us; yea, to have been <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Darkness,</hi> and to be <hi>but carnal,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. Doth he not here judge?</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41160:34"/>
That all the Children of God are taught of God, and need not any other Teacher. This our Sense and Method he opposeth to God's Way, <hi>as being quite different,</hi> p. 14. And saith, that God's Way and Method of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting men what to believe and do, <hi>is not by his immediate Teaching and Operation,</hi> p. 40.</p>
               <p>But in plain Contradiction to himself, he confesseth, <hi>That the Scripture attributes it</hi> (to wit, the Work of saving Grace) <hi>to God, to Christ, to the holy Spirit,</hi> p. 18. and saith, <hi>Indeed the Work of saving Grace in men is most</hi> PROPERLY <hi>attributed to God, to Christ,</hi> p. 19.</p>
               <p>That the Light, mentioned <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. which lighteth every man that cometh into the World, doth enlighten men by <hi>natural Light;</hi> and that Christ, <hi>as</hi> God, doth enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en every man that cometh into the World with the <hi>Faculty of Reason,</hi> and affords no other Light to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> then <hi>this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light,</hi> as he calls it, p. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>Yet in plain Contradiction, he grants, That the Scripture speaks of <hi>Christ's being [in] men;</hi> and Christ and God <hi>every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and <hi>se in all men,</hi> and that the <hi>essential Presence of Christ, as God, is present to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man,</hi> p. 20, 21.</p>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:41160:35"/>
Observe Reader, how plainly he has broke the Neck of his Cause here: For if Christ, as God, be essentially present in all men, and to every man, and this God be Light, then the Light that is in every man is not natural nor created, as he hath affirmed the Light of Christ, <hi>as God,</hi> to be: And as for his Distinction between the <hi>essential Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of Christ and his <hi>virtual Presence,</hi> p. 20, 21. it is unscriptural: Neither can we believe, that the Presence of God and Christ are so distinguished or divided, as this man implies, viz. That <hi>God's essential Presence should be in all men,</hi> and yet <hi>not Christ's virtual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:</hi> VVhat Scripture hath he for these Words? Is there any Virtue in Christ's Presence, that is not in God's Presence? Is not the Father, Son and Holy Spirit one Being, though different as to Relation and Degrees of Manifestation? But how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory is it, one while to confess Christ's being <hi>in men, his essential Presence, as God, to be in all men;</hi> and yet that <hi>his Light in the Heathen</hi> (or greatest Part of men) <hi>is natural and created.</hi> O monstrous Inconsistency!</p>
               <p>He affirms, that the Form of Doctrine delivered to the <hi>Christians,</hi> to wit, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41160:35"/>
was <hi>to be the Rule of Faith and</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Practice, to rule and govern themselves by,</hi> p. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>And yet confesseth, <hi>That those who are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, make it their dayly Care and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to walk according to the Light and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that Rule that hath its Seat in their Conscience,</hi> p. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> Here he has found another Rule then the Scripture, to wit, the Light in the Conscience: Though it is true, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine contains Rules; but the Light within that gave it forth, was <hi>The Rule,</hi> the <hi>Chief or Highest Rule,</hi> for Guidance and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that wherein was the Power of Rule and Government to all true <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gives this Judgment against us, viz. That in Truth <hi>there is no Light in us, how much soever we vainly boast of it,</hi> he sayes, p. 40.</p>
               <p>And yet hath confessed, <hi>That the essential Presence of Christ, as God, is in all men; and that Christ doth enlighten every man with a Faculty of Reason or natural Light:</hi> by which he hath acknowledged <hi>some Light</hi> to be in every man, though it is true, they that speak not according to the Word, it is because there is <hi>no Morning in them;</hi> yet it follows not, that there is no Light at all in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41160:36"/>
them; for there may be some Light in them before the Morning.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. he saith, <hi>that there is no such thing, as that Christ so enlightens all men</hi> (as with what he ought to believe and do, in order to his Salvation) <hi>without out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching, can be proved,</hi> p. 41.</p>
               <p>And yet confesseth, That Christ indeed, <hi>as God, doth enlighten every man,</hi> by which he may know, that there is <hi>a God,</hi> that he is to be <hi>worshipped,</hi> that he is <hi>placable;</hi> and that this may be <hi>a Light sufficient</hi> to direct the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to do <hi>as much as God expects from them, if they live up to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in Contradiction again, He calls this <hi>a natural Light, not sufficient,</hi> &amp;c. p. 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> What! A Light sufficient to give the Knowledge of God and his Worship, &amp; that he is placable, and to direct the <hi>Heathen</hi> to as much as he expects from them, and yet not sufficient to enlighten men with a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what they ought to believe and do, in order to Salvation? Is not this palpable Contradiction, That <hi>Men may by the</hi> Light <hi>within be directed to acknowledge and worship God, and to as much as he expects from them;</hi> and yet <hi>not be saved?</hi> These can never hold together any more then that the Light in the <hi>Heathen</hi> may be sufficient to direct them to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41160:36"/>
                  <hi>as much as God expects,</hi> and yet <hi>not to believe in his Son</hi> for Salvation, according to <hi>pag.</hi> 42. As if God did not require all men to believe in his Son, when their not believing in him is the very thing for which his Spirit reproveth the World of Sin; and he that believeth not in the Son of God is condemned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That mens not believing in the <hi>Sou,</hi> and their rejecting his <hi>light within,</hi> are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, &amp; bothtend to the same End</note> already, because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Light</hi> is come into the World, and men love Darkness rather then Light, because their Deeds are Evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 19. So that it is evident; That Light is come into the World, that men may believe in the Name of the Son of God, and escape Condemnation.</p>
               <p>Again, he errs in saying, Paul <hi>knew of no such Way to propagate the Faith</hi> (as <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation,</hi> and inward Teaching of the <hi>Light within)</hi> after it was once set on foot in <hi>an extraordinary Way,</hi> p. 46.</p>
               <p>And this he hath contradicted, in his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, That the Work of Grace in men, <hi>is most properly attributed to God, to Christ;</hi> and that <hi>the Scripture attributes it</hi> to God, to Christ, to the holy Spirit, p. 18. And also he had, <hi>almost granted, that the holy Spirit may be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41160:37"/>
communicated to men by immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> So then God may and doth work by his immediate Power and Spirit, for the begetting men into the true Faith, and it is only this Spirit, immediately attending true Ministers, that maketh their Preaching effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for the turning men to the Word of Faith in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Tenour and Stress of this man's Work is against <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> in the best sense, even against being savingly illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in an immediate way;</hi> and saith, that the plentiful Effusion of the Spirit <hi>is far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Countenance to our Opinion of the Spirit's being given to teach men immediately by internal Illumination,</hi> pag. 60. And on <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. he accounteth that this is not a Promise to guide <hi>all Christians by its immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Motion,</hi> but a Promise to his Apostles, <hi>pag.</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>And yet in Contradiction to himself in this, and in Concession to the Truth, he in words assents to the <hi>Operation of God's Grace and good Spirit,</hi> pag. 15. And that men are said in Scripture <hi>to be born of the Spirit, to be born of the immortal Seed of the Word,</hi> pag. 18, 19. But then he is nconsistent again, in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these <hi>different Causes,</hi> he hath also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41160:37"/>
the <hi>essential Presence of Christ as God, to be in men,</hi> p. 20. And that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. it is seven times said, He that hath an Ear let him hear what the <hi>Spirit saith to the Churches,</hi> p. 27. And that <hi>Christ's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are Ministers of the New Testament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> p. 33. <hi>That he accompanies their Ministration with the Presence of his Grace and Power,</hi> p. 38. And also he asserts to <hi>the inward Assistance of his Spirit,</hi> p. 41. And saith, <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is Truth,</hi> p. 55. And on 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth you; he grants that the Apostle's Meaning must be, <hi>That they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from him, or any other man any teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that could give them greater Assurance of any thing then that Anointing gave them of Jesus his being the Christ, and of the Truth of that Doctrine; that Anointing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Witness from Heaven,</hi> pag. 68. And that the <hi>Spirit doubtless is not wanting to assist the sincere Endeavours of men, in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Sense of the Scriptures,</hi> p. 69.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, for men to be guided by the <hi>internal Teachings of the Spirit, without out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching,</hi> this he calls <hi>our Wild Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> And yet citeth <hi>Rom. 8. 14. As many
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41160:38"/>
as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> p. 71. And <hi>Gal. 5. 18. If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law,</hi> p. 73. And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted, <hi>Eph. 2. Be filled with the Spirit,</hi> in order to their speaking to themselves <hi>in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs,</hi> Ephes. 5. 18, 19. p. 74. And he cites <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. viz. <hi>Unto whom I now send thee, to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light,</hi> p. 85. Now I ask; If this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was not within, that they were to be turned from? And if this Light, they were to be turned to, was not also within in some Degree, and that in an immediate VVay? And also, Did not the Apostle turn the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to the Light, that they might receive Forgiveness of Sins, and an Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are sanctified by Faith that is in Christ?</p>
               <p>Further, he confesseth to the Truth in these words, <hi>If all good</hi> Christians <hi>then had been guided by an infallible Light within, they would not have needed to have bin taught and re-taught what were the first Principles of the Oracles of God, as some of them were, Hebr.</hi> 5. p. 105. Is it not plain here, that he hath placed the Fault or Deficiency upon those that needed so to be taught, as being
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41160:38"/>
awanting to themselves (not following the Infallible Light within) and not upon the Light it self? but justified it as a sufficient Rule and Teacher; and that they that are guided by it need not mens Teaching. And he also confesseth, <hi>That the Humble God will teach, and the Meek he will guide in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Psal. 25. And also, that <hi>the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of</hi> Christians <hi>is such, that they are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the spiritual and divine Nature, or Likeness to Jesus Christ in Purity, in Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Humility, Meckness, and in Love to God, and Charity to men, in Peace and Gentleness, in Contempt of the World, &amp;c. on the Account of which spiritual Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> Christians <hi>are said to be one Spirit with Christ; and by this Spirit and Temper we know that we dwell in him, and he in us; and if any man have not the Spirit of Christ in some measure, he is none of his,</hi> pag. 119. Is not this a plain Confession to the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateness of Christ's In-dwelling in us? And does not he then teach us by himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately? It is also confessed, <hi>We are also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted in a due Sence of our own Weakness and Insufficiency, and of the great Need we have of the constant Assistance of God's holy Spirit in all, to make instant and important Supplication to God for it,</hi> p. 122. Here he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41160:39"/>
plainly grants to the Necessity of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration and immediate Assistance of God's holy Spirit; which plainly overthrows and confuteth the Body of his Work to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And further observe, that in his Postscript he confesseth, <hi>That he hath not so plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Nature of Faith, which is the condition of the New Covenant; and that he that Believes and considers Christs Doctrine, must needs be under the Influence of the most powerful Motives to Repentance of a bad, and lead a good Life: And that Faith works that Change in men, by which they become new Creatures, are born of God, and sanctified; and that it doth evidence to the Soul of things not seen; and that a Believer is described by his coming to Christ,</hi> John 6. 35. <hi>For mens coming to learn of him is the Effect of their believing him to be the Son of God; and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are described by the Receiving of Christ,</hi> John 1. 12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name; and that Believers are described by their trusting in Christ or relying on him,</hi> Eph. 1. 12. p. 135.</p>
               <p>Now mark, serious Reader, how he has confessed to the Truth of Believers coming
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41160:39"/>
to Christ to learn of him, receiving Christ, trusting in, and relying on Christ: And what is this but a Confession to a Believer's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Enjoyment of Christ himself, and his immediate Teaching and Assistance: For if men come to Christ, to learn of him, or be taught by Christ himself; is not this immediate, and the End of Outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to those that come to this Blessed At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: See how the man hath justified that <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> (as he calls it) which he he hath bestowed so much Pains against.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Reader,</hi> by this time thou mayst see where the Stress of the Controversie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, and that it is not about the word <hi>[En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm]</hi> but about the Doctrine of God's Immediate Way of Enlightening &amp; Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which this man in a Way of Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pleased to term <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers, Enthusiasts,</hi> for owning that Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Some other more particular Fling sand Groundless Objections he has against us of less moment, which I pass by as Trifles not deserving my Time and treating about.</p>
