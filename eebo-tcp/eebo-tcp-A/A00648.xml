         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

friends house of mine, acquainted me with his Proiect; which was as followeth: That hee the said <hi>Taylor</hi> had studied such seuerall Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in Prose, as neuer were the like before: (which indeede fell out true, to his shame) wherein hee would haue me ioyne; hee to play a Scene in Prose, and I to answere him in Verse: Whereto I condiscended, on these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; <hi>viz.</hi> That I might haue halfe the Commoditie thereof; Or Securitie for fiue pounds; Or else twentie shillings in hand, and the rest as the Day affoorded. Next, That I might heare his Booke read (which was fit) to know on what ground I might build my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention. And last, That I should see the Manner of his Challenge before it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and set my Answere to it with my owne hand. To all which hee graunted, and deliuered mee fiue Shillings vpon the same: Whereupon I promised faithfully, That if all this were on his part performed, I would (God willing) meete him, and with my best endeauor striue to give the Audience content. Now, here I must entreat you, before you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mee, note but the Occasions of my Breach of Promise: This <hi>Water-Taylor,</hi> with his Confederates, presuming he had bound

And the same day I receiued a Letter out of Warwickeshire from my Father, That he was not well; wishing mee and my wife to repayre vnto him with all possible speede. Now, you that are Parents of Children, or Children to Parents, Iudge, whether I ought rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obay my Father, or displease <hi>Iohn Taylor</hi>; purchase my Fathers hate, or lose a Scullers loue; and I hope you will say I had sufficient cause to keepe me from the <hi>Hope.</hi> But fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my homely Truth (though it be sufficient to plead my Honestie) is not answerable to your
