            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For it is a thing notorious &amp; ſufficiently knowen, not onely to the fewe <hi>Hanſe</hi> townes, but alſo to all Chriſtendome, that the king of Spaine is tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a mortall hatred againſt the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of England: a witnes whereof is the intended but not performed inuaſion of the kingdome, and Dominions of England by the ſaide king the yeere laſt paſt, furthered by him with all his force, but by the mercie of God vtterly diſappointed.</p>
            <p>Which exulcerate malice of the Kings minde, not lately ſprong vp, but of long time lurking in the cloſet of his heart, yet foreſeene and ſtill preuented by the Queenes Maieſtie, ſhe often by her meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſent to him for that purpoſe, as with moſt

gentle medicines indeuoured to aſſwage, to reduce him to a newe minde meeter for a Prince, and ſo great a king as himſelfe: to the ende that remouing out of both their mindes not onely the ſtaine, but alſo the ſuſpition of the ſtaine of diſcontentments, they might diſpoſe themſelues to enter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a firme peace and durable friendſhip, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient leagues betweene their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours and fathers, and their kingdomes, for the ſpace of many yeeres happily continued.</p>
            <p>The king as a man bewitched by the biſhop of Rome, the very firebrand and bellowes of all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres in Chriſtendome, neglecteth the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and conditions of peace that haue bene offred, and perſeuereth according to his beginning, in his hoſtile inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement againſt her Maieſtie, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe contentable or ſatisfiable then with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the ſlaughter and bloodſhed of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt obedient vnto her, and to bee ſhort, with the conqueſt of the whole kingdome.</p>
            <p>And for the better effecting hereof, hee hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſent his meſſengers (you woulde rather ſay his fireflingers) into England, &amp; of lateſt yeeres, two ſpeciall perſons, of all the reſt moſt eger and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>Gyrald Deſpes,</hi> and <hi>Bernardine Mendoza,</hi> who ceaſed not to ſound and perſwade the mindes of all thoſe whome they coulde growe in acquaintance with, and were men giuen ouer to al miſchiefes and diabolical practiſes: promiſing them, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon them extraordinarie rewards, of purpoſe to ſtirre them vp to moue domeſtical conſpiracies againſt her Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>And how much they preuailed in their attempts,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:818:4"/>
it is not materiall in this place particularly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe, for ſo this worke woulde growe large. The 3. principall conſpiracies, the one of the Earles of Northumberland and Weſtmerland, and of their partizans, the ſecond of the Duke of Norfolke, the third of the two Pagets brethren, as alſo of the two Throckmortons and of their confederats, whereof ſome were condemned and executed, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ouerthrow of the Queenes Maieſtie, and of the ſtate of the Common wealth, and the reſt that are fled, and wander vp and downe in vncertaine places, and are to this day mainteined at the charge and by the purſe of the Spaniſh King, are in this matter very ſufficient witneſſes.</p>
            <p>But the Patrons and complotters of theſe rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, being ſubtile and cautelous in their actions, howſoeuer apparant the factes of their ſeditious miniſters ſeeme to bee, yet peraduenture the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard himſelf wil denie them to be his precepts, and directions.

Did hee detaine from them all rewards and preferments, as hauing ill deſerued them? hath he blamed the auctours of ſuch facts, and excuſed himſelfe to the Queene? I would to God it were ſo.</p>

As for the late treatie of peace with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in Flanders, entred into vpon the mediation, and requeſt of the good prince the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> how ſmoothe &amp; how ſlie a tuche was that? for her Maieſtie, being wholy bent to that treatie, with a ſincere minde and vnfayned deſire, beholde as then at her doores, that huge &amp; mightie Fleete of Spaine, beholde a ſort of Armies brought out of Italie, and Germanie into Flanders, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and prouiding for nothing els but the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdome of England, and the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Queene: for the Conſpiratours had as it were with their fingers, appointed euery one of vs to the ſlaughter: they had diſtributed our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and lands, and a newe Prince, a forrener was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ordeyned &amp; created to enioy the kingdome.</p>
            <p>If the Spaniards ſeeme to obiect againſt theſe ſo grieuous, ſo deadly, and ſo ſtrange deuiſes, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which her Maieſtie hath yeelded to the lowe Countreys, let them conſider well, and they ſhall finde, that moſt of theſe practiſes haue in time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the tranſporting of any ayde to them: let them denie (if they can) that they ſollicited many Engliſh Subiects to rebell, before her Maieſtie, ſo much as thought, of the relieuing of her auncient confederats, by her honeſt and iuſt meanes.</p>

            <p>For if ſhe had bene diſpoſed to regard her owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, ſhe might haue taken another courſe, but ſhe did not ſo: ſeeking rather as yet, earneſtly, and diligently with any conditions, if not too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and ſuch as may ſtand with her honor, and the profite of the ſtate of Chriſtianitie, howe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious and ſecure pacification may be made betwixt the King, and the States of the lowe Countreys.</p>

            <p>And howſoeuer ſhe may be thought greedie of <note place="margin">Her Maieſties Ambaſſadors ſent into Flanders to intreate of a peace.</note> other mens Dominions, ſhe ſent to Parma very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent Ambaſſadours, who being delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from day to day, from moneth to moneth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing accompliſhed, ſhe notwithſtanding tooke it patiently, and ſuffered ſo farre theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous delayes, that the Spaniſh Souldiers panting with haſte and greedineſſe for the blood and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie of her Maieſtie, and people moſt deare vnto her, were come vpon her coaſtes, and before her doores. In this ſort was her hope deluded, and her opinion fruſtrated by him, contrary to the royall dignitie of both the Kingdomes of England and of Denmarke.</p>
            <p>And if the victorious hand of God had not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in derided the cunning deuiſes and purpoſes of the Spaniards, if it had not ſcattered ſo great a terrour to all Chriſtendome, and drenched their carkaſes in the Sea, what ſhould the ſtate of the ſaid Hanſe marchants haue bene, ſo buſily and ſo contrary to al equitie and iuſtice, haſtening to furniſh him with corne &amp; prouiſion for the warres? whither ſhould the long and ſacred quiet of the Romane Empire haue gone to hide it ſelfe? where ſhould all other Nations that profeſſe the trueth of Chriſtianitie, thinke that they might haue ſhrowded themſelues to be free from his tyrannie, and ſafe from his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers and cruel executioners? If they ſaw not that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:818:6"/>
their owne deſtruction was ioyned with the ruine of the Queene of England, either it muſt be ſaide that they woulde denie Chriſt, or that they were blinded to their owne miſerie by the vengeance of God, for their ſecret ſinnes. For where the cauſe of hoſtilitie is all one, the like effect and iſſue is to be looked for at the hands of a cruell and raging ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the trueth: for in a maner, all the inhabitants of the Hanſe Townes are very good fauourers of the reformed Religion, and mortall enemies to the Romiſh errors. And would any man then beleeue, that men ſo well inſtructed, coulde more reſpect their priuate gaine, I will not ſay their filthie lucre, then their owne ſecuritie, the preſeruation of their Countrey, and the propagation of true Religion?</p>
            <p>But what? will the inhabitants of the Hanſe Townes pretend that they knewe not the Queene of Englands pleaſure? The Citie of Hamborough by their letters written vnto the Queenes Maieſtie, <note place="margin">The Citie of Hamboroughs letters to the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</note> the 21. of September, in the yeere 1585. hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her, that their ſhips might paſſe quietly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spaine and Portugal, without ſtop or hindrance either in their paſſage or repaſſage, by her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Captaines at Sea, receiued not they anſwere to this effect?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We doubt not, but you haue heard what occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde are lately fallen out betweene vs and the king of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas two yeeres after that, to wit, <note place="margin">The Hamburgers petitorie meſſage to the Queenes Maieſtie.</note> the laſt yeere the ſaide Burgomaſters of Hambur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſent <hi>Sebaſtian Berghen</hi> their Secretarie and <hi>Agent</hi> with letters vnto the Queene of England, deſiring that vnder the colour and title of Newtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, they might freely paſſe into Spaine and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingal, and repaſſe againe with al kind of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe whatſoeuer, was not the ſaid <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this wiſe by the Lordes of her Maieſties Counſaile?</p>

That ſuch as preſumptuouſly durſt attempt the contrary, ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment of their vnbrideled licenſiouſneſſe, if they</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:818:7"/>
               <hi>fell into the handes of the Captaines, or other Subiects of the Queene of Englande, their goods and marchandiſes whatſoeuer thus tranſported againſt her Maieſties will to be made good priſes to any man that can take them, no excuſe of Newtralitie preuailing to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer it is not to be omitted, that the Lords of her Maieſties Counſell aforeſaid, hauing called for <hi>Maurice Tymberman</hi> reſident in London, and <note place="margin">The Alderman of the Stilliard in London, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to aduiſe the Hanſe Townes.</note> Alderman (as they call him) of the Stilliard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to giue warning to all the <hi>Haunſe</hi> Townes that her Maieſtie willed, and according to her Soueraigne auctoritie in her Dominions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhoulde forbeare from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, from the beginning of the moneth of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie laſt paſt from carying of corne, and generally of all prouiſion of warre, cables, maſtes, and like mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe into Spaine and Portingall, whereby the enemie of her Kingdome might be the better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, vnder the paine of loſſe both of ſhips and goods, to be inflicted vpon ſuch, as ſhould violate this her princely commandement.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Haunſe</hi> Townes were not ignorant of this inhibition, appeareth by the letters of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Lubecke, and Hamborough, written after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin">The letters of the Lubeckers, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers, and Dantiskers.</note> to the Queenes Maieſtie, the 26. of March, and from Dantiske, the 13. of the ſaide moneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe ſhips ſet out from home, which are now taken. The ſame in like maner is apparant, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bils of the hiring, and freyghting of their ſhips, wherein among others, this one thing is worth the noting, which was there found, that they couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in plaine words, with the ſhipmaſters, that they ſhould not paſſe into Spaine &amp; Portingall through
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:818:7"/>
the Engliſh Chanel &amp; vſuall way, but on the backe ſide of the Kingdomes of Scotland, and Ireland, a newe and ſtrange, and without doubt, a dangerous courſe: by which their intention and deede, they declared howe litle they cared for good meaning, and how carefull they were to arme and furniſh the common and knowen enemie of the Queene of England. But as alwayes for the moſt part it falleth out, deceite doeth neuer thriue with any man, and when men thinke moſt to deceiue, they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſuffer the penaltie of their guile: for falling into the handes of her Maieſties armie vpon the coaſt of Portugall, and euen in the entrance of the hauen of Lisbone, they were brought backe into England, and by the lawe of Nations, are become priſes to him which tooke them.</p>
            <p>Here now they cry out, that the Commaunders of our Fleete haue delt iniuriouſly with them, they exclaime that the leagues are broken, that their old priuiledges in England are violated, which they chalenge to belong to their Cities, and ought to be kept and mainteined. As though that any man were ſo madde, ſo farre from the trueth of things, ſo careleſſe of his owne ſafetie, ſo great an enemie to publike ſecuritie, that with all his might and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, would not preuent the miſchiefe and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hanging ouer the Commonwealth. He that withſtandeth not wrong when hee is able, is in as great fault, as if he deſtroyed the Common wealth. The preſeruation of the people hath bene euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted among all nations, for the very ſupreame Law.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:818:8"/>
lawe againſt a publike and ſoueraigne lawe? Did euer any king or Prince witting and waring, ſuffer ſuch a kinde of trafike which ſhould make his enemie ouer mightie, and though hee did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh himſelfe, yet ſhoulde leaue himſelfe more open vnto his furie, which otherwiſe were like to be vnarmed and vnable to wage warre againſt him?</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1545. at which time the warres grew hotte betwixt the kingdomes of England and <note place="margin">The Engliſh and French enemies: Charles the fift a confederate.</note> Fraunce, when the ſubiects of <hi>Charles</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the fift of that name of noble memorie, would needes haue had free libertie of paſſage with all commodities into Fraunce, vnder pretext of their Newtralitie, What was the Emperours anſwere being a Prince of great equitie? Did he not openly pronounce that courſe of theirs altogether vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? let the Contract it ſelfe concluded the 6. day of April be lookt into.</p>
            <p>When the Kings of Denmarke, and of Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande were at difference one with another, was it <note place="margin">The Danes and Swethens ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: the Hanſe men confederats.</note> permitted to theſe Hanſemen to conuay freely any thing into one of their kingdomes, which was not in deede ceaſed vpon &amp; confiſcated, if it fel into the laps of the other, not hauing firſt obtained ſpeciall libertie for the ſame? Was this ſtately, &amp; ſo much priuiledged name of Newtralitie at that time, of ſuch force, that without vſing of any mediatour, it could recouer againe their goods out of the hands of the Danes &amp; Swethens, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance the ſame in ſafetie, &amp; ſecuritie? Let them acknowledge that, whereof they are not ignorant, that although the Emperour <hi>Ferdinande</hi> and other Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire dealt in their behalfe by way of intreatie and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:818:8"/>
mediation, and that from the ſolemne aſſemblie of the ſaid Empire, yet they in this caſe preuailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all with <hi>Ericke,</hi> the king of Swethland.</p>
            <p>And further in the time of hoſtilitie betwene the Empire, wherewith as then the king of <hi>Poland</hi> ioyned againſt the great Duke of <hi>Muſcouie,</hi> went <note place="margin">The Emperour and the King of Poland enemies to the Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite: the Engliſh and Hanſe men friends.</note> theſe matters otherwiſe then? Could either the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh marchants, or anie other frequent the <hi>Narue</hi> in <hi>Liuonia,</hi> or any other partes of the Dukes domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons freely, and without daunger? Did the Hanſe men which then were for their king and Emperor, deliuer and reſtore againe the ſhippes which they had intercepted and taken, from thoſe which made ſuch attempts? Many mens goods ſurpriſed by the Hanſe men and others, as then intertained againſt the <hi>Moſcouite,</hi> and by them ſtill detained, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie precedent prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of paſſing to the ſaid <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couite,</hi> are hereof very good witneſſes.</p>
            <p>It is alſo a thing well knowen, that the noble Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States, exerciſed the like iuſtice, as well againſt the Hanſe men, as others in times paſt.</p>
            <p>And verely the foreſaid Princes in theſe arreſtes did that which was according to the tenour, and preſcription of the lawes of the equitie of nations. For that ſame priuiledge of Newtralitie, is in ſuch ſort to bee vſed and inioyed, that in helping one of our confederates, we hurt not another: ſo that hee which helpeth one, &amp; thereby damnifieth another, falleth from his priuiledge and contract: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he helpeth one of his confederates, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doeth preiudice another, and by that fact of his, makes himſelfe an enemie, as offering the firſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:818:9"/>
iniurie, and therefore in ſo doing, he is to bee taken and reputed for an Adherent, and Aſſiſtant to the enemie, and a very enemy himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This then beeing the ſtate of theſe thinges, what lawe, what reaſon, or example may be obiected to the contrary, but that it is lawfull for the Queene of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whoſe ſcepter, diademe, kingdome, liuing, and life, are greedily thirſted after by the Spaniard, ſo potent and ſo malicious an enemie, to doe that againſt his fautors and fauourers ſo often premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which was lawful for the Emperour, for the Empire, for the king of Swethen, for the king of Denmarke, for the Prince of Orange, for the States of Netherland, yea for the <hi>Hanſe</hi> men themſelues to doe in the like cauſe, but not in the like danger, and extremitie as this is.</p>
            <p>Nay, if wee thought it requiſite to alleadge any thing out of the priuiledges themſelues, whereof they haue ſo often, and ſo much complained, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many yeeres withheld from them by iniuſtice, wee might offer the charter of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt king <note place="margin">Anno Do. 1302.</note> of England, to be peruſed, granted in the third yere of his raigne: in which charter wee reade theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all the aforeſaide Marchants may at any time car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or cauſe to bee carried into or out of the kingdome of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">An exception in the priuiledge.</note> 
               <hi>England, their marchandizes, which they ſhall bring with them, or buy here or otherwiſe come by, excepting to the countreyes of the manifeſt and notorious enemies of this kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that either they muſt denie, that the king of Spaine hauing practiſed ſuch cruell and horrible things (I would to God we might not ſay ſtil practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:818:9"/>
the ſame) is an enemie to the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or els by the wordes of the aforeſaide charter, they muſt confeſſe that they are included within thoſe boundes and limites, which they may not paſſe, if they deſire to bee called and accompted friendes.</p>
            <p>We may adde to all this, that it is a thing able to be ſhewed and proued in the Courts of Records of the kings of England, that heretofore the warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, and continuing betwixt the kinges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and of Fraunce, the goods of theſe Hanſe men were ſo ſubiect here in England to arreſtes, as now they are, vntill they grew more warie, and had put in ſufficient Sureties, that they woulde not from that time tranſport any part of their goods into the prouinces and dominions of the French king.</p>
            <p>By theſe reaſons we take it plainely, and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that her Maieſties Captaines by Sea, in the preſent arreſt of the Hanſe mens goods, haue committed no iniuſtice againſt their prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, but rather that they haue vtterly loſt them for this pranke of theirs, in cauſing victualles and martiall furnitures to bee conuayed to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of her manifeſt and notorious enemies, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the wordes ſpecified in the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Although her Maieſtie is not purpoſed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all preſent extremities, and this moſt vile and moſt barbarous part of the Hanſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, to proceede in dealing with them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſeueritie of law which iuſtly ſhe might execute, but is nowe thus farre onely reſolued, to confiſcate all the corne and prouiſions of warre: and as for the ſhippes themſelues, and other ſortes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:818:10"/>
of marchandiſe in them, ſhee is content to diſmiſſe them for the preſent.</p>
            <p>But nowe touching the matter of their priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for which they keepe ſuch a ſtirre, in complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Emperour, the ſtates of the Empire, and al other princes els, which neuertheleſſe are cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found to haue beene broken, and forfeited in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, that moſt noble and famous prince. The Queene of Englande can ſufficiently proue, that theſe Hanſe men haue deſerued no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite or fauour at her hands, euen by the lawes of the Empire it ſelfe, if her Maieſtie thought the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument neceſſary to ſtande vpon. It is a very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thing, that her Maieſtie neglecting and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the vniuſt pretenſes and forged ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith theſe Hanſe men haue charged her among ſtrangers, hath yeelded to them no leſſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of free negotiation, then to her owne ſubiects, without any other reſtraint but this, that in liewe <note place="margin">The fauour and liberalitie of the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, no leſſe to the Haunſe men, then to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh themſelues.</note> and memorie of ſo ſingular a fauour, they alſo on their parts ſhould graunt the like freedome in their portes, and cities to her ſubiects, and marchantes: and yet like vnkinde people, and without reſpect to this fauour, they returne to their olde byas, &amp; ceaſe not to attempt thinges dangerous to her Maieſtie, and by the opinions of all princes in no caſe to bee ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Hanſe</hi> men were at the like controuerſie ſometimes with the kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> &amp; <hi>Swethen,</hi> by reaſon of certaine like priuileges in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Swethland,</hi> and the matter grew ſo hot that it brake out to an open warre: but with what fruite or gaine to the ſtate of the <hi>Haunſe</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:818:10"/>
men? This was the iſſue: they were forced to accept ſuch conditions of priuiledges, not as they challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but as the foreſaid kings thought iuſt, &amp; equal. By which preſident they might learne if they were wiſe, not to accept only, but moſt gladly &amp; thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to accept the conditions offered by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as proceeding from ſuch a kind of liberalitie, that may make them in this caſe ſuperiouts to all other Strangers, equall and alike with her owne Subiects. But if they continue in this their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe and ingratitude, let them take heede leaſt they plucke vpon themſelues that moſt iuſt reward of their moſt peruerſe behauiours, whereof they haue felt the ſmart before this, both in <hi>Swethlande, Norway</hi> and <hi>Liuonia</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Seeing then theſe <hi>Hanſe</hi> men haue receiued from her Maieſtie many great benefits, but no ill deſerts at any time, ſhee deſireth the Emperours Maieſtie, and the reſt of the Princes and States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to giue no credite to the rumours ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by them, or by the friendes of the Romiſh Church, or by ſuch as are corrupted with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> penſions, men ſuborned of purpoſe to ſcatter theſe falſe ſurmiſes, to the ende that we being drawen to a mutual diſlike and hatred, they in the meane time may the ſooner and the more eaſily bring vs, and the Religion which we profeſſe (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) vnderfoote.</p>
            <p>And further her Maieſtie intreateth, that this heauie warre entred into with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for the mainteinance whereof no ſmall but huge ſummes are of neceſſitie required, and wherein the quarrell is not in her owne behalfe onely, but for the ſafetie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:818:11"/>
of all the Kings, Kingdoms, and Dominions of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope that profeſſe the ſinceritie of true Religion, and for that cauſe are as much hated of this Spaniſh enemie and his Romiſh Confederats, as her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is, may at the leaſt in this one thing ſeeme more tollerable, and leſſe difficult and labourious to bee continued, in not ſuffering the foreſaid <hi>Hanſe</hi> men, to tranſport to the forenamed common enemie, out of their Kingdomes, Dukedomes, Ports and Straights, any victuals or inſtruments of warre, by ordeyning ſeuere corrections vpon the rebellious and diſobedient, and ſuch as ſhall dare to attempt the contrary, and to thinke of her Maieſtie and her actions, as of a Prince moſt careful, both of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall peace of Religion, and of the ſafetie of all and ſingular Princes her Confederats, &amp; that they would by ioyning their Counſels &amp; forces in one, vſe all their power and abilitie to extinguiſh the practiſes of the Romiſh prieſthod, that ſo a ſincere, <note place="margin">The deſire of the Queenes Maieſtie for a peace through Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</note> holy, and largely extending peace, free from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, may be entred, concluded and eſtabliſhed throughout all Chriſtianitie, to the honour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and the tranquilitie of all Kings, Princes and Eſtates, with all increaſe of happines. In which cogitation, her Maieſtie moſt ſincerely and conſtantly abideth, and will not ceaſe (God bleſſing her) to remooue all impediments for her part, to procure this good effect according to her honourable deſire.</p>
            <p>But nowe hauing hitherto ſpoken of the open violence of the Spaniſh King, and the Biſhop of Rome, giue vs leaue to vſe a fewe wordes alſo of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <note place="margin">The Biſhop of Romes inuaſion of England by his Ieſuites.</note> matter not leſſe odious then the former,

conſiſting in the ſubtiltie of the litle foxe: which is a thing ſo much the more diligently to be lookt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by how much the more cloſe and ſecret it is, and a thing that creepes farre without many mens knowledge. It is that ſame priuie legation and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were in corners of certaine falſly termed Ieſuites and Seminaries into this kingdome, to withdrawe the mindes of the ſimple and ignorant people, from their duetifull obedience to the Queenes Maieſtie and the Realme. But as theſe kind of men doe ſpring of certaine runnagates, and fugitiues naturally borne Subiects, who at home, either for pouertie growe deſperate, or by reaſon of their vicious liues, could not longlie hid: ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nowe ſent home againe by the Pope, ceaſe not vnder the habite of their ſuperſtitious profeſſion to runne from houſe to houſe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Towne to Towne, ſtirring vp the people by their whiſperings to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and ſcattering certaine popiſh Buls, made and ſent for that purpoſe, teaching the people out of them, vnder the paine of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and of a curſe, that there is no hope of ſaluation remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, except they change their affections, and caſt off their due obedience to her Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of her Maieſties Subiects, which being taken with theſe Buls, and called in queſtion for the ſame, haue reuealed their practiſes: and being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a conſcience of their offence, doe returne to a better minde, and doe forſake that filthie ſinke or dunghill of the companie and opinions of Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Seminaries: are pardoned of their former tranſgreſſions, and paſſe without puniſhment: but as for thoſe that are rooted in their wickedneſſe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:818:12"/>
and remaine ſtifnecked in their offence, they being demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, whether if an inuaſion of the kingdome ſhould be made by the Biſhop of Rome or the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh King, they would (as good Subiects ought to do) ſtand for the Queene or no, they anſwere ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and proudly, that they are bound whenſoeuer it ſhould ſeeme good to the ſaid Biſhop of Rome, to <note place="margin">The manifeſt treaſon of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, againſt the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, &amp; the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> make any ſuch innaſion of the Kingdome, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of her Maieſtie, to aſſiſt and further the ſaid inuaſion, by al the wayes and meanes they can.</p>
            <p>I aske nowe of you, what Prince ſoeuer you be, hauing the authoritie of a Prince, what you would doe with ſuch monſters as theſe are, giuen ouer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort to ſuch diueliſhnes? would you ſuffer the cloke of popiſh religion and obedience, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt ſuch traytors from the ſeueritie of Iuſtice? woulde you ſuffer them to liue, that woulde you ſhould not liue? ſurely no Prince or Monarche ought or may tollerate ſuch monſtrous creatures, except he purpoſeth voluntarily to neglect good lawes, his people, kingdome, and life; and ſinne grieuouſly againſt God himſelfe. And theſe are the monſters that are in England committed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; howſoeuer the companions of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by their infamous libels ſpread amongſt the people crie out, and ſay, they ſuffer for the cauſe of Religion onely, and for their conſciences.</p>
            <p>Many of her ſubiects, and they no obſcure men, but ſome of the Nobilitie, and ſome others of the degree of knights are witneſſes, that howſoeuer they ſtand catholikely affected, yet as long as they conteine themſelues within the compaſſe of their duetie, &amp; obedience to her Maieſtie and the State,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:818:12"/>
are neither committed to priſon, nor in any ill ſort vſed, only for breaking the lawes of frequenting the Churches, are peraduenture rated at ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarie fine.</p>
            <p>The ende and purpoſe why wee ſpeake and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe things, is to let all good Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and others deſirous to know the trueth of things, vnderſtande howe and by what meanes, as openly, priuily, by force of armes, and practiſes of treacherie, the ſtate of her Maieſtie and of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is aſſaulted by the biſhop of Rome, and the Spaniſh King: and therefore howe conueniently and neceſſarily her Maieſtie is drawen to reſiſt this force and to auoyde theſe frauds, and with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious allegations the execution of lawes and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is as it were torne and rent in pieces, not only by malitious imprinted Libels, but alſo by painted tables and pictures, ſignifying I knowe not what monſtrous things, reſemblances of ſome barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous crueltie, as they falſely calumniate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, to be vſed againſt the foreſaid Ieſuites, and Seminarie Prieſts, that is to ſay, againſt men guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of high and horrible treaſon.</p>
            <p>But as for her Maieſtie, ſhe deſireth to ſtand as a perſon voide of all trueth and credite with good Princes, if ſhe euer puniſhed any of theſe men with any ſtrange or newe kinde of torment, then is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the preſcript of the ancient lawes of this Realme prouided againſt ſuch perſons, as ſhall be found and conuicted for Rebels and Traytors.</p>
