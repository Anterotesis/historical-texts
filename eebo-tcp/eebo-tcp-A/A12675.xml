         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I translated this litle

in my mynde, not only to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vnto you, but a so to dedicate it, &amp;
so publysh it fourth in your name The
author therof, called Baptista Mantua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
was an excellent Poete in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynce
of Lumbardye, brought vp in the

               </gap>e of Mantua, where as Uyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle
the famouse Poete was borne also.
And though he wer a supersticious fryre
of the secte of reformed Carmelytes, as
they there called them, yet was he a man
of most excellent learnynge in Latine,
Greke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Hebrue, &amp; smelled out more
abuses in the Romysh churche, then in
those daies he durst wele vtter, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
<pb facs="tcp:6329:3"/>
he spared not in his earnest writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges,
at times, both breuely and sharp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
to towche them.</p>
            <p>In hys fift Egloge, in declarynge the
nature of Auarice, he bryngeth in Rome
for example Rome (sayth he) rendereth
nothynge els, but very tryfles. And for
them agayne she receyueth good golde.
Uayne promyses shall ye haue there, and
nothynge els<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For alas, all that she se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

at large, that all kyndes of vyces
are at Rome muche made of, and be had
in great honour. Also in Libro .ii. Sylua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rum,
he saith: Mars is father to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
and Lupa their nource, for in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
and murther spende they all their
lyues and studie. If ye mynde to lyue
wele (sayth he) come not at Rome. For
though ye maye at Rome do all other
thynges, yet ye may not there lyue wel,
or leade an honest lyfe.</p>
            <p>In hys first boke <hi>de Sacris diebus,</hi> as
he dare, he holdeth with the maryage of
Byshoppes, and sayth: That in the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matyue
churche their lyues were muche
better, and more holye hauynge wyues,
then now hauyng none. And that it was
a more sure waie a great deale, and more

agreable wyth gods lawe, then thys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
consyderynge that God neuer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
marryage, but sanctified it. The
vnmarried state is ieopardous (he saith)
and suche a bytter yoke when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
as Christ wold neuercharge any
man with. Yea so cruell a burden, as yet
to thys daye bryngeth fourth many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
monsters (abhomynacyons he
wolde saye) and by an horrible presump<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon
was first inuented. In the xii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boke
of the same wurke he reprehendeth the
Schole doctours, for sophistically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendynge
about tryhles, and vanitees,
as was the questyon of our Ladies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepcion
amonge the orders of fryers:
and the argument of leuended or vnle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uended
breade in the sacrament, agaynst

In dyuers of hys bokes, he hath many

            <p>By this we maye wele perceyue, that

yet neuer so sore oppressed with the depe

to wake the multytude. For he
that kepeth Israel, doth neyther slu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber

thys present treatyse, that deathe is not
to be feared, whych Baptista first wrote
to a frynde of hys, a peere or senatour of
Bononye, called Iason Castelius, he
sheweth hym self no lesse dyuynely then
naturally, no lesse christenly, then poety<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cally
to handle that matter. But this I
leaue to the dyligent reader, because the

            <p>In confirmacyon of that Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rule

that fearefulnesse of thyne

my feble stomacke. Set a
part such heauinesse, considering
that deathes power extendeth
not ouer all. The more parte of
thinges created, feareth nothing
the dartes of Deathe. For God
hath graciously gyuen the chefe
Empyre to lyfe, to deathe hath
he in comparyson graunted but
a very small power. The water
and the earthe are subiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupcyon,
so are the ayre and fyre
with all those thynges who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
bringe fourth, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are made of
their mixtures. For so much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hygh heauen, and the fixed stars
therin, were created of a far other
matter, thei neuer cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
but remayne alwayes
incorruptible. And although the
creator of all thynges, beynge
an omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God, might at his
pleasure, reduce them agayne in
<pb facs="tcp:6329:7"/>
to theyr olde Chaos, or confuse
matter wythout shape. Yet wyll
not hys deuine goodnesse so do,
but of most louyng fauer he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
those his creatures, both
to liue and remaine. Yea, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
them not only to continue,
but also to mynystre theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and properties, eche one in
hys kynde, and gyueth them his
dayly strength in perfourmau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the same. The thynges which
he made durable, persyst styll in
theyr strength, and can by no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
be destroied, but must for
euer endure. The thinges which
he constituted corruptible &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
must be consumed of tyme, &amp;
so haue theyr endes by corrupci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All that is aboue the regyon

The florishinge borders of

Deathe beinge an enemye, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

are not all thynges vnder the

wythdraweth sumwhat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes

bodies of men be mortal by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion

theyr sowles a substaunce of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne
simplicite, wherby they are
immortal. Symplicite withoute

so much as it can not of it selfe be

In that place is eternal qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>et,

Uery certain is it, that the mortal
body shal return to earth, yet wil
not that slepe be continual. Our
sowles must again returne to the

restored to their righte places.
Why then doste thu folyshly fear
consyderynge that in deathe are

Yea, it will apeare a wonderfull

gyueth place to hys mortall poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

Then is stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,

For syckenesse fyrst of al beynge

shuld be ready at the walles with

God hath appointed him to haue

Deathe is a swyft flyght or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from the corruptyble body,
rather to be desyred, than to be

O folysh mynde, why sorowest
thu the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? yea, why fearest y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> death
<pb facs="tcp:6329:16"/>

experyence both the eyes and
the mouthes of them that depart
at the fearful enteraunce of death
to haue mooste wonderfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges,
Take thys for an earnest
warnynge, and be not deceyued
with so doutful similitudes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet faynt at them as doth an
olde dottynge gossyp. For take
this of me. If the sycke creatures
which are at the poynt of deathe,
do shew such terrible toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it mai
not be reckened that they come of
the extreme paines or grefes of the
body. Many vain fantasies doth
occupy the imagynacyon of the
minde, and they trouble the soule,
<pb facs="tcp:6329:17"/>
&amp; brynge the hart in much feare.
In profe of thys, we haue hearde
it ofte reported, that menne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
times in a rage, haue leaped
down from hygh hilles and depe
buyldynges to their deadly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
Thys hath only their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ymagynacyon wroughte in
them, and not the payne whych
hath come of theyr greuous sicke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
When the fyre is ones put to
the straw and the stocke through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
kyndled, thyncke heauynesse
ryghtly to be represented or syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfyed.
O mynde, why art thu so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful?
and wherfore fearest thu
deathe, forgettynge thy selfe, so
madly? O imprudent asseheade,
why louest thu that frayl body of
thyne so inordynatly: Why goest
thu so farre out of square, that thu
so much regardest thynges mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall?
<pb facs="tcp:6329:17"/>
and wylt neyther regard thy
oryginal nor yet wherto thu wert
created? whyles y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> hast a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
power, and thy first formacion
from heauen, why is it thy desyre
to dwel styll in thys earthely pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
What haste thu to do wyth
stones insensate? why settyst thu
so much by vile earthe &amp; by clay?
Thu bearest the symylytude and
true image of god. Leaue to brute
beastes thys earthly, dwellynge,
for heauen is thy due herytage.
Thys worlde is to vs, no contrey
natyue, but a very vncommody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse
exile, I pray the the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tell me,
why dost thu preferre this wylde
place of thy ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nishment, to the ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saunt
land thu art borne to? yea,
why haddest thu rather to be loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp in that darke dongio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to enioye the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modytees of that
fredome? A swete thynge were it
<pb facs="tcp:6329:18"/>
for the, from hence to be remoued
to the plesaunt socyete of the olde
holy fathers, and so to beholde
those men, which haue of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures
most worthi praises. What
syght in the worlde can be to vs
more delectable: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one place
to beholde all ages, or men of all
generacions sens the worldes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginninge?
If it chaunce to come
into thy head to feare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
of helle, or doubtest to be brent in
the burnynge lake therof? Thu
oughtest first to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydre, that god
is no enemy to vs mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Unsemynge is it that he be
reckened an vngentyll or vnmer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyful
father. As it becometh him
of his godly nature to be pityful,
so is he of vs to be reckened very
pytieful For he that thinketh him
to be without merci, doth not right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
iudge hym a father. No, no, he
<pb facs="tcp:6329:18"/>
accounteth hym to be no father.
For what mad man wold graunt
him to be a God, whom he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iust<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
denye to be mercyfull? God is
our vnyuersal goodnesse. Al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that are precyouse and hygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
to our profyt, god ministreth.
But what thyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyst thu iudge
to be more better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercy? why
sorowest thu then, thu waueringe
mynde? yea, why fearest y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> death,
forgetfull of thy self? How co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
it to passe thu dottynge fole, that
thu art so carefull for that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
bodi of thine? The high hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
loketh for the, the prynces fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myly
there doth call the by name,
and also the holy senate or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of the eternall father, do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uete
the very moche. Tell me er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
why dost thu loue thyne
own dammage? why dost thu de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syre
thyne owne hurte or decaye?
<pb facs="tcp:6329:19"/>
Dost thu not thynke that a want
or losse is a great discommodite?
Shew me by thy faith, O minde
vnquiet, why dost thu feare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to such places, where as non
are but thy fryndes? why dost thu
doubt payne? why dreadest thu
punyshmente? If thy conscience
beare the wytnesse of most gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse
synnes, and so accombre
the, repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them wyth al thy hart.
For repentaunce taketh al sinne
away. We are certaine and sure,
what the gentilnesse, the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the mercy is, of oure hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father. Yea, we perfyghtly
know it, how swiftly he will bend
hym selfe, to heare oure humble
prayers. If we do wele, we shall
gyue to God our hartes, &amp; wyth
bytter teares we shall do sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce
to hym. No offerynge in the
worlde, can be more acceptable
<pb facs="tcp:6329:19"/>
or plesaunt vnto him. If thu be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle
or lament thy synnes, such
a gentyll father hast thu, as wyll
clerely remyt them. God alone re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyreth
a contryte hart. He onlye
accepteth an humble request. God
doth not regarde the smoky sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices,
neyther yet is he pacyfyed
with aulters nor with offeringes
if the harts religion be wanting.
A yonge sprynge wyll bow wyth
a westerne winde, with a string is
a bow made croked. Fire melteth
stele, bloud breaketh an adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; god is mollified by lowlines of
the hart. Leaue your eartheli care
or study, ye most filthy bandes or
mortal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. Giue ouer thy pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

These be the thynges that
rauysh those myndes which haue
no foresyght, and throwe them in
to hel. These are the snares that
are wont to detayne vs, and lette
vs in all good workynge. O my
christen sowle, I tel thys tale to
the. Body and goodes with other
lyke, wyll perysh, as thynges cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruptyble
and mortall. Thu only
shalt contynue as a thing immor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tal.
Thu art the doughter of the
eternal god, my gentyl minde, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syre
thy fathers kingedome than
wyth a cherefull countenaunce.
Runne to thy lounig father, slyde
into his bosom, hold him, embrace
him, &amp; kisse him, for he with al his
housholde, wyll most louingly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue
the. Garlands prepare thei
to thy head, a semely white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
beutified w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stars &amp; fine gold
shall reache to thy verye feete.
<pb facs="tcp:6329:20"/>
Thu shalt wonder to behold the
innumerable multitude of sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
clappynge ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynge
at thy commynge. In such
peace and concorde agreeth the
heauenlye cytiezens, that theyr
loue ouerfloweth, as doth a great
myghty sea. The partycular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
or sygnes of honour, obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by valeauntnesse of manne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
causeth one man to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other. But loue hath
an other propertye. He suffereth
nothing to be particular. As cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, so maketh he al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all mennys needes. For
nothyng holdeth a perfyght loue
to hys owne vse only. O vndys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
mynde, why sorowest? yea,
why fearest deathe so vnwysely?
O dottynge fole, why fauourest
that vyle carrayne of thyne so
muche? Then wyth a good harte
<pb facs="tcp:6329:21"/>
and wyllyngly, ouerleape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre
