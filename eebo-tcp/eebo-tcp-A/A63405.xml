            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100184:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
having on a Blew Campaign Coat, with a Cape, and Black Campaign Peruke, and a Black Hat laced with Silver Lace, and a Silver-hilted Sword; the firſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaid, <hi>That is the Man, take good notice of him,</hi> which he did; and then the laſt Spirit vaniſhed: And <hi>Huſſey</hi> askt the firſt Spirit, who ſtill was on Horſeback, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Perſon did belong to the Army? the Spirit replied, <hi>He was daily buſling about the Court,</hi> and then the firſt Spirit vaniſhed. <hi>Huſſey</hi> writ a Relation of this under his hand (being ſeemingly very well in his Senſes), and offered to me, upon his revealing it to me, to ſwear to the truth of it. After which he ſaw the real Perſon riding with the King, which appeared to him on foot; and <hi>Huſſey</hi> would have ſeized on him, but could not come near enough to him at that time, <hi>Huſſey</hi> being on foot; but waited an opportunity to do it, ſome other time, and revealed it at the ſame time. But at One of the Clock the very next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, ſtanding Centry near the ſame place again, the firſt Spirit that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him on Horſeback before, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him on foot, and with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Countenance ſaid, <hi>Now the Buſineſs is prevented, no thanks to you; why did not you do your Duty yeſterday?</hi> and with that the Spirit hit him a blow on the back, which hath confined him to the Trench three or four days; and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaid, <hi>He is gone back to the French, but was laſt night ſhot in the Guts by an Out-Centry of theirs:</hi> And it is aſſerted by a Deſerter that came over to us that Night, That ſuch a Man ſo habited, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Spirit, was ſo ſhot by them, and hath aſſerted it: Believe it as you pleaſe, <hi>Huſſey</hi> is poſitive in the matter, and I think good to give you a Character of him my ſelf, who I have often ſounded about this Buſineſs, and neither Threats of Puniſhment, or Promiſes of Reward, can make him recant; but he ſtands to the Truth of what I have here written from his own mouth; And I think fit to add ſo much of my own knowledge of him, That ever ſince I have known him under my Command, he hath behaved himſelf with a great deal of Faithfulneſs, Courage, and Loyalty, diligent in His Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, obſerving the Commands of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and chearfully obeying them as a good Soldier ought to do, and a Fellow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neither to Malencholly, nor to much mirth, but a harmleſs good-natured Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as any I have in my Company.</p>
