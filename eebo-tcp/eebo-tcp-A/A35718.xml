         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe late Lord Strange, now Earle
of Darby, having ſtrongly beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the towne of Mancheſter in
the County Palatine of Lancaſter, and
lien before it with his Forces, to the
number of two thouſand Foot and ſix
hundred horſe, with 8. or 9. Peeces of
Ordnance, from the four and twentieth
of September to this preſent, ſince which
time many ſhot have been diſcharged
on both ſides; the Lord Strange planted
his Ordnance in two ſeverall places, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58945:3"/>
plaid very fiercely upon the Towne, and
ſo hath continued night and day ever
ſince, but hath done very little or no
harme! his Musketiers have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
furious aſſaults againſt the town, and
were as bravely withſtood by thoſe of
the towne, who moſt couragiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
their works, &amp; made good their
quarters againſt the enemy, beating
them off, and killing above an hundred
of them (among which were ſome
Commanders of note) without the loſſe
of one man.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſeeing that by force he
could not prevaile againſt the towne,
hee ſent a meſſenger to deſire <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> parley
with the inhabitants of the towne, but
they would not condeſcend unto it, till
after foure or five meſſages from his
Lordſhip, and then they agreed that
there ſhould bee a ceſſation of Armes
on both ſides, from tueſday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
till ſeven of the clock the next
day; in the mean while the L. Strange
propounded theſe demands following:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58945:3"/>
1. That they would lay downe their
armes, and deliver them up to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>2. That he might march through the
town with his Army, which were both
denied.</p>
            <p>3. That they would deliver him a
thouſand pound in money.</p>
            <p>4. Then he demanded but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Muskets.</p>
            <p>5. Seeing none of theſe would be
granted, rather then be fruſtrate in all his
demands, in his laſt meſſage he deſired
but fifty Muskets, and he would raiſe
his ſiege and leave the town.</p>
            <p>After ſome debate and ſerious conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
concerning theſe demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Commanders and common
ſouldiers, a peremptory and reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was returned his Lordſhip by the
unanimous conſent of them all, that he
ſhould not have ſo much as a ſword.
The towne hath now held out a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

an undaunted reſolution to ſtand it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

againſt him. Many of his ſouldiers run
away, and confeſſe they have neither
meat nor money, but what they get by
robbing. Captain Bradſhaw hath beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelfe moſt valiantly, to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
renown. The enemy have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their Ordnance above three
hundred times, and the Musketiers have
done what they could, and yet have we
not loſt one perſon in the fight, but a boy
unarmed ſtanding upon a ſtile, but the
