            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Tranſlation of theſe Epigramms is a thing (Reader) which I confeſſe for divers Reaſons I was leath to publiſh: One is, becauſe they are but a part of Martiall, and choſen out here and there; ſo that I am lyable to a double cenſure, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the skill in tranſlating, but the judgement in chooſing of them may be called in question. But in that caſe
<pb facs="tcp:12600:5"/>
not only Ioſeph Scaliger, who publiſhed divers of theſe Epigramms, tranſlated into Greek, but divers others, in other Languages, may in part excuſe me for meddling with a part of a Booke. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe it is more than probable, that divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have exerciſed or pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in tranſlating ſome of theſe, and may therefore peruſe mine with a more rigid cenſure. but that I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the goodneſſe of their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The third reaſon is, becauſe that having already publiſhed two Tranſlations, I was loath any more to vexe the Romane Poets (who ſhall ſleep quietly in their Vrnes hereafter for me) though Tranſlation bee a thing
<pb facs="tcp:12600:5"/>
which, I thinke, the ableſt men doe not at all condemne. Some men there are who complaine of late that too much learning is brought into our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Language, and that that is by others attained at too eaſie a rate, which coſt themſelves more labour. Thoſe (as I take it) are ſuch pretty Schollers as have rather ſtrived to get ſome skill in the Latine or Greeke tongues, than to furniſh themſelves with the ſubstance of Art, which is contained in thoſe tongues; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo much reall Learning as may commend them to the world, would faine bee applauded for the ſhadow of it: Like ſome unlearned or iniudicious Preachers in Countrey pariſhes, who
<pb facs="tcp:12600:6"/>
would rather be liked by the ignorant People for ſpeaking of Latin ſentences, than informing their knowledges with ſubstantiall Doctrine, and have the fortune to bee praiſed by none, but thoſe which doe not underſtand them: and indeed thoſe which I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved miſ-likers of Tranſlation, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfect in the Latin, nor able in their native Language. There are many things (Reader) in this Worke I doe confeſſe, which must intreat a favourable excuſe, and dare not ſtand a ſtrict cenſure; eſpecially the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramme of all, which is in the Latin both too full to be rendred in a Verſe of ten Syllables, and ſubject to divers Constructions of ſenſe: But being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated which
<pb facs="tcp:12600:6"/>
by a friend of mine to doe all the Booke of Spectacles, I could not leave out the firſt of them. Some of them have lyen many yeares by me, and were not intended for the Preſſe, and many of them in looſe Papers I have lost, and perchance thou wilt ſay (and I am of that opinion) it had beene no great matter if they had beene all lost.</p>
