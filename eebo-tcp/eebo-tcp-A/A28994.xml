         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THeſe <hi>Receipts,</hi> taken out of a large Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as conſiſting of a few ſafe Ingredients, commonly to be found at eaſie Rates in moſt places, were ſent to a learned Phyſician beyond Sea:
<pb facs="tcp:48050:3"/>
To whom they were a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Preſent, and anſwer'd, without doubt, the Ends he had in deſiring them.</p>
                  <p>That excellent Perſon, to whom theſe choice Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are owing, did permit a few Copies of them to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and was pleaſed to put them in the Hands of ſome of his Friends, provided, as there was occaſion, they would make Tryal of them, and faithſully report the Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Divers of thoſe, who on theſe Conditions had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great a Favour, held themſelves obliged to enquire for Perſons affected with any
<pb facs="tcp:48050:3"/>
of the Maladies againſt which the ſaid Medicines were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and, upon many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments carefully made, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found, that frequently they have relieved thoſe who uſed them, and ſometimes ſtrangely outdone Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with much Importunity to the Noble Author, to ſuffer Things, which were of ſuch general Benefit, and ſo eaſily to be procured by the Poor, to be made more publick.</p>
                  <p>And at length he hath been prevailed with not only to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former <hi>Receipts,</hi> which but few had ſeen, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed,
<pb facs="tcp:48050:4"/>
but hath, out of his rich Treaſury, ſtored us with a freſh Collection, which, as in Number it exceeds what we had before, ſo in Quality and Virtue it falls not ſhort of it.</p>
                  <p>And if what here, with ſuch an honeſt and kind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is offered to the Publick, be but candidly and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly receiv'd, we may ſtill hope for more Bleſſings of this ſort from him, who has not only a conſtant Will and great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do good, but hath, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, obliged the Age as much as any private Perſon in it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:48050:5"/>For Medicines ſo Simple, and for the moſt part ſo Cheap, I have found all of them to be good in their kind: And though I think moſt of them ſafer than many other Medicines that are in great Requeſt, yet I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that theſe ſhould play the Part of Medicines and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians too; but that they may be uſefully employed by one who knows how to adminiſter them diſcreetly.</p>
                  <p>I diſtinguiſh them into three Claſſes or Orders, annexing to the Title of each particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine one of the Three firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Alphabet; whereof A is the Mark of a Remedy of

the higheſt Claſſis of theſe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as very conſiderable and efficatious in its kind. <hi>B,</hi> Denotes a ſecondor inferior ſort, but yet to be valuable for their good Operations. <hi>C,</hi> belongs to thoſe Remedies that are of the loweſt Order, tho' good enough not to be diſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Receipts,</hi> which were my own, are expreſſed in my own Terms; ſo alſo thoſe which I received from others by word of Mouth: But them which were imparted to me in Writing, though I my ſelf would not have worded them, as they did that I had them from, yet I often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made a Scruple to Correct
<pb facs="tcp:48050:6"/>
or Alter their Expreſſions, tho' not ſuitable to the Current Style of the Formularies of <hi>Receipts,</hi> being more concern'd that the Meaning ſhould be cloſe kept to, than the Style rectified.</p>

For there has been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue a large Collection of Receipts, for almoſt all Diſeaſes, plac'd in Alphabetical Order; and thô theſe Receipts are Circumſtantially delivered in the Mother-Tongue of the People, yet they came not forth without the Licenſe or Authority of the Faculty of Phyſick, and were (at leaſt the firſt Tome) ſo well receiv'd and approv'd, that in divers places the reſpective Biſhops authorized them by their Publick Approbation, and recommended them upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count receiv'd, or the good Effects they had produc'd both to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charitable Perſons, and to the Curates (or Pariſh Prieſts) in their Dioceſſes.</p>
                  <p>In complying with the deſires of many, and with the Dictates of Philanthropy, I hope I may procure my Medicinal Receipts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes the more favourable Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:48050:70"/>
if I ſhew that I might juſtly have a peculiar and perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to this Work. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may think it ſtrange, as I my ſelf have been prone to do, that I ſhould preſume to recommend Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to others, who for divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Years have been ſo infirm and ſickly my ſelf. And ſome 'tis like will upbraid me with <hi>Medicoe Cura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teipſum.</hi> But on this occaſion, I may repreſent, that being the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or fourteenth Child of a Mother, that was not above 42 or 43 Years old when ſhe dyed of a Conſumption, 'tis no wonder I have not inherited a robuſt, or healthy Conſtitution. Many alſo have ſaid, in my Excuſe, as they think, that I brought my ſelf to ſo much ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by over-much Study. But I muſt add, that thô both the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Cauſes concur'd, yet I impute my infirm Condition more to a third, than to both together.
<pb facs="tcp:48050:71"/>
For the grand Original of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that have for many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, was a fall from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Horſe into a deep place, by which I was ſo bruiſed, that I feel the bad Effects of it to this day. For this Miſchance happening in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I being forc'd to take a long Journey, before I was well recovered, the bad Weather I met with, and the as bad Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Iriſh</hi> Inns, and the miſtake of an unskilful or drunken Guide, who made me wander almoſt all Night upon ſome Wild Mountains, put me into a Fever and a Dropſie, (<hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Anaſarca:</hi>) For a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Cure of which I paſt into <hi>England,</hi> and came to <hi>London;</hi> but in ſo unlucky a time, that an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition'd Fever rag'd there, and ſeiz'd on me among many others; and thô through God's goodneſs, I at length recovered, yet left me exceeding weak for a great while
<pb facs="tcp:48050:71"/>
after; and then for a farewel, it caſt me into a violent Quotidian or double Tertian Ague, with a ſenſe of decay in my Eyes, which during my long Sickneſs I had exercis'd too much upon Critical Books ſtuft with <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and other Eaſtern Characters: I will not urge that divers have wondred that a Perſon in ſuch bad Circumſtances has by the help of Care and Medicines (for they forget what ought to be aſcrib'd to God) ſhould be able to hold out ſo long againſt them. But this after the foregoing Relation may well be ſaid, that it need be no great wonder, if after ſuch a train of Miſchiefs, which was ſucceeded by a Scorbutick Cholick that ſtruck into my Limbs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of the uſe of my Hands and Feet for many Months, I have not enjoy'd much Health, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my being acquainted with ſeveral Choice Medicines; eſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:48050:72"/>
ſince divers of theſe I dare not uſe, becauſe by long ſitting, when I had the Palſie, I got the Stone, voiding ſome large ones (as well as making bloody Water) and by that Diſeaſe ſo great a tenderneſs in my Kidneys, that I can bear no Diureticks, thô of the milder ſort, and that I am forc'd to forbear ſeveral Remedies for my other Diſtempers, that I know to be good ones, and among them divers, that by God's Bleſſing, I have ſucceſsfully try'd on others. This ſhort Narrative may, I hope, ſuffice to ſhew that my Perſonal Maladies and Sicklineſs cannot rightly infer the inefficacy of the Medicines I impart or recommend, and if it ſhew That, it will do all that was aim'd at by this Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>
                  <p>If ſome Receipts or Proceſſes (for I hope they will not be many) ſhould happen to be met with in the following Collection, that may
<pb facs="tcp:48050:72"/>
be alſo found either in ſome Printed Book or other, 'tis hop'd an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader will either excuſe or pardon that Venial fault, eſpecially if we conſider, Firſt, That neither Phyſick nor Chymiſtry being my Profeſſion, I did not think my ſelf oblig'd to peruſe any ſtore of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Books, and therefore may well be ſuppos'd to be unacquainted with a great many of them, much more with many of their Receipts and Proceſſes. And indeed I find by ſome of the later Printed Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Books written about the Phyſicians Art, that there is a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them, which when I wrote, I had never ſeen, or perhaps ſo much as heard of. Secondly, That 'tis ſo uſual for Authors, eſpecially that Write either Syſtems or Collections, to ſet down ſtore of Preſcriptions dictated by their Conjectures, not their Tryals, and yet without giving a diſtinct Character of almoſt any
<pb facs="tcp:48050:73"/>
of them in particular: That if I had met there with ſome of the ſame that I am ſpeaking of, I ſhould not have ſelected them from a great number of other undiſtinguiſh'd ones; and 'tis eaſie to obſerve that there is a great deal of difference betwixt being told by an Author that many things, and among the reſt, but not before them, this or that Drug, Receipt is good for ſuch a Diſeaſe, and to have particular notice given of it, and not only to be confirm'd that 'tis good, but to be told how good it is, and poſſibly alſo that it may be uſefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in other Diſtempers beſides thoſe for which 'tis preſcrib'd in the Printed Book.</p>
                  <p>The moſt of theſe Receipts are intended chiefly for the uſe of thoſe that live in the Country, in Places where Phyſicians are ſcarce if at all to be had, eſpecially by Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And becauſe very frequently
<pb facs="tcp:48050:73"/>
a Labouring-Man, or a Handicrafts Man, or ſome Tradeſman has a whole Family depending upon him, being maintain'd by his Pains and Induſtry, and yet is diſabled to help himſelf and them, not by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diſeaſe, but by External, and often-times Accidental Maladies; ſuch as Bruiſes, Strains, Cuts, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Aches, Burns, and the like, I have been careful to furniſh this final Collection with a pretty num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Receipts, obtain'd moſt of them from able Surgeons and Practitioners for thoſe External Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that thoſe poor Upholders of Families, who cannot find or Fee a Surgeon or a Doctor, may be cheaply reliev'd without either of them.</p>
