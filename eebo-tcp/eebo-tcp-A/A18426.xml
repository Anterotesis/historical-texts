            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Brother, there is a certaine Goddesse called <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that carries a maine stroke in honourable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Fortune waits vpon her; <hi>Cupid</hi> is at her becke; shee sends them both of errands. This Deitie doth promise me much assistance in this businesse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lysand.</speaker>
                     <p>But if this Deitie should draw you vp in a basket to your Countesses window, and there let you hang for all the wits in the Towne to shoot at: how then?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Thar.</speaker>
                     <p>If shee doe, let them shoote their bolts and spare not: I haue a little Bird in a Cage here that sings me better comfort. What should be the barre? you'le say, I was Page to the Count her husband. What of that? I haue there by one foote in her fauour alreadie; Shee has taken note of my spirit, and suruaid my good parts, and the picture of them liues in her eie: which sleepe, I know, can not close, till shee haue embrac't the substance.</p>

                     <p>Why should I despaire, but that <hi>Cupid</hi> hath one dart in store for her great Ladiship, as well as for any other huge Ladie, whom she hath made stoope Gallant, to kisse their worthie followers. In a word, I am assured of my speede. Such faire attempts led by a braue resolue, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore seconded by Fortune.</p>

Countesse; that if another man of my making, and mettall, shall assault her: her eies and eares should lose their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, her other parts their vse, as if Nature had made her all in vaine, vnlesse I only had stumbl'd into her quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                     <p>Brother: I feare mee in your trauaile, you haue drunck too much of that Italian aire, that hath infected the whole masse of your ingenuous Nature; dried vp in you all sap of generous disposition, poisond the very Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of your soule, and so polluted your senses, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer enters there, takes from them contagion, and is to your fancie represented as foule and tainted, which in it selfe perhaps is spotlesse.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Thar.</speaker>
                     <p>No sister, it hath refin'd my senses, and made mee see with cleare eies, and to iudge of obiects, as they truly are, not as they seeme, and through their maske to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne the true face of thinges. It tells me how short liu'd Widdowes teares are, that their weeping is in truth but laughing vnder a Maske, that they mourne in their Gownes, and laugh in their Sleeues, all which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as a Delphian Oracle: and am resolu'd to burne in that faith. And in that resolution doe I march to the great Ladie.</p>

                     <p>No, I will performe it in the Conquerours stile. Your way is, not to winne <hi>Penelope</hi> by suite, but by surprise. The Castle's carried by a sodaine assault, that would perhaps sit out a twelue-moneths siege. It would bee a good breeding to my yong Nephew here, if hee could procure a stand at the Palace, to see with what alacritie Ile a-coast her Countesship, in what garbe I will woo her, with what facilitie I will winne her.</p>

                     <p>Because I saw <hi>Cupid</hi> shoot in my wordes, and open his wounds in her lookes. Her bloud went and came of errands betwixt her face and her heart; and these changes I can tell you are shrewd tell-tales.</p>

But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with such an affected zeale, as my minde gaue me, shee had a kinde of secret titillation to grace my poore house sometimes; but that shee fear'd a spice of the Sciatica, which as you know euer runs in the bloud.</p>

                     <p>Yes, but with a medicine ten parts more dangerous then the sicknesse: how know you strange his dotage euer was on his wife; taking speciall glorie to haue her loue and loialtie to him so renowm'd abrode. To whom shee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath vow'd constancie after life, till her owne death had brought forsooth, her widdow-troth to bed.

                     <p>Thankes for this newes i' faith. This may perhaps proue happie to my Nephew. Truth is I loue my sister well and must acknowledge her more then ordinarie vertues. But shee hath so possest my brothers heart with vowes, and disauowings, seal'd with oathes of second nuptialls; as in that confidence, hee hath inuested her in all his state, the ancient inheritance of our Familie: and left my Nephew and the rest to hang vpon her pure deuotion; so as he dead, and shee matching (as I am resolu'd shee will) with some yong Prodigall; what must ensue, but her post-issue beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd, and our house alreadie sinking, buried quick in ruin. But this triall may remoue it, and since tis come to this; marke but the issue <hi>Lycus,</hi> for all these solemne vowes, if I doe not make her proue in the handling as weake as a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; say I lost my time in trauaile.

                     <p>Faith fellow <hi>Lycus,</hi> if my wager were weakely built, this vnexpected accident might stagger it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the truth is, this strain is extraordinarie, to follow her husbands bodie into the Tombe, and there for his companie to burie her selfe quick: it's new and stirring, but for all this, Ile not despaire of my wager.</p>

                     <p>All's one for that, What I thinke I thinke; In the meane time forget not to write to my Brother, how the plot hath succeeded, that the newes of his death hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; a funerall solemnitie perform'd, his suppos'd Corse bestow'd in the monument of our Familie, thou and I hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible mourners: But aboue all that his intollerable vertuous Widow, for his loue; (and for her loue) <hi>Ero</hi> her hand-maid, are discended with his Corse into the vault; There wipe their eies time out of minde, drinke nothing but their own teares, and by this time are almost dead with famine.

                     <p>Well, this newes will absolutely purge that humor. Write all, forget not to describe her passion at thy discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his slaughter: did shee performe it well for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands wager?</p>

                     <p>Performe it, call you it? you may iest; men hunt Hares to death for their sports, but the poore beasts die in earnest: you wager of her passions for your pleasure, but shee takes little pleasure in those earnest passions. I neuer saw such an extasie of sorrow, since I knew the name of
<pb facs="tcp:8152:25"/>
sorrow. Her hands flew vp to her head like Furies, hid all her beauties in her discheuel'd haire, &amp; wept as she would turne fountaine. I would you and her husband had beene behind the Arras but to haue heard her. I assure you Sir, I was so transported with the spectacle, that in despight of my discretion, I was forc't to turne woman, and beare a part with her. Humanitie broke loose from my heart, and stream'd through mine eies.</p>

                     <l>This straine of mourning with Sepulcher, like an ouer-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Actor, affects grosly, and is indeede so farre forc't from the life, that it bewraies it selfe to be altogether artificiall.</l>
                     <l>To set open a shop of mourning! Tis palpable.</l>

                     <p>For this does shee looke to bee Deified, to haue Hymnes made of her, nay to her: The Tomb where she is to be no more reputed the ancient monument of our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the <hi>Lysandri</hi>; but the new erected Altar of <hi>Cynthia</hi>: To which all the Paphian widdowes shall after their husbands Funeralls, offer their wet muckinders, for monuments of the danger they haue past, as Sea-men doe their wet gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at <hi>Neptunes</hi> Temple after a ship wracke.</p>

                     <p>Well, Ile apprehend you, at your pleasure: I for my part will say; that if her faith bee as constant as her loue is heartie, and vnaffected, her vertues may iustly challenge a Deitie to enshrine them.</p>

                     <p>I, there's an other point too. But one of those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is enough at once. All natures are not capable of all gifts. If the braine of the West, were in the heads of the learned; then might Parish-Clerkes be common counsaile men, and Poets Aldermens deputies. My sister may turne <hi>Niobe</hi> for loue; but till <hi>Niobe</hi> bee turn'd to a Marble, Ile not despaire but shee may proue a woman. Let the triall runne on, if shee doe not out-runne it, Ile say Poets are no Prophets, Prognosticators are but Mountibankes, &amp; none tell true but wood-mongers.

This negligence will by the Gouernour be wholly cast on me, he hereby will suggest to the Viceroy, that the Citie guards are very caresly attended.

Well, my mind must stoope to his high place, and learne within it selfe to seuer him from that, and to adore Authoritie the Goddesse, how euer borne by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie beast; and let the Beasts dull apprehension take the honour done to <hi>Isis,</hi> done to himselfe.
