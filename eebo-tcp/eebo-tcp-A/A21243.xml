            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if thei would be in dede, as

their cure vnserued? How
thynke they that they may

But only (as the wisest could

that if he had knowledge of

of the three diuine vertues,

And against all conscience &amp;

It is not vnknowen, thear

taught GOD wot as they

which thyng toward

And as for the residue (me

thei kepe them at home, and

vpon how mooch thei haue

Bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est sperare i dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o,<note place="margin">Psal. cxvii.</note> quàm
sperare in pricipibus. Thei see
that we see, their world will

whisper in corners for eas of
their harts: but thei flok not
in assembles, for consultacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and counsaill. And those of
them that haue cause to cum
abrode, me thinks I sai I see,
how thei leaue of their ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets

or cloke them for rain,
put their tippets in their

and woofully bewail them,
that euer the Deuill had so

being thus sorily beested, and
in this case of care, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how little manhod it is
to strike at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ar doun

rather regard, that as at the

Gods grace) of cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours,

<pb facs="tcp:12054:37"/>
if we regard our religion, &amp;
be as we shoold be, we ought
no lesse to looue, then our oun

haue in mynde, not what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
thei haue doon or what
thei haue deserued, but what
is our dutie and how we
woold be delt with all our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
Euen like also as (if I

wish the Quenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
to shew foorth &amp; extend
her Princely pitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them

<pb facs="tcp:12054:38"/>
again: how easy, how
slipper, how wretched, how
wicked it is for man to erre &amp;
offende: and how harde, how
magnific, how princely and
diuine it is, to doo vertue &amp;
forgiue repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunt offenders.
How well it agreeth with
her sex, for a vertuous virgin
to be pitifull vpon her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
subiectes. With her estate
of a Queene to be mercifull.
With her highnes profession
of a Christen Prince &amp; no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
to be charitable. That
had neuer been their heinous
offences, then shoold her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
mercie neuer had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whearupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so Princely to

that as thear shall be found
but few amoong them, but
<pb facs="tcp:12054:38"/>
will be content to renounce
their vnlaufull obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued I a great hope, that
vpon cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of mercy, and for
gettyng of their fauts, thei
will redily returne to their

amoongst vs again, cast vp
their wicked Papisticall he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
&amp; forsake that scisme
and diuision fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging
<pb facs="tcp:12054:39"/>
(as with true catholik
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent afore tyme thei haue)
one God, one faith, one obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and one supreme hed
vnder Christ, of thesame his

the Prince of this realm the
Quenes Maiestie that now
is, or her Uicegerent in that

her highnes shall finde I
hope, thei will shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

it, or hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry to haue. Yea, thei
will preach I warraunt (if it
pleas her to trust them) the
pure &amp; perfit doctrine again.
And none of likelihod, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

ran out of the flock. And pity
wear it to lose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus might
be saued, so that consideryng
what vse may cum of them,
ones more to try them me
thinks wear not amisse: since
in deed if thei preach well, thei
may doo mooch good, if they
preach ill thei must look to
make aunswer. and surety
is thear inough of them, for
thei can not start, and I hard
ones olde Roch Alderman of

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12054:40"/>Now to conclude (for right
loth wear I to make ye wery
with sittyng) since it hath
pleased Gods allmighty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
thus mercifull to haue
hilde his holly hand ouer vs,
as to haue calld to his grace
the late Quene. The wicked

bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as afore is said) first to

to raise vp religions

thei the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues so to triumph,
and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nize ouer the worlde

and ended at last with forcing
