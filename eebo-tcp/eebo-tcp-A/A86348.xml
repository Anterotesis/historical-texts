            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>VVHether theſe or ſuch like Prophecies be of God, and proceed from the Holy Ghoſt or no, let the godly judge. But ſurely it is commonly ſeene, when God will ſhew his diſpleaſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and intendeth to bring to paſſe ſome great act, that all creatures doe Prophecy before, and give warning, although it helpe but little.

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ophecy it before but it availed not. Chriſt himſelfe had breathed it unto them. The Apoſtles had warned them thereof. They heard voyces in the Temple. They ſaw ſignes in the Element. They heard battels in the clouds. Mad men, and ſuch as were out of their wits, did prophecy it unto them, but all theſe ſignes prevailed not, they ſaw it in act and yet it preuailed not. They might have remedied it, if they would have ſuffered the Emperour to rule over them, but all prevailed nothing, for they were deſtroyed becauſe they diſpiſed Gods word.</p>
            <p>Even ſo ſhall it happen unto the Papiſts alſo. It is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied unto them by <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>7.</hi> and <hi>8.</hi> chap. Jt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied unto them by <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the <hi>11.</hi> chap. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by St. <hi>John</hi> in the Revel. It is prophecied unto them by Chriſt himſelfe, Matth. <hi>24.</hi> It is prophecied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by St. <hi>Paul. 2</hi> Theſ. <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>4.</hi> It is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied unto them by St. <hi>Pet. 2.</hi> It prevaileth not Their owne Biſhops, Abbots, Monkes and Nunnes prophecy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but it prevaileth not. Jt is prophecied unto them by Aſtronomers. It is prophecied unto them by the common
<pb facs="tcp:156396:3"/>rumour with certaine Proverbes. It is prophecied vnto them by viſions and ſignes in the Element, but all prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, they might turne it, if they would not preſume to be aboue Gods Word and mens conſciences, but would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God and his trueth to raigne over them and all mens conſciences, but all prevaileth nothing, Therefore muſt they be deſtroyed, there is no remedie, &amp; that which they will not now, they muſt not ſee to their griefe at laſt, when all helpe is paſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let no good Chriſtian grieue himſelfe with them, but rather ſuffer and take patience, and pray to God that it would pleaſe him to revenge the blood of his Saints, and ſpeedily to deliver us from theſe cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, &amp; all their miſchievous or rather helliſh enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thereby ſhall a man get a greater conqueſt over them, then by Sword and Armour. God knoweth well where ſuch a <hi>Titus</hi> is, as ſhall be the finall deſtruction of theſe arrogant Rabbies, or contemptuous Iewes alſo. To whom be all honour, praiſe, and glory, for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

            <head>The Prophecie of <hi>HILGARD.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALl worldly Princes and the common people alſo, ſhall fiercely fall upon you Prieſts, which hitherto haue abuſed me. They will turne you away from them, and put you to flight. They ſhall take away your ſubſtance and riches, becauſe that in your time, you have not kept the order of your Prieſthood well. Theſe words will they ſpeake by you. Let us caſt theſe Oath-breakers, robbers, and people repleniſhed with all kind of iniquity, forth of the holy Catholique
<pb facs="tcp:156396:3"/>Church: for the holy Church is contaminated and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by them. And therefore will God ſuffer alſo ſuch things to come over you. Yea, the Kings of the world, ſhall aſſiſt them with their earthly power and might that ſhall withſtand you. Your Prieſtly dignity and annointing, they will eſteeme as nothing worth, and to that purpoſe will they gather together in Councell, that they may drive you out of their Dominions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have driven away the moſt holy and innocent Lambe from you, with your vngodly and abhominable workes. Then ſhall the Heavens raine downe divers Plagues, which ſhall be as a revenge of God upon men. The miſte ſhall cover the whole Earth, ſo that all your graſſe ſhall dry up, and your ornaments become pale. The deepe ſhall ſuffer Earthquakes, and then ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the very anger of God, and the rage both of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. God will ſend a righteous and ſtraight judgement againſt the tranſgreſſors of Righteouſneſſe. And then ſhall we ſay altogether. How long ſhall we forbeare and ſuffer theſe ravening Wolves? they ought to have bin feeders of the ſoules, but they be deſtroyers of them. They bind and vnbind at their owne pleaſure (yet ſuch power belongeth not unto them) and as moſt fearefull beaſts they utterly caſt us away. And thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine we ſtill in our miſery and they in their ſins, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all Chriſtendome periſherh through them. And whatſoever is right that write they not, but wreſt, and onely doe that which is contrary to the Law of God. They devoure us, as the Wolfe devoureth the ſheepe, they live continually in luſt and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, they bee very robbers of the Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:156396:4"/>whatſoever they can catch or come by, they take and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure it. They make us alſo with their occupation poore and beggerly. They damne themſelves &amp; deſire to deſtroy us alſo. Therefore will we judge them righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, anb ſeperate them from vs, for they be rather ſeducers then teachers, &amp;c. Yet care they not for it, but remaine ſo ſtill, ſeeking to make all Kingdomes ſubject unto them. Nevertheleſſe, for all this they muſt away, and leaue behind them all that they have, neyther ſhall they afterward rule any more ouer the people againe, with Lands, Poſſeſſions, Vineyards, and other temporall goods, which worldly Princes be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for. A Pope ſhould be a Pope, a Knight a Knight, a Gentleman a Gentleman, wherefore all ſuch things as they poſſeſſe vnrighteouſly, ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them. &amp;c. But againſt the ſame will the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualtie as heads of this world repine and rebell: to wit, the Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, Abbats, and other Prelates. Firſt with their curſe, and with ſhutting up of the Heavens, but the ſame will not ſerve, neither ſhall men feare it any whit. After that, they will get them to their Armour and weapons, thinking therewith to defend themſelves, but againſt the judgement of God they can doe nothing, for their time is come, &amp;c.

            <p>Theſe be the true ſeruants which Chriſt ſpeaketh of, which in due time ſet forth the gifts and glory or the Father of the houſhold, and not their owne traditions, whereof as yet the whole world is full.

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>DIvers other like Prophecies there are no whit neceſſary to be written, becauſe I hope there will amendment follow after this, except the Readers be found to want the chiefe effects of their eies and eares: for whom would not this ancient, true, and faithfull declaration of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> ſtrumpet, bring to converſion and knowledge? Shee is here ſo clerely ſet forth and painted with all her falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and colours, that it cannot be done more liuely. Hath ſhe not with her Challice made drunke, and with her ſubtilty and deceit overcome Emperors, Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Lords? and with her ſnares overthrowne all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome? Let euery man marke it well. When did they any other thing but Pole and ſhave, lye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, burne, and banne, continually increaſing warres and murder? untill ſuch time as they were become heads of all Kingdomes. &amp;c. The ſame (as aboue mentioned) hath endured many yeares, but now will take an end. For the time of the Whore is come about, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that ſpeaketh in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> ſaying: <hi>I am Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
<pb facs="tcp:156396:5"/>and Omega, the beginning &amp; the ending, the firſt &amp; the laſt.</hi> Bleſſed be they that follow his Commandements, to the end that they may come to the tree of life, and and enter in at thoſe ſtraight gates of the celeſtiall <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> out of which ſhall be ſecluded all Vnbeleeuers, Enchaunters, Whores, murderers, Idolators, and all ſuch as loue and follow after lyes, whoſe portion is in the unquenchable Lake that burneth with fire and Brimſtone.</p>
               <p>Now hath Jeſus Chriſt ſent his Angell againe, to ſhew the people that he is the very roote of <hi>David,</hi> and the cleere morning Starre, and in none other is there any ſaluation, but in him onely, for it is written. There is no other name vnder heauen whereby we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but this onely. &amp;c. Now he that is faithfull ſtill, he that is holy, let him become more holy, and continue to the end. and let him not long for the time appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. And thus let every man be warned, for when he knocketh, happy are they that open, but to thoſe that doe not ſo, the danger is apparent: for unto ſuch, both Baptiſme and all holy Rites are miniſtred in vaine. Wherefore let us beware of beeing Chriſtians onely in name, and let us pray God to bleſſe us, and to grant us his grace, and that he would vouchſafe to guide us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by his holy Spirit. <hi>Amen.</hi>
