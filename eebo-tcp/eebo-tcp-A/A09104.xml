            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A</hi> COMPARISON OF A <hi>TRVE ROMAN</hi> CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIKE WITH A PROTESTANT, whereby may be discouered the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Spirits, not only in things <hi>belonging to faith and beleefe, but also concerning their liues, conuersations</hi> and manners: taken out of a more ample discourse of this subiect, <hi>made by that worthy and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father,</hi> F.

            <p>FIRST the Roman Catholike <note place="margin">A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of a true Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like with a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantin matter of doctrine.</note> (whom <hi>Fox</hi> calleth Papist) tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching matters of Faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, composeth himselfe to that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as whether he bee learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, or what arguments soeuer hee hath on the one or other side: yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth hee to determine nothing of himselfe, but remitteth that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (if any thing be doubtfull or vndetermined) vnto the judgement
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20478:3"/>
and decree of the vniuersall Church, and Gouernours thereof. And hence proceedeth the agreements and vnitie of Faith, which they haue held and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in so large a body, for so many ages, as haue passed since Christ and his Apostles. Whereas Protestants in this behalfe following another Spirit of selfe-will, and selfe judgement, and loosing the raynes of libertie to the pregnancie of each mans wit, doe hold and determine what their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the time doe thinke to bee true, or most probable, and are subject to no authoritie in this behalfe, but to their owne Spirit; which is variable, according to the varietie of arguments and probabilities that doe occurre. And hereof doe ensue the great varietie of sects and opinions among them, euen in this one age since they began, as you may see by that which is set downe in the third and seuenteenth Chapters of the fourth part of the three Conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of England.</p>
            <p>Next to this, for so much as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to life and actions; the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like man holdeth that wee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20478:3"/>
at all of our selues, no not so much as to thinke a good thought, but we must be preuented and assisted by Gods holy grace, as may bee shewed out of the Councell of Trent, which teacheth with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rid. Sess. 6. cap. 16.</note> is of Christ; yet is the force of this grace so tempered notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as it vseth no violence, nor exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the free concurrance of mans wil, preuented and stirred vp by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said grace of our Sauiour, and motion of the holy Ghost: So as freely by this helpe, we yeeld to the said good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doe beleeue in God, and his promises: and this act of Faith (as you may learne out of the said Councel) is the first foundation and root of all our <note place="margin">Sess. 6. c. 8.</note> justification: but yet not sufficient of it selfe, except Charitie and Hope (two other Theologicall vertues) doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the same; so as we doe both loue and hope in him, in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. And out of these, and by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of these, doe flow againe other Christian vertues, called morall: for that they appertaine to the direction of life and manners, which vertues doe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20478:4"/>
consist principally in the inward habits and actes of the mind, and from thence doe proceede to the externall actions and operations, whereby wee exercise our selues in keeping Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and exercising workes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie toward our neighbour, as cloathing the naked, feeding the hungry, visiting <note place="margin">External actions flowing of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> the sicke, and the like. In workes of deuotion in like maner, as singing, and praying to God, kneeling, knocking our breasts, mortifying our bodies, by fasting, watching, and other such like. All which exteriour actions are so farre forth commendable and meritorious, as they proceed from the inward ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and motions of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>And albeit (as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> saith) these exteriour actes doe adde nothing <note place="margin">S. Tho. 1. 2. q. 20. art. 4.</note> in substantiall goodnesse to the inward acts, but haue their merit from thence; yet, for that man consisteth both of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and flesh, it was reason that hee should bee bound to honor God with both, that is to say, both with inward acts of vertue, proceeding from Gods grace and motion, and with outward vertuous actes, testifying the inward,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20478:4"/>
whereby wee see what an excellent Christian Common-wealth the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion doth appoint, if it were executed according to her doctrine, to wit, that all mens minds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with all sort of vertues, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both God &amp; our neighbor, and that their actions should be full of all righteousnesse, pietie and charitie in exteriour behauiour, so as neither in thought, word, nor deede they should offend either of them both. And thus much for the Catholike man, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his actions, life and manners.</p>
            <p>But this Catholike Religion doth not stay heere, nor teach onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall what actions a Christian man should haue, and from what internall principles of grace and vertue they should flow, but doth offer vs diuers particular means also how to procure, <note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine of seuen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their vse.</note> and conserue, and increase this grace, which is the fountaine of al goodnesse: for first, it exhibiteth vnto vs, besides all other meanes of prayer, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular indeauours of our part, seuen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall meanes and instruments left vs to that purpose, by the institution of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20478:5"/>
Christ himselfe, which are seuen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that being receiued with due disposition of the receiuer, doe alwaies bring grace by the vertue and force of Christs merit and institution, without dependance of the merit, or demerit of the Minister that administreth them. By vse of which Sacraments, infinite grace is deriued daily by Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vnto his Church, and particular members thereof, in euery state and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of men.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, Catholike Religion not contented with these generalities, doth <note place="margin">The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man from his Baptisme vntill his death, by helpe of diuers Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Baptisme.</hi>

Esa. &amp; ep. 8. ad Demetr.</note> second table or planke, whereon wee may lay hands, and escape drowning, after the shipwracke of our pardon, <note place="margin">Pacian. ep. 1. ad Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pron.</note> grace and justification receiued in our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which was the first table: by which second table of <hi>Penance,</hi> all sorts may rise againe how often soeuer they fall; which Sacrament consisteth of three parts, sorrow for our sinnes, and confessing the same, for the remission <note place="margin">Contrition Confession Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> of the guilt, and some kinde of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on our behalfe, for remouing the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20478:6"/>
temporall punishment remaining: the true vse whereof bringeth such excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding helpe and comfort to a Christian soule, as it is vnspeakable. For that by the first two parts a man is oft brought sweetly to sorrow for his sins, to thinke vpon them, to detest them, aske pardon of God for them, to make new purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of better life for the time to come, to examine his conscience more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and other such heauenly effects as no man can tell the comfort thereof, but he that receiueth them.</p>
            <p>By the third part also, which is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> though a man performe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The force of <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </note> so little thereof in this life, yet doth it greatly auaile him, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the grateful acceptation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at Gods hands, for that it commeth freely of his owne good will, but also for that it humbleth euen the proudest minde in the sight of almightie God: it restraineth also greatly our wicked appetites from sin for the time to come, when we know wee must giue a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account, and satisfie also for our sensualities somewhat euen in this world. And finally, it is the very chiefe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20478:6"/>
sinew of Christian conuersation and behauiour one towards another: for when the rich man knoweth (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sake) that he must satisfie one way or another, and be bound by his ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father to make restitution so farre, as hee is able, of whatsoeuer hee hath wrongfully taken from the poor, when the poore also are taught that they must doe the like towards the rich, the sonne towards his father, the seruant towards his master, if hee haue deceiued him; when the murmurer in like manner knoweth that he must make actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of fame (if he haue defamed any) this Catholike doctrine, I say, and practise, must needs be a strong hedge to all vertuous and pious conuersation among men, that beleeue and follow the same.</p>
            <p>And finally, not to passe to more particularities, whereas Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine teacheth vs, that all or most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of this life in a sensuall man (to omit the infirmities of our higher powers in like manner) doe proceede originally from the fountaine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,</hi> and law of the flesh remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <hi>certamen,</hi> as holy Fathers do tearme it, that is to say, for our conflict and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, to the end our life may be a true warfare, as the holy Scripture calleth it. This Concupiscence, I say, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall motion, being the ground of our temptations, though it be not sinne of it selfe, except we consent vnto it, yet is shee busie in stirring vs daily to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse; as a Christian mans principall exercise, and diligence, ought to be in resisting her, which he may doe by the helpe and assistance of Christs grace, (merited by his sacred Passion) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he extinguished the guilt of this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, though hee left still the sting and prouocation for our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter merit, and continuall victory by his holy grace, in them that will striue and fight, as they may and ought to doe.</p>

of their Lord and Sauiour. By all which helpes, assistances, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deliuered in this behalfe by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine, to euery mans state and degree of life, a Catholike Christian passeth on more securely during his life, and at his last going out of this world, receiueth finally the grace and comfort of the last Sacrament of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame vnction,</hi> instituted by Christ, and <note place="margin">Extreame vnction. Iames 5.</note> recommended vnto vs by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Apostle; and from thence passeth to receiue that eternall joy and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at his Sauiours hands, which hee hath prepared for them that beleeue in him, and striue and fight for him in this life against sinne and iniquitie.</p>
            <p>And thus haue we described brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but seriously and truely, the state and condition of a Roman Catholike man, to oppose the same against a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous vaine definition, or rather ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of IOHN FOX. But now if wee would paragon the same with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Doctrine and practise, in all these points before mentioned, we shal quickly see the difference. And as for the first point of all, concerning Faith
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20478:8"/>
and beleefe in generall, the difference is so palpably set downe in that which hath bin alreadie said, as it is needlefse to say any more.</p>
            <p>In the second point concerning the inward principles of our outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the foresaid Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with that of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> truth it is, that they agree with vs in somewhat, to wit, that all good commeth originally from Gods holy grace and motion; but presently they disagree againe, for that they hold our grace of Iustification to be no inherent qualitie, but onely an externall impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that Gods motion to our minde is such, as it excludeth wholly all concourse and cooperation of our Free-will, whereby they cut off at one blow, all endeauours of our part to do any goodnesse at all, and leaue vs as a stone or blocke to be moued by God onely, whereof also ensueth, that hee must needs be author of our sins, and other blasphemies, and infinite incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, not only in matter of Faith, but in life and actions also; for that this principle being once receiued, that our Free-will, though it be preuented, mooued and strengthened by Gods
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20478:9"/>
grace, can doe nothing at all, nor coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate to any good worke, or resist any euill: who will haue care afterward to endeauour, labour, striue, or wearie himselfe about any thing that is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, or displeasant vnto him?</p>
            <p>Next to this, concerning the vertues Theologicall, of Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Protestants are content with Faith only to our justification, as you see by <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> who saith that the Scriptures <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ox. p. 22.</note> doe expresly exclude both Hope and Charitie. And albeit some others of his sect will seeme to couer the matter, by <note place="margin">Cap. pro <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed.</note> saying, that Hope and Charitie do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Faith as fruits thereof, if it be true Faith; yet in practise is there no man of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed, that will permit his faith to this triall: but whether he haue these fruits or noe, he will defend his faith to be good, and that himselfe is justified thereby. So as from hence you see an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other gappe opened to all presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and liberty of life: for howsoeuer a Protestant liueth, yet will he not yeeld thereby that his faith is nought (and indeed the argument inforceth it not) and then followeth it, that his faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20478:9"/>
good, hee is justified, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, howsoeuer he liue, yet is hee a just man, and who will trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the labour of a good life, if beleeuing onely be sufficient. And this for internall vertues.</p>
            <p>But as for externall actions, euen those of the Law and ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments commanded by Christ himselfe, <hi>Fox</hi> derideth them in our people, as may be seene in his Definition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth onely two exteriour actions in his people, to wit, <hi>Baptizing</hi> and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or celebrating the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> for all other matters, hee saith, no one thing is necessary for the exercise of his new Gospell, or to make a perfect Christian after his definition. So as if you lay before you two sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the one labouring and wholly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupying themselues in all godly life, <hi>fructificantes in omni bono opere,</hi> fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <note place="margin">Coloss. 1. vers. 10.</note> in all good workes (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words are, who also in the same place calleth this worke, The true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and right vnderstanding of Gods heauenly will, and worthie walking before him:) you may behold, I say,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20478:10"/>
the one sort of these people, which <hi>Fox</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exercises of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in good workes.</note> calleth Papists, not onely endued with inward good desires, but externally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so busied altogether in good deeds, shewing the same by the fruits of their inward vertues, to wit, in building of Churches, Hospitals, Monasteries, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, giuing almes, maintaining Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, Widdowes and Pupills, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Pilgrimes, and other such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an exercises, as also meeting at Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, praying on their knees, sighing and sobbing for their sinnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the same to Gods substitute, to wit, their ghostly father, asking pardon also of their neighbours, and making restitution, if any thing with euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science they haue taken or withholden, &amp;c. Whiles in the meane space, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort accounted Saints of the new making by <hi>Fox,</hi> doe walke vp and downe, talking of their beleefe, but lay their hands vpon no good external worke at all by obligation, if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <hi>Fox,</hi> except onely the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> nor is it incident to their vocation. And hereby also may we consider, how great a difference there is betweene
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20478:10"/>
these two sorts of people in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, where they liue together, and what an infinite gate is laid open by this loosse new doctrine, to idlenes and lasie behauiour in Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, quite opposite not onely to the doctrine and practise of ancient Fathers, and the Primitiue Church, but to the whole course of Scriptures, in like manner, which euery where doe inculcate with all sollicitude, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual performance of externall good works, and that thereby indeed true Christians are knowne, in exercising themselues in Christs Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements.</p>
            <p>And as for Sacraments, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our doctrine, are heauenly <note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof.</note> conduites and most excellent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, appointed by God, for deriuing of grace vnto vs in euery state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Christian men; these fellowes doe first cut off fiue of the seuen, and the other two they doe so weaken and debase, as they are scarce worthy the receiuing: for they doe not hold, that either their <hi>Baptisme,</hi> or the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> doth giue any grace at all to him that receiueth them, though hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20478:11"/>
himselfe neuer so well thereunto, but onely that they are certaine signes of their election &amp; justification, which signes notwithstanding, hauing no more certaintie in them, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues list to apprehend by their special faith, concerning their owne justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the matter standing in their owne hands to shew themselues justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when they will; by these signes it seemeth indeed to be a very jest or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but yet breaketh down a maine bank of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> discipline, care &amp; sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, that is to be seene in our men, when they receiue any Sacrament, for that beleeuing (as Catholique Faith teacheth them) that all Sacraments bring grace to them, that receiue them with due preparation, and of their own part, put no let by their indisposition; they doe labour and endeauour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> themselues worthily, to the said receiuing therof, by Penance, Fasting, Prayer, Almes-deeds, and other like holy endeauours, assuring themselues also on the contrary side, that negligent receiuing of Sacraments doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not bring grace, but encreaseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20478:11"/>
their owne offence. So as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Catholike people to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of Sacraments, is a continuall kinde of spurre to good purposes, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and renouation of life: whereas this other sort of good fellowes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading themselues that their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are onely bare signes of things already past; and as it were, a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all representation of justification alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die receiued, there needeth not any such laborsome indeauour for due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, nor yet care or sollicitude of life or manners; for that alreadie they haue the thing, which they desire, and that those are but signes, tokens and testimonies that they haue receiued it indeed, which yet, as I said, hath no more assurance, then euery mans owne perswasion and apprehension will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
            <p>Lastly, concerning the foresaid fountaine of temptation in our flesh and sensualitie, called <hi>Concupiscence:</hi> they differ from vs in two essentiall points: first, that they hold this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, not for a tempter onely, but rather for a conqueror, for so much as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20478:12"/>
they teach that euery motion of her to sensualitie in vs, is a finne, whether it bee yeelded vnto by our will or noe. The second point following necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refisting of our Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.</note> of this first, is, that all resistance of our part to the motions of this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, is either needlesse or boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; for that the motion it selfe being sinne without our consent, it followeth consequently, that the matter is not remediable by our endeauours; and heere now breaketh in a whole sea of disorders to Christian life, for that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing first, that which is most true, that euery Christian man hath this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of concupiscence within him; and secondly, by this new doctrine, that no man can auoid to sinne thereby vpon euery motion that is offered, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or what auaileth any resistance of ours, or any conflict to the contrary? sinne it is, though we resist neuer so much, and but sinne it is, if we yeelde. And seeing that by another principle of this new doctrine, all sinnes are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually mortall, what is gained by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or what is lost by yeelding? And to what end are all those large Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20478:12"/>
of ancient Fathers, about fighting against this concupiscence, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of her appetites and motions? What doe auaile all their exhortations to this purpose, as also those of the Scriptures, to continencie, chastitie, virginitie, abstinence, sobrietie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vertues; for so much as euery first motion of our concupiscence to the contrary (which first motion wee cannot auoid) is sin in it selfe, to what purpose (I say) are wo perswaded and animated, to fight and striue against this enemie, seeing there is no hope of victorie, but that at euery blow shee conquereth and ouerthroweth vs, as the Protestants teach?</p>
            <p>Wherefore to proceed no further in this comparison, you may easily by this, that is said, consider the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">Fiue principal inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, brought in by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> these two people, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, you may with griefe and teares contemplate among other points, fiue generall inundations of loosenesse and wicked liberty, brought into Christian conuersation, by the foresaid fiue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of these mens doctrine, to wit: First, in taking away wholly all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20478:13"/>
and good endeauors of mans will to any vertuous action whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, though neuer so much preuented or assisted by the helpe of Gods grace. Secondly, in ascribing all justificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> onely Faith, and thereby moouing the concurrance of Hope, Charitie, Piety, Deuotion, and other vertues. Thirdly, in disgracing and denying the necessity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the exercise of externall good workes, proceeding from those inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vertues, and commended vnto vs to walke therein. Fourthly, in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the force, dignity, and number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Sacraments, appointed for instruments and conduites of Gods holy grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all sorts of men. And lastly, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a kingdome of sinne irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable to our concupiscence, in fauour of temptations and sensuall motions, and discomforting thereby all people from fighting against the same.</p>
            <p>Which fiue principles being well weighed &amp; considered, together with the practise and successe that haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued vpon them throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where this new doctrine hath preuailed; no indifferent man can bee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20478:13"/>
so simple, but that he will easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the true difference betweene these two people, and their Religions; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so betweene <hi>Fox</hi> his lying fond Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Catholike, and this our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Catholikes &amp; Protestants, containing the most substantiall points of Faith, and life, both of the one and the other.</p>

               <hi>NOW</hi> because I haue mentioned <hi>IOHN FOX,</hi> I would desire thee (good Reader) to reade that learned Treatise of <hi>Three Conuersions,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the third part, wherein <hi>IOHN FOX</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The 17.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20478:14"/>
and herefies; but howsoeuer, if they spake freely against the Pope, or floutly denied but one article of the Catholike Faith, for which they haue been condemned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes by our Church, they were presently accounted for right good Protestants, and fit for <hi>IOHN FOX</hi> to Canonize and make Martyrs. Of this that worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the foresaid Treatise sheweth briefely in a Consideration which hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, what sort of people be put by <hi>IOHN FOX</hi> into his Kalendar.</p>
            <p>It is then to be noted (saith hee) that <note place="margin">Three Conuers. part. 3. chap. 17. n. 6.</note> in the Kalendar and story thereof (to wit, <hi>FOX</hi> his <hi>Actes</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi>) are comprised all the heads of Factions and Sects that haue been different from the knowne Catholike Religion, and among themselues for these three or foure last hundred yeares, as <hi>Waldo</hi> of Lyons, and his <hi>Waldensians,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Tholosa,</hi> and his <hi>Albigensians, Iohn Wickliffe</hi> of England, and his <hi>Wickliffians, Iohn Husse</hi> of Bemeland, and his <hi>Hussites, Iohn Zisca</hi> of the same Nation, and his <hi>Thaborites, Walter Lollard</hi> in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and his <hi>Lolardians:</hi> and in our daies, <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and his <hi>Lutherans,</hi> both

            <p>And whereas we that follow Catholike doctrine, are so exact for holding vnitie therein, as we reiect and hold for wicked (according to the Creed of Saint <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi> and first Councell of <hi>Nice</hi>) who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doth not beleeue inuiolably the said Catholike Faith, and intirely in euery point, and doe sometimes condeme euen to death, and burne some for dissenting in one only point of Faith, (as <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> himselfe hath diuers times complained) how can it be, that he and his Church can gather vp and tye together in one vnion of Faith, and communion of Saints, all these different and opposite heads, together with their members and followers?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20478:17"/>
asked him <hi>How he came to so great a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> he answered, <hi>I am certaine of my saluation and religion by the Scriptures:</hi> but when they posed him further, how hee could bee sure of Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and of their true meaning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the testimony of the Church; hee had no other shift, but to runne to the assurance of his owne spirit, telling them, that albeit he receiued the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Church (as those of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sychar did the notice of Christ by the woman from the Well) yet that <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> when he once had them, then could he vse them well enough, for vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them; and for shew hereof, when a little after hee had occasion to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret some peeces of Scriptures, he did it so absurdly as a man might well see, how much might be builded vpon the assurance of that his particular and priuate spirit, as for example, among other places, hee tooke vpon him to proue by Scripture that the Pope was Antichrist, and cited for it onely those words of the Apostle to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, That <hi>Antichrist shall sit in the
<pb facs="tcp:20478:17"/>
Temple of God,</hi> &amp;c. which though it proue nothing, as you see, for that wee deny not but that Antichrist when hee commeth, shall sit in the Temple of God, yea and pretend to be God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, (which no Popes euer did or shal doe;) yet to <hi>Bradford</hi> the allegation of this place seemed much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and to <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> that admireth all which the other vttered, it appeareth so full a proofe, as he maketh this note in the margent: <hi>The Pope proued to bee Antichrist by Scriptures.</hi> But this proofe (as you see) standeth only vpon <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> interpretation, which interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not onely not conforme to any ancient Fathers exposition whatsoeuer, but is manifestly also contrary to the text it selfe, where immediatly before the words alledged, That <hi>he shall sit in the Temple of God,</hi> are these words, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolletur supra omne quod dicitur Deus, aut qued colitur,</hi> That Antichrist (when he commeth) shall bee extolled aboue all that is called God, or that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped for God, so as he shall not call him Gods seruant (as the Pope doth) nor the seruant of his seruants, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20478:18"/>
chiefe God himselfe, which no Pope, as is said, euer did or will, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently these words cannot possibly agree to the Pope, and yet forsooth the spirit of <hi>Bradford,</hi> that cannot erre or be deceiued, doth expound it so, and thereby you see the certaintie of his spirit.</p>
                  <p>After this, againe he went about to perswade the two Bishops, who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him, that he agreed with them, and with their Church in substance of Faith and beleefe, and consequently might bee saued with them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this deniall of two articles, for which only he said he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: to wit, <hi>Transubstantiation, and that the euill men doe not receiue the body of Christ,</hi> when they communicate, which two articles <hi>Bradford</hi> affirmed not to appertaine to the substance of faith, or foundation of Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that he was vnjustly cast our of the Church for them, for so much as hee firmely beleeued all the articles of the Creede with them: whereunto, when the Bishops smiling replied say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Yen, <hi>Is this your Diuinitie?</hi> BRAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD

I know they will not, and would bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to interpret the place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that sense, for so much as it is euident, that he meaneth of the straw and stubble of workes, and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or at least such principall points of doctrine as those are, which

                     <hi>Bradford</hi> did professe contrary to the Catholique truth.

            <head>ANOTHER DIFFERENCE worthy of obseruation betweene <hi>the Catholike and Protestant spirit,</hi> consisting in the willingnes of the one, and vnwillingnesse of the <hi>other to admit publike and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different triall of their Doctrine.</hi>

            <p>WHEREAS one principal mark by which a good Spirit may be discerned from a bad, is that the good Spirit loueth light, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly commeth to the light, admitting any reasonable and indifferent meanes of triall. But the bad Spirit hateth light, and commeth not to the light, but flyeth all publike and indifferent meanes, by which it may be examined.

            <p>On the one side it may easily bee seene how much the Catholike Church loueth light, in that the Doctors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:20478:22"/>
in théir publike writings ordinarily vse to explicate and set downe clearely and sincerely, the state of the question in controuersie. Secondly, They truly set downe the opinions and arguments of their Aduersaries, and this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more fully then is done by their Aduersaries themselues. Thirdly, They explicate the Catholike doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it with cleare testimonies of holy Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, and Reasons, and answering fully all, or the strongest Obiections. Fourthly, They are ready both in their publike Schools and in their Prouinciall and Generall Councels to admit, yea inuite, their greatest Aduersaries to speake freely whatsoeuer they thinke good, for triall of the truth in all matters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. This to be true, appeareth partly by the learned and methodicall books of our Catholike Authors, namely, <hi>Bellarmine, Stapleton, Valentia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; partly by the practise of our publike Schooles, where any may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make whatsoeuer arguments they will, for disputation sake, partly by some especiall examples of free dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb facs="tcp:20478:22"/>
permitted to be made in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Countries, euen by knowne Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: as for ancient times, wee reade how the Councell of Carthage inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Donatists to a publike and free Conference or disputation, saying, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis exvobis ipsis,</hi> &amp;c. Choose some among your selues who may vndergoe this businesse to proue your cause, that we also may do the like, and that some from among this Councell may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who may at the same time and place agree vpon, examine or trie together with those which shal be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen among you, whatsoeuer controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie it is which hindereth vs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with you, &amp;c. For if you doe brotherly admit thereof (to wit, of this conference) the truth will easily appeare. But if you refuse to accept of this, your infidelitie (or false faith) will presently be made knowne. Thus this ancient Councell did inuite Heretikes to a triall, also in latter times in our owne Countrey, to wit, in the raigne of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> there were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seuerall open disputations, once in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi> for sixe daies,

            <p>
               <hi>AT nec te dispiscimus, &amp;c.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne not thee (I speake to the Reader much auerted from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Faith) nor set vpon thee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, prouoke thee with reproaches, loade thee with contumelies; because we are not moued with any perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20478:28"/>
of mind against the persons, when we reprehend mens errours, wee deale most kindly with thee, to the end thou mayest vnderstand that the Truth it selfe, rather then the Patron thereof, fighteth against thee: yea we will bee most liberall to thee, so farre forth, as that we will not feare, with all lenitie and submission of minde, to allow thy selfe perusing diligently these our workes, and desiring to finde forth the truth, as a just arbitrator. We hauing a confidence in the goodnesse of our cause, will yeeld so much vnto thee, as not to disdaine to vndergoe thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the truth of those things we speake of, prouided that thy reason, as it were, equally ballanced, be placed betweene, but aboue both parties, that is, supposing thee to be of a sound and sincere judgement, voyd of all perturbation, wanting particular affections, and so inclining to neither partie. If thou bee ready to shew thy selfe such a judge, I appeale from thy selfe, when at other times thou haddest thy minde troubled, vnto thine owne selfe, now examining things more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20478:28"/>
with the cleared eye of thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the which power of mans soule is most vigorous, if being vnchai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and free, it bee suffered freely to discourse. This consideration enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our Auncestors, relying vpon the truth of their doctrine, when they had occasion to deale with most obstinate Heretikes, refusing and contemning the Church her judgement, to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so much vnto them, as to permit their cause to the arbitrement of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and demand their sentence in the same. These being Iudges, the Iews after much contention ouercame the Samaritans. In like manner, <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioseph. An. tiq. lib. 13. cap. 6.</note> choosing by consent of his aduersaries a Gentile for Vmpire, ouerthrew fiue most peruerse Heretikes, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him who sate as Vmpire in their dispute. Likewise the holy Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Bishop, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> confuted the <note place="margin">Epiphan. Heres. 66.</note> most impious Arch-heretike <hi>Manes,</hi> by the arbitrement of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> chosen to decide by common consent of both disputants. There are many other like examples, by which it appears the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the truth to haue refused no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20478:29"/>
mans judgement or sentence, no not so much as of those who seeme to be condemned by our Lord himselfe, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Hee that beleeueth not, is alreadie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> 
               <hi>iudged.</hi> All these we seeme to ouer go in our maner of free dealing with thee, because wee seeke no other arbitrator then thy selfe, if thou follow the rules of reason, most certainly assuring our selues, that thou wilt giue sentence for, and agree with vs, if thy reason of it owne nature most affecting equitie, do willingly heare the truth. One thing wee expect as the sole reward for our labours, that is, to see thee at length so condemned by thy selfe, judging most justly, as that thou mayest be quitte of thy errours. God grant we may once joyfully meete thee rectified in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, embrace and <hi>kisse thee as our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> 
               <hi>sucking the brests of our Mother:</hi> at this present although it be vnlawful for vs, because of the prohibition of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle (we speake it not without a most hearty sorrow) to salute thee, or to say so much as all haile vnto thee, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there is none that will forbid vs, to beg of almightie God by earnest
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20478:29"/>
prayer thy saluation, which wee most earnestly desire.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth how much the Catholike Spirit loueth light, &amp; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to haue a full and free triall of the truth. Contrariwise, the Protestants Spirit sheweth it selfe to hate light, first in that ordinarily their professors write confusedly of Controuersies, seldome setting downe sincerely and clearely the state of the question, but often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting it, making that seeme to be the question, which is not, also ordinarily wronging the Catholike sentence, in making it seeme to say what it sayeth not, also vsually concealing, or not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrging the arguments of Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, &amp; Reasons brought by Catholikes in their publike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Their owne sentence and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also they set downe so darkely and obscurely, as that often times they scarse vnderstand themselues, and much lesse is it vnderstood by others, what they hold, or would say. The arguments also which they bring for confirmation of their opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as likewise their answers to our objections are so light and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20478:30"/>
yea sometimes so farre fetched and ill framed, as it is wonder that men of witte and learning can suffer such stuffe to passe from them.</p>
            <p>I omit to speake of their falsification and corruption of Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where of a taste may be taken by that which is set downe in M. <hi>Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his Search into matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I omit also their flying the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ancient Fathers and Councels, and their retiring themselues into the mist of their owne priuat fantasies, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the spacious titles of onely Scripture and Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>That which chiefly sheweth Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Spirit to loue darknes, is that by any meanes they will not be drawne to permitte Catholikes liuing in their quarters, to come to such a publike, free and in different triall of the truth (euen by such grounds as Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe admit, or which by force of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Catholikes wil soundly proue ought to be admitted) as Protestants haue bin permitted, yea inuited, yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently vrged vnto by the Catholike part: How ofteu haue euen our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               </note> them, writing about this point, against a Minister called Master <hi>Charke:</hi> And heere (M. <hi>Charke</hi> saith he) because we are fallen into this matter, I am in the name of my fellow Catholikes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our publike Challenge, of equall Disputation to you, and to all your brother Ministers againe. M. <hi>Campian</hi> is gone, whom you name in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be our onely Champion, you see that Master <hi>Sherwin</hi> is made away with him, whom you are wont to say (for more abasement of the other) to haue been far better learned then M. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> himselfe. But howsoeuer that was, both of them haue you dispatched, and thereby (in your opinion) greatly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened our cause; yet notwithstanding we are the same men that we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: yea much more defirous of this triall then before. Wherefore wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest you now at length, yea we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you either for the truth sake, if you seeke it, or for your owne credit sake, if you will reteine it, that you yeeld vs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20478:31"/>
after so much suite and supplication, some equall triall, either by writing, preaching, or disputing. There is no reason in the world (but onely feare) that may mooue you to deny vs this our request. For the reason (of State) which you alledge (M. <hi>Charke</hi>) in the reply, is most vaine. For what can a peaceable disputation, granted to vs for Religion, indanger the State? but only (that you would say) that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation may chance to discouer your errors, and so make the hearers detest the state of your herefie, for other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there can be none to your State. And if you had the truth with you (as you pretend) whose property is, the more to shew her selfe, the more shee is examined, you should much increase your State by this publike triall: for that you should both gaine more to your part, by opening the said truth, and also confirme many of your owne side, that now justly doe wauer vpon this open discouery of your feare in triall.</p>
            <p>Wherefore once againe, I say vnto you Ministers, obtaine vs this disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20478:31"/>
though it be only but for a shew, thereby onely to hold and maintaine your credit: we protest before God, that we seeke it onely for the triall of Christs truth, for search whereof, wee offer our selues to this labour, charges, and perill of life, we aske for our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but only such a warrant from her Majesty, as the late Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> did offer vnto all Protestants in the world, wherof you haue the copy with you: we will come in what kinde and number, at what time, to what place you will appoint.</p>
            <p>If you wil haue your own Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they are ready to come. If you wil haue strangers to dispute in your Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities before the learned only, there shal not want. For your selues, we giue you leaue to call all the learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of <hi>Europe</hi> for your defence; wee wil take only our owne Country-men, if you permit vs. We giue you leaue to oppose or defend, to appoint questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to choose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies, to begin or end at your pleasure, and to vse any other prerogatiues that you please, so that they impugne not the indifferencie of
<pb facs="tcp:20478:32"/>
Triall: What can you alledge why you should not accept this?</p>
            <p>If you had rather make trial in other Countries, then at home before your own people, as perhaps you had, chuse you what Protestant state you list, and procure vs therein the foresaid safetie from the Prince, and wee will neither spare labour nor cost to meet you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also. Or if this seeme hard, and like you not, then take you but the paines some number of you, to come into any Catholike Kingdom or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try where you please, and we will procure what security soeuer reasonably you shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for your persons. And more then that, we will beare your expences also, rather then so good a worke shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnattempted. And if you can deuise any other condition to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on our parts, which I haue left out, do you adde the same, and we will agree (by the grace of God) to fulfil it. If we offer you reason, then deale som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reasonably with vs againe. For al the world wil crie shame, and begin to discredit you, if you will neither giue nor take vpon so great oddes as are
<pb facs="tcp:20478:32"/>
heere offered you. If you dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Disputations, yet grant vs at the least certaine Sermons to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with you vpon this matter: or if that also be so dangerous, procure vs but a little passage for our bookes.</p>
            <p>Now wheras the <hi>Denfence of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> wherein the fore-rehearsed Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge made by our learned Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is set downe, was published <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1582. the same Challenge vnto the Ministers of England, with humble suit and earnest petition to the Prince for the same, hath bin continually euer since made, during the late Queenes dayes, and the same also more often reitterated and vrged since the raigne of his Majestie, vnto whom the graue and learned Doctor <hi>Kellison</hi> presented the same petition in the name of al Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, yea and after that intreated for the same in his Epistle Dedicatorie to the Kings Majestie, prefixed before his learned booke called <hi>The Suruey of the new Religion.</hi> The same petition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for disputation &amp; triall (to omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others) was made vnto his Majestie by that learned Priest M. <hi>Brierley,</hi> in his
<pb facs="tcp:20478:33"/>
vnanswerable booke entituled, <hi>The Protestants Apollogie for the Romane Church,</hi> where hauing directed the whole current of his discourse vnto his learned Majestie, hee closeth vp the same with a finall petition and humble intreatie for some open and equall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of disputation. For the obtaining <note place="margin">Tract. 3. Sect. 7.</note> whereof (saith he) we presume hereby to become most humble and earnest petitioners vnto your Majestie. The euident and necessary incertaintie of our Aduersaries judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in doctrine may well seeme to need it. The weight and consequence of the cause (being no lesse then the matter of Faith and Religion) deserueth. Our Aduersaries rule of reducing all things to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triall, appointeth it. Our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of their conuersion thirsteth greatly after it. Their full perswasion of our pretended erring, and like cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable care of our reformation, should in all reason be no lesse willing of it. Our often admitting, or rather prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them to open and equal dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations had in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, doth as now againe by way of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb facs="tcp:20478:33"/>
answerably requite it. The serious and resolued confidence of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Diuines, men confessedly no lesse able to performe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willing to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the same, doth with most graue, and not to be neglected solicitation, prouoke and challenge it. The seueral examples of the same course, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obserued and practised in sundrie Nations, and by our very Aduersaries prescribed, doe as it were conduct and lead vs to it. The venerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed antiquitie of Catholike Faith established, but neuer hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in any Generall Councell (and therfore vn worthy to be now rejected without some indifferencie of triall) presumeth very confidently to obtaine it. And lastly, your Highnesse mature and ripe judgement, able to moderate and censure the same, maketh vs so much the rather to become most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desirous and earnest for it.</p>
            <p>Thus you see with what confidence in the truth of their cause, and with what feruent desire of disputation, and publike trial of their Spirits, these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Catholikes in the name of the rest
<pb facs="tcp:20478:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
desire it. With the same carnestnesse doe our learned Catholikes abroad call vpon the Protestant Ministers, in all such places where they beare sway, to come vnto some publike triall of their cause: Witnesse Sir <hi>Edwine Sands,</hi> who <note place="margin">
