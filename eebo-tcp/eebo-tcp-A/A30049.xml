            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>William Penn, THE Pretended QUAKER, DISCOVERED To hold a Correſpondence WITH THE JESUITE's at ROME. To which is Added, A Winding-Sheet FOR <hi>Ann Dockwra</hi>: By <hi>Francis Bugg.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON the 2d. of <hi>July,</hi> in this preſent year 1700. Having occaſion to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Mr. <hi>Batle,</hi> Sub-Dean of the Royal Chappel at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> I enquired of him the Truth of the Story of that I had heard from others, that he ſhould report of <hi>William Penn</hi>; who freely told me as follows.</p>
            <p>That he being at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1677. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone thither from <hi>England,</hi> Tutor to Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>; and having ſtayed there for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, had one Father <hi>James,</hi> a Scots Jeſuit at <hi>Rome</hi> to teach him <hi>Italian,</hi> which was all the occaſion he had of Converſe with him. And as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103407:2"/>
he was making ready with his Pupil Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> to return for <hi>England,</hi> ſuppoſing he might have ſome occaſion, to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome ſtrings to ſome Muſical Inſtruments, he ask'd Father <hi>James,</hi> how he might ſend a Letter to him that might come ſafe to his hands to <hi>Rome,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>That if he would put his Letter in Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>Packet, it would come ſafe to him, for Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>Packet comes frequently to</hi> Rome <hi>from</hi> London. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Batle,</hi> William Penn <hi>the Quaker,</hi> ſaid Father <hi>James, The very ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Story, the Quakers Report thus, as I heard it from one of them, which I then told to Mr. <hi>Batle,</hi> that after <hi>William Penn</hi> had heard that Mr. <hi>Batle</hi> had ſo Reported of him at <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he went thither to call him to an Account for it; and at Meeting, Mr. <hi>Batle</hi> did own his miſtake, that on a better Recollection of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, it was not Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> but one <hi>Pennynton,</hi> a Glover, who was no Quaker, who frequently uſed to ſend Gloves to <hi>Rome</hi>: Mr. <hi>Batle</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I heard the Quakers ſo report, but it is utterly falſe, I ſaid no ſuch thing, there is no miſtake in the Name, it was no Mr.</hi> Pennynton <hi>a Glover, but Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>that is,</hi> William Penn <hi>the Quaker, as Father</hi> James <hi>told me.</hi> Mr. <hi>Batle</hi> alſo told me, That after he had reported this at <hi>Hartford, Henry Stout,</hi> a Quaker at <hi>Hartford,</hi> came to him and ſaid, <hi>Neighbour</hi> Batle, <hi>Thou haſt done thy ſelf a great diskindneſs by reporting this Story of</hi> William Penn, <hi>and to be plain with thee, I do not believe it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Batle,</hi> anſwer'd him, <hi>Tell Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>If he will come to me, I will Treat him as a Gentleman, but I will ſay it to his Face, that what I Reported of him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103407:2"/>
is true; that is, that Father</hi> James <hi>a</hi> Jeſuit <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>told me, If I put my Letter in Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>Packet, it would come ſafe to him, for he ſent a Packet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from</hi> London <hi>to</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day above-mentioned, Mr. <hi>Batle,</hi> told me, that Mr. <hi>Hockley,</hi> Goaler at <hi>Hartford,</hi> lately Deceaſed, told him, and divers others at <hi>Hartford,</hi> that Father <hi>Gifford</hi> (then Priſoner at <hi>Hartford,</hi> who was taken up at the Revolution, being deſigned by K. <hi>James</hi> to be made Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of St. <hi>Magdalen</hi>'s Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>) told him, the ſaid <hi>Hockley,</hi> that he had heard Father <hi>Penn</hi> ſay Maſs ſeveral times: What Father <hi>Penn,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hockley</hi>? William Penn <hi>the Quaker? Yes,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> William Penn <hi>the Quaker.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hockley,</hi> has told it to divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Repute at <hi>Hartford,</hi> who if asked, will affirm it.</p>
            <p>All this, Mr. <hi>Batle</hi> allowed me to put in Print, to Inform the Nation and the Quakers.</p>

            <head>A Winding-Sheet for <hi>Ann Dockwra:</hi> Being an Anſwer to her Scurrilous Pamphlet, Intituled, <hi>The Second Part of an Apoſt. Conſ.</hi> &amp;c.</head>

               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not unſenſible, that Negative Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in many Caſes, will not Determin the Point in hand; and therefore it is both Reaſonable and Judicious for me, the Accuſed, to demand Proof, as herein I have done: And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103407:3"/>
then, if this Slanderous Woman cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Proof, I am Acquitted of her groundleſs Charge. For ſuppoſe this Envious Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in favour of Quakeriſm, ſhould Publiſh in Print, that <hi>Fran. Bugg,</hi> twenty years ſince Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Man, Fir'd a Houſe, and Robb'd by the Highway, (as that ſhe may with as much Truth and Juſtice, as what in her two Books ſhe has done) how can I help it? I only can call upon her to produce her Evidences; if ſhe do this, I may be thought Guilty; but if not, I am by the Rules of Juſtice Diſcharged; and ſhe remains Culpable, and ought to make me Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But that a Negative Evidence is good, and Vallid in ſome Caſes, I ſhall Demonſtrate; for Example, ſuppoſe this Slanderous Woman ſhall Charge me with Robbing a Houſe in <hi>York City,</hi> on the 15th of <hi>May</hi> laſt; if then I can prove by Credible Witneſſes, that I was in <hi>London</hi> the ſame Day, this will hold, and I ſhould be Acquitted. And to ſhew that this Simily is not Foreign to our Caſe in Hand, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce two Inſtances (to Name no more) out of this Book of hers, <hi>p.</hi> 13.25</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>is this,</hi> viz. Fran. Bugg <hi>the Elder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his Eſtate to his Son,</hi> Francis Bugg <hi>the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who had</hi> 700 <hi>Pound with his Wife; and her Friends and Relations, upon Inquiry, doe affirm that it was Settled upon Marriage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now what is this? But to ſuggeſt, firſt, That my Son had 700 Pound with his Wife. 2dly. And that I took the Money of him, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof, Convey'd my Eſtate to him; and all this to make good her former lying Story,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103407:3"/>
               <hi>viz. That I Sold my Eſtate to my Son,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made him able to Settle a Joynture upon his Wife; and conſequently both Father and Son Knaves; for I could not be Guilty of this Frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Act, but my Son muſt Conſent to it. And 3dly, That upon the ſtrict Inquiry of her Relations, this Cheat was found out; and by them affirmed to be ſo. The laſt of which I do believe to be a Grand Lye; and that until ſhe produce the Names of thoſe Relations that ſo ſought, ſo found out, and ſo affirm, I ſhall take it to be ſo, for no one of them ſpeaks one Word to me of any ſuch thing, nor had they any ground ſo to do; the two firſt I ſhall diſprove by good Evidence, and thereby leave this old Woman in ſuch a Dilemma, out of which ſhe ſhall never be able to deliver her ſelf, but by Repentance, and Retraction, which is wholly Inconſiſtent with Quakeriſm; for they can neither make Confeſſion of Sins or Treſpaſſes, to God or Man, as their Books do abundantly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>His</hi> (<hi>Fran. Bugg</hi>'s) <hi>Son had</hi> 700 <hi>Pound with his Wife.</hi> This is falſe, and a Lye ſpoken in Hypocriſie, with a deſign to Deceive; for 'tis plain ſhe would have it believed that my Son had 700 <hi>l.</hi> in Currant <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money with his Wife, which was not ſo: and thereby was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to Purchaſe my Eſtate, to Settle a Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon her: And if ſo, it would help her out in her former Lye, <hi>viz. That I Sold my Eſtate to my Son.</hi> That this is her deſign, 'tis plain; for 'tis no Crime that <hi>Francis Bugg's</hi> Son got a Wife with 700 <hi>l.</hi> nor no Sin againſt his Wife, or her Relations, that I gave my Son ſuch a part
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103407:4"/>
of my Eſtate as I then thought, and did believe, I could Spare; and conſequently no need of ſuch Inquiry, nor of ſo affirming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not that hereby I deſign to Leſſon my Daughter-In-Law's Portion, but do grant that ſhe was worth 700 <hi>l.</hi> and a better Penny when he Married her; and to this day I never underſtood any Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either in my Son, or my ſelf, about her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor yet in my Daughter-in-Law; or in any of her Relations, about what I gave my Son upon Marriage, which was every way Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her Portion. But ſtill, I ſay, he had not 700 <hi>l.</hi> No, he had but 300 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, and 400 <hi>l.</hi> in Houſe and Land, which had ſhe Dyed without Iſſue; that Eſtate of hers had devolv'd back; and now, Bleſſed be God, ſhe hath Iſſue, which I dearly Love, even as if begot by my own Body; and wiſh them all the Bleſſings of this and the other Life; yet if they Dye, and their Mother, Then my Son is but a Termer for Life, to that part of it which is Freehoold; and that too by the Courteſie of <hi>England</hi>; for unleſs a man have the Inheritance of an Eſtate in fee Simple, it cannot be ſaid to be his own, otherwiſe then as before deſcribed; for he can neither Sell, Mortgage, nor give it. Thus have I gone further then I needed, or indeed, was willing, did I not believe it neceſſary to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe Evil and Pernicious ſuggeſtions, which this dark Spirit of Quakeriſm would raiſe againſt me, for the ſake of the Diſcovery I have made of its Inconſiſtency with Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ſays this old Woman, Fran. Bugg <hi>hath Conveyed his Eſtate to his Son.</hi> In her firſt Book
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103407:4"/>
it was, Fran. Bugg <hi>Sold his Eſtate to his Son.</hi> So <hi>Jezebel withſtood</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>from p.</hi> 55. of her <hi>Apoſt.</hi> &amp;c. So that it is plain, that by conveyance here, ſhe means and would have it believed, that this conveyance was by Deed of Sale, when it was no ſuch thing; but by Deed of Gift; not in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any part of his Wives Portion, to me, or for my uſe; But in Conſideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Love and Affection I had to my only Son, who hath been a Dutiful Child from his Cradle. And to this Day never was Blemiſh in his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, until this Infamous Woman has attack'd him. But may I not think that this Woman hath ſtill a further deſign then to render both Father and Son Knaves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In ſetting my Daughter-in-Law (whom I Love and Reſpect as my own Child) and her Kindred againſt me; and not only ſo; but if my Son remain Dutiful, as that I have no cauſe yet to fear; then to ſet them and me againſt each other; and for this <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath ſet her a Copy, not only in the caſe of my ſelf and Wife; but in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> Mr. <hi>Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> and their Wives, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But to purſue this, and to Illuſtrate the Jeſuitical Practice of her Gentleman Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, I have not Room in this Winding-Sheet. Let it ſuffice then, that I am well ſatisfied in my Son and Daughter; and they both are as kind to me as I can deſire; I never yet deſired any Kindneſs of my Daughter-in-Law but ſhe as readily granted it; and I pray God to Bleſs them both, and their Offspring, and to give 'em a ſight of the Errors of the Quakers; in which I ſhall endeavour to be as Inſtrumental as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103407:5"/>Again, <hi>Secondly,</hi> p. 25 <hi>Ibid. He</hi> Francis Bugg) <hi>ſuffered the leaſt of any I know, that had Eſtates to loſe; the Fines were Two, one was</hi> 15<hi>l. for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Preacher; the other was</hi> 10<hi>l. for the Poverty of the Man that kept the Meeting at his Houſe: Of this</hi> 25<hi>l. he got</hi> 15<hi>l. of a near Relation of his by Fraud; and the Juſtice that Proſecuted him, gave him</hi> 5<hi>l. of the Money again, ſo that his whole Loſs was but five Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, I am Aſtoniſhed, when I conſider the vain Boaſts, and high Pretences of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Juſtice, Truth, Equity, Righteouſneſs, Purity, Self denyal, Meekneſs, yea, to do as they would be done by; when they ſo Generally Act the Contrary. You ſee ſhe ſays I ſuffered but two Fines; that I was the leaſt Sufferer that ſhe knew of, that had Eſtates to Loſe; that my whole Loſs by Fines was but 5<hi>l.</hi> And yet ſays that <hi>Sam.

Neither doth the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> want the <hi>Dark-Lanthorn Light</hi> of this Crazy Woman, to give him Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to Act. Well, but to the Matter, Namely, To diſcover the horrible <hi>Lies</hi> of this Crack-brain'd Woman. <hi>He</hi> (F. Bugg) <hi>Suffer'd</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>the Leaſt of any I knew,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But Two Fines: His whole Loſs by Fines was but</hi> 5l. We have an old Proverb, <hi>A Lyar had need to have a good Memory</hi>: She ſhould have conſider'd this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then I demand of her, in her next, to ſhew any one Man in the County where I dwelt, that Suffered longer Impriſonment than I did; that ſuffer'd more Fines, for the Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others, and for themſelves, than I did; that gave more to the building a Meeting-Houſe than I did; that Entertain'd their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers more than I did; or that Spent his Eſtate for the propagation of Quakeriſm, more then I did; and of this Service to their cauſe, there are yet amongſt them many Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then at <hi>Ely,</hi> I ſuffered three Ten Pound Fines for the Poverty of <hi>G. Thorrowgood,</hi> at whoſe Houſe the Meeting was kept; beſide as many ſmall Fines for my ſelf: And for which I was diſtrained by <hi>Nicholas Ruſh, Robert Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and others; in Cloths, Stuffs, Yarn, and Wooll, and others Goods above the value of 50<hi>l.</hi> without one Penny or Pennyworth Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103407:6"/>
               <hi>Ann Rogers,</hi> my then Maid, and <hi>Thomas Bird,</hi> my then Journey-man, and now a Quaker of good Repute amongſt them, knew this: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I was Fined Twenty Pounds for a meeting at my Houſe in <hi>Milden-Hall</hi>; which <hi>Will. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> Preached at, when for refuſing to tell his Name and Habitation, the Poor Quakers were Fined for him; and their Cows driven away and Sold; ſo that <hi>John Maſon,</hi> and my ſelf were Conſtrained to lend them Money, to help to get more, whilſt this Infallible Preacher Loſt nothing. I alſo was Fined Ten Pound for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meeting, for the Poverty of <hi>Ja. Webb,</hi> at whoſe Houſe the Meeting was. And beſides all theſe Ten, and Twenty Pound Fines; four of them for the Poverty of the Dwellers in our Meeting-Houſes; and one Twenty Pound Fine for a Meeting at my own Houſe, I alſo was Fined Seven or Eight ſmall Fines, inſomuch, that I was Diſtrained at <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> (beſides thoſe mention'd at <hi>Ely</hi>) in Wooll, Yarn, Stuff, Cloth, and Houſhould Goods, to the Value of above 50 <hi>l</hi> more; which in all, makes more then 100 <hi>l.</hi> Loſs by Fines, for Meetings.</p>
            <p>Now, Reader, Had not this Woman a— Forehead well Enlaid with Impudence, how dare ſhe appear in Print with ſuch bare Fac'd Lyes? As that <hi>I ſuffered the leaſt of any ſhe knew that had Eſtates to Loſe: That I ſuffered but two Fines: That my whole Loſs by Fines was hut</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> As for the Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> ſhe mentions, for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Preacher, my Book, <hi>Reaſon againſt Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> &amp;c. did ſo effectually Confute all their falſe Accuſations, as that to this Day they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p>Oh, Couſin <hi>Dockwra,</hi> for Shame Cover thy Face; wear a Vail, and ſit down and mourn for thy Sins. Till then never pretend more to Religion: Remember <hi>Cherry-Hynton,</hi> thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place of Abode.</p>
            <p>Reader, theſe two Books of <hi>Ann Dockwra</hi>'s, <hi>viz, An Apoſtate Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>The Second part of an Apoſtate Conſcience,</hi> were both Wrot by the Quakers Spirit of Truth, that cannot Err, being Infallible: Yea, and alſo approved by the Quaker-Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Second-Day Meeting; that Infallible Club of Inſpired Doctors, with whom ſhe has been in the Unity this 36 years, as ſhe ſays herſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 35. Theſe Books are alſo Sold by <hi>Tacy Sowle,</hi> the Quakers Bookſeller, as a Sign both of their Approbation, and Unity. The firſt ſtands Convicted of 18 Lyes, and in her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhe has not cleared herſelf of any one of them. And I do now recharge them upon her; and as many freſh Lyes in this Laſt; let her come forth if ſhe thinks ſhe can clear herſelf, and I am willing alſo that ſhe take her Gentleman Quaker, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> to her Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Again, I find, in <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>Ibid,</hi> That rather then ſhe will want Authors for her Villany, ſhe'll Father her Lyes upon me, <hi>viz. He (Fran. Bugg) told me ſo himſelf.</hi> Again, <hi>He</hi> (Fran. Bugg) <hi>told me many years ago, that when he bought his Houſe, that his Wives Father help'd to buy it. And made his</hi> (Fran.

And more of this Nature I could mention, but ſhall forbear; nor had I done this, but in Vindication of my own Reputation, avouching ſtill for a Truth what I have ſaid in <hi>Jezebel Withſtood,</hi> &amp;c. p. 2. And which my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John,</hi> then Living, might have gainſaid if he could: All which ſhews this Treacherous Womans deſign, which was to ſet my Wives Relations and me at Variance: Unleſs ſhe took me to be ſuch a Tame Fool, as by my ſilence to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all her Lies and Forgeries.</p>
            <p>But her inveterate Malice ends not here, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſme</hi> muſt ſhew its ſelf exact <hi>New Rome,</hi> and in this inſtance exceed her Elder Siſter; for as the Papiſts took up the Bones of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> many years after he was laid into his Grave; and burnt them as a Sacrifice to their Infallible Malice, no more can the Quakers let my Honoured Father alone in his Grave; But near 40 years after his Death, they muſt rake in his Aſhes, and lay falſe Imputations to his Charge: And that which Aggravates the Malignity of their Implacable Malice is, he never gave them Cauſe, he never was concerned in this Controverſy: Whereas, in excuſe of the Papiſts Fury, they have this to

ſay, That <hi>Wickliff</hi> was a Vigorous Warrier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Romiſh Idolatry; and had wrote more than two hundred Volumes againſt their Errors and Superſtition. This indeed did Anger the Romiſh Church, as my ſelf and others have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred her Younger Siſter; yet I never read that the Papiſts meddled with <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Father, Grandfather, Yea and Great Grand-father, as the Quakers have done with my Dear Father, Grand-father, and Great Grand-father.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this, I replyed in my Book <hi>Jezebel With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> &amp;c. p. 2. ſaying, <hi>Here is Lye upon Lye, four Story high: Firſt, my Father never dwelt with me a week ſince I Married, much leſs ſome years.</hi> 2. <hi>He never roſe ſo from Dinner.</hi> 3. <hi>Nor was ſo found Drown'd: Nor did I or my Wife ſo relate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now inſtead of clearing herſelf of theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Lies, ſhe being Fool-hardy, and, filled Brimful with Prejudice againſt our whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for my Sake; ſhe in her <hi>Second Part</hi> &amp;c. p. 13. thus enlarges, <hi>I heard my Brother</hi> Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſton <hi>ſpeak of it ſome years after; That</hi> Francis Bugg's <hi>Father Drowned himſelf, as moſt People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> &amp;c.

That becauſe her Brother <hi>Barnardiſton</hi> living near 20 Miles diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from my Fathers Dwelling, that upon his telling her (ſhe knew not when, nay I queſtion whether at all) that moſt People talked ſo; That therefore ſhe ſhould have the Impudence, near 40 years after this Accident, to take upon her to Try this Tryed Cauſe <hi>de novo</hi>; And by her Infallible Super-abounding Confidence, to Confront both Coroner and Jury, Render them Perjured, who then had the opportunity to hear Witneſſes, to examine all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and when they found it caſual and Accidental, they brought their Verdict in Accordingly: And this ſhe ſays herſelf, p. 14. <hi>But the Coroner and Jury did not find it Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-Murder.</hi> And I do now Challenge <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

If every Proud Varlet, and Envious Man, may ſtir up Strife in Towns and Cities, and charge Perſons with Crimes after they are acquitted by Legal Tryals. Neither is it agreeable to the Rules of Law or Juſtice, to Impeach men afreſh, or recharge them after they are cleared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do acknowledge the Accident was ſorrowful enough to my ſelf, and my Fathers Relations and Loving Neighbours. But if my Grandfather who was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1579, which was about 50 years before this Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Woman was Born; No, nor yet my Great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was Born many years before him, no Marvel that ſhe now falls upon my Deceaſed Father, and Reflects upon my Son alſo; for Malice is like Quakeriſme, it hath no Botom; nor no Banks can keep it in due bounds; its like the Raging Sea, Foaming, out its own Shame; caſting forth Mire and Dirt; for ſuppoſe it had been as ſhe falſely relates, how could I have helped it, or wherein does the Misfortune of any of my Relations affect the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie now on Foot.</p>
            <p>But that I may draw the exact Picture of this old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Hypocrite <hi>Ann Dockwra,</hi> as Compleatly, as Father <hi>Penn's</hi> is drawn in the Quakers Synod; and ſet her forth in her proper Dreſs, with all her Features, ſee <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>ibid,</hi> where ſhe thus ſays, as if ſhe were an Excellent Friend

            <p>Here the Cloven Foot appears, tho' Diſguiſed; for Malice and Hypocriſie, walk Hand in Hand, under a Quaker-Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, for ſays ſhe, in her Preface; <hi>It is matter of Admiration</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>to me, that they</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Clergy) ſhould Entertain</hi> Fran. Buggs <hi>Books, and give Credit to them; a Man of a Seared Conſcience, of Deſperate Fortunes, of a Shattered Head, his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Conſcience Imboldens him to Write all manner of Lyes and Forgeries</hi> [whilſt ſhe proves not one] <hi>to get Money like High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Men; a Beggar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I think, I need not Comment upon this her Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In ſaying, ſhe does not Write to Upbraid me; whilſt ſhe Upbraids me in the Higheſt Nature the Devil and Malice can Invent. And this I can ſay, that as no Man ever Incouraged me to Scrible away my Eſtate: But that from Firſt to Laſt, I have ſeen a Neceſſity to Unmask this Painted Harlot; ſo thanks be to God, I can ſay with a good Conſcience, I never Wrot for Money, nor was I ever a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, nor have I wanted a ſufficient ſupport to this Day; but have Lived well in Meat, Drink, and Apparrel, and Maintained my Family with all Neceſſaries; I never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good Houſe to Live in, nor a good Horſe to Ride on, and Money in my Pocket; and if I have Applyld my ſelf to the Clergy, that thereby, I might be Inabled to Deſend my Chriſtian Profeſſion, againſt the Powerful Fund of the Quakers; it is no more then <hi>Fox, Whitehead,</hi> and other of the Quakers have done, who at firſt were not able to Print a Book at their own Charge, [which I did fifteen years together] without Aſſiſtance from their hearers, to whom they apply'd themſelves by Papers which did fly like briefs <hi>FOR MONEY, MONEY FOR THE MINITSRY.</hi>
