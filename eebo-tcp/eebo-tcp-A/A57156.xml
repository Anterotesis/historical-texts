         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as to their formal and immediate beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Invisible to any eye, but his who search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48972:3"/>
our <hi>Repentance</hi> is said to be <hi>towards God,</hi> and
<hi>Faith towards our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> Acts 20.
21. our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> is said to be <hi>in God,</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 21. As the <hi>Root,</hi> though the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Seat of Life in the Tree, is under
ground unseen, but the <hi>fruits</hi> flowing from
that Life are visible; or, as the Orator saith
of a goodly Structure, <hi>fastigia spectantur,
latent fundament.</hi> So the most <hi>primitive</hi> and
<hi>vital Graces</hi> are in themselves known onely
to God, and to the Heart which enjoyes
them; but in and by their <hi>fruits</hi> they may,
and must be known unto men. By our
Works we must shew our Faith, <hi>Iam. 2. 18.
Act. 19. 18. Works,</hi> I mean, of <hi>transient
Charity,</hi> which properly termimate upon
others, without us; In which respect our
Saviour, though he forbid us to <hi>do our
Works to be seen of men,</hi> in a way of Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Matth. 6. 1. 6. 16.â€”18.</hi> yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us to <hi>let our Light shine before men,</hi>
in a way of Edification, and to God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. and in order to the Same
End, the Apostle here requireth us to <hi>let

and a <hi>Christian duty</hi> from thence inferred, <hi>Let

an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to the Exercise of a Special
Grace, and a most <hi>Solemn Argument,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi> In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
is observable, 1. The <hi>vertue</hi> it

for the Abstract, not without an Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
as I take it. Sometimes we finde a
Concrete Superlative expressed by an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,

O Pride,</hi> that is, O thou most proud: and here
an Extensive Abstract expressed by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
as if he should have said, Let
your Tongue, your Hand, your whole
Conversation shew forth to all men, upon
all occasions, this excellent and most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Grace. 2. The Peculiarity or Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteristical

in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, not a bare Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical,
but a <hi>Christian moderation,</hi> such
as becomes Believers. 3. The Conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
thereof, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, let it be really up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions manifested, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christ, and Credit of Religion.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48972:4"/>
4. The <hi>Impartiality</hi> of it, It must be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
<hi>to all men;</hi> not onely unto good
men, but unto the froward, that the mouths
of Adversaries may be stopped, their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
refuted, their Emnities broken, and
they won by the meek and humble Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Believers to the obedience of the
Gospell.</p>
            <p>In the Argument unto this Duty, it is
considerable, how many wayes the Lord
is near unto his Servants, for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in so difficult and excellent a
Duty; near, <hi>ad Auxilium,</hi> to Help them;
near, <hi>ad Solatium,</hi> to Comfort them; near,
<hi>ad Iudicium,</hi> to Reward them; near, <hi>per
Inhabitantem Gratiam,</hi> to direct and enable
them; near, <hi>per Exauditionis Clementiam,</hi>
to Hear and Answer them; near, <hi>per Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae
oeconomiam,</hi> to Support and Protect
them.</p>
            <p>1. Believers are called unto an high and
honourable Condition, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>dignity</hi>
of being the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> John 1. 12. and in
that Condition they may, by the power of
Corruption and Temptation, be in danger
to be puffed up with pride and arrogancy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48972:4"/>
above others, and to a supineness and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Living, to sever their Dignity from
their Duty: In this Case <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, that is, as
<hi>Suidas, Hesychius,</hi> and <hi>Favorinus</hi> render it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, that which is
decent or becoming, is to be known; we
must walk <hi>secundum decentiam status Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
so as becometh the sanctity and dignity
of our High Calling.</p>
            <p>2. Again, being in common with other
men expos'd to the <hi>various vicissitudes</hi> of
Events; apt in Prosperity to be corrupted, in
Adversity to be dejected, and according to
diversity of Conditions, to express a <hi>dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar</hi>
and <hi>uneven behaviour;</hi> here again,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let your Moderation be known,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, a serene, pacate, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
equability of minde, unshaken and fixed
against all Events.</p>
            <p>3. Again, being by the state of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and by reason of the <hi>Emnity</hi> which
God hath put between the <hi>seed of the Woman</hi>
and the <hi>seed of the Serpent,</hi> to expect, as
<hi>Strangers</hi> in the midst of Adversaries, <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
afflictions</hi> and injuries, as the Scripture
hath assured us, <hi>Act. 14. 22. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Tim.</hi> 3. 12.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48972:5"/>
Here also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let your Moderation be
known,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, Moderation of <hi>patience</hi>
in bearing Evils; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
a Moderation of <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Equanimity;</hi> not
putting suspicious and morose, but favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
constructions upon Actions which have
an appearance of unkindness; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
a Moderation of <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability,</hi>
an easiness to be entreated, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to forgive; as the Philosopher saith of
such men, that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, apt to pass
by, and to pardon Injuries.</p>
            <p>4. Again, having with other men a
<hi>share and right in publick Iustice,</hi> and out of
the debt of <hi>Self-love,</hi> being engaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to preserve <hi>our own Interests,</hi> we may be
tempted to <hi>rigour</hi> and extremity in the
means thereunto, and to lay hold on the
utmost advantages against our <hi>Brother:</hi>
Here also the Exhortation is seasonable,
that <hi>our Moderation be known;</hi> that we be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ready to part from our own right, than
to prosecute it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, with the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a rigorous inflexibility; and so the
Philosopher saith, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
a supplying of the defect, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48972:5"/>
a rectifying and mitigating of the rigour of
Legal Justice.</p>
            <p>5. Again, because we have the Human
Nature burthened with the <hi>same common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
and are of like passions with other
men, we may be easily tempted and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
many wayes <hi>into inordinateness and
excess;</hi> we may use <hi>our knowledge and liberty
undecently and exorbitantly,</hi> to the defiling
of our Selves; we may use them <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,</hi>
to the grief and scandal of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Rom. 14.
15, 21. 1 Cor. 8. 9, 12. 10. 23, 28, 29, 32.
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 16. we may use <hi>our power</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
sharply and severely, to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
rather than benefiting our poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
in all such Cases the Apostle's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
is seasonable, <hi>Let your Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </gap>; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

Moderation of <hi>Passions,</hi> not to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with excessive delights, overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with inordinate sorrows, or posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with any other unruly or tempestuous
affection, to the suffocating of Reason, and
dishonour of Religion; but to let Grace
and Wisdom hold the reins, and keep within
just bounds of Temper and Sobriety what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
offers to break forth into undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and excess. We see the wide extent and
comprehensivenesse of this most amiable
Grace. Give me leave to speak a word or
two to each of these Particulars, and then I
shall proceed to that which follows.</p>
            <p>1. We must walk <hi>secundum decentiam &amp;
dignitatem status Christiani,</hi> so as becomes
the <hi>Gospell,</hi> that we may credit and honour
our most holy Profession, as those who have
<hi>a Lord</hi> to rejoyce in, <hi>a God</hi> to pray unto,
<hi>a Blessed appearing</hi> of a Glorious Saviour to
wait for, <hi>as a People</hi> whom God hath <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for himself, to shew forth his praise,</hi> Isai.
43. 21. This is the frequent Exhortation
of the Apostle, that we <hi>walk worthy of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48972:6"/>
Vocation wherewith we are called,</hi> Eph. 4. 1.
<hi>as becometh the Gospel of Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. 27.
So as we have <hi>learned and received Christ
Iesus the Lord,</hi> Col. 2. 6. <hi>worthy of God,</hi>
who hath called us to his Kingdom and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 12. as <hi>becometh Holyness,</hi> as a
<hi>peculiar People,</hi> that we may <hi>adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> Tit. 2.
3, 10, 14. and may <hi>shew forth the praises of
him, who hath called us out of Darkness into his
marvelous Light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. And truly
there is nothing deserveth such Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this, to consider how few there are
who live consonantly to the Gospel; which
will too evidently appear, if we consider the
<hi>Law of Christ,</hi> the <hi>vow of Baptisme,</hi> and
compare our Conversations with them.
Are not these the Laws of Christ? He that
<hi>hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer;</hi> He that
<hi>looketh on a Woman lustfully, is an Adulterer;</hi>
that we <hi>Resist not Evill;</hi> that we <hi>love our
Enemies;</hi> that <hi>we lay not up for our selves
Treasures in Earth, but in Heaven;</hi> that we
<hi>enter in at the strait Gate;</hi> that He who will
come after him, must <hi>deny himself, and take
up his Cross and follow him;</hi> that we <hi>learn
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48972:7"/>
of him to be meek and lowly, who when he was
reviled, reviled not again; when he suffred, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not:</hi> In one word, that we should <hi>walk
as he walked,</hi> and <hi>observe all things</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath commanded us? and have we
not <hi>solemnly vowed all this</hi> in our <hi>Baptisme?</hi>
wherein we promised to keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
towards God, and did in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God and Angels <hi>renounce</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
the World, and the Flesh, with all
their pomps, vanities, and lusts? and so
not onely subscribe to the truth, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the practice of those necessary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?
And if we should now compare
the Lives of Men amongst us, their bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
and open Profaneness, their daring
Atheisme and Blasphemy, their Oaths and
Curses, their Luxuries and Excesses, their
Wantonness and Impurities, their Variance
and Wrath, their Contentions and Defian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
their Bloodshed and Duels, their Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableness
and Revenge, their inordinate
love of the profits and pleasure of the World
more than of God, their utter unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the Yoke of Christ, and the
narrow way that leadeth unto Life; if,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48972:7"/>
I say, we should lay together Christ's Laws,
and our Lives, our most solemn Vow, and
our most perfidious violations of it, might we
not most confidently conclude, <hi>aut haec non
est Lex Christi, aut nos non sumus Christiani?</hi>
Either this is not <hi>Christianity,</hi> or we are not
<hi>Christians?</hi> and so <hi>Tertullian, Iustin Martyr,</hi>
and other Antients are bold to affirm of
such men, That they are not Christians.
<hi>Ioannes Picus Mirandula</hi> professed, That he
had an amazement upon him, when he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
considered the Studies, or rather
Follies of Men: For, saith he, a Madness
it is for Men not to believe the Gospel;
which hath been sealed by the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
published by the <hi>preaching</hi> of <hi>Apostles,</hi>
confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> attested by the
<hi>World,</hi> confessed by <hi>Devils: Sed longe major
insania, si de Evangelii veritate non dubitas, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
tamen quasi de ejus falsitate non dubitares.</hi>
But a farr greater Madness it is, if not
doubting of the truth of the Gospel, we so
live as if we doubted not of the falseness of
it. And certainly, they who abuse the
Doctrine of the Gospel unto licencious
Living, and expose the holy Name of God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48972:8"/>
unto Contempt, by turning his Grace into
Lasciviousness, are <hi>Christiani nominis probra
&amp; Maculae,</hi> the stain and dishonour, the
blains and ulcers of the Christian<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Name, no
otherwise belonging unto the body of
Christ, than dung and excrements to the
Natural body If the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
would often look on his Gray Hairs,
that he might be put in minde to do nothing
unworthy the honour of them; how much
more should we continually minde the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of our Relation unto God, as his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
that we never admit any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
the Excellency of so High a
Calling.</p>
            <p>2ly. Being in danger by the different
<hi>vicissitudes</hi> of divine providence, to be tossed
and discomposed with various and unequal
Affections, contrary to that stedfastness of
Heart which ought alwayes to be in <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
who have an all-sufficient God to
rejoyce in, and a Treasure of <hi>exceeding
great and precious Promises,</hi> (able by
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> to ballance the Soul against
all Secular Fluctuations and Concussions) to
take Comfort from, In this Case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48972:8"/>
it is necessary that <hi>our Moderation be
known,</hi> that we learn, with the Apostle,
in <hi>every state to be content,</hi> to be <hi>abased</hi> and
suffer need without pusillanimity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency,
to <hi>abound</hi> and be full without
arrogance or vain-glory. <hi>Faith makes a
Rich man rejoyce in that he is made low</hi> and
humbled, to glory no longer in Grass and
Flowers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in withering and perishing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents;
and it makes the <hi>Brother of Low degree
to rejoyce in that he is exalted to the hope of
Salvation,</hi> Jam. 1. 9, 10. When therefore,
with <hi>David,</hi> we finde one while <hi>our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
strong,</hi> and presently we are <hi>moved,</hi> Psal.
36. 6. when one day, with <hi>Ionah,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in our Gourd, and another day are as
angry because it is withered; then we must
<hi>labour for this</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, this pacateness and
serenity of Soul; <hi>like Gold,</hi> to keep our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the fire, <hi>like Celestial Bodies,</hi> which
in all their Motions are regular and steady.
Even Heathen men, by the dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Philosophy, have arrived at a very
noble Constancy and Composednesse of
Minde; of one, it is said, That in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
Times, I and Places, <hi>suos semper
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48972:9"/>
Mores retinuit,</hi> he never departed nor varied
from himself; of another, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
observed either to <hi>laugh</hi> or <hi>weep;</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that he was of so equal a Temper,
that in his Youth, he had the wisedom of
an Old Man, and in his Age the valour of a
Young man; and of that excellent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> it is observed by <hi>Dion,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, that he was ever like
himself, never given to change. How
much more should <hi>Christians,</hi> who have an
unchangeable God to take care of them,
a Kingdom which <hi>cannot be shaken</hi> provided
for them, <hi>Promises</hi> which are all <hi>yea and
Amen,</hi> and an <hi>Hope</hi> which is sure and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
set before them, retain a minde like
the Rock on which they are built, fixed and
inconcussible. Such was the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>as dying, and yet alive; as chastened,
and yet not killed; as sorrowfull, yet alwayes
rejoycing; as having nothing, and yet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all things:</hi> and such he would have us
all to be, <hi>stedfast and unmoveable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
58. <hi>not soon shaken in minde,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 2.
but <hi>holding our Confidence, and the rejoycing of
our Hope firm unto the end,</hi> Heb. 3. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48972:9"/>
3. Being, by the Condition of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
to expect manifold Afflictions and
Injuries in the World; Here also it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that our <hi>Moderation be known;</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>Patience,</hi> in bearing them; of
<hi>Candor,</hi> in interpreting them; and of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and meekness, in forgiving them.</p>
            <p>1. Moderation of <hi>Patience</hi> in bearing
them, having our Eye more fixed on the
hand of God ordering, than on the hand
of Man infflicting them; being more taken
up with the Hope of Future Good, than
with the Sense of Present Evil; looking
rather with Comfort on the <hi>need</hi> we have
of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. on the <hi>fruit</hi> we have
from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. on the <hi>Recompence</hi>
of the Reward which will follow them,
<hi>Heb. 11. 25, 26. Rom.</hi> 8. 17, 18. on <hi>the love
of God,</hi> which will <hi>support</hi> us under them,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. on our <hi>Communion</hi> in them <hi>with
Christ,</hi> for whose sake we suffer them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
4. 13. on <hi>the End of the Lord,</hi> who is ever
pittifull and of tender mercy to us, in them,
<hi>Iam</hi> 5. 11. than on any present weight or
pressure we sustain from them. <hi>Nullus dolor
est de incursione<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Malorum praesentium quibus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducia
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48972:10"/>
est futurorum Bonorum,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi>
A Man is never miserable by any
thing, which cannot take away God or
Salvation from him.</p>
            <p>2. Moderation of <hi>Candor</hi> and Equanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
putting the best Constructions on them,
as the Carpenter's Plain rendreth rugged
things smooth, as favourable Glasses report
Faces better than they are. A meek Spirit
doth not easily take up every Injury, not
out of <hi>dullness,</hi> because it cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; but out of <hi>love,</hi> which doth
not wittingly or hastily suspect Evil, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 5. which <hi>covereth all Sinnes,</hi> Prov. 10.
12. which teacheth us to <hi>shew all meekness
to all men,</hi> Tit. 3. 2. we are <hi>prohibited Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with some men,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. 6. but we are
<hi>commanded to follow Peace with All,</hi> Heb.
12. 14.</p>
            <p>3. Moderation of <hi>Meekness</hi> and Lenity,
not resisting of Evill; nor out of a vindictive
Spirit, embracing all advantages to avenge
our Selves, as if it were an Argument of a
low and dejected Soul not to repay Evil
with Evil, and bid a defiance and challenge
upon every Wrong; directly contrary to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48972:10"/>
the Word of God, which maketh it a
<hi>man's wisedom and glory to pass over a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi>
Prov. 19. 11. and expressly requireth
us <hi>not to recompence Evil, but to wait on God,</hi>
Prov. 20. 22. Rom. 12. 17. yea contrary
to the noble practice of many magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Heathens, <hi>Epaminondas, Agesilaus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,
Caesar,</hi> and others, who by their cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and bounty toward Enemies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for their own Safety, and made the
way easie unto further victories. But we
have a more excellent Example to follow,
<hi>forbearing one another, and forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>even as Christ forgave
you, so also do ye,</hi> Col 3. 13. that man can
have no assurance of Christs forgiving him,
who resolveth to be avenged on his Brother,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 35. He who choseth rather to be
a Murtherer, to take away another Mans
life, or to throw away his own, than to
suffer a Reproach, hath, give me leave to
say it, <hi>eousque,</hi> renounced the Doctrine of
Christ, who commandeth us <hi>to do good unto
those that hate us, and pray for those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully
use us,</hi> Matth 5. 44. <hi>as himself did,</hi>
Luke 23. 34. who <hi>being reviled reviled nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48972:11"/>
again,</hi> but was as <hi>a Sheep dumbe before the
Shearer,</hi> as the Prophet speaks. By this
<hi>noble Moderation</hi> we disappoint those that
wrong us, <hi>quia fructus Laedentis in dolore laesi
est,</hi> we fence our selves against the harm
which an Injury would do us, as a Canon
bullet is deaded by a soft Mudd wall, and
the force of a Sword by a pack of Wooll.
He that is <hi>slow to anger appeaseth strife,</hi> Prov.
15. 18. We melt and overcome our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<hi>and heap coals of fire on his head,</hi>
Rom. 12. 20. But above all we honour
God, to whom alone Vengeance belongeth,
we adorn the Gospel, and evidence our
selves to be the Disciples of Christ.</p>
            <p>4. Being subject, by the dictates of overmuch
<hi>Self-love,</hi> to assert with <hi>rigour</hi> our own
Right and Interest, in this Case also the
Precept is necessary, <hi>Let your Moderation be
known;</hi> rather <hi>remit</hi> of your own Due, than
by too earnest an exacting of it, to grieve
your <hi>Brother,</hi> or to discredit your <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Abraham</hi> did so, though the nobler
Person, yet in order unto Peace and Honor,
that their Dissentions might not expose
Religion unto reproach amongst the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48972:11"/>
he gave unto <hi>Lot</hi> the praeoption of
what part of the Land he would live in, <hi>Gen.
13.</hi> 9. It was as free for the Apostle to have
taken the Rewards of his Ministry of the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> as of other Churches, yet he
purposely refused to use that power, that
he might not hinder the Gospel, nor give
occasion of glorying against him unto those
that sought it, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 12, 14, 15. 2 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.
8, 12 Our Saviour,</hi> though he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on the dignity of his Person, as the
Sonne of God, from paying Tribute, yet
to avoid offence he did <hi>Cedere de Iure,</hi> and
gave order about the payment of it, <hi>Matth.
17.</hi> 24, 25, 26. No doubt is to be made,
but that it is free for Christians to recover
their Just Rights by a <hi>legal tryal,</hi> yet when
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sued one another before Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
and thereby exposed the Gospel
unto Contempt, the Apostle reproveth
them <hi>that they did not rather take wrong, and
suffer themselves to be defrauded;</hi> the Evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farr less for them to suffer <hi>wrong,</hi> than
for the Gospel to suffer <hi>reproach,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.
5, 6, 7. Thus doth this most amiable Grace
whereby we behave our Selves towards all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48972:12"/>
Men with all Equity, Facility, Equanimity,
and Suavity of Conversation, <hi>attempering</hi> the
<hi>severity</hi> of other Vertues with the Law of
Love, exceedingly conduce to the <hi>honour</hi> of
God, and <hi>credit</hi> of the Gospel, yea to our <hi>own
safety</hi> and <hi>interest;</hi> for as a Tempest doth
not break the <hi>Corn</hi> which yields unto it, but
the <hi>Oaks</hi> which withstand it, nor Thunder
so easily hurt <hi>Shrubs</hi> as <hi>Cedars,</hi> So the wrath
and prejudice of Adversaries is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mitigated and abated by the Humility,
Moderation and Meeknesse of those that
suffer them.</p>
            <p>Lastly. Being subject to the <hi>same common
Passions and Infirmities</hi> with other Men, and
thereupon lyable to be transported into
Excess in the use either of our Knowledge,
Power or Liberty; here also comes in the
seasonable use of this excellent Precept,
<hi>Let your Moderation be known.</hi> Moderation
of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> Moderation of <hi>Power,</hi> and
Moderation of <hi>Passions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Moderation of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that we
suffer not our <hi>Knowledge to puff us up,</hi> but
<hi>temper</hi> it as the Apostle directeth us with
<hi>Charity,</hi> and use it unto <hi>Edification, 1 Cor.</hi> 8.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48972:12"/>
1. I do not hereby understand Moderation
in the <hi>measure</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of our <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
as if we should content our Selves with a
Mediocrity, and be, at our own choyse, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
Ignorant of any part of God's reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will, as we please our selves; for we are
required to <hi>grow in Knowledge, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 18.
and the Word of Christ must <hi>dwell in us
richly,</hi> Col 3. 16. Nor do I understand a
Moderation of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> as if it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
not what Judgement we were of, but
had, as the <hi>Priscilianists</hi> claimed, a Liberty
at pleasure to depart from the Rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth in Outward Profession, to serve
a present Interest; for we are to <hi>buy the
Truth, and not to sell it; We can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truth, but for it; We are to hold fast
the Faithfull Word,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. and having
<hi>proved all things, to hold fast that which is
good,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 21. But by a Moderation
in Judgement, I understand these three
Things:</p>
            <p>1. A Moderation of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> not to break
in and gaze upon hidden and secret things,
as the men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> into the Ark, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. nor to weary our Selves <hi>about
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48972:13"/>
Questions,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, which are
unprofitable and vain, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 9. such as that
of <hi>Peter, What shall this Man do?</hi> John 21.
21. and that of the Apostles, <hi>Wilt thou now
restore the Kingdom unto</hi> Israel? <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6.
But to be wise <hi>unto Sobriety,</hi> Rom. 12. 3.
and to content our Selves with things Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and leave Secret things unto God,
Deut. 29. 29. <hi>in quem sic Cred<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

Saint <hi>Austin, ut aliqua non aperiri etiam pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santibus
nullo modo adversus eum murmurare
debeamus.</hi> And therefore that good Father
Gave no other Answer to a curious Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than this modest one, <hi>Nescio quod Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scio,</hi>
as Judging an humble Ignorance much
better than a proud Curiosity.</p>
            <p>2. A Moderation of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi>
not to be so opinionative or tenacious of
our own private, meerly disputable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical
Conceptions, wholly unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Faith, Worship, or Obedience, as out
of a love of them, not onely to undervalue
and despise the as probable and sober
Judgements of other Men, but by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
and unadvised publishing of them,
to obtrude them with over confidence on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48972:13"/>
the belief of others, and haply thereby to
cause a great disturbance in the Church of
God, directly contrary to the Counsel of
the Apostle, <hi>Hast thou Faith, have it to thy
self before God,</hi> Rom. 14. 22. It is not fit
that the peace of the Church should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
by the bold attempts of every da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Pen. Of this sort was that unhappy
Controversie in the dayes of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi>

touching the time of <hi>Easter,</hi> who though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

Churches did differ from one another in

and Communion still.</p>
            <p>3. Moderation of <hi>Charity,</hi> when in such
things wherein a <hi>latitude</hi> and mutual Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
may be allowed, we choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48972:14"/>
according to the Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
not to offend our weak Brethren,
than unseasonably to insist on our own
Knowledge and Liberty. And truly as it
is an <hi>Honour</hi> which Learned men owe unto
one another, to allow a liberty of Dissent
in Matters of mere opinion, <hi>SalvÃ¢ compage
Fidei, Salvo vinculo Charitatis, SalvÃ¢ pace
Ecclesiae,</hi> (for those three, <hi>Faith, Love,</hi>
and <hi>Peace,</hi> are still to be preserved:) so
it is a <hi>Charity</hi> which Good men owe unto
one another, upon the same <hi>Salvo's,</hi> to
bear with the Infirmities of each other, not
to judge, or despise, or set at nought our
Brethren, as useless and inconsiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but whom God is pleased to receive
into His Favour, not to cast them out of
Ours. This <hi>Latitude</hi> and Moderation of
Judgement, some Learned men have taken
the freedom to extend even to the Case of

I shall not take upon me to affix any private
sense of mine upon Publick Laws, or ever
judge it desirable, that the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> should have too slack a
tye on the Judgement of the Clergy; onely
sure I am in Points which are not <hi>Fidei</hi> but
<hi>Questionum</hi> (as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> distinguisheth)
in Matters of an inferiour nature, wherein
no Man can rationally hold himself bound
to trouble or discompose the Mindes of the
People, or the Order and Peace of the
Church, by an unnecessary publishing of
his own private Perswasion, so that his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and the Churches Quiet may be very
well consistent together, Learned men
have ever allowed this latitude unto one
another.</p>
            <p>2. Moderation of <hi>Power,</hi> by gentle and
winning wayes, to reform the Manners,
allay the Distempers, and conquer the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
of inconstant and discontented
Mindes; by placide and leasurely steps and
degrees to get the possession of them, and to
model and compose them unto an Equal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48972:15"/>
temper. This was the Counsel of the Old
men, <hi>Speak good unto them and they will be thy
Servants for ever,</hi> 1 Reg. 12. 7. as Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is by grave and prudent men obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be the <hi>preservative of Power;</hi> So <hi>Cato</hi>
in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Oration which he made unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in <hi>Dion:</hi> so certainly it is a special
means for the <hi>Right administration</hi> of it.
Therefore the Lord chose <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>meekest
man alive</hi> for the Government of his Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 3. and of <hi>Christ</hi> the
Prince of Peace it is said, that <hi>he would not
break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking
flax,</hi> Matth. 12. 20. as he saith of himself,
<hi>Learn of me for I am meek and lowly,</hi> Matth.
11. 29. and the Apostle beseecheth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
by the <hi>Meekness and Gentleness of
Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 1. so the same Apostle
expresseth his <hi>tenderness</hi> towards the Church,
by the affections sometimes of a <hi>Father, 1
Cor.</hi> 4. 15. Sometimes of a <hi>Mother,</hi> Gal. 4.
19. Sometimes of a <hi>Nurse,</hi> 1 Thess. 2. 7. He
calleth upon <hi>Timothy, In meekness to instruct
those that oppose themselves, because the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Lord must be Gentle to all men,</hi> 2
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48972:15"/>
Tim. 2. 24, 25. and upon <hi>Titus, to shew all
Meekness to all men,</hi> Tit. 3. 2. <hi>Rulers</hi> are called
<hi>Healers,</hi> Isai. 3. 7. and a Physician, saith
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> will if it may be cure the Disease
of his Patient rather by Sleep and Diet, than
by strong Purges. Grave Writers have
observed, that even in the avenging of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Enemies Moderation is advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Conqueror. He, saith <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
who is kinde to an Enemy provideth
for his own Safety; and surely it cannot but
be usefull for Healing Distempers, amongst
a long dilacerated and discomposed People,
<hi>ut quod Belli calamitas introduxit, hoc Pacis
Lenitas sopiret,</hi> to use the words of <hi>Iustinian</hi>
the Emperor. A course observed with rare
clemency by our <hi>most Meek</hi> and <hi>Gracious
Soveraign</hi> in the <hi>Act of General Pardon and
Indempnity</hi> towards his People.</p>
            <p>I do often sadly recount with my self the
<hi>wofull distractions</hi> which are in this once flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Church, occasion'd by the <hi>wantonness</hi>
of some, and <hi>subtilty</hi> of others, and can scarce
arrive at any other Expedient than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
Iehovah Iireh,</hi> Gen. 22. 14. I do not
need at all, neither shall I at all presume
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48972:16"/>
to bespeak the <hi>Reverend Governors</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> in this Case of Moderation, in any
other way than the Apostle doth the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
in the Case of <hi>Brotherly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Love.</hi> As
touching Moderation <hi>ye need not that I write
unto you, for you your selves are taught of God
to shew all meekness to all men, and to restore
those that are overtaken in a fault with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Meekness, and indeed you do it.</hi> One
thing I assure my self would greatly conduce
to the Healing of our Divisions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of many unto the Communion of
the Church who have departed from it, If
all the other Ministers of the Gospel in their
respective Places would every where preach
the Word with that Soundness, Evidence,
and Authority, and so commend themselves
to every man's Conscience in the sight of
God, reproving Sinne not with Passion,
Wrath, and Animosity, but with the Spirit
of Meekness, and by the Majesty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Word; (which alone can
convince and awe the Conscience) would
lead such holy, peaceable, and inoffensive
Lives, would treat all men with that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
meekness, and winning Converse,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48972:16"/>
that all who see and hear them may know
that God is in them of a truth, that they
do indeed love the Peoples Souls, and so
faithfully discharge their Trust, as those
that do in good earnest resolve to save
themselves and those that hear them. Thus
are all the Interests of a Christian Church
by all the Officers therein, to be managed
and preserved with that <hi>wisedom which is
from above,</hi> which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, is
<hi>first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
full of mercy and good works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partiality, and without hypocrisie, whereby
the fruit of Righteousness is sowen in peace of
them that seek Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Moderation of <hi>Passion,</hi> when we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not our Passions to anticipate right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or run beyond the dictates of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
judgement, when they flye not out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their due measure, nor transport us
unto any undecency or excess, when they
do not <hi>like a troubled Sea cast up mire and dirt;</hi>
but are like the shaking of clean Water in a
Christal Glass, which onely troubleth it,
but doth not defile it. For this purpose
we must keep <hi>sanctified Reason</hi> alwayes in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48972:17"/>
the Throne; The higher and more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Soul is, the more sedate and calm it
will be, <hi>Inferiora fulminant, Pacem Summa
tenent.</hi> We must get the Heart ballanced
with such Graces as may in special manner
establish it against perturbation of Passion,
with clearness of Reason, serenity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
strength of Wisedom, sobriety and
gentleness of Spirit, humility and lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Minde, (for ever the more Proud,
the more Passionate) with Self-denial;
for all Impotency of Affections is rooted in
an inordinate <hi>Self-love;</hi> This will transport
a man to furious Anger, to insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to excessive Delights, to discruciating
Fears, to impatient Hopes, to tormenting
Sorrows, to gnawing Emulations, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
Despairs. <hi>The Heart,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>is established by Grace,</hi> Heb. 13. 9.</p>
            <p>We have thus largely considered the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
here required, which the Apostle would
further have to be <hi>such a Moderation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
them as Christians.</hi> And therefore the
Precept is closed in on all sides of the Text
with certain <hi>peculiarities</hi> of Christians,
<hi>Rejoycing in the Lord,</hi> Verse 4. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48972:17"/>
what can befall a man to shake and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
his Heart, who hath a Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to rejoyce in? <hi>nearness of that Lord,
the Lord is at hand;</hi> And what is there in all
the World, the beauty whereof can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
with Inordinate Love, the evil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
can tempt to Immoderate Fears the
Heart which can by Faith see Christ coming
quickly with <hi>a farr more exceeding and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
weight of glory? An access in Prayer
and Supplication unto the Throne of Grace,</hi> v. 6.
And what Evils can disquiet the Heart of
that Man with anxious, excessive, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating
Cares, who hath the bosome of a
Father in Heaven to powre out his Requests
into? Lastly, <hi>the peace of God which passeth
all understanding;</hi> and what Perturbations
are able to storm such a Soul as is garrison'd
with Divine peace? There is a mere <hi>philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Moderation, quae mimice affectat veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks. But <hi>Christian
Moderation</hi> is that which is <hi>founded in the Law
of Christ;</hi> which requireth us <hi>not to resist
Evil, to love our Enemies, to Bless them that
Curse us, to do Good unto those that Hate us,
to recompence to no man Evil for Evil, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48972:18"/>
weep as though we wept not, and to rejoyce as
though we rejoyced not.</hi> It is founded in <hi>the
love of Christ,</hi> the sense and comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ballanceth the Soul against the assault of
any other Perturbations. It is <hi>Regulated by
the Example of Christ,</hi> of whom we learn to
be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> to forbear and to forgive,
<hi>who when he was reviled reviled not again,</hi>
who prayed for his Persecutors, and saved
them by that Blood which their own hands
had shed. It is <hi>wrought by the spirit of Christ,</hi>
the fruits whereof are <hi>Love, Ioy, Peace, Long-suffering,
Gentleness, Goodness, Meekness,</hi> as
the Apostle speaks. It is <hi>ordered to the glory
of Christ,</hi> and honour of Christianity,
when by our Moderation we adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God our Saviour, <hi>being blameless,
and harmless, the Sons of God without rebuke,
shining as Lights in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this End it is that the Apostle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
this Moderation of theirs <hi>to be known,</hi>
not as the Philosophers and Heathen shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Vertues for Vain-glory, Ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Interest, as <hi>Gloriae Animalia, &amp;
Negociatores Famae,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls them:
But that <hi>others seeing our good Works may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48972:18"/>
God in the day of Visitation;</hi> for if they
who profess Obedience to the Rule of Christ
in the Gospel live dissonantly from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
of that Rule, they do not onely
<hi>harden wicked men</hi> in their Sinnes, but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the name of God</hi> and his Doctrine unto
Reproach, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom. 2.
23, 24. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 1. as <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David,</hi>
that by his Sinne he had caused <hi>the Enemies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
of God to blaspheme,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 14. So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and illogical is Malice, as to charge
those Sinnes, which are aberrations from the
Doctrine of Christianity, upon the Doctrine
it self, as genuine Products and Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof. The Moralist hath observed,
that the antient Grecians called a Man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, Light, teaching him so to live as to be
a Light unto others. Sure I am the Apostle
hath told us, that though we were by nature
<hi>Darkness,</hi> yet we are <hi>Light in the Lord,</hi> and
therefore should walk as <hi>Children of Light,</hi>
and <hi>shine as Lights in the World,</hi> Eph. 5. 8.
Phil. 2. <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>5.</p>
            <p>Lastly. As it must be <hi>known,</hi> so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
known <hi>unto All Men;</hi> It must be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Hypocrisie,</hi> not attempered to Interests
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48972:19"/>
and Designs, like the Devotion of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
who <hi>for a pretence made long Prayers;</hi> like
the Civilities of <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> of whom
the Historian saith, That he did <hi>Adorare
vulgum, jacere oscula, &amp; omnia serviliter pro
Dominatione.</hi> It must be <hi>without partiality,</hi> not
varied or diversified according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Persons with whom we have to do.
We Christians, saith <hi>Tertullian, Nullum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
sub exceptione Personarum administramus.</hi>
It must be known <hi>to our Brethren,</hi> that they
may be edified; it must be known <hi>to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
that their Prejudices may be removed,
their Mouths stopped, their Hostilities aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their Hearts mollified and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to entertain more just and honourable
thoughts of those Precepts of the Gospel by
which our Conversations are directed.</p>
            <p>Many and weighty are the Arguments
which might be used to perswade all sober,
pious and prudent Christians unto the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of this most excellent Grace. They
may be drawn from Our <hi>great Exemplar and
Pattern,</hi> whom though we finde once with
a Curse against a barren Figg-tree, once with
a Scourge against Prophaners of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48972:19"/>
House, once with Woes against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and incorrigible Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
yet generally All his Sermons were
Blessings, all his Miracles Mercies, all his
Conversation meek, lowly, humble, gentle,
not suited so much to the greatness and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Divine Person, as to the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of his Office, wherein he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>of no reputation, but took upon him the
form of a Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From a principal Character of a Disciple
of Christ, <hi>Humility and Self-denial,</hi> which
teacheth us not onely to moderate, but to
abandon our own Judgements, Wills, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Interests, when ever they stand in
Competition with the Glory of Christ, and
welfare of his Church, which maketh <hi>the
same minde be in us which was in Christ Iesus,</hi>
to look <hi>not every man on his own things, but
every man on the things of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Credit and Honour of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
which is greatly beautified by the
meekness and moderation of those that
profess it. Hereby we walk <hi>worthy of our
Calling,</hi> or as those who make it their work
to shew forth the worth and dignity of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48972:20"/>
Christian Profession, when we walk in <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness,
meekness, long-suffering, unity, and love,</hi>
Eph. 4. 1, 2, 3. as the splendour of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Court is set forth by the Robes and fine
Rayments of their Servants, <hi>Matth. 11. 8.
2 Sam.</hi> 13. 18. So the Servants of Christ
shew forth the Honour and Excellency of
their Lord, by being <hi>cloathed with Humility,</hi>
1 Pet 5. 5: and decked with the <hi>Ornament of
a meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>From the Breaches, Divisions, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composures
which are at any time in the
Church or State; towards the Healing of
which Distempers Moderation, Meekness,
and Humility, do exceedingly conduce;
though sharp things are used <hi>to search wounds,</hi>
yet Balm and Lenitives are the Medicines
that heal them; as <hi>Morter,</hi> a soft thing, is
used to knit and binde other things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is observed by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
of <hi>Proclus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
that being a Man of singular lenity and
meekness, he did thereby preserve intire
the Dignity of the Church, and by his
special prudence healed a very great Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Church, bringing back unto the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48972:20"/>
Communion thereof those who had depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it.</p>
            <p>From the various vicissitudes and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancies
of Human Events, whereby many
times it cometh to pass, that things which for
the present are judged very needfull and
profitable, prove inconvenient and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for the future, as <hi>Polybius</hi> hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Hereby we may in all Conditions be
taught Moderation, not to faint or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in the day of Adversity, because God
can raise us again; nor to swell or wax
Impotent with Prosperity<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because God can
as easily depress us. It was a wise Speech
of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Ambassadours unto
the <hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Thucydides;</hi> That they
who have had many alternations and vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes
of Good and Evil, cannot but deem
it Equal to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, diffident
and moderate in their Prosperity; as <hi>Coenus</hi>
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> said unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> That
nothing did better become him, than
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Arrian</hi> tells us.
And so on the other hand, this Grace of
Moderation doth so poize and ballance the
heart with Christian Constancy and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48972:21"/>
that it is not easily tossed or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
by any Tempest; but, as they say
of the Palm tree, beareth up above all the
difficulties that would depresse it; as good
<hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> when he was distressed with a
great multitude of Adversaries, said in his
Prayer to God; <hi>We have no might against
this great Company that cometh against us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know we what to do; but our eyes are upon
thee,</hi> 2 Chron<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 20. 12.</p>
            <p>Lastly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> From the Nearness of Christ,
which is the Apostles Argument in the
Text, <hi>The Lord is at hand. Prope ad Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
Near to help us, <hi>The Lord is nigh
unto all that call upon him,</hi> Psal. 145. 18. Deut.
4. 7. We have no sufficiency of our selves to
improve any Talent, to manage any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to use our Knowledge or Liberty,
our Power or Prosperity to the Honour of
God, or Service of his Church, no power to
rejoyce in Adversity, to forgive Injury, to
correct the exorbitancy of any inordinate
and irregular Passion. Only we have a <hi>Lord
Near</hi> unto us, his Eye upon us to see our
Wants, his Ear open to hear our Desires,
his Grace present to assist our Duties, his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48972:21"/>
Comforts at hand to support our Hearts, his
Power and Providence continually ready
to protect our Persons, to vindicate our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
to allay the wrath, and rebuke the
attempts of any that would harm us. This
is one Principal cause of all our Impatiency
and Perturbation, that we are so soon
shaken and discomposed with every Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
so soon posed with every Difficulty,
that we do soon despond under every Storm,
Because we do not with an Eye of Faith look
up unto God as one that Careth for us,
and is ever near at hand as a Sun and a
Shield, a Sanctuary and an Hiding Place to
secure us against all our Fears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prope ad judicium,</hi> Near to judge us,
to take a Full and Impartiall Review of all
that is done by us, and accordingly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
either <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Trouble,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks. This is a Fundamentall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which we all avow as an Article of the
Christian Faith. <hi>Act. 17. 13. Rom. 14. 10.
2. Cor</hi> 5. 10. That Christ shall Come as the
Ordained Officer to whom all Judgement is
Committed, in flaming Fire, attended with
all the Holy Angels; <hi>Matth. 25. 31<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 2. Thess.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48972:22"/>
1. 7, 8. Iud.</hi> 10. 14, 15. to give a Righteous,
an Impartiall, and finall Doom and State
unto the Everlasting Condition of all men.
Before whose most dreadfull Tribunal we
must all appear, Stripp'd of all our Wealth,
Honors, Dignities, Retinues, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with nothing but our <hi>Consciences,</hi> and
our <hi>Works,</hi> whether good or Evill, to beare
witness of us, and there receive a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
Sentence to the things which we
have done: Holy men a Sentence of <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Mercy,</hi> for the manifestation of
Gods glorious Grace, when he shall come
to be <hi>Magnified in his Saints, and admired in
all those that believe.</hi> Wicked men a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Rejection</hi> and Everlasting <hi>destruction
from the presence of the Lord,</hi> for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his glorious Power and Justice,
when all the Devils in Hell and Powers of
Darkness shall be brought all together, and
be trodden down under his Feet, when all the
low and narrow Interests of Secular wealth,
pleasures, power and greatness which short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
men so passionately dote upon, and
so eagerly pursue, shall to their Everlasting
disappointment be swallowed up in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48972:22"/>
Conflagration and so vanish for ever.
When the poor and pittiful Artifices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
angry Mortalls do countermine and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
one another, and mutually project
each others vexations, shall to the confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Contrivers be detected and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
In a word, when nothing that ever we
have done, shall afford benefit or comfort
to us, any further then as it was with a
single and upright aime directed to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and mannaged by the Law of
Love.</p>
            <p>Certainly this is one principal Reason of
all Immoderation amongst Men, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
in Adversity, of Insolence in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
of Excess in Delights, of Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
in Passions, of vindictive Retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
one principal Reason why they do
not with a single Eye and an unbiassed
Heart mannage all their Actions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
to the Glory of God, the Credit of
the Gospel, the Interest of Christianity,
the Edification and Salvation of the Souls of
Men, but often suffer weak Passions, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
Interests to State, model and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
their Designes; the Reason I say of all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48972:23"/>
is, Because the <hi>Terror of the Lord</hi> hath not
perswaded them, because they are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
awed with the All-seeing Eye, and
near approach of the Lord of Glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom <hi>all their wayes are naked,</hi> with
whom <hi>all their Sinnes are laid up in store, and
sealed amongst his Treasures.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seriously resolve to regulate all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by our <hi>Great Accompt.</hi> To say with
<hi>Iob, What shall I do when God riseth up, and
when he visiteth what shall I answer him?</hi>
Job 31. 14. He hath entrusted me with
many Talents, with a Rich Treasure of
Power and Interest, of Wisedom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
of Wealth and Learning, he hath
deposited with me the Custody of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Gospel, the Grand Interests of the
Church of Christ, and of the Precious
Souls which he redeemed with his own
Blood. God forbid that I should ever suffer
any Immoderate Passions, or Prejudices,
or Partialities, or low and narrow Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of mine own so farr to transport me,
as that I should betray so great a Trust, and
provoke the wrath of so Holy and Just a
Judge. God enable me with that Equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48972:23"/>
and Singleness of Heart, without
Hypocrisie, and without Partiality, with
a direct Eye to the Glory of God, the
Kingdom of Christ, the Edification and
Peace of his Church, the Flourishing of
his Gospel, and the Prosperity of the
Souls of his People; so to discharge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Trust reposed in me, as that I may be
able to give up mine Accompts with Joy,
and when the Chief Shepheard shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
I may lift up my Head in the day of
Redemption, and receive a Crown of Glory
which fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>Thus let your Moderation be known unto
All men, because <hi>the Lord is at hand</hi> in his
<hi>future</hi> approaching <hi>Iudgements..</hi> But hath
not the Lord been <hi>at hand,</hi> near us, in the
middest of us already by many strange <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
Providences,</hi> by a <hi>series</hi> of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mercies, and a <hi>vicissitude</hi> of dreadfull
Judgments; as if he would both wayes try,
whether by the one we would be <hi>led unto
Repentance,</hi> or by the other <hi>learn Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
Is it a small Mercy, that we have had
the <hi>Gospel of Salvation</hi> in the purity of the
Reformed Religion for so long a time in this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48972:24"/>
Land, having brought<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> forth so little
Fruit in answer to the Light and Grace
which hath been therein revealed unto
us? I have read an Observation in one
of the Homilies of our Church (if my
memory do not greatly faile me) That
we shall not often finde, that a Nation
which hath had the Gospel in purity, and
not brought forth the Fruits thereof, hath
enjoyed it much longer than 100 years. I
do not mention this as a sad Presage, for I
dare not set bounds to the infinite Mercy
and Patience of God, his Judgements are
unsearchable, and his Wayes past finding
out; the secret things belong unto him,
and things revealed to us and our Children;
It is not for us to know the Times or the
Seasons, which the Father hath put in his
own Power: onely I desire, by this sad Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
to awaken both my self and you
timely to consider <hi>the things that do belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Peace, before they be hidden from our
Eyes;</hi> for this is a sober and certain Truth,
that the <hi>Sins of a Church,</hi> as the Fruits of a
well-ordered Garden, do <hi>ripen much faster</hi>
than those of a Wilderness; and therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48972:24"/>
the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> calleth them by the name
of <hi>Summer Fruit, Amos</hi> 8. 2. The Prophet
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> compareth the Judgements threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against them unto the <hi>Rod of an Almond-tree,</hi>
Jer. 1. 11. which shooteth forth her
Blossoms before other Trees. And therefore
when we have reason to fear that God will
<hi>hasten Iudgements,</hi> we have great reason to
resolve with holy <hi>David, to make hast and
not to delay to keep his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, was it not a great and eminent
Mercy, when God commanded up into the
Scabbard the Sword of violent men, swell'd
into Pride and Arrogance, with their many
Successes, when he infatuated their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
shattered and dissipated their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
and swallowed them up in the
confusion of their own Consultations?</p>
            <p>Was it not a glorious and wonderfull
Mercy, that after a long and bitter Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Lord brought back <hi>our dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi>
in the <hi>Chariots of Aminadab,</hi> upon
the wings of Loyalty and Love unto his
Royal Throne, without the effusion of one
drop of Blood, and thereby made way for
a stable and durable Settlement both of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48972:25"/>
Church and State? To say nothing of the
other ordinary Mercies, of flourishing of
Trade, and plenty of Provisions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this Nation hath been for a long time
blessed: And may it not be said of us as it
was of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that we have <hi>not rendered
again according to the Benefits done unto us?</hi>
but have surfeited and played the Wantons
with these great Mercies; so that the Lord
hath been provoked to lift up his Hand in
many sore and dismal Judgements against
us?</p>
            <p>For after that Thousands and Ten
Thousands had fallen by the Sword of an
unnaturall War in the High Places of the
Field, he hath stirred up Potent Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
abroad against us, though blessed be
his Name we have not only hitherto been
delivered from their Fury, but by signall
Successes have had good reason to hope
that the Lord hath owned our Righteous
Cause.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, his Anger is not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but <hi>his Hand is stretched out still;</hi> for
he hath in these two years last past emptied
this City and Nation in very many parts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48972:25"/>
thereof, as we may I presume with good
Reason compute, above an Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of her Inhabitants, by the fury of a
raging and contagious <hi>Pestilence,</hi> the like
whereunto possibly cannot be paralell'd for
some Hundred of years. And yet after all
this, his <hi>Anger hath not been turned away,</hi> but
<hi>his Hand is streched out still.</hi> He hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
contended by Fire, and by the <hi>late
direfull Conflagration,</hi> hath laid in Ashes the
glorious Metropolis of this Nation, hath
made <hi>desolate</hi> almost all her goodly <hi>Palaces,</hi>
and laid <hi>waste</hi> almost all the <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> of
God therein. Thus the Lord hath come
<hi>with Fire, and with his Chariots like a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
to render his Anger with fury, and his
Rebuke with flames of Fire; for by Fire and by
Sword hath he pleaded with us, and the Slain of
the Lord have been many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We see how the Lord hath been near us
both in wayes of Mercy and of Judgement,
as if he would say of us as of</hi> Ephraim, Is
Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleasant Child?
for since I speak against him I do earnestly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
him still, therefore my Bowels are troubled
for him. I will surely have mercy upon him,

saith the Lord. And again, How shall I give thee
up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> How shall I deliver thee <hi>Israel?</hi>
How shall I make thee as <hi>Admah?</hi> How shall
I set thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> Mine heart is turned
within me, my Repentings are kindled together.
I will not execute the fiercenes of mine Anger, I
will not return to destroy <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for I am God
and not Man, &amp;c. <hi>Jer. 31. 20. Hos.</hi> 11. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>I shall Limit the Inference from all this to
the first Acception, which I gave of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Word in the text, namely, to <hi>teach us
from hence to walk as becometh the dignity</hi> of
our High Calling, according to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of the Apostle, <hi>Let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
be as becometh the Gospel of Christ.</hi> For
every thing of the Gospel doth call upon us
for Holyness of Life, the <hi>Author</hi> of it a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of Holyness, <hi>He that saith he abideth in
him, must walk even as he walked, 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 6.
The End of it a design of Holyness, That
we being delivered out of the hand of our
Enemies, might serve him without fear <hi>in
Holyness and Righteousness before him all the
dayes of our life</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it a
<hi>Mystery</hi> of Godliness, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16. There is
not an Article of the Creed which hath not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48972:27"/>
Holyness a Consequent of it. The <hi>Laws</hi> of
it Prescripts of Holiness, <hi>Be ye perfect as
your Heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Matth. 5. 48.
The <hi>Cardinall Graces</hi> of it Faith, Love, and
Hope, all Principles of Holyness, <hi>Faith
Purifieth the Heart and worketh by Love,</hi> Act.
15. 9. Gal. 5. 6. <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling of the
Law,</hi> Rom. 13. 10. Herein is <hi>Love if we
keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. And <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that hath this Hope in him purifieth
himself even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 3. No man
can rationally hope to be like unto Christ
in Glory hereafter, who resolves to be
unlike unto him in Grace and Holyness
here; for Glory is the Consummation and
Reward of Grace. All the precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel invite unto Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Having these Promises, dearly beloved,
let us cleanse our Selves from all filthiness of
Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holyness in the
fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. Lastly, the
dreadfull Threatnings of the Gospel drive
unto Holyness; since we know, that <hi>without
Holyness no Man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.
and that he <hi>will come in flaming Fire to take
vengeance on those that know not God, and that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48972:28"/>
obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> 2
Thess. 1. 8. And therefore as ever we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to enjoy the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the Gospel,
(without the which we are of all Creatures
the most miserable) we must shew forth
the <hi>Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the
Gospel in our Hearts and Lives, <hi>which
teacheth us to deny Vngodlyness and Worldly
Lusts, and to Live Soberly, Righteously, and
Godly in this Present World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12.
which that we may all do, The God of Peace,
who brought again from the Dead the Lord
Jesus, the Great Shepheard of the Sheep,
through the Blood of the Everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
make us perfect in every Good
Work to do his Will, working in us that
which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
Christ; to whom be Glory for Ever and
Ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
