         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which are naturally swift, save themselvs by flying away;
wheras others, who are not so, are overtaken by the Wolf,
and so become his prey: and so, it is not because they have
escaped the Wolf, that they are the more fleet, but it is their

               </gap> swiftness that saves them. He affords also other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and at last concludes, That it may be the thing is not

away the time gently and pleasantly; without medling with
the severity of high fetcht reasons, to wind up the spirits, and
make them more attentive. But, in so renowned an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as this, where there are such Judicious Persons and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
learned, and who, upon this rancounter, expect from
me, that I pay them in solid reasons; I should be very sorry,
that, having done my uttermost to make it clear, How the
Powder, (which they commonly call the <hi>Powder of Sympathy)</hi>
doth, naturally and without any Magick, cure wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

I should be very sorry, that it should be doubted, Whether
such a cure may effectually be perform'd or no.</p>
            <p>In matter of fact, the determination of the existence and
truth of a thing depends on the report which our Senses make
us. This business is of that nature; Wherin, they, who have
seen the effects and had experience therof, and have been
careful to examine all necessary circumstances, and satisfied
themselves afterwards that there is no imposture in the thing,
nothing doubt but that it is real and true; And, they, who
have not seen such experiences, ought to refer themselvs to
Narrations and Authority of such as have. I could produce
divers wherof I was an ocular witness; nay, <hi>Quorum p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

instance in one only. But, it shall be one of the clearest, the
most perspicuous, and the most averred that can be; not only
for the remarkable circumstances therof, but also for the
hands (which were above the Vulgar) through which the
whole business passed. For, the cure of a very sore hurt was
perfected by this <hi>Powder of Sympathy,</hi> upon a Person illustrious,
as well for his many perfection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

talent and marvailous sagacity, to discusse natural things,
and penetrate them to the very marrow: As also by his Son,
the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> their
prime Minister. And, in fine, all was registred among the
Observations of the great Chancelor, <hi>Bacon,</hi> to add, by way
of Appendix, to his Natural History. And I believe, when
you shall have understood this History, you will not accuse me
of Vanity, if I attribute to my self the Introducing this way

own Chyrurgeons; for his Majesty much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffected the said M<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.
<hi>Howel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was my chance to be lodged hard by him; and, four or
five dayes after, as I was making my self ready, he came to
my House, and pray'd me to view his wounds,: for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
said he, that you have extraordinary remedies upon
such occasions; and my Chyrurgeons apprehend some fear,
that it may grow to a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and so the hand must be cut
off. In effect, his countenance discover'd that he was in
much pain; which, he said, was insupportable, in regard of
the extream inflammation. I told him that I would willingly
serve him: but if, haply, he knew the manner how I would
cure him, without touching or seeing him, it may be he would
not expose himself to my manner of curing; because he would
think it, peradventure, either ineffectual or superstitious. He
reply'd, The wonderful things which many have related to
me, of your way of medicament, makes me nothing doubt of
its efficacy; and all that I have to say to you is comprehended
in the Spanish Proverb, <hi>Hagase el milagro, y hagalo,</hi> Mahoma,
Let the miracle be done, though <hi>Mahomet</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>I ask'd him, then, for any thing that had the blood upon it;
so he presently sent for his Garter, wherewith his hand was
first bound: and as I call'd for a Bason of water, as if I would
wash my hands; I took a handful of Powder of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which
I had in my Study, and presently dissolv'd it. As soon as the
bloody Garter was brought me, I put it in the Bason, observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the while what Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> did; who stood talking with a
Gentleman in a corner of my Chamber, not regarding at all
what I was doing: But he started suddenly, as if he had found
some strange alteration in himself. I ask'd him what he ail'd?
I know not what ails me, said he, but I find, that I feel no
more pain: me-thinks, a pleasing kind of freshness, as it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49807:4"/>
were a wet cold napkin spread it self over my hand; which hath
taken away the inflammation that tormented me before. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
since then you feel already so good an effect of my
medicament, I advise you to cast away all your plaisters; only
keep the wound clean, and in a moderate temper 'twixt heat and
cold. After dinner I took the Garter out of the water,
and put it to dry before a great fire. It was scarce dry, but
Mr. <hi>Howel</hi>'s servant came running, to tell me that his Master
felt as much burning as ever he had done, if no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more; for the
heat was such, as if his hand were betwixt coales of fire. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wer'd,
that although that had hapned at present, yet he should
find ease in a short time; for I knew the reason of this new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
and I would provide accordingly, so that his Master
should be free from that inflammation, it may be, before he
could possibly return unto him: but, in case he found no ease,
I wish'd him to come presently back again; if not, he might
forbear coming. Away he went; and at the instant I put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Garter into the water; therupon, he found his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
without any pain at all. To be brief, there was no sense of
pain afterward; but, within five or six days the wounds were
cicatriced, and entirely healed. King <hi>Iames</hi> required a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
information of what had passed, touching this cure: and
after it was done, and perfected, his Majesty would needs know of
me how it was done, having droll'd with me first (which, he could
do with a very good grace) about a Magician and a Sorcerer. I
answer'd, That I should be always ready to perform what his
Majesty should command; but I most humbly desired him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I should passe further, that I might tell him what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>hour,
of whom I had the Secret, said to the great Duke of
<hi>Toscany,</hi> upon the like occasion. It was a Religious <hi>Carmel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te,</hi>
that came from the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> he had also
been at <hi>China;</hi> who, having done many marvellous cures with
this Powder, after his arrival to <hi>Toscany,</hi> the Duke said, he would
be very glad to learn it of him. It was the father of the Great
Duke, who governs now. The <hi>Carmelite</hi> answer'd him, That it
was a Secret which he had learnt in the Oriental parts, and he
thought there was not any, who knew it in <hi>Europe</hi> but himself;
and that it deserv'd not to be divulged; which could not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
if his Highness would meddle with the practice of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49807:5"/>
he was not likely to do it with his own hands; but must
trust a Surgeon, or some other servant; so that, in a short time
divers other would come to know it, as well as himself. But, a
few months after, I had opportunity to do an important cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
to the said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ryar; which induced him to discover unto me
his Secret: and the same year he return'd to <hi>Persia;</hi> that now
there is no other knows this Secret in <hi>Europe,</hi> but my self.
The King replied, That I needed not apprehend any fear that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would discover it; for he would not trust any body in the
World to make experience of this Secret, but do it with his
own hands: therfore he would have some of the Powder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which I deliver'd, instructing him in all the circumstances.
Wherupon his Majesty made sundry proofs; whence he reciv'd
singular satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rim,</hi> Dr. <hi>Mayerne,</hi> his first Physician, watch'd to
discover what was done by this Secret: and at last he came to
know, that the King made use of <hi>Vitriol.</hi> Afterwards he acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
me, saying, he durst not demand of me my Secret, because
I made some difficulty to discover it to the King himself: But,
having learnt with what matter it was to be done, he hoped I
would communicate to him all the circumstances, how it is to
be used. I answer'd him, That if he had asked me before, I
I would frankly have told him all; for, in his hands, there was
no fear that such a secret should be prostituted: and so I told
him all. A little after the Doctor went into <hi>France,</hi> to see some
fair Territories he had purchased near <hi>Geneva;</hi> which was the
Barony of <hi>Aubonne.</hi> In this voyage he went to see the Duke
of <hi>Mayerne,</hi> who had been a long time his friend and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;
and he taught him this Secret: wherof the Duke made
many experiments, which if any other but a Prince had done,
it may be they had passed for effects of Magick and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>After the Dukes death, who was kill'd at the siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi>
his Surgeon, who waited on him in doing cures, sold this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to divers persons of Quality, who gave him considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sums for it, so that he became very rich therby. The
thing, being fall'n thus into many hands, remain'd not long
in termes of a Secret but by degrees came to be so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49807:5"/>
that now there is scarce any Country Barber but
knows it.</p>
            <p>Behold, Sirs, the genealogy of the <hi>Powder of Smpathy</hi> in this
part of the World with a notable History of a cure perform'd
by it. 'Tis time now to come to the discussion, how it is done.
It must be avowed, that 'tis a marvellous thing, that the
hurt of a wounded person should be cured by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of a remedy put to a rag of cloth or a weapon at a great
distance. Yet it is not to be doubted, but after a long and
profound speculation of all the oeconomy and conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation
of natural causes, which may be adjudged
capable to produce such effects, one may fall at last upon
the true ones, which must have subtle resorts and means to
act. Hitherto they have been wrap'd up in darknesse, and
esteem'd so inacc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essible, that they who have undertaken to
speak or write of them, (at least those I have seen) have been
contented to speak of some ingenious sleight; without diving
into the bottom: endeavouring rather to shew the vivacity
of their spirit and force of their eloquence, than to
satisfie their Readers and Auditors, how the thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be done. They would have us take for ready mony
some terms, which we understand not, nor know what
they signifie. They would pay us with conveniences,
with resemblances, with Sympathies, with Magnetical virtues,
and such terms, without explicating what these terms mean:
They think they have done enough, if they feebly perswade
any body that the business may be performed by a natural
way; without having any recourse to the intervention of
<hi>Demons,</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> but they pretend not in any
sort to have found out the convincing reasons which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
how the thing is done.</p>
            <p>If I did not hope to gain otherwise upon your spirits; if I
did not, I say believe, that I should be able to perswade you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by words, I would not have under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aken this
enterprize. I know to well,
<q>—Quid vale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt humeri, quid ferre recusent.</q>
Such a design requires a great fire, and vivacity of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49807:6"/>
volubility of tongue, aptness of expressions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinnuate,
as it were by surprisal, that which one cannot carry
away by a firm foot, &amp; by cold reasons, though solid. A Discourse
of this nature challenges other than a Stranger; who finds
himself obliged to display his sense in a language, wherein
he can hardly express his ordinary conceptions. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
these considerations shall not deterr me from enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my self in an enterprize, which may seem to some much
more difficult, than that which I am now to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> to
make good convincing proofs, that this <hi>Sympathetical
cure</hi> may be done naturally; and to shew before your
eyes, and make you touch with your finger, how it may be
done. You know that Perswasions are made by ingenious <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
which, expressed with a good grace, rather tickle
the Imagination, than satisfy the Understanding: But demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
are built upon certain and approved principles;
and though they be but roughly pronounced, yet they
convince and draw after them necessary conclusions.
They proceed, as a strong Engin fastned to a gate to
batter it down; or as a plate of metal to imprint the mark
of the mony. At every turn, that truth makes, she approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
but little, and as it were insensibly, and makes not much
noise, and there is no such great force required to turn her;
but her strength, though it be slow, is invincible. That at
the end, she breaks down the gate, and makes a deep impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ece of Gold or Silver. Whereas the stroke of
hammers, and bars, (whereto witty discourses, and the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
conceptions of Subtile spirits may be compared) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the arm of a Giant, makes a great noise; and, at the
end of the account, produces little effect.</p>
            <p>To enter then into the matter I will (according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Geometrical Demonstrations) lay <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
as foundation-stones, wheron I will erect my Structure,
But I will lay them so well, and so firmly, that there shall be
no great difficulty to grant them. These Principles shall be
like the wheels of <hi>Archimedes:</hi> by the advantage wherof a
child might be capable to hale on shore the bigest <hi>Carack</hi> of
King <hi>Hieron;</hi> which a hundred pair of Oxen, with all the
Ropes and Cables of his <hi>Arsenal,</hi> were not able to stir. So, by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49807:6"/>
the strength of these Principles, I hope to wast my Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a safe Port.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First Principle</hi> shall be, that <hi>the whole O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>be or Sphere of
the Air is filled with Light.</hi> If it were needful to prove in
this point, that <hi>Light</hi> is a material and corporal <hi>Substance,</hi> and
not an imaginary and incomprehensible <hi>Quality,</hi> (as many
Schoolmen aver), I could do it evidently enough: but I have
done this in another T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eatise, which hath been published not
long since. And it is no new op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nion: for, many of the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
Philosophers among the Antients have advanced it;
<hi>yea,</hi> the Great <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> (in his <hi>Third Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stle to</hi> Volusian) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that it is his sentiment. But to our present business, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght be the one, or the other, it matters not; tis enough to
explicate its course, and the journies it makes, wherto our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
bear witness. Tis clear, that, issuing continually out of its
source, the <hi>Suu,</hi> and lancing it self by a marvailous celerity on
all sides by straight lines, where it encounters any obstacles in
its way, by the opposition of some hard or <hi>opaque</hi> body, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects;
&amp; leaping thence to equal angles, takes again its course
by a straight line, till it bandies upon some other solid body; &amp;
so it continues to make new boundings here &amp; there; till, at the
end, being chased on all sides, by the bodies which oppose it in
its passage, 'tis tired, and so extinguishes. In the like manner
as we see a <hi>Ball in Tenis Court,</hi> being struck by a strong arm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the walls, leaps to the opposite side; so that sometimes it
makes the circuit of the whole Court, &amp; finishes its motion near
the place where it was first struck. Our very eys are witnesses of
this progress of the Light; when, by way of reflexion, it illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
some obscure place, whither it cannot directly arrive:
Or when, issuing immediatly from the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; beating upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he
<hi>Moon,</hi> or some other of the Planets, the ray's, which cannot find
entrance there, bound upon our Earth, (otherwise we should
not see them); and there it is reflected, broken &amp; bruised by so
many bodies, as it meets in its diversity of reflexions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Principle</hi> shal be, that <hi>The Light gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cing so up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
some body, the rayes which enter no further but rebound from the
superficies of the body, carry with them some smal particles or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes:</hi>
just as the Ball, whereof we have spoken, would
carry with it some of the moisture of the wall, against which'tis
banded, if the plaister therof were also moist, &amp; as, in effect, it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49807:7"/>
carryed away some tincture of the black, wherwith the walls
are coloured. The Reason wherof is, that the Light, that
subtil and rarified fire, coming with such an imperceptible
haste, (for its darts are within our eyes, as soon as soon as its
head is above our Horison, making so many millions of miles
in an inimaginable space of time) I say, the Light, beating
upon the body which opposes it, cannot chuse but make
there some small incisions, proportion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble to its rarity and
subtility. And these small Atomes being cut and loosned
from their trunk, the heat of the light sticks and incorporates
it self wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the most humid, viscuou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and glewing parts of
them; and carries them along with it. Experience shews us
this, as well as Reason. For, when one puts some h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
cloth to dry before the fire, the fiery rays beating theron,
those which find no entrance, but refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, carry away
with them some small moist bodies, which make a kind of
mist betwixt the cloth and the fire. In like manner the <hi>Sun</hi>
at his rising enlightning the earth, which is moistned either
by rain or the dew of the night, his beams raise a Mist, which,
by little and little, ascends to the tops of the hills: and this
Mist doth rarifie, according as the Sun hath more force to
draw it upwards; till at last we lose the sight thereof, and it
becomes part of the Air, which, in regard of its tenuity, is
invisible to us. These Atomes then are like Cavaliers, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on winged Coursers; who ride on still till the Sun, setting,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akes from them their <hi>Pegasus</hi> and leaves them unmounted:
and then they precipitate themselvs in crowds to the Earth,
whence they sprung. The greatest part of them, and the
most heavy, fall, upon the first re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eating of the Sun; and
that we call the Serain: which though it be so thin that we
cannot see it, yet we feel it, as so many small hammers strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon our heads and Bodies; principally the elder sort of
us. For, young persons, in regard of the boyling of their
blood, and the heat of their complexion, thrust out of them
abundance of Spirits: which, being stronger than those
that fall from the Serain, repulse them, and hinder them to
operate on the Bodies, whence these Spirits came forth; as
they do upon those that, being grown cold by age, are not
guarded by so strong an emanation of their Spirits. The
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49807:7"/>
Wind which blows, and is tossed to and fro, is no other than
a great River of the like A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omes; drawn out of some solid
Bodies, which are upon the earth, and so banded here and
there, according as they find cause for that effect.</p>
            <p>I remember to have once sensibly seen how the Wind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that, about that place which was illuminated by the Solar
rays, there was a Fog: which at first was of no greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

that at last, not only the top of that Mountain, but all the

               </gap>sses from the Sun to Mount
<hi>Viso,</hi> I stay'd a while to behold it, while my Servants were
coming up the Hill behind: for, having more men to carry
my chair, than they had, I was there sooner. It was not long
e're I might perceive the said Fog descend gently to the place
where I was; and I began to feel a freshness that came over
my face, when I turn'd it that way. When all my Troop
was come about me, we went descending the other side of
Mount <hi>Cenis,</hi> towards <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sensibly found that the Wind began to blow hard behind our
backs; for, our way obliged us to go towards the side, where
the Sun was. We met with Passengers that were going up, as
we down; who told us, that the Wind was very impetuous
below, and did much incommodate them, by blowing in their
faces and eyes; but the higher they came, it was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sser and
lesser. And for our selves, when we were come to the
place where they said the Wind blew so hard, we found a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Storm: and it encreased still, the lower we went;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49807:8"/>
till the Sun, being well advanced, drew no more by that line,
but caused a Wind in some other place. The people of that
Country assured me, that it was there always so; if some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and violent accident did not intervene, and divert the
ordinary course, <hi>viz.</hi> at a certain hour of the day, the Wind
raises it self to such a <hi>romb,</hi> or point, and, when the Sun is come
to another point, another wind rises; and so from hand to hand
it changes the point, till the Sun set: which always brings with
it a calm, if the we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther be fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r; and that always comes from
the Mount <hi>Viso,</hi> opposite to the Sun. They told us also that
the daily wind is commonly stronger towards the bottom of
the Mountain, than towards the top; wherof the reason is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.
For, the natural movement of every body natural
encreases always in swiftness, according as it moves forward to
its center; and that by the unequal numbers, (as <hi>Galileo</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously
demonstrated; I did it also in another Treatise):
that is to say, if at the first moment it advances an ell, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
it advances three, in the third five, in the fourth seven, and
so it continues to augment in the same manner; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the density and figure of the descending body,
acting upon the cessiblility of the <hi>medium.</hi> And these
small Bodies, which cause a wind from Mount <hi>Viso,</hi> are thick
and terrestrial: for, the Snow being composed of watry and
earthy parts united by the cold, when the heat of the Solar
beams disunites and separates them, the viscous parts flie
with them; while the terrestrial, being too heavy to fly
upward, fall presently downward. This makes me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a very remarkable thing, which befell me when I was with
my Fleet in the Port of <hi>Scanderon</hi> or <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> towards
the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea: there they use to
dis-imbark, when they go to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi> I had
done already what I had intended to do in those Seas, and
happily compassed my design; so it imported me much to
return to <hi>England</hi> as soon as possibly I could; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because my Ships were batter'd by a great Fight, I
had had a little before, against a formidable power; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
although I had obtain'd the better, yet, in so furious a
dispute, my Fleet was in some disorder, and my Ships
full of wounded Men. To advise therefore of the most
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49807:8"/>
expedient Course to come to some Harbour, where I
might repair my Ships and be in surety: I assembled
all my Captains, Pilots, and Mariners, the most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
of my Fleet: and, having propounded to them my
design, they were all of an unanimous opinion, that the
surest course was towards the South, and to cast upon <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Iudea, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and render our selves at the
streight of <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raltar;</hi> sailing so near the main Land, we
should have every night some small briezes of wind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we should in a short time make our Voyage. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
we should not be in any great danger to meet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Spanish or French Fleets. For, <hi>England</hi> was at
that time in open War with both those Kings, and we
had advice, that they had great Fleets abroad, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
some things we had done in prejudice of them
both, those sixteen months that we remain'd Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter of
those Seas: therefore it concern'd us to make towards
some safe Port; where we might both refresh our Men,
and repair our batter'd Vessels.</p>
            <p>My opinion was clean contrary to theirs: for, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
our best Course were, to steer our Course West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and to sail along the Coasts of <hi>Cilicia, Pamphylia,
Lydia, Natolia,</hi> or <hi>Asia the Less;</hi> and to traverse the mouth
of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> leave the <hi>Adriatick</hi> on the right hand,
and pass by <hi>Sicily, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica,</hi> the Gulph of
<hi>Lion,</hi> and so coast all <hi>Spain.</hi> Telling them, that it would
be a great dishonour to us to forsake our best Road, for
fear of the Enemy; since our chief business thither was to
find them out: and the protection which it pleased God
to afford us all along in so many Combats, in going,
ought to make us hope the same providence would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to guide us in returning. That there was no doubt
but the road which I proposed to them, consider'd sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in it self, was, without comparison, the better, and
the more expedite to sail out of the Mediterranean Sea,
and gain the Ocean; because, said I, although we have
the briezes from the Land, as long as we are upon
the Coasts of <hi>Syria;</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> we shall not have them
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49807:9"/>
at all while we sail upon the coasts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> where there are
those fearful Sands, the <hi>Syrtes,</hi> which are of a great extent,
the said coast having no humidity; for there is neither tree
nor herb grows there, nor ought else but moving Sands,
which cover'd and interred heretofore at one glut the puissant
Army of K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng <hi>Cambyses.</hi> Now, where there is no humidity,
the Sun cannot attract to make a wind: so that we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find there, specially in Summer time, any other wind but
that Regular one which blows from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> according to
the course of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is the Father of Winds; unless
some extraordinary happen, either from the coast of <hi>Italy,</hi>
which lies Northward, or from the bottom of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where
the Mountains of the <hi>Moon</hi> are, and the source of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts
of <hi>Nile.</hi> Therfore, if we were near the <hi>Syrtes,</hi> the
winds of <hi>Italy</hi> would be most dangerous to us, and expose us
to shipwrack. I reason'd so according to natural Causes, while
they of my Councel of war kept themselvs firm to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and I would do nothing against the unanimous sense
of all: for, though the disposing and resolution of all things
depended absolutely upon my self, yet I thought I might be
justly accused of rashness or wilfulness, if I should prefer my
own advice before that of all the rest. So we took that course,
and went happil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no other but a few gentle <hi>Zephirs,</hi> which came from the
West, whither we were steering our course. We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to keep at anchor all that time, with a great deal of
apprehension, that the wind might come from the North, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a Tempest: for, if that had hapned, we had
been all lost; because our anchors had not been able to hold
among those moving Sands (for, under water they are of the
same nature as they are upon dry land) and so we must have
been shipwrackt upon that coast. But God Almighty, who
hath been pleas'd I should have the honour to wait on you
this day, deliver'd me from that danger. And, at the end of
seven and thirty days, we observ'd the course of the clouds
very high, which came from So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but by degrees faster and faster: insom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch that, in two days,
the wind, which was forming it self a great way off in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:49807:9"/>
came, in a tempest, to the place where we rid at anchor, and
carried us whither we intended to go; but the force of it was
broken before, coming so far.</p>
            <p>Out of this Discourse we may infer, and conclude, that,
wherever there is any wind, there are also some small B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dies
or Atomes, which are drawn from the Bodies, whence they
come, by the virtue of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> and, that in effect,
this Wind is nothing else but the said A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omes agitated, and
thrust on by a kind of impetuosity. And so, the winds par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the qualities whence they come: as, if they come from

the contagion along with them.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Third Principle</hi> shall be, that <hi>The Air is full throughout of
small Bodies or Atomes;</hi> or rather that, which we call ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> air,
is no other than a mixture or confusion of such Atomes, wherin
the aereal parts predominate.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that in nature there cannot be actually
found any pure Element, unblended with others: for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Fire and the Light acting one way, and the internal
Fire of every Body pushing on another way, causes this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous
mixture of all things in all things. Within that huge

liberty enough to make such a mixture; which Experience,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I have seen little <hi>Vipers,</hi> as soon
as they came from the egs where they were ingendred, being
not yet an inch long: which, conserv'd in a large Gourd,
(cover'd with paper tyed round about, that they might not get
out, but leaving little pin-holes made in it, that the Air might
enter) encreased in substance and bigness so prodigiously, in
six, eight, or ten months, that it is incredible; and more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49807:10"/>
during the season of the <hi>Equinoxes,</hi> when the air is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of those aethereal and balsamical atomes, which they drew
for their nouriture.</p>
            <p>Hence it came that the <hi>Cosmopolites</hi> had reason to say, <hi>Est in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

air. These smal <hi>Vipers</hi> had but the air only for their sustenance;
nevertheless, by this thin viand, they grew, in less than a year,
to a foot long, and proportionably big and heavy. <hi>Vitriol,
Salt-peter,</hi> and some other substances, augment in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
only by attraction of air.</p>
            <p>I remember, that upon some occasion, seventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years ago, I had use of a pound of Oil of <hi>Tartar;</hi> it was
at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had then no Operatory. Wherfore I desired
<hi>Monsir Ferrier,</hi> a man universally known by all such as are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
to make me some: for, he had none then ready made,
but did it expressely for me. And because, for the calcination of
<hi>Tartar,</hi> twenty pound may be as easily made as two, without
encrease of charge; he took occasion hereby to make a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
for his own use. When he brought it me, the oil smelt so
strong of the Rose, that I complain'd of his mingling it with
that water, wheras I had desired him to do it purely, by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it to the humid air: for, I verily thought he had dissolved
the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> in <hi>Rose-water.</hi> He swore to me that he had
not mingled it with any liquor; but had left the Tartar cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cind
within his Cellar, to dissolve of it self. It was then the
season of Roses; therfore it seems that the Air, being then
full of the atomes which come from the Roses, and being
changed into water by the powerful attraction of the <hi>Salt</hi> of
Tartar, their smel became very sensible in the place where
they were gathered together, as the beams of the Sun do burn,
being crowded together in a burning glasse.</p>
            <p>There hapned also another marvailous thing, touching this
<hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Tartar;</hi> which may serve to prove a proposition
we have not yet touched: but, not to interrupt the course
of the story, I will tell it you by way of advance. It was,
that, as the Season of Roses passed, the smel of the Rose va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
away from the said <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Tartar;</hi> so that, in three or
four months, it was quite gone. But we were much surprized,
when, the next year, the said odor of Roses return'd as strong
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49807:10"/>
as ever and so went away again towards winter: which
course it still observs. Which made <hi>Monsir Ferrier</hi> keep it
as a singular rarity; and the last Summer I found the effect in
his house.</p>
            <p>We have in <hi>London</hi> an unlucky and troublesome confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this doctrine: for, the air uses to be full of such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.
The fuel in that great City, is commonly pit-Coal,
brought from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> or <hi>Scotland.</hi> This Coal ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in it a
great quantity of volatil Salt, very sharp; which being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on by the Smoke, uses to dissipate it self and fill the air,
Wherwith it so incorporates, that, although we do not see
it, yet we find the effect: for it spoils Beds, Tapistries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
houshold stuffs, that are of any beautiful fair colour;
the fuliginous air tarnishing it by degrees. And, though one
should lock up his Chamber very clean, and come not thither
in a good while, yet at his return, he will find a black kind of
thin soot cover all his houshold-stuff; as we see in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls
there is a white dust, as also in Bakers shops; which uses to
whiten the walls, and somtimes gets into cup-boards and chests.
The said coal-soot also gets abroard, and fouls cloths upon
hedges, as they are a drying; as also, in the Spring time, the
very leavs of Trees are besooted therewith. Now, in regard
that it is this air which the lungs draw for respiration among
the Inhabitants, therfore the flegme and spittle which comes
from them is commonly black<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

the acrimony of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot produces another funest effect; for,
it makes the people subject to inflammations, and by degrees
to ulcerations in the Lungs. It is so corrosive and biting,
that, if one put Gammons of Bacon, or Beef, or any other
flesh, within the chimney, it so dries it up, that it spoils it.
Wherfore, they who have weak lungs quickly feel it; whence
it comes to pass, that almost the one hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of putrefaction) which stick to it. I know a
Person of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ality, (and a singular friend of mine) who is
lodg'd in a place, where on o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e side, a great many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabit, few Carts use to pass, and fewer Coaches. His
neighbours behind his house empty their filth and ordures in
the middle of the street; which uses hereby to be ful of mounts
of filth, to be carried away by Tombrells, but when they
they remove these ordures; you cannot imagine what a stench
what kind of infectious air is smelt thereabour every where.
The Servants of my said Friend, when this happens, use to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Plate, and Andirons and other of their fairest hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold-stuff,
with Cotton or course Bays; otherwise they would

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arnished. Yet nothing hereof is seen within the air;
however these experiences manifestly convince, that the air
is stuffed with such atomes. I cannot omit to add hereto
another experiment; which is, that we find by the effects,
how the rays of the <hi>Moon</hi> are cold and moist. 'Tis without
controversie, that the luminous parts of those rays come from
the <hi>Sun;</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> having no light at all in her: as her ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
bear witness; which happen, when the Earth is just twixt
her and the <hi>Sun,</hi> and by such interposition hinders her to have
light from his rays, The beams then which come from the
<hi>Moon</hi> are those of the <hi>Sun;</hi> which glancing upon her, reflect
upon us, and so bring with them the atoms of that cold and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e whence they come.
Whence, if one expose a hollow bason, or glass, to assemble
them, he shall find, that wheras those of the <hi>Sun</hi> burn by such
a conjuncture, these, clean contrary, refresh and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a notable manner, leaving an aquatick and viscuous glutining
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49807:11"/>
kind of sweat upon the glass. One would think it a folly to talk
of washing hands in a well polished Silver Bason, wherin there
is not a drop of water, yet this may be done; by the reflexion of
the <hi>Moon</hi> beams only; which will afford a competent humidity
to do it, But they who have tryed this have found their hands,
after they are wiped, to be much moister than usually: and
this is an infallible way to take away Warts from the hands, if
it be often used,</p>
            <p>Let us then conclude, out of these premises and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the Air is ful of atomes; drawn from bodies, by
means of the light which reflects theron, or sallying out by the
interior natural heat of those bodies, which drive them forth.
It may haply seem impossible that there can be an emanation of
so many small bodies, that should be spread and carried up and
down, so far in the air by a continual flux, (if I may say so)
and yet the body whence they come receive no diminution
that is perceptible; though sometimes tis visible enough; as,
by the evaporations of the Spirits of wine, musk, and other
such volatil substances. But, this objection will be nul, and
the two precedent Principles, render themselvs more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when we shall settle another, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Every body, be it
never so little, is divisible</hi> in infinitum: not that it hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
parts, (for the contrary therof may be demonstrated)
but it is capable to be divided and subdivided into new parts,
without ever coming to the end of the division: And it is in
this sense that our Masters teach us that Quantity is infinitely
divisible. This is evident to him who shall consider, with a
profound imagination, the essence and formal notion of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
which is nothing else but divisibility. But, in regard that
this speculation is very subtile and metaphysical, I will serve
my self of some geometrical demonstrations to prove this
truth; for, they accommodate best with the imagination. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi>
teaches us (in the <hi>Tenth Proposition</hi> of his <hi>Sixth Book),</hi>
that if one take a short line, and another a long one, and the
long one be divided into divers equal parts; the short one may
be divided also into as many equal parts, and every one of those
parts also into others, and these last into so many more, and so
on, without being able eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to come to that which is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:49807:12"/>
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t let's suppose (although it be impossible) that one might
divide and subdivide a line, so that at last we should come to
an indivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible; and lets see what will come of it. I say then,
that, since the line resolves it self into indivisibles, it must be
composed of them; lets see whether that may be verified. To
which purpose, I take three indivisibles, (and to distinguish
them) let them be A, B, C. for, if three millions of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles
make a long line, three indivisibles will make a
short one. I put them then in a row; First A, then B, so
near, that they touch one another: and I say, that B must
necessarily possess the same place as, A, or not possess it. If it
possess the same place, they both together make no extension:
and, by the same reason, neither 3, nor 3000 will do it; but
all the indivisibles will unite together, and the result of all shal
be but only one indivisible. It must be then, that, being not
both in the same place, yet touching one another, one part
of B must touch one part of A, and another part not touch it:
Then I add the indivisible C, wher of one part shal touch a part
of B. which touches not A; and by this means B is copulant,
lying between A and C, to make the extension. To do this,
you see that we must admit that B hath parts; as the other two
also which by your supposition are all indivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible: and this
being absurd, the supposition is impossible. But, to render the
matter yet more perspicuous, let's suppose that these three indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibles
make one extension, and compose one line; the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
already cited from <hi>Euclide</hi> demonstrates, that this line may
be divided into thirty equal parts, or into as many as youplease:
insomuch that it must be granted, that every one of these three
indivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibles may be divided into three parts; which is point
blank against the nature and definition of an indivisible. But,
without dividing into so many parts, <hi>Euclide</hi> shews (by his <hi>Tenth
proposition</hi> of his <hi>First Element)</hi> that every line may be parted
into two equal parts: but this, being composed of indivisibles
of unequal number, it must necessarily follow, that, being
parted into two, there must be an indivisible more on the one
side than on the other, or the middle one be parted into two
halfs. So that he, who denies that Quantity may be divided
<hi>in infinitum,</hi> entangles himself in absurdities, and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
impossibilities: And on the contrary, he, who
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49807:12"/>
assents to it, will find it no impossibility or inconvenience,
that the atoms of all bodies, which are in the air, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
stretcht and carried to a marvailous distance. Our
very senses make faith hereof in some sort: There is no body
in the World, which we know of, so compact, so solid,
and weighty as Gold; yet, to what a strange extent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
may it be brought! Let's take an Ounce of this
massy mettal; it shall be but a button, as big as my fingers
end: A beater of Gold will make a thousand leavs or more
of this Ounce. Half of one of these leavs shall suffice to gild
the whole surface of Silver of three or four Ounces. Let's
give this gilded lingot of Silver to them, who prepare Gold
and Silver Thrid to make Lace; and let them draw it to the
greatest length and subtilty they can; let them draw it to the
thinness of a hair, and so this thrid may be a quarter of a
league long in extent, if not more; and in all this length
there will not be the space of an atom which is not cover'd
with Gold. Behold a strange and marvailous dilatation of
this half leaf. Let us do the like to all the rest of the beaten
Gold; it will appear that, by this means, this small button of
Gold may be so extended, as to reach from this City of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier</hi>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> and far beyond it: into how many millions of
atoms might not this gilded line be cut with small Sciffers.</p>
            <p>Now, 'tis easie to comprehend, that this extention and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility,
made by such gross instruments, as hammers and
Scissers, is not comparable to that which is made by the light
and rays of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And it is certain, that, if this gold may
be drawn into such a great length by spindles or wheels of iron,
some of its parts may easily be carried away by those winged
Coursers we spoke of before; I mean, by the rays that flie in a
moment from the Sun to the Earth.</p>
            <p>If I did not fear to prove tedious to you by my prolixity,
I would entertain you with the strange subtility of little
bodies; which issue forth from living bodies; by means
whereof our Dogs in <hi>England</hi> will pursue the scent of a
mans steps, or of a beasts, many miles: and not only so,
but they will find, in a great heap of stones, that which a
man hath touched with his hand: Therfore, it must needs be,
that upon the Earth, or upon the Stone, some material parts of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49807:13"/>
the touched body remain: yet the body doth not sensibly
diminish; no more than <hi>Ambergrise,</hi> and Spanish skins,
which will send out of them an odour during a hundred years,
without any diminution of skin or smell. In our Country
they use to sow a whole field with one sort of grain; to wit,
one year with Barley, the next with Wheat, the third with
Beans: and the fourth year they let it rest, and dung it, that
it may recover its vigor by attraction of the vital spirit it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivs
from the air; and so be plow'd up again after the same
degrees. Now, the year that the field is cover'd with Beans,
Passengers use to smell them at a good distance off, if the wind
blow accordingly, and they be in flower. It is a smell that
hath a suavity with it, but fading; and afterwards is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant,
and heady. But the smell of <hi>Rosemary,</hi> which
comes from the coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> goes much further. I have
sail'd along those coasts divers times, and observ'd always that
the Mariners know when they are within thirty or forty
leagues of the Continent, (I do not exactly remember the
distance): and they have this knowledge from the smell of the
<hi>Rosemary</hi> which so abounds in the fields of <hi>Spain.</hi> I have smelt it
as sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibly, as if I had had a branch of <hi>Rosemary</hi> in my hand;
and this a day or two before we could discover land; 'tis true,
the wind was in our faces, and came from the shore. Some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists
write that <hi>Vultures</hi> have come two or three hundred
leagus off, by the smell of carrens, and dead bodies left in the
field, after some bloody Battle; and it was known that these
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rds came from afar off, because none used breed near.
They have a quick smelling; and it must be that the rotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of those dead Carcaffes were transported by the air so far:
and those Birds, having once caught the scent, pursue it to the
very source, and, the nearer they come to that, the stronger it is.</p>
            <p>We will conclude here that which we had to say, touching
the great extent of those little Bodies, which, by the mediation
of the Sun-beams and of the Light, use to issue out of all Bodies
that are composed of Elements; which throng in the air, and
are carried a marvailous distance from the place and bodies
where they have their origin and source: the proof and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which things hath been the aim of my discourse hitherto.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lords, I must, if you please, make you see how
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49807:13"/>
               <hi>These small bodies, that so fill and compound the Air, are oftentimes
drawn to a road altogether differing from that which their universal
causes should make them hold:</hi> and it shall be our <hi>Fifth Principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One may remark, within the course and oeconomy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
divers sorts of attractions. As, that of <hi>Sucking;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I have seen leaden Bullets at the bottom of a long Barrel
exactly wrought, follow the air, which one suck'd out of the
mouth of the Gun, with that impetuosity and strength, that it
broke his teeth. The attraction of water or wine by a <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
is like to this: for, by means of that, the liquor is made
to pass from one Vessel into another, without changing any
way the colour, or rising of the lees. There is ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her sort
of attraction which is called <hi>Magnetical,</hi> wherby the <hi>Loadstone</hi>
draws the <hi>Iron.</hi> Another <hi>Electrick,</hi> when the <hi>Iet-stone</hi> draws
to it <hi>Straws.</hi> There is another of the <hi>Flame;</hi> when the smoke
of a Candle put out draws the flame of that which burns hard
by, and makes it descend to light that which is out. There
is another of <hi>Filtration,</hi> when a humid body climbs up a dry.
Lastly, when the <hi>Fire</hi> or some hot body draws the <hi>Air</hi> and that
which is mixed therwith.</p>
            <p>We will treat here of the two last <hi>species</hi> of Attraction; I
have sufficiently spoken of the rest in another place. Filtration
may seem to him who hath not attentively consider'd it, nor
examin'd by what circumstances so hidden a Secret of Nature
comes to pass, and to a person of a mean and limited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
to be done by some occult virtue or property;
and he will perswade himself that, within the <hi>Filtre</hi> or strayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instrument, there is some secret <hi>Sympathy,</hi> which makes
Water to mount up, contrary to its natural motion.</p>
            <p>But, he, who will examine the business, as it ought to be,
observing all that is done, without omiting any circumstance,
will find there is nothing more natural, and that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it should be otherwise. And we must make the same
judgment of all the profound and hidden'st mysteries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if men would take the pains to discover them, and
search into them with judgment.</p>
            <p>Behold, then, how Filtration is done. They use to put a
long toung of cloth, or cotten, or spongy matter, within an
earthen pot of Water or other liquor; and leave hanging
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49807:14"/>
upon the brim of the pot a good part of the cloth; and one
shall see the water presently mount up, and pass above the
brink of the Vessel, and drop, at the lower end of the piece
of cloth, upon the ground, or into some Vessel. And the
Gardners make use of this method, to water their plants and
flowers in Summer, by soft degrees. As also Apothecaries,
and Chymists, to separate their liquors from their dregs and
residences.</p>
            <p>To comprehend the reason why the water ascends in that
manner, let us nearly observe all that is done. That part
of the cloth which is within the water becomes wetted;
<hi>viz.</hi> it receivs and imbibes the water through its spungy
and dry parts at first. This cloth swells in receiving the
water; so, two bodies joyn'd together require more room
than one of them would by it self. Let us consider this
swelling and augmented extension, in the last thrid of them
which touch the water, <hi>viz.</hi> that on the <hi>super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icies;</hi> which,
to distinguish from the rest, let us mark at the two ends (as
by a line) with A. B. and the third which immediately
follows and is above it, with C. D. the next with E. F.
the next with G. H. and so to the end of the toung. I say
then, that the thrid A, B. dilating it self and swelling, by
means of the water which enters 'twixt it's fibres or
strings, approaches by little and little to C. D.; which is
yet dry, because it touches not the water: but when A. B.
is grown so gross and swol'n, by reason of the water which
enters, that it fills all the vacuity and distance 'twixt it and
C. D. as also that it presses against C. D. by reason of
it's extension, which is greater than the space was betwixt
them both; then it wets C. D., because the thrid A. B.
being compressed, the exterior part of the water which
was in it, coming to be push'd on upon C. D., seeks
there a place, and enters within the thrids, and wets them,
in the same manner as at first it's exterior and highest part
became wet. C. D. being so wetted, will dilate it self as
A. B. did; and consequently pressing against E. F. it cannot
choose but work the same effect in it, which before it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the swelling and dilatation of A. B. and so, by gentle
degrees, every thrid wets its neighbor, till the very last thrid of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49807:14"/>
the cloth toung. And it is not to be feared, that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of the Water will break, ascending this scale of chords;
or that it will recoil backwards: for, those little ladders, so
easy to be mounted, render the ascent facile, and the wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fibres of every thrid seem to reach their hands to help
them up at every step: and so the facility of geting up,
joyn'd with the fluidness of the water, and the nature of
quantity, (which tends always to the uniting of substances and
bodies which it clothes, when there occurs no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
cause to break and divide it) causes that the water
keeps it self in one piece, and passes above the brink of the
pot. After that, its vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age is made more easie, for it follows
its natural tendence, always downwards. And, if the end of
the cloth hangs lower without the pot, than the surface of
the water within, the water drops into the ground, or some
Vessel placed underneath; as we see a chord being hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a pully, the longest and heaviest end falls upon the ground,
and carries away the shortest and lightest, drawing it over
the pully. But, if the end of the cloth, without the pot, were
<hi>horizontal</hi> with the surface of the water, and hung no lower
than it, the water would be immoveable: as, the two sides
of a Ballance, when there's equal weight in both the scales.
And, if one should pour out part of the water that is in the
pot, so that the <hi>superficies</hi> grow lower than the end of the
cloth without: in that case the ascending water becoming
more heavy than the descendant on the other side, without the
pot, it would call back that which was gone out before and
ready to fall; and would make it thrust on and return to its
former pace, and enter again into the pot, to mingle with
the water there.</p>
            <p>You see then this mystery, which at first was surprizing,
displaid, and made as familiar and natural, as to see a stone
fall down from the air. 'Tis true, that to make a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, exact and compleatly rigorous, we must add
other circumstances; which I have done in another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
wherein I expressly treated of this subject. But that
which I now say is sufficient, to give a taste how this so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Attraction is performed,</p>
            <p>The other Attraction by Fire, which draws to it the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49807:15"/>
air, with the small bodies therein, is wrought thus;</p>
            <p>The Fire, acting according to its own nature, which it, to
push on a continual river or exhalation of its parts, from the
center to the circumference, carries away with it the air ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
and sticking to it on all sides; as the water of a river
trains along with it the earth of that channel or bed, through
which it glides. For, the air being humid, and the fire
dry, they cannot do less, than embrace and hug one another.
But, there must new air come from the places circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent,
to fill the room of that which is carried away by
the fire; otherwise there would a vacuity happen, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
abhors. This new air remains not long in the place it
comes to fill; but the fire, which is in a continual carreer
and emanation of its parts, carries it presently away, and
draws other: and so there is a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>petual and constant cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the air, as long as the action of fire continues. We
daily see the experience hereof: For, if one makes a good
fire in ones Chamber, it draws the air from the door and
windows; which though one would shut, yet there be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and holes for the air to enter, and, coming near them,
one shall hear a kind of whistling noise which the air makes in
pressing to enter. 'Tis the same cause that produces the sound
of the Organ and Flute. And he, who would stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the crevices and the fire, should find such an impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of that artificial wind, that he would be ready to freeze,
while he is ready to burn the other side next the fire. And a
Wax-candle held in this current of wind would melt, by the
flame blown against the wax, and waste away in a very short
time: wheras, if that Candle stood in a calm place, that the
flame might burn upward, it would last much longer. But,
if there be no passage wherby the air may enter into the
Chamber, one part, then, of the vapor of the wood, which
should have converted to flame and so mounted up the funnel
of the Chimney, descends downward against its nature, to
supply the defect of air within the said Chamber, and fills it
with smoke; but at last the fire choaks, and extinguishes, for
want of air. Whence it comes to pass, that the Chymists have
reason to say, that the air is the life of fire, as well as of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
But, if one puts a Bason or Vessel of water before the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49807:15"/>
fire upon the hearth, there will be no smoke in the Chamber;
although it be so close shut, that the air cannot enter: for,
the fire attracts part of the water, which is a liquid substance
and easie to move out of its place; which aquatic parts rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves into air, and therby perform the functions of
the air. This is more evidently seen if the Chamber be
little; for then the air, which is there pen'd in, is sooner
rais'd up and carried away. And, by reason of this attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they use to make great fires, where there is houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff,
of persons that dyed of the Pestilence, to dis-infect it.
For, by this inundation of attracted air, the fire as it were
sweeps the walls, floor, and other places of the Chamber;
and takes away those little putrified, sharp, corrosive, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
bodies, which were the infection that adhered to it:
drawing them into the fire, where they are partly burnt, and
partly sent up into the Chimney, accompanied with the
atomes of the fire and the smoke. 'Tis for this reason that
the great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (who groped so far into the secrets of
Nature) dis-infected, and freed from the Plague a whole
Province or entire Region; by causing them to make great
fires every where.</p>
            <p>Now, this manner of attraction is made, not only by simple
fire, but by that which partakes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by hot substances: and
that which is the reason and cause of the one, is also the cause
of the other. For, the Spirits or ignited parts, evaporating
from such a substance or hot body, carry away with them the
adjacent air; which must necessarily be supplied by other
air or some matter easily rari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iable into air; as we have spoken
of the bason and tub of water, put before the fire to hnder
smoke. 'Tis upon this foundation that Physicians ordain the
application of Pigeons, or Puppy's, or some other hot Animals,
to the soles of the feet, or the hand-wrists, or the stomachs, or
navils of their Patients; to extract out of their bodies the
wind or ill vapours which infect them. And, in time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
or universal infection of the air, Pigeons, Cats, Dogs,
with other hot Animals, which have continually a great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
or evaporation of Spirits, use to be killed: because
through attraction, the Air taking the room of the Spirits,
which issue forth by the evaporation, the pestiferous atomes,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49807:16"/>
which are scatter'd in the air and accompany it, use to stick
to their feathers, skins, or furs.</p>
            <p>And, for the same reason, we see that Bread coming hot
out of the Oven, put upon the Bung, draws to it the Must of the
Cask which would spoil the Wine: and that Onions, and
such hot bodies which perpetually exhale fiery parts, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the strength of their smel) are quickly poison'd with
infectious airs, if they be exposed to them: and, 'tis one of
the signs, to know whether the whole mass of the air be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
infected.</p>
            <p>And, one might reduce to this head the great attraction of
air by calcin'd bodies; and particularly by <hi>Tartar,</hi> all ignited
by the violent action of the fire which is crowded and encor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
among it's Salt. I have observed, that it attracts to
it nine times more air, than it self weighs. For, if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

not produce this History; although the Nun her self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
it to me, and a good number of Physicians assured
me of the truth thereof. There was a Nun, that, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of fasting, watching, and mental orisons, was so

and her bones dryed up and calcin'd. This heat then,
this in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ernal fire, drawing the air powerfully; this air
incorporated within her body, as it uses to do in Salt
of Tartar: and, the passages being all open, it got
to those parts where there is most serosity, which is the
bladder; and thence she rendred it in water among her
Urine, and that in an incredible quantity; for, she
voided, during some Weeks, more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds of Water every four and twenty hours.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49807:16"/>
With this notable example I will put an end to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I have urged to prove and explicate the attr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ited bodies, which are of the
nature of fire.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Sixth Principle</hi> shall be, that <hi>When fire or some hot body
attracts the Air and that which is within the Air, if it happens
that within that air there be found some dispersed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oms of the same
nature with the body that draws them; such atoms are more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attracted, than if they were Bodies of a different nature, and they
stay, stick, and mingle more willingly with the body which draws
them.</hi> The Reason hereof is, the Resemblance and <hi>Sympathy</hi>
they have one with the other. If I should not explicate
wherein this Resemblance consisted; I should expose my self
to the same censure and blame, as that which I taxed, at the
beginning of my discourse, in those, who spake but lightly
and vulgarly of the <hi>Powder of Sympathy,</hi> and such marvels of
Nature. But, when I shall have cleared that which I contend
for by such a resemblance and conveniency; I hope then you
will rest satisfied. I could make you see that there are many
sorts of Resemblances, which cause an Union between bodies;
but I will content my self to speak here only of three signal
ones.</p>
            <p>The first Resemblance shall be in Weight; whereby bodies
of the same degree of heaviness assemble together, The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wherof is eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. For, if one body were lighter, it would
occupy a higher situation than the heavier body; as on the
contrary, if a body were more weighty, it would descend
lower than that which is less heavy: but both having the same
degree of heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness, they keep company together in <hi>equilibrio,</hi>
As one may see by experience in this gentile example; which
some curious spirits use to Produce, to make us understand
how the <hi>Four Elements</hi> are situated one above the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their weight. They put in a vial the sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Turpentine tinctur'd with blew, for the Air, the spirit of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And, to represent the <hi>Earth,</hi> the Powder of some solid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enamell'd: you see them one upon the other w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng; and if you shake them together by a violent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:49807:17"/>
you shal see a Chaos, such a confusion, that it wil seem
there's no particular atoms that belong to any of those bodies,
they are so hudled pel mel altogether. But, cease this agitation,
and you shall see presently every one of these four substances go
to its natural place; calling again, &amp; labouring to unite all their
atoms in one distinct mass, that you shall see no mixture at all.</p>
            <p>The second Resemblance of bodies, which draw one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and unite, is among them which are of the same degree
of <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density.</hi> The nature and effect of Quantity is to
reduce to unity all things which it finds; if some other stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
power, (as, the differing substantial Form, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
it) do not hinder. And the reason is evident. For the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssence of Quantity is <hi>Divisibility</hi> or a <hi>Capacity to be divided,</hi>
that is to be <hi>made Many;</hi> whence may be inferr'd that Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it self is <hi>not-many;</hi> 'tis therfore of it self and in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
one continued extension, Seeing then that the nature of
Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>antity in general tends to Unity, and Continuity; the first dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Quantity, which are <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density,</hi> must produce
the same effect of Unity, and Continuity in those bodies which
participate in the same degree of them. For proof whereof, we
find, that water unites and incorporates it self strongly and easily
with water, oil with oil, spirit of wine with spirit of wine: but
water and oil will hardly unite, nor mercury with the spirit of
wine; and so other bodies of differing density and tenuity.</p>
            <p>The third Resemblance of bodies which unites and keeps
them strongly together, is that of <hi>Figure.</hi> I will not serve my
self here with the ingenious conceit of a Great Personage;
who holds that the continuity of Bodies results from some
smal hooks or clasps, which keep them together; and are
different in bodies of a differing nature: But (not to extend
my self too diffusively in every particularity) I will say in
gross, as an apparent thing, that every kind of body affects a
particular Figure. We see it plainly in the several sorts of
Salt; peel and stamp them separately, dissolve, coagulate, and
change them as long as you please; they come again alwayes
to their own natural figure, after every dissolution, and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
The ordinary Salt forms it self alwaies in cubes of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oursquare faces; Salt-peter in forms of six faces: Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac-salt
in <hi>Hexagons;</hi> as the Snow doth, which is sexangular.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49807:17"/>
Wherto Mr. <hi>Davison</hi> attributes the pentagonary figure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of those Stones, which were found in the Bladder of
<hi>Monsir Peletier,</hi> to the number of fourscore; for the same imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
efficient cause the Bladder had imprinted its action both
on the stones, and the salt of the urine. The Distillators ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that if they powre upon the dead head of some distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water which was distilled out of it, it imbibes it, and re-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
incontinently; wheras if one pour on it any other water
of an heterogeneous body, it swims on the top, and incorporates
with much difficulty. The reason is, that the distill'd water,
which seems to be an homogeneous body, is composed of smal
bodies of discrepant figures; as the Chymists plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate:
and these atoms being chaced, by the action of fire, out
of their own Chambers, or beds exactly fitted to them; when
they come back in their antient habitations, <hi>viz,</hi> to the pores
which are left in the dead heads, they accommodate themselvs,
and amiably rejoin and comensurate together. The same hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
when it rains, after a long drougth: for, the earth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
drinks up the water, which had been drawn up by the Sun;
wheras any other strange liquor would enter with some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
Now that there are differing po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in bodies which seem
to be homogeneous, <hi>Monsir Gassendus</hi> affirms, and undertakes to
prove, by the dissolution of Salts of differing natures in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
water. When, says he, you have dissolv'd in it common
Salt, as much as it can bear; if you put in only a scruple more,
it will leave it entire in the bottom, as if it were sand or plaister;
nevertheless it will dissolve a good quantity of Salt-peter; and
when 'tis glutted with this, 'twil dissolve as much of Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
salt, and so others of different figures. So that as I have
observed elsewhere, we see plainly by the oeconomy of Nature,
that bodies of the same figure use to mingle more strongly, and
unite themselves with more facility. Which is the reason why
those, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> make a strong glue, to piece together broken pots
of Porcelain or Chrystal, &amp;c. always mingle with the glue
the powder of that body, which they endeavour to re-accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date:
and the Goldsmiths themselvs, when they go about to soder
together pieces of gold, or silver, mingle alwayes their own
dust in the soder.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto run through the reasons and causes why
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49807:18"/>
bodies of the same nature, draw one to another with greater
facility and force, than others, and why they unite with more
promptitude; lets now see according to our method, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
confirms this discourse, for, in natural things we
must have recourse, <hi>en dernier ressort,</hi> to experience; and all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
that is not supported so, ought to be repudiated, or at
least suspected to be illegitimate.</p>
            <p>Tis an ordinary thing, when one find she ha's burnt his hand;
to hold it a good while as near the fire as he can, and by this
means the ignited atomes of the fire and of the hand mingling
together, and drawing one another; and the stronger of the
two, which are those of the fire, having the mastery, the hand
finds it self much eased of the inflammation which it suffer'd.
Tis an usual course, though a nasty one, of those who have ill
breaths, to hold their mouths open over a Privy, as long as they
can; and by the re-iteration of this remedy, they find themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
cured at last; the greater stink of the privy drawing to it, and
carrying away, the lesse, which is that of the mouth. They
who have been prick'd or bitten by a Viper or Scorpion, hold,
over the bitten or prick'd place, the head of a Viper or Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
bruised; and by this means the poyson, which, by a kind
of filtration crept on to gain the heart of the party, returns
back to its principles, and so leavs him well recover'd. In
time of common contagion, they use to carry about them
the powder of a Toad, and somtimes a living Toad or Spider,

               </gap>ick, or some other venemous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
which draws to it the contagious air, that otherwise would
infect the party: and the same powder of a Toad draws to it
the poyson of a plague sore. The Farcy is avenemous and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humor within the body of a Horse: hang a Toad about the
neck of the Horse, in a little bag, and he will be cured infallibly;
the Toad, which is the stronger poyson, drawing to it the venome
which was within the Horse. Make water to evaporate out of
a Stove, or other room, close shut; if there be nothing that
draws this vapor, it will stick to the walls of the Stove, and, as
it cools, recondense there into water; but if you put a bason or
bucket of water into any part of the Stove, it will attract all the
vapor which fil'd the chamber, and no part of the wall will be
wetted. If you dissolve <hi>Mercury,</hi> which, resolving into smoke,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49807:18"/>
passes into the recipient, put into the head of the limbeck
a little therof, and all the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the limbeck will gather
there, and nothing will passe into the recipient. If you distil
the Spirit of Salt, or of Vitriol, or the Baume of Sulpher, and
leave the passage free betwixt the Spirit and the dead head,
whence it issued; the Spirits will return to the dead head,
which, being fixt and not able to mount up, draws them to
it.</p>

that the Vines are in flower, the Wine, in their Cellars,

the Vines seem to exhale their Spirits in the Vineyards. He
makes use of the same example in dry Onions, which bud in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49807:19"/>
the House, when those in the Garden begin to come out of the
earth, and fill the air with their Spirits; shewing by these
known examples of Nature, the communication between Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons, and the souls of the Dead. Now those Viny Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
that issue from the buds and flowers, filling the air, (as the
Spirits of <hi>Rosem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry</hi> use to do in <hi>Spain)</hi> are drawn into the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
by the connatural and attractive vertue of the Wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
and these new volatil Spirits, entring, excite the more fixed
Spirits of the Wine, and so cause a fermentation; as if one
should pour therin new or sweet wine, for in all fermentations,
there is a separation made of the terrestial parts from the oily,
and so the lightest mount up to the <hi>Superficies,</hi> the heaviest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Tartar lees, which sink to the bottom. But, in this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if one be not very careful to keep the Wine in a proper
and temperate place, and the Cask full and well bung'd; and to
use other endeavours which are ordinary with <hi>Wine-Coopers,</hi>
one runs a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd to have his Wine impaird, or quite spoil'd;
because volatil Spirits, evaporating again, carry away with them
the Spirits of the wine that is barrel'd, by exciting and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with them. As in like manner, the Oil of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which
<hi>Monsur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errier</hi> made, attracting to it self the volatil Spirits of
<hi>Roses,</hi> diffused in the air in their Season, suffer'd such a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
and made every year new attractions of the like Spirits,
in regard of the affinity which this oil had contracted with
those Spirits at first; which it lost again still as the Season passed.
And tis for the very same reason, that a Table-cloath, or Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
spoted with <hi>Mulberries,</hi> or red Wine, is eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly whitned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
at the season that the Plants flower; wheras at any other
time, these spots can hardly be washed out. But, tis not only
in <hi>France,</hi> and other places where Vines are near Cellars of
wine, that this fermentation happens: in <hi>England,</hi> where we
have not Vines enough to make wine, the same thing is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
yea, and some particularities farther. Although they
make no wine in our Country, to any considerable proportion,
yet we have wine there in great abundance, brought over by
the <hi>Merchants.</hi> It uses to come principally from three places,
<hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> from <hi>Gascony.</hi> Now,
these Regions being under different Degrees and Climates, in
point of <hi>Latitude,</hi> and consequently one Country being hotter
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49807:19"/>
or colder, than the other; so that the same Vegetals grow to
maturity sooner: it comes to pass, that the foresaid fermenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of our differing Wines advances it self more or less, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
as the Vines, whence they proceed, do bud and flower in
the Region where they grow; it being consentaneous to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that every sort of wine attracts more willingly the Spirits
of those Vines whence it comes, than of any other.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear making some digression here, to unfold
some other effects of Nature; which we see often, and are not
less curious, than the most principal we treat of, and wil seem
to be derived from more obscure causes; notwithstanding, in
many circumstances, they depend on the same principles,
and, in many, much differing. First, touching <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les</hi> or marks,
which happen to Infants when their mothers, during the time
of their pregnancy, have long'd for some particular th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs. To
proceed after my accustomed manner; I will begin with an
example. A Lady of high condition, whom many of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
know, at least by reputation, hath upon her N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck the
figure of a <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or can
possibly represent one: for it bears not only the colour, but
the just proportion of a <hi>Mulberry,</hi> and is as it were emboss'd
upon her flesh. The Mother of this Lady, being w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th-child,
had a great mind to eat some <hi>Mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erries;</hi> and her fancy bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
satisfied, one of them casually fell upon her neck; the sanguin
juice whereof was soon wiped off, and she felt nothing at that
time. But the Child being born, the perfect figure of a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi>
was seen upon her Neck; in the same place where it fel
upon the Mothers: and every year, in <hi>Mulberpy</hi> season, this
impression, or rather this excrescence of flesh sweld, grew big,
and itch'd.</p>
            <p>Another Lady who had the like mark of a <hi>Stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berry,</hi> was more
incommodated therwith; for it, not only grew inflamed and
itch'd in <hi>Strawberry</hi>-season, but broke, like an Impostume,
whence iss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed forth a sharp corrosive humor. But, a skilful
Surgeon took all away, to the very roots, by cauterizing; so
that, since that time, she never felt any pain or alteration in
that place which incommodated her so much; it being become
a simple scar.</p>
            <p>Now then, lets endeavour to penetrate, if we can, the causes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49807:20"/>
and reasons of these marvailous effects. But, to go the more
handsomly to work, let us reflect. that, in the actions of all our
senses, there is a material and corporal participation of the
things we are sensible of, <hi>viz.</hi> some atoms of the body operate
upon our Senses, and enter into their organs; which serve
them as funnels, to conduct and carry them to the brain and
the imagination. This appears evidently in Vapours and
Savours. And for Hearing, the exterior air, being agitated,
causes a movement within the membrane or tympane of the
Ear, which gives the like shake to the hammer tyed thereto;
and that beating upon its anvil, causes a reciprocal motion in the
air, which is shut within the crannies of the Ear; and this is
that which we usually call Sound.</p>
            <p>Touching the Sight, tis evident that the Light, reflecting
from the body that is seen, enters into the eyes; and cannot,
bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bring with it some emanations of the body wheron it reflects;
as we have establish'd in our <hi>Second Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now to shew that the like is done in the grossest of
our senses, the Touch or Feeling. And if it be true, as we
have shewn, that every body sends forth a continual emanation
of atoms out of it self: it makes much for the assertion of this
truth. But to render it yet more manifest, and take away all
possibility of doubt, I will demonstrate it evidently to the eye:
wherof every one may make an experience in a quarter of an
hour, if he be so curious, yea, in a less compass of time.</p>
            <p>I believe you all know the notable affinity betwixt <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Quick-silver.</hi> If <hi>Gold</hi> but touches <hi>Mercury,</hi> that sticks close to it,
and whitens it so, that it scarce appears <hi>Gold,</hi> but <hi>silver</hi> only. If
you cast this blanched <hi>Gold</hi> into the fire, the heat chases and
drives away the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> returns to its former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
but, if you repeat this often, the <hi>Gold</hi> calcines, and then
you may pound, and reduce it to powder.</p>
            <p>Now, there is no dissolvant in the World that can well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
and burn the body of <hi>Gold,</hi> but <hi>Quick-silver.</hi> I speak of
that which is already formed by Nature; without engaging my
self to speak of that which is talked of among the Secrets of
Philosophy. Take then, a spoonful of <hi>Mercury</hi> in some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celan
or other dish, and finger it with one hand: if you have a
Gold-Ring on the other hand, it will become white and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49807:20"/>
with <hi>Mercury;</hi> though it doth not any way touch it.
Moreover, if you take a leaf or a Crown of gold in your mouth,
and put but one of your toes in a Vessel where <hi>Mercury</hi> is; the
Gold in your mouth, though you shut your lips never so close,
shall turn white and laden with <hi>Mercury:</hi> then, if you put the
Gold in the fire, to make all the <hi>Mercury</hi> evaporate, and re-iterate
this thing often, your Gold will be calcin'd, as if you
had, by amalgation, joyn'd <hi>Mercury</hi> therwith corporally. And
all this will yet be done more speedily and effectually, if, in lieu
of common <hi>Mercury,</hi> you make use of <hi>Mercury</hi> of Antimony,
which is much hotter, and more penetrating; and, though you
drive it away by force of fire, it will carry away with it a good
quantity of the substance of the Gold; that, re-iterating often
this operation, there will no more Gold remain for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
your experiments. If then, cold <hi>Mercury</hi> doth so pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the whole body; we ought not to think it strange, that
subtil atoms of fruit composed of many fiery parts wil pass with
more facility and quickness. I could further make you see
how such Spirits &amp; Emanations suddenly also penetrateev'n steel;
though it be a substance so compacted, cold, and hard, that the
said atoms keep there residence their many months and years.
In a living body, such as is Mans: the intern Spirits aid and
contribute much facility to the Spirits that are without, (such
as those of Fruits are,) to make their journy to the Brain.
The great Architect of Nature in the fabrick of a Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the master piece of corporal nature, hath placed there some
intern Spirits, to serve as Sentinels, to bring their discoveries
to their General, the <hi>Imagination,</hi> (which is, as it were, the
Mistress of the whole family,) wherby the man might know
and understand, what is done without his Kingdom, in the
great World; and might shun what is noxious and seek after
that which is profitable. For, these Sentinels or intern Spirits,
with all the inhabitants of the sensitive organs, are not able to
to judg alone: insomuch, that, if the Imagination or thought,
be distracted strongly to some other object, these intern Spirits
do not know whether a man hath drunk the wine which he
hath swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low'd; if perchance, seeing a person who comes to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
him, he fixes his eye upon him all the while, or he listens
attentively to the air of some melodious Song or musical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49807:21"/>
The inward Spirits the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore bring all their
acquisitions to the Imagination; and if she be not more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent upon another object, she falls a forming certain Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as
and Images: for the atoms from without, being convey'd by
these intern Spirits to our imagination, erect there the like
edifice, or else a model in short resembling the great body
whence they come, And if the Imagination hath no more
use of those significative atoms for the present, she ranges them
in some proper place within her Magazin, the <hi>Memory;</hi> where
she can recall, and send them back when she pleases. And if
there be any object which causes some emotions in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and touches her nearer, than common objects use to do;
she sends back her Sentinels, the internal Spirits, upon the
Confines, to bring her more particular news. Hence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that being surprized by some particular person, or other
object, that has already some eminent place in his Imagination,
be it with desire or aversion, man suddenly changes colour,
and becomes now red, then pale, then red again at divers
times: according as the Ministers, which are those intern
Spirits, go quick or slow towards their object, and return with
their reports to their Mistress, which is the Imagination. But,
besides these passages we speak of, from the brain to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
parts of the body, by the ministry of the nerv's; there is
also a great road from the Brain to the Heart; by which the
vital spirits ascend from the Heart to the Brain, to be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and hereby the Imagination sends to the Heart those
atoms which she hath receiv'd from some external object. And
there they make an ebullition among the vital Spirits; which,
according to the intervening atoms, either cause a <hi>dilatation</hi>
of the Heart, and so gladden it; or contract it, and so sadden it:
and these two differing and contrary actions are the first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
effects, whence proceed afterwards the particular <hi>Passions;</hi>
which require not that I pursue them too far in this place,
having done it more particularly else where, and more expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Besides these passages, which are common to all Men and
Women, there is another that's peculiar only to females;
which is, from the Brain to the <hi>Matrix:</hi> wherby it often falls
out that such violent vapours mount up to the Brain; and those
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49807:21"/>
in so great a number, that they often hinder the operation of
the Brain and Imagination, causing convulsions and follies, with
other strange accidents; and by the same channel, the Spirits
or atoms pass with a greater liberty and swiftness to the womb
or <hi>Matrix,</hi> when the case requires.</p>
            <p>Now, lets consider how the strong Imagination of one m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
doth marvailously act upon another man, who hath it more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and passive. We see daily, that, if a person gape; those
who see him gaping are excited to do the same. If one fall
in company with persons that are in a fit of laughter, he can
hardly forbear laughing, though he knows not, why they laugh:
or if one enters into an house where all the World is sad; he
becomes melancholy. Women and Children, being very
moist and passive, are most susceptible of this unpleasing conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Imagination. I have known a very melancholy
woman, which was subject to the disease called the <hi>Mother;</hi> and
while she continued in that mood, she thought her self posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and did strange things, which among those that knew not
the cause, passed for supernatural effects, and of one possessed
by the ill spirit, she was a person of quality; and all this hap'ned
through the deep resentment she had for the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
She had attending her four or five young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
wherof some were her Kinswomen, and others serv'd her
as Chamber-maids: All these came to be possessed as she was,
and did prodigious actions. These young Maids were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from her sight and communication; and not having yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
such profound roots of the evil, they came to be all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by their absence: and this Lady was also cured afterwards
by a Physician, who purg'd the <hi>atrabilious</hi> humors, and restored
her <hi>Matrix</hi> to its former estate. There was neither imposture, or
dissimulation in this.</p>
            <p>I could make a notable recital of such passions, that hap'ned
to the <hi>Nuns</hi> at <hi>Lodun:</hi> but, having done it in a particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
at my return from that Country, where I, as exactly as
I could, discussed the point, I will forbear speaking therof at
this time. And only pray you to remember, that, when two
Lutes or Harps, near one another are both set to the same
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>une; if you touch the strings of the one, the other consonant
Instrument will sound at the same time, though no
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49807:22"/>
body touch it; whereof <hi>Galileo</hi> hath ingeniously rendred the
reason.</p>
            <p>Now, to make application to our purpose of all that
hath been produced about it, I say that, since it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that any two several persons should be so near one
the other as the Mother and the Infant in her womb;
one may thence conclude, that all the effects of a strong and
vehement Imagination, working upon another more feeble, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and tender, ought to be more efficacious in the
Mother acting upon her Infant, than when the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of other persons act upon those who are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them. And, as it is impossible for a Master of
Musick, let him be never so expert and exact, to tune so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
any two Harps, as the great Master of the Universe
do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the two bodies of the Mother and the Infant; so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
the concussion of the principal strings of the Mother,
which is her Imagination, must produce a greater shaking
of the consonant string in the Infant, to wit, his Imagination,
than the string of one Lute being struck, can of the Consonant
strings of another. Wherefore, when the Mother sends
Spirits to some parts of her body, the like must be sent to those
parts of the Childs body.</p>
            <p>Now, lets call to memory, how the Imagination of the
Mother is ful of corporeal atoms, coming from the <hi>Mulberry</hi>
or <hi>Strawberry,</hi> that fel upon her Neck and Brest; and her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
being then surprized with an emotion, by the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the accident, it follows necessarily, that she must send
some of these atoms also to the Brain of the Infant, and so to
the same part of the body, where she took the stain at first;
twixt which and the brain, there pass such frequent and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
messengers, as we have formerly set forth. The Infant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
having his parts tuned in an harmonious consonance with the
Mothers, cannot fail to observe the same movement of spirits,
twixt his Imaginations and his neck and brest, as the
mother did 'twixt hers: and, these Spirits, being accompanied
with atoms of the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> which the Mother convey'd to his
Imagination, make a deep impression and lasting mark upon
his delicate skin, wheras that of the mothers was more hard.
As if one should let fly a Pistol charg'd with powder only,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49807:22"/>
against a Marble, the powder would do nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully it
a little, which may quickly be rub'd off; but if one should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
such a Pistol at a Man's face, the grains of the powder
would pierce the skin, and stick and dwel there, all his life time,
making themselvs known by their black-blewish colour, which
they always conserve.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the smal grains or atoms of the Fruit, which
passed from the Mothers neck to the Imagination of the Infant,
and thence to the same place upon his skin, do lodg and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
dwel there for the future; and serve as a source to draw
the atoms of the like fruit dispersed in the air, in their season,
(as the wine in the Tun draws to it the volatil spirits of the
Vines) and by drawing them, the part of the skin, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
ferments, swels, corrod's, inflames, and sometimes break<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
But to render yet more considerable these marvailous marks of
longing, (since we are upon this subject), I cannot forbear to
touch also another circumstance, which might seem at
first to be a miracle of Nature, beyond the causes which I
have alledg'd: but having well eventilated it, we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
find that it depends upon the same principles. T'is.
that oftentimes it falls out, that the impression of the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
or longed for by the Mother, sticks on the Child; though
the thing it self ne'r toucht the mothers body. T'is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that some other thing fal or inexpectedly beat upon some
part of the woman with-child, while such a longing predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in her imagination; and the figure of the thing so long'd
for, will be found at last imprinted on the same part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Infant, where the Mother receiv'd the stroke. The
reason hereof is, that the atoms of the thing long'd for, being
rais'd up by the Light, go to the brain of the Mother, through
the channel of her eyes, as well as other more material atoms,
proceeding from the corporeal touch, would go thither, by
the guidance of the nervs: And, of these petty bodies, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forms in her imagination a complete model of that
whence they flow by way of emanation. Now, if her mind
only run on it, these atoms, which are in her imagination,
make no other voyage, than to her heart, and thence to the
imagination and heart of the Infant; and so cause a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Passion in them both which may be moved
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49807:23"/>
to such a violent impetuosity, that, if the Mother doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her long'd-for object, this passion may cause the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of her and her Infant, at least make so great a change
in their bodies as may prejudice them both in their healths' But,
if some unlook'd-for blow surprize the mother in any part of her
body, it often happens that the spirits, which reside in the brain,
are immediately sent to that part by her imagination. And, in
all such sudden surprisals, either in women or men, these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are transported with the more impetuosity, the more the
Passion is violent: As, when one loves another passionately,
he runs suddenly to the door when any knocks, or that—<hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax
in limine latrat,</hi> hoping always t'is the party that entirely
occupies his thoughts, (for <hi>qui amant ipsi sili s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mnia fingunt)</hi>
who comes to give him a visit. These spirits then moved by

the fantasie, carry them along with themselvs to the part of the
body which is struck; as also to the same part of the body
of the Infant, as well as to his Imagination: and after that, all
which haprens is but the same in respect of the Mother and
the child; as when the <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>berry</hi> or <hi>Strawberry</hi> fell upon the
neck or breast of the Ladies, with whom I have entertain'd
you.</p>
            <p>Permit me, my Lords, to inlarge my digression a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by re-accounting to you a marvailous accident, known all
over the Court of <hi>England;</hi> in the confirmation of the activity and
impression which the Imagination of the Mother makes upon
the body of the Infant in her womb. A Lady that was my
Kinswoman, (she was the Neice of <hi>Fortescu,</hi> the Daughter of
Count <hi>Arundel)</hi> came to give me visits somtimes in <hi>London;</hi>
she was handsome and knew it well; taking great complacency
not only to keep her self so, but to add that which she could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
wherefore being perswaded that black Patches which
she used, gave her a great deal of ornament, she was careful to
wear the most curious sort. But as it is very hard to
keep a moderation, in things which depend more upon
<hi>Opinion,</hi> than <hi>Nature;</hi> she wore them in excess, and patched
most of her face with them, Though that did not much add
to her beauty, and I took the liberty to tell her so
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49807:23"/>
yet I thought it no opportunity then, to do any thing that
should give her the least diftast; since with so much civility and
sweetness she came to visit me. Nevertheless, one day I
thought good, in a kind of drolling way so that she might not
take any disgust, (and <hi>Ridentem dicere verum quis vetat?)</hi>
to tell her of it; so I let my discourse fall upon her <hi>great-belly,</hi>
advising her to have a care of her health, wherof she was
somewhat negligent; according to the custom of young
vigorous women, which know not yet what it is to be subject
to indispositions, She gently thank'd me for my care herein;
saying, That she could do no more for the preservation
of her health, than she did, though she was in that case.
You should at least, I reply'd, have a great care of your
Child, O! for that, said she, there is nothing can be contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Yet, I told her, see how many <hi>Patches</hi> you we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
upon your face: are you not afraid that the Infant in your
womb may haply be born with such marks on his face?
But, said she, What danger is there that my child should
bear such marks, though I put them on artificially? Then,
you have not heard, I reply'd, the marvailous effects that the
imaginations of Mothers work upon the bodies of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
while they are yet big with them; therfore I will reac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to you some of them. So I related to her sundry stories
upon this subject: as, that of the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who was
delivered of a white Boy; which was attributed to a Pictu reof
the Blessed Virgin, she had near the teaster of her bed, where
bore she great devotion. I urged another, of awoman who was
brought to bed of a child all hairie; because of a pourtrait of
<hi>St. Iohn Baptist</hi> in the Wilderness, when he wore a coat of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
hair. I re-accounted to her also the strange Antipathy
which the late <hi>King Iames</hi> had to a naked sword; wherof the cause
was ascribed to some <hi>Schotch</hi> Lords, entring once violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bed-chamber of the Queen his Mother, while she was
with child of him, where her Secretary, an <hi>Italian,</hi> was dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some letters for her: whomthey hack'd and kill'd with naked
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ords, before her face, and threw him at her feet; and they
grew so barbarous, that they had near hurt the Queen her self
who endeavour'd to save her Secretary by interp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sing her
self, for her skin was rased in divers places. <hi>Bucanan</hi>
makes mention of this Tragedy. Hence it came
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49807:24"/>
that her Son, King <hi>Iames,</hi> had such an aversion all his life
time to a naked Sword; that he could not see one, without a
great emotion of spirits: and, though otherwise couragious
enough, he could not over-master his passions in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
I remember, when he dub'd me <hi>Knight;</hi> in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of putting a naked Sword upon my shoulder, he could
not endure to look upon it, but turned his face ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; insomuch that, in lieu of touching my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he had almost thrust the point into my eyes, had
not the Duke of <hi>Buckingingham</hi> guided his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>I alledg'd to her divers such stories; to make her apprehend,
that a strong Imagination of the Mother might cause some
notable impression upon the body of her Child, to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
And 'pray consider, said I, how attentive you are
to your Patches, how you have them continually in your
imagination; for, I have observed, that you have look'd on
them ten times since you came to this room, in the Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass.
Have you, therfore, no apprehension that your child
may be born with half-moons upon his face; or rather, that
all the black, which you spot in several places up and down
may assemble in one, and appear in the middle of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
the most apparant and remarkable part of the visage,
as broad as a <hi>Iacobus:</hi> and then, what a grace would it be to the
Child. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mee! said she, rather than that should happen,
I will wear no more Patches, and while I am with-child: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
instantly she pul'd them all off, and threw them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
When her friends saw her afterwards without
Patches; they demanded how it came to pass, that she,
who was esteem'd to be one of the most curious Beauties
of the Court, in point of Patches, should so suddenly give
over wearing them? She answer'd, that her Uncle, in
whom she had a great deal of belief, assured her, that,
if she wore them, during the time she was with-child, the
Infant would have a large black patch in the midst of his
forehead. Now, this conceit was so lively engraven
in her imagination, that she could not thrust it out: And so
this poor Lady, who was so fearful that her child should bear
some black mark in its face, yet could not prevent, but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49807:24"/>
it came so into the World, and had a spot as large as a Crown
of Gold in the midst of the forehead; according as she had
figured before in her imagination. It was a Daughter that
she brought forth every way very beautiful, this excepted:
'tis but few moneths since, that I saw her bearing the said mole
or spot, which proceeded from the force of the Imagination
of her Mother.</p>
            <p>I need not tel you of your Neighbour of <hi>Carcassona;</hi> who
lately was brought to bed of a prodigious Monster, exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
an Ape, which she took pleasure to look upon, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time she was with-child: for, I conceive you know
the story better than I. Nor of the woman of <hi>St. Maixent,</hi>
who could not forbear going to see an infortunate child of a
poor passenger woman, that was born without arms; and she
her self was deliver'd afterwards of such a Monster; who yet
had some smal excrescences of flesh upon the shoulders, about
the place whence the arms should have come forth. As also
of her who was desirous to see the execution of a Criminal,
that had his head cut off according to the laws of <hi>France:</hi>
wherof her affrightment made so deep a print upon her Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that presently falling in labour, before they could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her, to her lodging, she was brought to-bed, before her time,
of a Child who had his head sever'd from his body, both the
parts yet shedding fresh blood, besides that which was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
shed in the womb; as if the heads-man had done an
execution also upon the tender young body within the
Mothers wombe. These three Examples, manifestly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
prove the strength of the Imagination: and many
others, as true I could produce; which would engage me
too far, if I should undertake to clear the causes and unwrap
the difficulties that would be found greater in them, than in any
of those wherwith I have entertain'd you. Because those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
had the power to cause essential changes and fearful effects,
upon bodies that were already brought to their perfect shapes;
and it may be well believ'd, that in some of them there was a
transmutation of one <hi>species</hi> to another, and the introduction
of a new <hi>Form</hi> into the subject-Matter, totally differing
from that which had been introduced at first; at least, if
that which most Naturalists tell us, at the animation of the
<pb facs="tcp:49807:25"/>
Embryo in the womb, be true. But this digression hath been
already too long</p>
            <p>To return then, to the great channel and thrid of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
The examples and experiments, which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
insisted on in confirmation of the reasons I have aledg'd,
clearly demonstrate that Bodies, which draw the atomes disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the air, attract themselvs such as are of their own nature,
with a greater force and energy, than other heterogeneous and
strange atoms; as Wine doth the vinal spirits; The oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
perfum'd in the making, with Roses, drew the volatil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Rose; The flesh of Deer, or Venison buried in crust,
attracts the spirits of those Beasts; and so all the other wherof
I have spoken.</p>
            <p>The History of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
is
very famous: you know how the venome of this Animal, ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the part that was bitten, towards the head and heart of
the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies; excites in their Imagination an impetuous desire to
hear some melodious airs; and most commonly they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with differing airs. Therfore, when they hear an air
that pleases them, they begin to dance incessantly; and, therby
fall a sweating in such abundance, that a great part of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
evaporates. Besides, the sound of the musick raises a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and causes an agitation among the aereal and vaporous
Spirits in the brain, and about the heart; and diffused up and
down through the whole body, proportionably to the nature
and cadence of such Musick! as, when <hi>Timotheus</hi> transported
<hi>Alexander the great</hi> with such a vehemency, to what Passions he
pleas'd: and, as when one Lute struck makes the consonant
strings of the other to tremble, by the motions and tremblings
which it causes in the air; though they be not touch'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at all. We find too, oftentimes, that Sounds (which are
no other thing, than Motions of the air,) cause the like move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Water: as, the harsh sound, caus'd by rubbing hard
with ones finger, the brim of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> full of water, excites a noise,
a turning, and boundings, as if it danced according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Sound: The harmonious Sounds also of Bells, in
those Countries where they use to be rung to particular tunes,
makes the like impressions upon the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Rivers that
are nigh the Steeple, as in the Air especially in the night time,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49807:25"/>
when there is no other movement, to stop or choak the other
supervenient one. For, the air being contiguous, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous,
with the water; and the water being susceptible of
movement; ther's the like motion caused in the fluid parts of
the water, as began in the air. And, the same contract, which is
betwixt the agitated air, and the water by this means moved
to; happens also to be betwixt the agitated air, and the vap'rous
Spirits in those bodies that have been bitten by the <hi>Tarantula;</hi>
which Spirits, by consequence, are moved by the agitated air,
that is to say, by the Sound; and that the more efficaciously, the
more this agitation or Sound is proportion'd to the nature and
temperature of the party hurt. And, this intern agitation of the
Spirits and vapours helps them to discharge the vaporous ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> which is mixt among all their humours:
as standing puddle Waters and corrupted airs, putrified by long
repose, and the mixture of other noisome substance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, are refin'd
and purifi'd by motion. Now, winter appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ching, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
these Animals, the persons are freed from this malady;
but, at the return of that season when they use to be bitten, the
mischief returns, and they must dance again as they did, the
year before. The reason is, that the heat of Summer revives these
Beasts, so that their venom becomes as malignant and furious as
before; and, that being heated and evaporating it self, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in the air the leven of the same poyson, which remains in
the bodies of them who have been hurt, that draws it to it self;
wherby such a fermentation is wrought, as infects the other
humours, and thence a kind of steam issuing and mounting to
the brain, uses to produce such strange effects.</p>
            <p>It is also well known that, where there are great dogs or
Mastifs (as in <hi>England)</hi> if any be bitten perchance by them,
they commonly use to be kil'd, though they be not mad; for
fear, least the leven of the canine choler which remains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the body of the party bitten, might draw to it the malignant
spirits of the same dog, (should he afterwards chance to be
mad) which might come to distemper the spirits of the person.
And, this is not only practised in <hi>England,</hi> where there are such
dangerous dogs; but also in <hi>France;</hi> according to the report of
<hi>Father Cheron, Provincial</hi> of the <hi>

               <hi>I</hi> will say nothing of artificial Noses, made of the flesh of

as soon as those persons, out of whose substance they were
taken, come to die; as if that small parcel of flesh, engrafted

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>clusion needs not much proof, being evident enough of it
self. If there be nails, pins, or ribands, tied to the end of a long
chord or chain, and withal a lump, either of wax, gum, or glue;
and <hi>I</hi> take this chord or chain by one end, and draw it to me,
till the other end come to my hand: it cannot be otherwise but,
at the same time, the nails, the pins, the ribands, the lump, and
in fine, all that hangs at it must come to my hand. <hi>I</hi> go therfore
to relate to you, only, some experiments that have been made,
in consequence of this Principle; which will most strongly
confirm the others produced before.</p>
            <p>The great fertility and riches of <hi>England</hi> consists chiefly in
pasturage for Cattle; wherof we have the fairest in the world,
principally of Oxen and Kine. Ther's not the meanest Cottager,
but hath a Cow to furnish his Family with milk: 'tis the principal
sustenance of the poorer sort of people, as 'tis also in <hi>Switzerland;</hi>
which makes them very careful of the good keeping and health
of their Cows. Now, if it happen that the Milk boil over, and so
comes to fall into the fire, the good woman or maid presently
gives over whatever she is adoing and runs to take the Vessel
off the fire: and, at the same time, she takes a handful of Salt,
which uses to be commonly in the corner of the Chimney to
keep it dry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and throws it upon the cinders where the milk
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49807:26"/>
was shed. Ask her, wherfore she doth so? and she will tell
you, 'tis to prevent a mischief to the Cows Udder, which gave
this milk: for without this remedy, it would grow hard and
ulcerated; and she would come to piss blood, and so be in
danger to die. Not that 'twould rise to this extremity the first
time; but she would grow ill-disposed, and if this should
happen often, the Cow would soon miscarry. It might seem
that there were some superstition or folly in this: but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the effect warrants from the last, and, for the first,
many indeed believe that the malady of the Cow is supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or an effect of Sorcery, and consequently that the remedy
which I have alledg'd is superstitious; but 'tis easie to disabuse
any man of this perswasion, by declaring how the business
goes, according to the foundations I have laid. The milk
falling upon the burning coals is converted to vapour, which
disperses and filtreth it self through the circumambient air,
where it encounters the Light and Solar rays which tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>port
it further; augmenting and extending still farther the Sphere
of its activity. This vapour of the milk is not alone or simple;
but compos'd of fiery atoms, which accompany the smoke and
vapour of the milk, mingling and uniting themselvs therwith.
Now, the sphere of the said vapour extending it self to the
place where the Cow is; her Udder, which is the source
whence the milk proceeded, attracts to it the said vapour, and
sucks it in together with the fiery atoms that accompanied it.
The Udder is, part, glandulous and very tender; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
very subject to inflammations: this fire then heats, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames,
and swells it; and in fine, makes it hard and ulcerated.
The inflamed and ulcerated Udder is near the Bladder; which
comes likewise to be inflamed: making the <hi>anastomoses</hi> and
communication 'twixt the veins and arteries to open and cast
forth blood, and to regorge into the bladder, whence the Urine
empty's it self. But, whence comes it, you will ask, that the Salt
remedies all this? 'Tis because that is of a nature clean contrary
to the fire; the one being hot and volatil, the other cold and
fixed: insomuch that, where they use to encounter, the
Salt, as it were, knocks down the fire, by precipitating
and destroying its action; as may be observ'd in a very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
accident. The chimneys which are full of Soot use to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49807:27"/>
take fire very easily; and, the usual remedy for this is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a Musket in the funnel of the Chimney, which loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and brings down with it the fired Soot, and then the
disorder ceases: but, if there be no Musket, or Pistol, or
other Instrument to fetch down the Soot, they use to cast a
great quantity of Salt on the fire below; and that chokes, and
hinders the atoms of fire, that otherwise would incessantly
mount up and joyn with them above, which, by this means
wanting nouriture, consume themselvs, and come to nothing.
The same thing befalls the atoms which are ready to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the vapour of the milk; the salt precipitates and kills
them on the very place: and if any chance to scape and save
themselvs, by the great strugglings they make, and go along
with the said vapour, they are nevertheless accompanied with
the atoms and spirit of the Salt sticking to them; which, like
good wrestlers, never leave their hold, till they have got the
better of their Adversary. And you may please to observe
by the by, that that there is not a more excellent balme for a
burn, than the spirit of salt, in a moderate quantity. 'Tis
then apparent, that there cannot be employ'd any means more
efficacious, to hinder the ill effects of the fire upon the Udder
of the Cow; than to cast upon her milk, that has boil'd over
upon the Cinders, a sufficient quantity of Salt. This effect,
of securing the Cows Udder upon the burning of her milk,
makes me call to mind, what divers have told me they have
seen both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England, viz.</hi> when the Physicians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the milk of a Nurse, for the Child of a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
they use to make proofs several ways, before they come
to judg definitively of the goodness thereof; as, by the taste,
by the smell, by the colour and consistence of it: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they cause it to be boil'd, till it come to an evaporation
and they see it's residence, with other accidents and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which may be learnt and discern'd by this means. But,
those, of whose milk this last experiment hath been made,
have felt themselvs so tormented in their Paps, while their milk
was a boiling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, having once endured this pain, they
would never consent that their milk should be carried away
out of their sight and presence: though they willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to any other proof than that by fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:49807:27"/>
Now, to confirm this experiment of the attraction which
the Cows Udder makes of the fire and vapour of the burnt
milk, I am going to recount to you another of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
wherof I my self have seen the truth more than once,
and wherof any one may easily make trial. Take the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Dog, and throw it into the fire, more than once; at
first you shall find him heated and moved, but, in a short time,
you shall see him, as if he were burnt all over, panting and
stretching out his tongue, as if he had run a long course.
Now, this alteration befalls him, because his entrails, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them the vapour of the burn'd excrement, and, with
that vapour, the atoms of fire which accompanied it, grow so
chang'd and inflam'd, that the Dog, having always a Fever
upon him, and not being able to take any nourishment, his
flancks cling together and he dies. 'Twere dangerous to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
this experience among such persons, as are subject to
make use of any thing for doing of miscief: for, the same
effect, would be wrought upon Mens Bodies, if one should
try the conclusion upon their excrements.</p>
            <p>There hap'ned a remarkable thing to this purpose, to a
neighbor of mine in <hi>England,</hi> the last time I was there: He
had a very pretty Child, whom because he would have always
in his eye, he kept the Nurse in his House. I saw him often,
for he was a stirring man, and of good address; and I had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to use such a man. One day I found him very sad, and
his Wife a weeping: wherof demanding the reason, they told
me that that their little Child was very ill; that he had a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fever, which inflamed him all over, as appear'd the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his face; that he strove to go to Stool, but could do
little, and that little he did was cover'd with blood; and that
he refused also to suck: And that which troubled them most
was, that they could not conjecture how this indisposition
come; for his Nurse was very well, her milk was as good as
could be wished; and in all other things there was as much care
had of him as could be. I told them, that the last time I was with
them, I observ'd one particularity, wherof I thought fit to
give them notice; but somthing or other still diverted me;
'twas this, that the Child, making a sign that he was desirous
to be set on his feet, let fall his excrements on the ground;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49807:28"/>
and his Nurse presently took the Fire-shovel and cover'd them
with embers, and then threw all into the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The mother
began to make her excuses, that they were not more careful
to correct this ill habit of the child; telling me that, as he
advanc'd in years, he should be corrected for it. I replied,
that 'twas not for this consideration that I spake of it: but
searching after the reason of her childs distemper, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to find some remedy. And thereupon, I related
to them the like accident which had hap'ned, two or three
three years before, to a child of one of the most illustrious
Magistrates of the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> who was bred up in
the House of a Doctor of Physick of great reputation in the
same Town: I told them also what I have now related to you,
touching the excrements of Dogs. And I made reflections
to them upon a thing they had often heard, and which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
practised in our Country; <hi>viz.</hi> that, In the Villages,
which are always dirty in the winter, if there happens to be a
Farmer any thing more neat than others, and that keeps the
approaches to his House cleaner than his neighbours do, the
Boys use to come thither, in the night time or when it begins
to be dark, to discharge their bellies there: because, in such
Villages there is not much commodity of easments; besides
that in such clean places the knaves are out of danger to sink
into the dirt, which otherwise might rise up higher than their
shooes. The good houswives in the morning, when they
open their doors, and find such an ill-favour'd smell, use to
be transported with choller: But they, who are acquainted
with this trick, go presently and make red hot a Spit, or Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shovel,
and thrust it so into the excrements, and when 'tis
quencht, they heat it again and again to the same purpose.
Mean while the Boy, that had plaid the sloven, feels a kind of
pain and collick in his bowels, with an inflammation in his
fundament and a continual desire to go to Stool: and he is
hardly quit of it, till he suffer a kind of Feaver all that day;
which makes him return thither no more. And these women,
to be freed from such affronts, pass among the Ignorant for
Sorceresses, and to have made a compact with the Divel;
since they torment people in that fashion, without seeing or
touching them. This Gentleman did not disallow those
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49807:28"/>
things I have already told you; but was confirm'd farther when
I wish'd him to look farther into the fundament of his child,
for without doubt he should find it red and inflamed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
full of pimples, and excoriated. Not long after, this
poor chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grew ill, and with much pain and pitiful cries,
voided some small matter: which in lieu of casting into
the fire or covering it with embers, I caused to be put into a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of cold water and set in a cool place. This was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to be done, every time the child gave occasion; and he
began to amend the very same hour, and, within four or five
daies became perfectly well recover'd. But, least I trespass
too much upon your patience, I'le hold you no longer, but
with one experiment more, very familiar in our Countrey:
and then I will summ up all that hath been said; to make you

the ground in the morning presses forth the impostume: the
matter wherof sticks to the place. Now, this turf of Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exposed in some proper place, to receive the dry cold
blasts of the Northern winds; those blasts intermingle with
the said corrupt impostumated matter: which spreading its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
about through all the air, the ulcerated foot of the Animal,
(being their sourse) draws them to it, and with them the cold dry
atoms which cure it; the malady requiring no other help than
to be wel dry'd, and refreshed. But, if one should expose
this turf to a moist hottish wind, it weuld produce contrary
effects.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi> wounded in the hand, and a great inflammation
following upon his hurt; his Garter is taken, cover'd with the
blood that issued from the wound, and is steep'd in a bason of
water where <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>triol</hi> was dissolv'd, one keeps the Bason in a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
moderately warm'd by the Sun all day, and at night in the
chimney corner; so that the blood upon the Garter be always
in a good natural temperament, neither colder nor hotter than
the degree required in a healthful body: What now must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
(according to the doctrine that we endeavour to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,)
from all this? In the first place, the Sun and Light will
attract, a great extent and distance off, the spirits of the blood
upon the Garter: and the moderate heat of the chimney, acting
gently upon the composition, (which comes to the same thing,
as if one should carry it dry in his pocket, to make it feel the
temperate heat of the Body,) will push out and thrust forward
still the said atoms, and make them march of themselvs a good
way in the air round about, to help therby the attraction of the
Sun and Light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> being incorporated with the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49807:29"/>
blood cannot choose but make the same voyage together with
the atoms of the blood. Thirdly, the wounded hand expires
and exhales, in the mean time, continually abundance of hot
fiery Spirits, which stream as a river out of the inflamed hurt:
nor can this be, but the wound must, consequently, draw to it
the air which is next it. Fourthly, this air must draw to it the
other air next it, and that the next to it also; and so there will
be a kind of current of air drawn round about the wound.
Fiftly, with this air will come to incorporate at last the atoms
and Spirits of the Blood and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffused a good
way off in the air, by the attractions of the Light and the Sun:
Besides, it may well be, that, from the begining, the orb and
sphere of these atomes and Spirits extended it self to so great a
distance; without having need of the attractions of the air, or
light to make them come thither. Sixthly, the atoms of blood,
finding the proper source and original root whence they issued,
will stay there, re-entering into their natural beds and prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
receptacles: wheras the other air, being but a passenger,
will evaporate away as soon as it comes; as, when it is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
through the funnel of the chimney, as soon as it is drawn
into the chamber by the door. Seventhly, the atoms of the
blood being inseparable from the Spirits of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> both
the one and the other will joyntly be imbibed together within
all the corners, fibres, and orifices of the Veins which lye open
about the wound; whence it must of necessity be refresh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
in fine imperceptibly cured.</p>
            <p>Now to know in virtue of what such an effect and cure is so
happily performed, we must examine the nature of <hi>Vitriol:</hi>
which is composed of two parts; the one fixed, the other vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til.
The fixed, which is the Salt, is sharp and biting, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftique
in some degree. The volatil is smooth, soft, balsamical,
and astringent; and 'tis for that reason that <hi>Vitriol</hi> is made use
of, as a sovereign remedy for the inflammations of the eyes, when
they are corroded and parched by some sharp and burning hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
or defluction; as also in injections, where excoriations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them, and in the best plaisters to stanch the blood and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
hurts. But, they who well know how to draw the sweet
oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which is the pure volatil part therof, know also
that in the whole closet of Nature, there is no balm like this oyl:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49807:30"/>
For, it heals in a very short time, all kind of hurts which are
not mortal, it cures and consolidates the broken veins of the
breast; ev'n to the Ulcers in the lungs, which is an incurable
malady without this balm. Now, 'tis the volatil part of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi>
which is transported by the Sun (the great Distiller of
Nature) and which by that means dilates it self in the air: and
that the wound or part which receiv'd the hurt, draws and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates
with the blood and its humours and spirits. Which
being true, we cannot expect a less effect of the volatil <hi>Vitriol,</hi>
but that it should shut the veins, stanch the blood, and so, in a
short time heal the wound.</p>
            <p>The method and primitive manner how to make use of this
Sympathetical remedy was, To take only some <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and that
of the common sort, as it came from the Druggists, without any
preparation or addition at all; and to make it dissolve in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(or rather in rain-water,) to such a proportion, that, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therin a knife or some polished iron, it should come out
chang'd into the colour of copper: and, into this water, they
used to put a clowt or rag embrued with the blood of the party
hurt; if the rag were dry: But, if the rag was yet fresh, and
moist with the reaking blood, there was no need but to sprinkle
it with the smal powder of the same <hi>Vitriol;</hi> so that the powder
might incorporate it self with, and imbibe the blood remaining
yet humid. In both cases the rag was to be kept in a temperate
heat or place; <hi>viz.</hi> the powder in ones pocket, and the
water (which admits not of this commodity) within a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where the heat should be temperate, and, every time that
one should put new water of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or fresh powder to new
cloth or other bloodied stuff, the patient would feel new ease;
as if the wound had been then drest with some sovereign medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament.
And for this reason they used to reiterate this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dressing both Evening and Morning.</p>
            <p>But now, the most part of those who serve themselvs with the
<hi>Powder of Sympathy</hi> endeavour to have Vitriol of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of
<hi>Cyprus;</hi> which they calcine at the rayes of the Sun: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
some use to add the Gum of <hi>Tragagantha;</hi> it being easy
to add to things already invented.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, I have seen as great and admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of simple <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of eighteen pence the pound; as of that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49807:30"/>
Powder which is us'd to be prepared now at a greater price:
yet I blame not the present practice; on the contrary, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, for, it is founded upon reason. For</p>
            <p>First, it seems that the purest and best sort of <hi>Vitriol</hi> operates
the best.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it seems also, that the moderate calcining therof
at the rays of the Sun takes away the superfluous humidity of
the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> and operates on no part therof, but that which is
good: as if one should boil broth so clear that it would come
to be gelly, which certainly would render it more nourishing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it seems, that the exposing of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> to the Sun,
to receive calcination, renders its spirits more fitly disposed
to be transported through the air by the Sun, when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
For, it cannot be doubted but some pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the aethereal
fire or Solar rays incorporates with the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> (as is plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
in calcining <hi>Antimony</hi> by a Burning-glass; for it much
augments the weight of it, almost half in half:) both are near-a-kin:
those therefore, easily obeying the Motion of their
brother-beams, must needs make the grosser matter, they are
united with less refractory.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, these Solar rays, being embodied with the <hi>Vitriol</hi>
are in a posture to communicate to it a more excellent virtue,
than it hath of it self; as we find that <hi>Antimony,</hi> calcin'd in the
Sun becomes (of rank poison that it was before) a most
sovereign and balsamical medicament, and a most excellent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborative
of Nature.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Gum of <hi>Tragagantha,</hi> having a glutinous faculty,
and being, in other respects very innocent, may contribute
somthing towards the consolidation of the wound.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I could add many most important considerations
touching the Form and essence of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> wherof the substance
is so noble, and the origin is so admirable, that one may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
it, with good reason, one of the most excellent bodies
which Nature hath produced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chymists</hi> assure us that it is no other than, a corporifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Vniversal Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which animates and perfects all
that hath existence in this sublunary World: which it draws
in that abundance to it, that I my self have, in a short time, by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49807:31"/>
exposing some only to the open air, made an attraction of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
<hi>Vitriol</hi> ten times more in weight, of a marvailous pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and virtue; a priviledge given to none but It, and pure
virgin Salt-peter.</p>
            <p>But to anatomise, as we ought, the nature of this transcendent
Individual, (which nevertheless in some respect may be said to
be Vniversal, and fundamental to all bodies,) would require a
Discourse, far more ample, than I have yet made: And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
entertain'd you so long, that it would be a very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion
to entrench further upon your goodness, who have
hitherto listned to me with so much attention and patience; if I
should go about to enter into any new matter, and embark my
self for a further voyage. Wherefore remiting several things to
some other time, when you shall please to command me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the general consideration of this Sympathetical cure
I will put a Period to this Discourse: after I shall have said
two or three words, which will not be of smal importance, for
the confirmation of all that hath been alledg'd by me hitherto.</p>
            <p>I have deduced to you the admirable causes of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and strange effects of <hi>the Powder of Sympathy,</hi> from their
first root. These fundamental causes are so linked one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the other, that it seems there can be no default, stop, or
interruption, in their proceedings. But we shall be the
better fortified in the belief of their virtue and efficacy, and
how they come to produce the effects of so many rare Cures, if
we consider that when any jugling is practiced in some one of
these causes, or in all of them together, we may perceive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
an effect altogether differing from the former. If I
had not formerly seen a <hi>Watch</hi> or <hi>Clock,</hi> I should be justly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and remain astonish'd, to see the hand or needle so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
mark the journal hours and motion of the Sun, upon the
flat of a Quadrant; and that it should turn and make its round
every four and twenty hours; there being nothing seen that
should push on the said needle. But, if I look on the other side,
I see wheels, ressorts, and counterpoises in perpetual move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which having well considered, I presently suspect, that
those Wheels are the cause of the movement and turnings of
the said Needle; though I cannot presently discern or know
how they effect it, because of the plate that lies interposed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49807:31"/>
betwixt them. Therupon, I reason thus with my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf, Every
effect whatever must of necessity have some cause; therfore the
body moved there, must necessarily receive its movement from
some other body contiguous to it: Now, I see no other body,
to make the needle of the quadrant move and turn, but the
said wheels; Therefore, I must of force be perswaded to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the movement to them. But, afterwards, when I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
have stop'd the motion of those wheels and taken away the
Counterpoise, and observed that suddenly the needle ceases
to move; and that, applying again the Counterpoise, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liberty for the wheels to turn, the needle re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urns to her
ordinary course, and that I make one wheel go faster, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my finger to it, or by adding more weight to the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise,
the needle hastens and advances its motions proportion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
then I grow to be convinced and entirely satisfied; and
so absolutely conclude that these Wheels and Counterpoises are
the true cause of the motion of the Needle.</p>
            <p>In the same manner, if, interrupting the action of any of
those causes, which I have established for the true foundation
of the Sympathetical Powders virtue, I alter, retard or hinder
the Cure of the Wound: I may boldly conclude, that they
are the legitimate and genuine true causes of the Cure; and that
we need not amuse our selvs to search after any other.</p>
            <p>Let us then examine the matter by this rule. I have affirm'd
that, the <hi>Light</hi> transporting the atoms of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> and Blood,
and dilating them to a great extent in the air: the wound or
place hurt attracts them, and therby is immediately refresht
and eas'd; and consequently comes to be heal'd; by the Spirits
of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which is of a balsamical virtue. But, if you put
the Bason or Powder with the cloth-imbrued with blood into a
Cup-boord or a corner of some cold room, or into a Cellar,
where the Light or fresh Air never comes (whence the place
is corrupted and full of ill smell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,) in that case the wound can
receive no amendment, nor any good effect from the said
Powder. And, it will fall out in the same manner, if, having
put the bason or Powder in some By-corner, you cover them
with some thick cloth, stuffing and spongie, which may imbibe
the atoms coming forth, and retain the light and rays that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
there, so that they are thereby stop'd and quite lost. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49807:32"/>
Morover, if you suffer the water of <hi>Vitriol</hi> to congeal into ice;
or the cloth dip't in it; the party hurt shall be sensible, at the
begining, of a very great cold in his wound: but when it is iced
all over, he shall feel neither heat nor cold, in regard that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
cold constipates the pores of the water, so that it ceases
to transpire and send forth Spirits. If one wash the bloody
Cloth in Vinegar or Lye, (which, by their penetrating acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
transport all the spirits of the blood), before the <hi>Vitriol</hi>
be applied; it will produce no effect. Yet, if the Cloth be
wash'd but with pure simple water, it will nevertheless do
something; for, that water carries not away so much; but, the
effect will not be so great, as if the Cloth had not been washed
at all; for then it would remain full of the spirits of the blood.
The same cure is performed, by applying the remedy to the
Blade of a Sword which ha's wounded a body; so the Sword be
not too much heated by the fire: for that will make all the Spirits
of the blood to evaporate; and consequently the Sword will
contribute but little to the cure. Now, the reason why the
Sword may be dressed in order to the cure, is, because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
spirits of blood penetrate the substance of the blade, as far
as it went into the body of the wounded party; and, there keep
their residence, unless the fire, as I said before, chase them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
For experiment wherof, hold the Blade over a chasing
dish of moderate fire, and you shall discern, on the side opposite
to the fire, a little humidity; which resembles the spots that
ones breath makes upon looking-glasses; or upon the burnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
blade of a sword. If you look upon it through a magnifying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass,
you shall find that this soft dew of the Spirits consists in
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttle bubles, or blown bladders: and, when once they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
evaporated, you shall discern no more upon the weapon;
unless it were thrust a new into the body of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
nor, from the begining shall you discover any such thing, but
precisely upon the part of the blade, which had entred the
wound.</p>
            <p>This subtile penetration of the Spirits into hard steel, may
confirm the belief of such Spirits piercing through the skin of
a woman big with child: as I remind, to have proposed to you
in my <hi>sixth Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To confirm all these particulars, I could add, to those I have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49807:32"/>
already recounted many notable examples more; but, I fear I
have already too much exercised your patience; I will therfore
suspend any mention of them at this time; but I offer to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any of this Honourable Assembly therwith, when they
shall have the curiosity.</p>
            <p>I conclude then, my Lords, with representing to you that all
this mystery is carry'd and guided throughout, by true natural
ways and circumstances; although, by the agency and resorts
of very subtile spirits.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded my Discourse hath convincingly shew'd you,
that, in this Sympathetical cure, there is no need to admit of an
action distant from the Patient: I have traced to you a real
Communication 'twixt the one and the other; <hi>viz.</hi> of a Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
substance, which corporally mingles with the wound.</p>
            <p>Now, it is a poor kind of pusillanimity and faint-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or rather a gross weakness of the Understanding, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any effects of charm or magick herin; or to confine all the
actions of Nature to the grossness of our Senses, when we have
not sufficiently consider'd nor examined the true causes and
principles wheron tis fitting we should ground our judgment:
we need not have recourse to a Demon or Angel in such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
