            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and more Particular Account OF THE <hi>Late FIRE.</hi> With the ſeveral loſſes at NEWMARKET: In a Letter from thence of the 24th Inſtant. 1683.</head>
            <p>HAving ſeen a forged Paper (pretended to be Written in a Letter from hence) giving a ſhort and imperfect Account of the late dreadful Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> I thought my ſelf obliged as well to Anſwer your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt as to ſatisfie others, to give you a particular and more exact Account of that unfortunate Accident.</p>
            <p>On the 22d Inſtant being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> betwixt Eight and Nine a Clock at Night, by the careleſneſs of a Groom ſmoaking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco; it firſt broke out in a Stable, having ſeized upon the Litter, Straw, Hay, and Roof of the Stable before it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and then too violent to be overcome, till it had ſeized upon the next Houſe, and ſo from one to another till it had run through all the Houſes on that ſide of the Town.</p>
            <p>It began at the lowermoſt end of the Town next the Heath, the Wind being at South-weſt, which carrying the Flame ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, no Water being near to quench it, nor Powder to blow up the Houſes in leſs than three hours time, all the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on that ſide of the Town were on Fire, and continued burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the Morning, by which time they were Reduced to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>That which made the worſe for the Town, was the many Thatch'd Houſes, Stables and Hayricks, which took Fire from one another like a train of Gunpowder, having not left a Houſe before Twelve a Clock that the Fire had not ſeized upon.</p>
            <p>In this dreadful and terrible condition all burning at once, and moſt of all the Houſes yet ſtanding, the Roofs being the firſt that took the Flame, the Houſes ſeem'd all the way as if they had been Arched or rather Roof'd with Fire. Some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing burning till the next day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61090:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It would be Dreadful to tell you the Conſternation we were in upon this ſo ſudden and unhappy an Accident; which from the Firſt Kindling, Burnt on with that Violence, that thoſe who were Twelve Houſes and upwards from the place where the Fire began, had ſcarce time to ſave any thing, ſcarce their Horſes, and thoſe that were nearer could hardly ſave themſelves; many People by the ſudden Surprize, and others who were aſſiſting in the Quenching of the Fire, having periſhed therein, ſeveral of whom we have ſince found Buried under the Rubbiſh.</p>
            <p>Many brave Horſes, Coaches, and Chariots, with all their Rich Furniture, were loſt in this general Conflagration.</p>
            <p>Some run about the Streets half naked, with their Saddles, Bridles, and Portmantles, others run into the Houſes to ſave what they could, till they were many of them half Burnt, and many loſt, endeavouring to ſave their Horſes; which by no means they could get to come through the Fire till they had Hoodwincked them, or the Fire had ſeized upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, the pain of which drove them forward to ſeek for their Safety.</p>
            <p>The diſtracted People were in ſuch Conſternation, that many Horſes which were taken out of the Flame, and ſet looſe in the Street, to ſhift for themſelves upon the Heath with the People, inſtead of making towards the Heath, made to the Stables, where they were Burnt without all poſſibility of preventing it.</p>
            <p>Many ſuſtained great Loſſes, not only of Horſes, but Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and other things; But the greateſt of this Nature fell upon the Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> who not only loſt his chief Saddle-Horſes, but his beſt ſet of Coach-Horſes; the Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lord <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> loſt ſeveral Race Horſes, and beſt Saddle-Horſes, and many others, which would be too tedious to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>All that happened well in ſo unhappy an Accident was, that the Fire all this time, did not touch on that ſide of the Street where the Kings Houſe ſtood; which was the only Comfort we had in the midſt of all our Loſſes.</p>
            <p>It would but create a trouble to tell you the miſerable Eſtate theſe poor Wretches are in, expos'd to the Wind and Weather upon the Heath, having neither Houſe nor Goods, Cloathes nor Suſtenance. I will therefore add no more, but that I am</p>
