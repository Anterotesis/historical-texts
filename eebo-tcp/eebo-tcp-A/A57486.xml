            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ENJOYMENT.</head>
            <l>SInce now my <hi>Silvia</hi> is as kinde as fair,</l>
            <l>Let wit and joy succeed my dull despair.</l>
            <l>O what a night of pleasure was the last!</l>
            <l>A full reward for all my troubles past!</l>
            <l>And on my head if future mischief fall,</l>
            <l>This happy night shall make amends for all.</l>
            <l>Nay though my <hi>Silvia's</hi> Love should turn to hate,</l>
            <l>I'll think of this, and dye contented with my fate.</l>
            <l>Twelve was the lucky Minute when we met,</l>
            <l>And on her Bed were close together set;</l>
            <l>Though listning Spyes might be perhaps too near,</l>
            <l>Love fill'd our hearts, these was no Room for fear.</l>
            <l>Now whilst I strive her melting heart to move</l>
            <l>With all the powerfull Eloquence of Love:</l>
            <l>In her fair face I saw the Colour rise,</l>
            <l>And an unusuall Softnesse in her Eyes,</l>
            <l>Gently they look, and I with Joy adore</l>
            <l>That only Charm they never had before!</l>
            <l>The wounds they made, her Tongue was us'd to heal,</l>
            <l>But now these gentle Enemies reveal</l>
            <l>A Secret, which that friend would still conceal.</l>
            <l>My Eyes transported too with Amorous rage,</l>
            <l>Seem fierce with expectation to engage:</l>
            <l>But fast she holds my hands, and close her thighs,</l>
            <l>And what she longs to do, with frowns denies.</l>
            <l>A strange effect on foolish Women wrought,</l>
            <l>Bred in disguises, and by Custome taught:</l>
            <l>Custome, which Wisedome sometimes over rules,</l>
            <l>But serves instead of reason to the fools:</l>
            <l>Custome, which all the world to Slavery brings;</l>
            <l>The dull excuse for doing silly things.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103091:2"/>
She by this Method of her foolish Sex,</l>
            <l>Is forc'd a while me and herself to vex.</l>
            <l>But now when thus we had been strugling long,</l>
            <l>Her Limbs grow weak, and her desires grow strong:</l>
            <l>How can she hold to let the <hi>Hero</hi> in;</l>
            <l>He storms without, and Love betrays within.</l>
            <l>Her hands at last to hide her blushes, leave</l>
            <l>The Fort unguarded, willing to receive</l>
            <l>My fierce assault, made with a Lovers hast;</l>
            <l>Like Lightning piercing, and as quickly past.</l>
            <l>Thus does fond Nature with her Children play,</l>
            <l>Just shews us Joy, then snatches it away.</l>
            <l>'Tis not th' excess of pleasure makes it short;</l>
            <l>The pain of Love's as raging as the sport:</l>
            <l>And yet, alas, that lasts; we sigh all night</l>
            <l>With grief, but scarce one moment with delight.</l>
            <l>Some little pain may check her kinde desire,</l>
            <l>But not enough to make her once retire:</l>
            <l>Maids wounds for pleasure bear as Men for praise,</l>
            <l>Here Honour heals, there Love the smart allays:</l>
            <l>The World if Just, would harmfull courage blame,</l>
            <l>And this more innocent reward with fame.</l>
            <l>Now she her well contented thoughts employs,</l>
            <l>On her past fears, and on her future Joys:</l>
            <l>Whose Harbinger did roughly all remove,</l>
            <l>To make fit room for great Luxurious Love,</l>
            <l>Fond of the welcome guest, her Arms embrace</l>
            <l>My body, and her hands a better place:</l>
            <l>Which with one touch so pleas'd and proud does grow,</l>
            <l>It swells beyond the grasp that made it so.</l>
            <l>Confinement Scorns in any straighter Walls,</l>
            <l>Then those of Love, where it contented falls:</l>
            <l>Though twice o'rethrown he more enflam'd does rise:</l>
            <l>And will to the last drop fight out loves prize.</l>
            <l>She like some Amazon in story proves,</l>
            <l>That overcomes the <hi>Hero</hi> whom she Loves.</l>
            <l>In the close strife she takes so much delight,</l>
            <l>She then can think of nothing but the fight:</l>
            <l>With Joy she lays him panting at her feet,</l>
            <l>But with more joy does his recovery meet.</l>
            <l>Her trembling hands first gently raise his head,</l>
            <l>She almost dyes for fear that he is dead:</l>
            <l>Then binds his wounds up with a busy hand,</l>
            <l>And with that balm enables him to stand,</l>
            <l>Till by her eyes she Conquers him once more,</l>
            <l>And wounds him deeper then she did before.</l>
            <l>Though fallen from the Top of pleasures hill,</l>
            <l>With longing Eyes we look up thither still:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103091:2"/>
Still thither Our unwearied wishes tend,</l>
            <l>Till we that heighth of happiness ascend</l>
            <l>By gentle steps, th' ascent it self exceeds</l>
            <l>All Joys, but that alone to which it leads.</l>
            <l>First then so long and lovingly we kiss,</l>
            <l>As if like Doves, we knew no dearer bliss:</l>
            <l>Still in one Mouth our Tongues together play,</l>
            <l>While groping hands are pleas'd no less then they.</l>
            <l>Thus cling'd together now awhile we rest,</l>
            <l>Breathing our Souls into each others breast:</l>
            <l>Then give a general kiss of all our parts</l>
            <l>While this best way we make exchange of hearts.</l>
            <l>Here would my praise as well as pleasure dwell,</l>
            <l>Enjoyments self I scarcely like so well:</l>
            <l>The little this comes short in Rage and strength,</l>
            <l>Is largely recompenc'd with endless length.</l>
            <l>This is a joy would last, if we could stay,</l>
            <l>But Loves too eager to admit delay,</l>
            <l>And hurries us along so smooth away.</l>
            <l>Now wanton with delight we nimbly move,</l>
            <l>Our plyant Limbs in all the shapes of Love:</l>
            <l>Our motions not like those of gamesome fools,</l>
            <l>Whose active Bodies shew their heavy Souls.</l>
            <l>But sports of Love, in which a willing minde,</l>
            <l>Makes us as able as our hearts are kinde.</l>
            <l>At length all languishing and out of breath,</l>
            <l>Panting as in the agonies of death,</l>
            <l>We lye entranc'd, till one provoking kiss</l>
            <l>Transports our ravish'd Souls to paradice.</l>
            <l>O Heaven of Love, thou moment of delight!</l>
            <l>Wrong'd by my words, my fancy does thee right.</l>
            <l>Methinks I lye all melting in her Charms,</l>
            <l>And fast lockt up within her Legs and Arms:</l>
            <l>Bent are our mindes and all our thoughts on fire,</l>
            <l>Just labouring in the pangs of fierce desire.</l>
            <l>At once, like Misers Wallowing in their store,</l>
            <l>In full possession, yet desiring more.</l>
            <l>Thus with repeated pleasures while we wast</l>
            <l>Our happy hours, that like short Minuts past,</l>
            <l>To such a sum of bliss our Joys amount,</l>
            <l>The number now becomes too great too count.</l>
            <l>Silent as Night are all sincerest Joys,</l>
            <l>Like deepest Waters running with least Noise.</l>
            <l>But now at last for want of further force</l>
            <l>From deeds, alas, we fall into discourse!</l>
            <l>A fall which each of us in vain bemoans,</l>
            <l>A greater fall then that of Kings from Thrones,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103091:3"/>
The Tide of pleasure flowing now no more,</l>
            <l>We lye like Fish left gasping on the shore.</l>
            <l>And now as after fighting, wounds appear,</l>
            <l>Which we in heat, did neither feel for fear,</l>
            <l>She for her sake intreats me to give o're,</l>
            <l>And yet for mine would gladly suffer more.</l>
            <l>Her words are coy, while all her motions Woo,</l>
            <l>And when she asks me if it please me too,</l>
            <l>I rage to shew how well but 'twill not do.</l>
            <l>Thus would hot Love run it self out of breath,</l>
            <l>And wanting rest, finde it too soon in death,</l>
            <l>Did not wise Nature with a gentle force</l>
            <l>Restrain its rage, and stop its headlong course:</l>
            <l>Indulgently severe, she well does spare</l>
            <l>This Childe of hers, which most deserves her care.</l>
