            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Concerning the former, <hi>S.

               <p>Poets write that <hi>Prometheus</hi> made man of clay; <hi>Res eos non fefellit, ſed nomen artificis,</hi> miſtaking not the thing it ſelfe, but the artificers name:<note place="margin">1.

this building; for the Holy Ghoſt teacheth vs here, by the pen of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it was God which ſaid, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> therefore <hi>it is he that hath made vs and not we our ſelues.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 100.3.</note>

                        <hi>Eſa 44.</hi> I am the Lord that made all things that ſpread out the heauens alone, and ſtretched out the earth by myſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rom. 11.34.35</hi> He ſpake not to the Angels.</p>
                  </note> becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Let Vs make man;</hi> as if manie were ioyned together in the buſineſſe. Not ſo neyther: for, <hi>Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or was his Counſailor, and hath taught him? who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him firſt, and he ſhall be recompenſed?</hi> When hee ſaid, <hi>Let Vs make man,</hi> hee ſpake not vnto the Angels. Are they not all miniſtring Spirits? and then how ſhould they be creating powers? They are our fellow ſeruants, creatures as we are, and beneficiaries of God his graces with vs; not conſorters or companions of his glorie. They are ſent forth to miniſter for their ſake that be heyres of ſaluation, not to be founders or coadiutors of our creation. They cannot be ſeruants in the one, and maſter workmen in the other: they cannot be creatures and creators: they cannot be Gods meſſengers and his compeeres too.</p>
               <p>So man ſhould be created in the likeneſſe of Angels; for he ſaith, <hi>Let vs make man in our Image.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> confuteth in the next verſe. In the Image of God hee made man,<note place="margin">God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels haue not one image.</note> not in the image of Angels; vnleſſe any ſhould be ſo vaine to imagine that there is one and the ſame image common to God and Angels. Some of them did affect to bee like vnto the Almightie, and it was adiudged robberie, for a document of inſtruction to terrifie euery creature from ſuch preſumptuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and to conteine all ſorts within the liſts of their vocation. Verily none but God is like vnto God:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27763:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Sonne vnto the Father: the Holy Ghoſt vnto them both. He only hath the character &amp; image of the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, that is the firſt begotten of all creatures. <hi>Philip, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father:</hi> againe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14 9. Ioh. 10.30.</note> 
                  <hi>I and the Father are one;</hi> without inequalitie, without diſsimilitude: When he ſaith, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> he leaueth no inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>reddidiſti authorem cum ſocium profeſſus es.</hi> When he addeth, <hi>in our image,</hi> where can be diſsimilitude?</p>

Therefore being in the forme of God he made man, &amp; being in the ſhape of a ſeruant was himſelfe made a man: for if the Father alone had made man without the Sonne, our Text wold not haue ſet it downe in theſe termes, <hi>Let vs make man in our owne image, according to our likeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then that here a Noune ſingular, <hi>dixit Deus,</hi> is ioyned with a Verb plurall, <hi>faciamus hominem;</hi> and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27763:5"/>
the Scripture ſpeaketh of God in the one number, and the other particularly as of one, and by the name of a multitude, as of manie: I neede not trouble you with further ſearch to whom he ſpeaketh when he ſaith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> but may rather call you to obſerue, that there be manie perſons in this vnitie of Godhead, and yet but one ſubſtance in this pluralitie of perſons.</p>
               <p>The Father eternall maketh and preſerueth all things by his coeternall Wiſedome, with his ſubſtantiall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Chriſt teacheth vs this cooperation of Father and Sonne:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>My Father worketh as yet, and I worke.</hi> Now Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sonne work not without their loue, their glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eſſentiall power, which is the Holy Ghoſt. If all theſe perſons doe concurre and ioyne together in the worke of mans creation, we ſee the perſons that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto, and the pluralitie comprehended vnder <hi>facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Againe, by the concluſion of their decree, that this excellent creature ſhould be ſtamped with the print of their owne image, you may diſcerne the vnitie of their ſubſtance; becauſe all three haue but one image, <hi>ad ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem noſtram.</hi>

As for example: The incarnation of the Sonne of God, was an action or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worke of the whole Trinitie; yet the Father had a peculiar part in it, namely, to ſend his Sonne: And the Sonne againe had his parte, to take fleſh, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine it into the vnitie of his perſon; which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to either of the other two perſons: for ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father nor Holy Ghoſt could be incarnate. It was not the Nature of God that did take the Nature of man, for then all three perſons muſt haue beene incarnate. The Word onely, being the ſecond perſon in Trinitie,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27763:6"/>
was made fleſh, and tooke the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon onely was incarnate, which is peculiar to the Sonne alone, and cannot bee communicated to the Father or Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt had another part in that buſineſſe; he came vpon the bleſſed Virgin, ouerſhadowed her, and by purifying that part of her ſubſtance, built vp a bodie fit for the Word.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.14.</note>When <hi>S. Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Timothie,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceiued, but the woman; he meant not to extenuate the mans offence, or to exempt him from the fraude or impoſture of the Deuill: but to ſhew whether ſexe was more credulous, infirme, and like to be ſeduced. Herein he concludeth the woman to be the weaker veſſell, and forbiddeth her to teach in the Church, becauſe that when ſhe was yet perfect and ſound, the Serpent began with her as the eaſier to be deceiued.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did thinke that the Serpent would reſort to his former inſtrument, and ſo hold the miniſtrie in leſſe regard, for the weakeneſſe of their ſexe. Behold S. <hi>Pauls</hi> proiect in the words to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here in this Text another matter is in hand. No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here, whether the man or woman was firſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarication: were that the point, the Deuill in his pride would haue the ſtart of both; Hee was a ſinner from the beginning.

a ſucceſsion of ſinne throughout all mankinde. And as well here, as in all other places, the Scripture attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the matter of propagation, not to women but to men.</p>
               <p>Therefore we will diſmiſſe <hi>Eue,</hi> if you pleaſe, as our Sauiour Chriſt diſmiſſed the woman taken in adultery;<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.11.</note> not for an innocent, but becauſe ſhe is not here implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <hi>Adam</hi> is the man which the Apoſtle now charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Wherewith is it? For gluttonie, or intemperance of his throate? No: there was affluence of all other delicacies in Paradiſe to ſatisfie ſuch deſires. Is it for his curioſitie and vaine loue of knowledge? Neyther: For although that be a fault, to be wiſe beyond ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet could it not haue brought ſo heauie a ſequele. What was it then? He affected that fruite, <hi>Non veſcendi libidine, ſed animoſitate exultandi;</hi> not in any lingering deſire to the meate, but in a kind of luſtineſſe to breake out.

               <p>When originall ſinne is thus extenuated, conſider (I beſeech you) what, and how little it is that they leaue to the redemption and benefit of Chriſt? Not actuall,

               <p>Sure there cannot be any thing added to the diſeaſe in this kinde, but that which muſt detract from the Creator: our ſubſtance is of his building. And is it not a ſtrange amplification of the diſeaſe, that brings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, inſtead of glory to the Phyſitian? If original ſinne be of mans ſubſtance, muſt it not needs haue tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt? it is moſt certaine that he tooke our whole ſubſtance: how could he be true man, without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of man?</p>
               <p>This ſinne which is tranſmitted to vs all, is no part of mans nature, but a deprauation of it, ſpreading it ſelfe ouer all, &amp; creeping into our marrow and moſt hidden entrailes.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecret poiſon within vs, like vnto the graines of Muſtard ſeede, little in the beginning, but groweth to a great tree. There want no ſubtile practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27763:21"/>
without vs, according to the depthes of Sathan, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated ſo couertly, that they are ſcarce marked from whence they come, nor whither they tend.</p>
               <p>I would I were able to diſtinguiſh them vnto you: but I cannot deliuer that which I haue not receiued. There is <hi>morbus Mentis,</hi> and <hi>morſus Serpentis: malum innatum,</hi> and <hi>malum ſeminatum: pactus Cordis, &amp; ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium hoſtis.</hi> They are not one, but agree in one: both are the ſower fruites of this mans fatall diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thereby hee receiued the one, admitted the other, and tranſmitted both vnto vs all: And they are ſufficient, eyther for conception or production of ſinne. <hi>So by one mans diſobedience wee are all made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Peraduenture ſome will ſay, that this man, by whom ſinne came, was receiued into fauour againe. And what queſtion ſoeuer others may make, my opinion is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to charitie, that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſaued, and had preſent forgiueneſſe of his ſinne. Then you will aske, how he ſhould tranſmit that ſinne to his poſterity, that was remitted to himſelfe?</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> anſwereth, that the Saints chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren diſcend from their parents by carnall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not by ſpirituall regeneration. But <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was forgiuen: I graunt it, yet that was not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nature, where the fountaine of generation reſted; the forgiueneſſe of his ſinne was a matter of Grace, in the power of GOD, not in <hi>Adams</hi> fleſh.</p>
               <p>For how was his ſinne forgiuen? not by taking ſinne abſolutely away from him, but by not impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting it vnto him. This imputation was not in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27763:22"/>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> power, but in Gods good pleaſure; therefore he could not tranſmit it to his poſteritie: He tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely his owne tainture and mortalitie.</p>
               <p>You know how the Husbandman doth purge and cleanſe the ſeede that hee caſteth into the ground; he threſheth it from the ſtraw, winnoweth it from the chaffe, ſiftieth it from all hoore, and ſo ſoweth bare and cleane corne: yet it commeth vp not pure corne, but ioyned with ſtraw, and couered with eares. How ſo? Becauſe it had theſe purifications, not naturally, but outwardly, by the paines and endeuours of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman. And as it was amongſt the circumciſed Iewes; their children were borne with the foreskin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vncircumciſed, becauſe their circumciſion was not inward or naturally in the parent, but added out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by humane violence: So it ſtood with <hi>Adam;</hi> though his ſinne were forgiuen, yet becauſe his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe was altogether in Gods imputation, not in his owne nature, he tranſmitted ſinne and mortality, which he had in himſelfe: and could not tranſmit righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or immortality, becauſe they were altogether out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the power of God.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Item</hi> the Apoſtle giueth vs, that ſeeing our ſinne commeth from our ſelues, God is not authour thereof. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh truely of the holy One of Iſrael;<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.4.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:27763:22"/>Sinne is a thing repugnant to the nature of God, and contrarie to all his properties. It cannot ſtand with his goodneſſe: for being the chiefe and ſoueraigne good, he cannot be authour of euill; ſeeing euerie one affecteth, not that which is oppoſite, but that which is conformable and agreeable to his nature,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>And God is light, and in him dwelleth no darkeneſſe at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, it were ſome impeachment of his power, to be authour of ſinne: for without any euill God is able to doe what good he will.</p>
               <p>The wiſedome of God will not admit him to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſinne. Good is the proper obiect that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euery one his deſire (as the Philoſopher diſputeth truely) and euill is neuer deſired nor ſought after, but through error, when that which hath but the face and outward appearance of good, is miſtaken for it, which hath the true nature of good indeed. So God cannot be the author of ſinne, vnleſſe you derogate ſome thing from his wiſedome; <hi>And O Lord thine eyes be cleere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>thou canst not ſee euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he were authour of ſinne, hee ſhould diuert and turne men away from himſelfe; and that were a plaine deniall of himſelfe, not fit, not poſsible to comply with his truth.</p>
               <p>Neither can it hold correſpondencie with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: for he pittieth and is mercifull to them that ſinne; therefore he cannot be author thereof.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, it will not ſort with his iuſtice: for hee puniſheth ſinne, becauſe he is iuſt; and then he cannot be authour of it, but he muſt needes be vniuſt. And is there any vnrighteouſnes with God? That is an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie to be deteſted, not confuted. God forbid. <hi>God

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt Sabbath I diſcuſſed the former part of this Text vnto your moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable houſhold, and now, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of God his holy Spirit, &amp; your Princely patience, doe purpoſe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Three points are here to be cleared; firſt, who this obedient perſon was; ſecondly, the manner of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; thirdly, the validitie. As to the firſt: This age doth not affoord ſuch plentie of obedience, as may make the perſon here ſpoken of, doubtfull or ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If bare profeſsion were good obedience, Chriſt would neuer haue told the Iewes,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.31.</note> that Publicans and Harlots ſhould goe into the Kingdome of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: <hi>Saul,</hi> neuer intending obedience, pretends it all in vaine.<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27763:25"/>
the more libertie to follow vanitie: <hi>Et nolebant cenſu abundare terreno, vt abundarent magis ſenſu ſuo. S. Bern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſome certain religious people, haue deuoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to obedience, their vowes make the title fayrer, but not the obligation ſtronger. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> decyphered ſuch vanities long agoe, <hi>Sine defectu pauperes, ſine deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu humiles, ſine labore diuites eſſe volunt:</hi> Holy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient people indeed, that will be poore without want, humble without contempt, rich without labour, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient without any reknowledgement of allegiance. They will not be like vnto other men; therefore ſauing our Aphoriſme againſt retaliation and Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that nothing be done in reuenge, if other men wil be as peremptorie againe, not to be like vnto them, there ſhall be no great cauſe left (as I ſuppoſe) for Church or Common-wealth to complaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Difference in the obedient.</note>The importunitie of their challenges, makes mee to put difference in thoſe that be obedient: the perſon that our Text ſpeaketh of, is obedient vnto God; theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, are obſequious vnto men, to S. <hi>Frauncis, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, Dominick, Ignatius Loyola,</hi> and their ſuperiours. But why ſhould Chriſtians, that are borne of God, take names from men? <hi>Non ad hominis nomen ambulo, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti nomen teneo. Perirem ſi eſſem de parte Pauli; quomodo non perirem, ſi eſſem de parte Donati.</hi> His obedience ſtood in performing his fathers will; theirs is exerciſed in vpholding mans inuentions, or if they labor in obeying God, it is but in part, and he was obedient perfectly: his perſon was infinite, theirs is finite; his innocent, theirs ſinfull: his obedience is applicable, and beneficiall vnto others: if theirs be memorable for imitation, it is well; it can neuer be applicable for expiation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:27763:25"/>The obedience that maketh others righteous,<note place="margin">Complete obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> muſt be complete, abſolute, continuall; ſo was neuer any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane obedience: it is interrupted often, it hath manie intermiſsions, therefore I maruaile what ſecurity they can finde, that follow after it. I ſhould be the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid for ſuch a helpe: without it, I haue nothing to feare but my cauſe alone; if I ſhould repoſe my ſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this broken ſtaffe, I muſt feare it, and my cauſe too. <hi>Refugium nostrum non est tale:</hi> The obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, is perfect obedience, full of ſecuritie, voyde of feare. He is the perſon then, by whoſe obedience many are made righteous.</p>
               <p>His obedience was admirable, and it ſutes well with his perſon, which is wonderfull, ſingular, and not to be matched: <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne, and <hi>Dauids</hi> Lord; the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the father of eternitie; the ſonne of man, and the ſonne of God, <hi>Who being in the forme of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. v. 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>thought it no robberie to be equall with God: but he made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men, and was found in ſhape as a man. He humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe.</hi> Two entyre &amp; perfect natures, combined &amp; glewed together in one perſon, <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God and man.</p>
               <p>This makes another doubt, whether his obedience was performed in the humanitie, or in the diuinitie, or in both together: I anſwer, that he was obedient in the humane nature alone, not in the diuine. If the diuine nature could haue yeelded obedience, had not his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation beene ſuperfluous? If the diuinitie had bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, it muſt haue died too; for he was obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to death: and is it poſſible to haue a mortall diuinitie?
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27763:26"/>
There was no congruitie, that one nature ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the obedience impoſed on the other: behold a confuſion, for the Godhead to entertaine and handle the buſineſſe of the manhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 2.19.</note>Therefore his obedience was performed in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie; <hi>Destroy this Temple, and I will raiſe it vp in three dayes:</hi>

                  <hi>vana ſalus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> And if this man had not bene God, he ſhould not haue beene partaker of incorruptibilitie, and then hee could not tranſmit it to vs: <hi>hunc hominem Deus, non vt alios regebat, ſed gerebat.</hi> This man, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith excellently, had a prerogatiue aboue all others: God did not gouerne him barely, as he doth euery one elſe, but he bare him too.</p>
               <p>His manhood was inſeperably conioyned and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the vnitie of the godhead; ſo as death it ſelfe, that ſeuereth man and wife aſunder, that deuideth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule, and parteth all things elſe, could yet make no ſeperation here: but then, euen in the death of his bodie, the diuinitie did adhaere, and was coupled with it in the graue; otherwiſe it had followed the condition of all fleſh elſe, ſeene corruption, and abid in death.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that there is ſo firme an vnion of the Godhead and manhood in one perſon, the obedience which the manhood performed, may rightly be valued at an infinite rate, as if it had beene done by the Deitie it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Dauid</hi> thought he did <hi>Saul</hi> wrong,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Concerning the manner of his obedience,<note place="margin">Spontanea o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientia.</note> manie things are of profitable conſideration, which I ſuppoſe you haue heard lately: but none more memorable, then the alacritie and cheerefulneſſe of his obedience;

                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> his obedience is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: hee was not refractorie when his father would offer him vp in ſacrifice, but yet he was bound: And, O Lord, thine hands needed no bands, nor thy feete to be tyed in fetters of braſſe.</p>

Spare it, if you regard not men, yet for the feare you haue of God: or if none of all theſe can moue your bowels, for my life; let me haue my coate, this partie-coloured coate, the ornament of my youth, and the pledge of my fathers loue, for an hearſe to ſhroude and couer me when I am dead.</p>
               <p>Maruaile not at <hi>Ioſephs</hi> obteſtations; he was but a figure of obedience, and the figure muſt euer be inferior to the truth.
