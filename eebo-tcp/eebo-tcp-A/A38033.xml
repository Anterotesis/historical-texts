            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Reverend Father in God EDWARD, Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Presumed to dedicate my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writings to two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons of your High Order in the <hi>Church:</hi> and now this present Undertaking comes to find shelter under your <hi>Lordships</hi> Patronage. Which I despair not of because you have let the world sufficiently know how greatly you disapprove of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of those Men whose Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is offer'd in the following Treatise. It was observ'd that
<pb facs="tcp:99330:3"/>
even in your Early Years you chose to encounter the <hi>Pontifician</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> Impostors; not unlike <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules;</hi> that in his very Minority grappled with <hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Crellius</hi> felt the Strength of your Arm, and hath laid a Baffled and Prostrate Foe ever since, for there never yet appear'd any thing that had the face of an <hi>Answer</hi> to your Book.</p>
            <p>And lately, when <hi>Socinus</hi>'s fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers began to take heart again, and to lift up their bruised heads, your Lordship successfully struck at them, and publickly vindicated <hi>the Mysteries of the Christian Faith</hi> from the bold and blasphemous insults of these persons. In your former Attempts you were wont to exceed Others, but now you outvied your self; such were the extraordinary Acuteness and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
<pb facs="tcp:99330:3"/>
of your Thoughts on this subject, such the inimitable Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of your Reasons, such the matchless Weight and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousness of your Arguments, such your close application of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where. Which the Adversaries were sensible of, and accordingly (that they might not be thought to be Idle) advanced some Feeble <hi>Considerations</hi> against your Lordship's Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Here, to support their Tatter'd Cause, they made a stir with trifling sallies and excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with faint shews of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism, with Pedantick flourishes of Wit, with mean and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid Efforts of Seeming Logick. But chiefly these <hi>Socinian</hi> Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers endeavour'd to run down the Truth by their unparallell'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and by treating your
<pb facs="tcp:99330:4"/>
Lordship, as well as it, with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect and disdain.</p>
            <p>But so it is, they have shew'd themselves Rude to their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal shame. And yet at the same time, by attempting to Lessen your Worth and Deserved Fame they have inhansed them; as all Envious and Malicious Persons do when they detract from those of Great Merit. All the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World unanimously vote your Lordship to be the Chief of this number: even those who disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all other things, agree in your Lordships Praises. For without the least Shew of Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it may be most truly said, that your <hi>Name</hi> is now not so much the Name of a <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> as it is the Name of <hi>Profound Learning</hi> and <hi>Solid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99330:4"/>
But I shall offend against your Lordship's Modesty, and call forth Blushes from those Reverend Cheeks, which have so boldly look'd your Adversaries in the face, if I proceed any further thus; wherefore I am forced here to a Period. Only let me be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to add my Hearty Wishes and Prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> would vouchsafe to bless Your Lordship with Long Life, Health, and Vigour, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish those Great Things which You have designed against the Church's Common Foes, <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> that You may be a Terrour and Scourge to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Racovia;</hi> that You may give an effectual check to the Sly pretences of <hi>Deists,</hi> that You may bridle the Insolence of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,</hi> and be successful in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb facs="tcp:99330:5"/>
all such Sworn Enemies of the Christian Faith and Practise. So prayeth</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOME Eminent Persons of our Church having been pleas'd to honour me with their Approbation of what I have lately writ against the</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians <hi>in defence of the Orthodox Faith, I presume once more to assert and vindicate this Noble Cause. And I am further animated and encouraged to such an</hi> Undertaking <hi>from what I meet with in the Learned Bishop of</hi> Worcester<hi>'s</hi> Preface to his Discourse concerning Christ's Satisfaction <hi>late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprinted, where he directly charges the</hi> Socinians with the promoting of Deism, <hi>and promises to make good his Charge against them in a Discourse. And in the close of his Preface he tells
<pb facs="tcp:99330:6"/>
us that he will let the world know that</hi> he is no stranger to the Pamphlets of the Modern Racovians. <hi>Thus we see the Cause doth not die: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can it, when so Able a Person is willing to uphold it, and hath engaged himself to do it; one whose Name is as terrible to the</hi> Socinians <hi>as that of</hi> Duke D'Alva <hi>heretofore to the</hi> Dutch. <hi>Till this Great Champion shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self anew, I will make bold to enter the Lists, and to attack our Common Foe, and thereby prepare the way for the Conquests of so Renowned a Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let me declare this, and that with the greatest sincerity imaginable, that it is not from any pleasure I take in contending with any Party of Men, or from a desire to provoke and exasperate them (for I bear a hearty Charity and Good Will to all mankind, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I love and honour all Sincere and Good Men, all that have the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Christian Spirit upon them)
<pb facs="tcp:99330:6"/>
nor is it from any other undue Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but wholly from a sense of my Duty, and that alone, that I appear again in this Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At first I purposely check'd my self, and forbore to produce all those Arguments and Proofs whereby I might have evinced the Inclinableness of the</hi> Socinians <hi>to</hi> Irreligion <hi>and a spirit of</hi> Infidelity. <hi>And this I did for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reasons, partly to suit my self to the then present Juncture, partly to let the world see that I was not Hasty and Forward in censuring any sort of persons, and partly to allow my self time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further into the matter, both to satisfie my self and others. Because what I then suggested, was design'd to be in the way of an</hi> Essay <hi>or</hi> Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>I only offer'd some few Heads of my Charge against them: but now I intend to give the Reader a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account of some of them; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to superadd Several Articles to
<pb facs="tcp:99330:7"/>
the former Charge and Indictment. I will set before him</hi> Other <hi>Different-Demonstrations of that</hi> Atheistick Tang, <hi>that</hi> Irreligious Genius <hi>which I tax'd them with. So then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they will have little occasion to say that</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vindication of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, p. 3.</note> I mollifie that in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, which was much more Harsh when preach'd in a Sermon. <hi>Though I must profess to the world that I loath all Harshness and Severity which are inconsistent with the Candor and Meekness of a Christian, and which are not absolutely requisite for the vindicating of the indispensable Truths of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Racovians <hi>may remember that they lately presented the world with a Paper entituled.</hi> The Trinitarian Scheme of Religion: <hi>and now I hope they will not be offended (I am
<pb facs="tcp:99330:7"/>
sure they ought not) when I publish</hi> the Anti-Trinitarian Scheme of Religion <hi>(if I may so call it,) or rather (to speak plainly and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> of their Irreligious Opinions and Placits. <hi>They had no Credible</hi> Authors <hi>to vouch their</hi> Scheme, <hi>but fill'd it up with what they thought fit. But I have taken another course, and have all along annex'd the</hi> Particular Authors <hi>whose Assertions I mention, and I have set down the</hi> particular places <hi>in their Writings. I have been very exact and faithful in rehearsing their words, that I might neither wrong them nor the Truth. And in order to this I have perused the Authors themselves, and have taken nothing on trust. Nor have I gather'd their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from some</hi> few <hi>or</hi> dubious <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in their Writings, or from some Scraps and Sentences, but from the plain Tenour and Scope of what they write. So that the Reader may
<pb facs="tcp:99330:8"/>
absolutely depend upon what I offer to him concerning their Sentiments. All the</hi> Socinian <hi>Writings (till some few of late) being in</hi> Latin, <hi>the Learned can consult the places which I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when they please, and bear witness to my faithfulness in alledging them. But I knew it would be of no use to the mere</hi> English <hi>Reader to transcribe the quotations in that Language: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I chose rather to give him them in his own Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And besides, it is to be supposed that the</hi> Learned <hi>are not unacquainted with these things: but because</hi> Others, <hi>who are the greatest numbers, are in great measure ignorant of them, I thought it requisite to publish them to the world, that it may be known what are the Wild and extravagant Notions which are wafted over to us from</hi> Racovia. If I had not read their Books, I might peradventure have entertain'd a more favourable opinion of them
<pb facs="tcp:99330:8"/>
than I now have, <hi>saith the</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to his Discourse concerning Christ's Satisfaction.</note> 
               <hi>Excellent Bishop before mention'd. And so without doubt many others would have entertain'd a tolerable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of these Gentlemen if they had not perused their Writings, and found what a numerous train of Unsound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are there upheld, and if they had not observ'd that pernicious tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and drift of them. People hear</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism <hi>much talk'd of of late: and one or two of the most Vulgar Points of it are partly known to them, and they are sollicited perhaps to give their assent to them. But if they had a discovery of all the rest of their Opinions, it is probable they would be moved by them to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of those others. Most men may think perhaps that the</hi> Socinians <hi>fail only in their disbelief of the</hi> Trinity, <hi>and particularly their disowning</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:99330:9"/>
Deity of the Son of God, <hi>but that as to other Principles of Christianity they believe and profess the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths which are embraced by the generality of Christians.</hi>

               <hi>For as in the late Reign</hi> Popery <hi>was misrepresented, all its Doctrines were dress'd up in a very specious and plausible garb by the Bishops of</hi> Meaux <hi>and</hi> Condom, <hi>and other dexterous Penmen, in so much that it did not seem to be what it was said to be before, (for they knew that Popery truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented would never go down with us; therefore when the Roman Catholicks had hopes of gaining this Nation once again to their Church, it was thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to set their Religion before us in a wrong posture:) so hath it fared lately with</hi> Socinianism, <hi>the</hi> English Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covians <hi>have given us such a Character of it that it appears to be quite different from what it was, yea and what it really is: they have given it such a gloss and
<pb facs="tcp:99330:9"/>
varnish that many are thence perswaded to have a good opinion of it: for they were sensible that if it were set forth and known in its true nature, few Wise and Considerate persons would imbrace it: therefore they found it necessary to give us a False Account of it, to render it (if possible) plausible and acceptable. But if we narrowly look into it, we shall find it to be another thing than it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be: we shall see that it is a Dreadful Compound of Errors and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxies, a Detestable Farce of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Heresies, a Horrid Perverting of the Christian Faith, and the Nurse of Irreligion and Prophaness. To be plainer yet, he that hath any close thoughts and remarks of things at this day must needs be sensible that the great Indifferency and Scepticism which reign among us have open'd a door to</hi> Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, <hi>which is a sure Project for</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, <hi>and this for</hi> Atheism. <hi>For it is apparent that the</hi> Atheists <hi>of our</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99330:10"/>
times politickly make use of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to compass their designs, that is, to banish the Deity and Religion out of the world, and to introduce universal Licentiousness, Immorality and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. I appeal to any Thoughtful, Serious and Observing Man whether this be not a true and right View of our present affairs with relation to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand.</p>
            <p>I apprehended therefore it would be good service to my Countreymen to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Monster to them in its true and genuine Colours, in its native and proper features; which will certainly acquaint them with its Deformity, and (as the effect of that) render it Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and Abominable, as it ought to be to all that are concerned for Religion. This is the design of the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and the <hi>Holy and Blessed Trinity</hi> (whose Cause I defend) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that herein I intend not the aspersing of any sort of men, I aim not at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb facs="tcp:99330:10"/>
of or reflecting upon any Party: but my whole business is to assert and vindicate the Truth which hath been owned by the Catholick Church in all ages of Christianity, and to obviate the growing Evil and Mischief of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi> In undertaking of this, I will suggest nothing out of heat and passion: I will labour to refute, not to reproach our Adversaries: I will endeavour to approve my self an Advocate for Truth without being an Enemy to Civility and Candour. But yet I shall by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aid (which most heartily I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, and beg the Reader to joyn his earnest Devotions with mine) use that Freedom and Plainness which become the Truth and an Unprejudic'd Asserter of it. My faults in my former book, it seems, were <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> if he who wrote the <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 33:</note>

Now, I hope, I have mended these faults, or chang'd them for two others,</hi> viz. <hi>Argument and Down-right Language, which yet will be as much disliked by that Gentleman and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans. However, I will venture it, and perhaps this Free and Open dealing may have some good effect even upon the minds of our Adversaries, at least on some of those that are in part tinctur'd with their Opinions: especially when they shall see that it is not my intention to represent the Disciples of</hi> Socinus <hi>worse than they are (which as to some things can hardly be done) but to give an Impartial Account of them in such Particulars wherein it is plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they swerve from the Truth, and profess such doctrines as have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to Irreligion and Impiety.</hi>

some hope that there are some Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Well-meaning people among them, who being inveigled by the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible pretences of their Leaders have taken up some of their Notions, but are ready, upon a discovery of the Falshood and Perniciousness of them, to lay them down, and wholly to abandon them. Those that are of this sober disposition, will, I question not, find this Present Undertaking beneficial to them; and will be so far from censuring them, that they will thankfully acknowledg my setting them Right in Perswasions of so great moment and importance, such as are either of the Foundation of Religion, or have a near alliance to it, or have a necessary influence on our Christian Practice.</hi>

               <hi>In short, when Principles and Truths of the Highest Nature are struck at by bold Assailants, when the Main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Religion are depraved and perverted, and when Christianity it self
<pb facs="tcp:99330:12"/>
is endanger'd, shall we sit still, and not be concern'd?</hi> * If these foundations be destroy'd, <hi>if these</hi> Forts, <hi>these</hi> Bulwarks, <hi>these</hi> Strong-holds <hi>(as some render the word) be demolish'd,</hi> what can the righteous do? <hi>if these Fundamental Principles be overthrown, what a wretched state will Religion and the Professors of it be reduced to? Which is the very thing which we may justly fear at this time, when we behold such a great and signal Defection from the Truths of Christianity, from the Faith of the Gospel, even in the Christian World. How few are there at this day that</hi> can endure sound doctrine? <hi>how many are there that call themselves</hi> Protestants, <hi>and yet grow weary of those Main Articles of Religion which have been owned ever since the</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>and have been defended and vindicated by the Pens of the Religious <note place="bottom">Psal. 11. 3.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99330:12"/>
and Learned? And shall we silently and tamely permit this? No certainly, That</hi> Charity which beareth all things, endureth all things, <hi>cannot suffer this. Yea, it is the highest</hi> Charity <hi>in such a dangerous juncture to acquaint persons with the true State of affairs, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Methods and Artifices of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, to lay open before the world their Cheats and Delusions, and to shew what Errors they substitute in the place of Truth.

                  <p>There is an obligation on the<hi> Author </hi>to give the World an account of the<hi> Irreligious Sentiments </hi>of the<hi> Socinians. </hi>Their<hi> Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Holy Scriptures </hi>is a proof of their Prophane genius.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Am obliged to let the World see that I did not reproach and injure the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> when I laid to their charge <hi>the favouring and promoting of Atheism,</hi> and consequently that what I said of them was not (as they have suggested) hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rashly spoken, or written without due premeditation: And thence it will appear that I am not to be represented as a Censorious or Uncharitable person, which are imputations which I always abhorr'd, and have carefully laboured to avoid.</p>
               <p>Thus then I make good what I said, Some of this sort of men cannot well be thought to have any true and right Sense of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> especially the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> because they have in their Publick Writings renounced some of the most
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99330:14"/>
Considerable things relating to <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> in the Church of Christ. These are the four General Heads of my following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>I begin with the First. As to the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of Religion, these men are very faulty, and upon examination will be found to be favourers of very <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> Opinions. And here I will reduce what I have to say unto these five Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Notions concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God,</hi> concerning the <hi>First Man,</hi> concerning the <hi>Future State,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Christianity it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, It is no mean proof of their Prophane genius that they delight to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and abuse the <hi>Holy Scriptures. As to some lesser matters, and such as are of small moment, the Bible hath Repugnancies</hi> and <hi>Mistakes,</hi> saith the Great <note n="*" place="bottom">Socin. de Author. S. Script. cap. 1.</note> Founder of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> i. e. He from whom it takes its denomination.

of no great moment.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Institut. Theolog. lib. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Episcopius,</hi> (who is owned to be a <hi>Socinian</hi> by the <note n="‖" place="bottom">A brief History of the Unitarians.</note> Party themselves) tells us that <hi>the Penmen of the Scriptures were left to their own humane frailty in delivering those things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to circumstances of Fact, as time and place, and the like.</hi> And in the same place he attributes these Mistakes and Errors in the Bible to the <hi>want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or <hi>weakness of Memory</hi> in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Where then is their Infallibility, which hath been owned by all Christian Churches? Or, can they be Infallible, and yet Err? What is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Writers and others but this, that they were Immediately Inspired by the Holy Ghost, and consequently are not liable in the least to Mistakes and Misapprehensions? Those then that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this must needs deny the Writers of the Holy Scripture to have been Inspired, and to have been Infallible, yea they must say that they were (like other men) faulty and erroneous in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. This, you will say (and that justly) is an Ill Beginning, here is a Bad specimen of their Sentiments concerning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99330:15"/>
the <hi>Doctrinal part of Religion,</hi> of which our Right Conceptions concerning the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> is a considerable Branch, not to say <hi>Root.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is but mean and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in respect of what they further hold and maintain. For they not only find fault with some passages here and there, but they question the Authority of whole Books, and even vilifie the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self. What think you of those words of the <note n="‖" place="bottom">Socin. Epist. 2. ad Dudith.</note> Ring-leader of the Party? <hi>The Precepts of the Old Testament are for the most part such, that it is hard to believe that they proceed from God, they are either so Light, or Vain, or Superstitious, or even Foolish, and Ridiculous; and, in sum, they seem not to be worthy of God.</hi> Is this the Language of one that hath a due respect and reverence for the Scriptures? And in an <note n="*" place="bottom">Explicat. 5. Mat. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>And <note n="†" place="bottom">Ostorodus in Institut. cap. 30.</note> one of his Friends declares, that <hi>when</hi> Solomon <hi>in his Proverbs speaks any thing concerning Manners, if it be not expresly spoken, that is, either commanded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99330:16"/>
or forbid by</hi> Moses <hi>in the Law, is no more obligatory than the wise advice and doctrine of any other man.</hi> What is this but bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down this Inspit'd Author to the same level with <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> or any other honest Moralist? But would you know what is the true reason of their slighting and undervaluing this Royal Penman who dictated all by an Infallible Spirit? It is this without doubt, because there is in that Book so Remarkable a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the doctrine of <hi>Christ's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> chap. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 22. to 32. where any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd man cannot but see that by <hi>Wisdom</hi> is meant the <hi>Son of God Christ Jesus,</hi> whose Eternal Being and Godhead are there in plain terms express'd. I might observe how an <note n="*" place="bottom">Smalc. cont. Frantz.</note> other Celebrated <hi>Racovian</hi> disparages those Writings of <hi>Solomon</hi> which bear the Title of <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes,</hi> but I shall have occasion to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this more particularly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then for the New Testament, we are rightly told by an Excellent Pen that <note n="‖" place="bottom">Bishop <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Pref. to the Discourse of Christ's Satisfaction.</note> 
                  <hi>our Unitarians undermine the Authority of these Books, and so introduce Deism amongst us.</hi> There are some of these Writings either
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99330:16"/>
slily carp'd at, or more positively call'd in question by them. The Subtilty of <hi>Enjedinus</hi> (an Overseer of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Churches in <hi>Transilvania)</hi> is to be taken notice of in his <hi>Explication of the Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> who though he saith he hath an esteem for this Book, and will not detract from the Authority of it, yet thus speaks, <hi>It is to be known that this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is very much suspected among the most, nor hath it obtain'd the same repute and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the other Writings of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi> And then he assigns his Reasons why he questions the Authority of this Epistle: one whereof is this, <hi>The things which this Author writes concerning the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> chap. 9. v. 1. <hi>may be confuted out of the Old Testament.</hi> An other is, that <hi>he seems to use foolish Arguings, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert some things which are manifestly false.</hi> And lastly, <hi>this Epistle seems to favour certain Heretical and Erroneous Opinions.</hi> All this, and much more he rehearses in contempt of the Divine Authority of this Epistle, and saith not one syllable to shew his dislike of it, or to let the World see how these Cavils may be confuted. The true reason is because this part of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Writings is such an Eminent and Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attestation of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99330:17"/>
Saviour, and of his making <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto God the Father by the offering of himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon the Cross for us.</p>
               <p>Again, the Writings of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist and Apostle have been struck out of the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture by these men. It is the frank acknowledgment of our <hi>New English Unitarians</hi> (as may be seen in one of their <note n="*" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity, p. 49, 50.</note> late Prints) that the <hi>Antient Unitarians</hi> generally disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the <hi>Gospel</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> which are ascribed to this Author, and held that they were writ by <hi>Cerinthus</hi> an Heretick in those days. But this must be said, they pitch'd upon a very unlikely man to be the Author of those Writings; for this <hi>Cerinthus</hi> (as <hi>Irenaeus, Eusebius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the most Credible Writers of the Church inform us) was the Chief Man in those days that opposed the Divinity of Christ, and held him to be a Mere Man, whereupon St. <hi>John</hi> drew his Pen against him. Can we think then that the Gospel of St. <hi>John</hi> was writ against <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,</hi> and yet that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> writ it? Besides, it is easily proved that both the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>First Epistle</hi> which bear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99330:17"/>
this Apostle's name were universally held to be <hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> and written by him, as <note n="‖" place="bottom">Eccles. Hist. l. 3. c. 24. lib. 5. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies: nay, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <note n="*" place="bottom">Sandius de Script. Eccles.</note> Unitarian Writer firmly vouches this. Wherefore it is probable that the only reason why any of the <hi>Old Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> disallow'd of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Writings was because there are such passages as these in them, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father. I and my Father are one. He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father. I am in the Father, and the Father in me. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</hi> In brief, because these Writings assert the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and more especially the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ,</hi> thence they are resolved to defame the authority of them: thence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99330:18"/>
our very <note n="†" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Modern Unitarians</hi> publickly declare that St. <hi>John</hi> makes use of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain terms and phrases (as <hi>life, light, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, only begotten,</hi> &amp;c.) by chance; and by other crafty insinuations they would diminish the esteem of those Writings.</p>
               <p>Nay, they endeavour to blast the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of All the Canonical Books, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that <hi>some have been modelling the Common Bibles far above twelve hundred years.</hi> So saith the Author of the <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and he speaks in the name of all the rest. Thus they would make the World believe that the Whole Sacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume is corrupted, and thereby our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Faith are rendred Uncertain and Dubious, which is the thing aimed at.</p>
               <p>Moreover, their vilifying and abusing of the Holy Scripture are seen in their <hi>Wild Interpretations</hi> of it, merely to evade plain Texts which are against them, and to establish their own fond Principles. I deny not that some of them have very laudable descants on several passages of the Bible. <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Discourses and Commentaries on sundry Texts; he treats excellently of the <hi>Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> and very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99330:18"/>
admirably and judiciously of the <hi>Truth of Christianity.</hi> But at other times he generally dodges and higgles, and uses quirks and subterfuges to support his Cause. So true is that of our Learned <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to the Discourse of Christ's Satisfaction.</note> 
                  <hi>F. Socinus seeing the bent of the Scripture so much against him, sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the finding out ways to avoid the force of them.</hi> It is granted likewise that some of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s followers are very useful in their Expositions of the New Testament. They settle the sense and scope of the words, and furnish the Reader with several Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms of good use. He that denies this is to be suspected of causeless Prejudice and ill-will against them. But then, it must be said that they too often pervert the native sense of the words, and force the Texts to speak what they please: and generally the Arguments they offer are weak and unmanly, groundless and precarious: but they have a way of shoving them on with some craft and subtilty. They are all very dexterous at this, but <hi>Enjedinus, Crellius,</hi> and <hi>Slich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingius</hi>'s Comments on Texts are of this sort especially. It would create wonder sometimes to see their Elaborate Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry

in finding out <hi>Trajections</hi> and <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> in several places, in altering the genuine and obvious sense of Texts, in their subtile ways of perverting and wresting of some clear passages of the Bible. It must be said they have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised the height of their Wit and Parts in this performance. But as it was said of old of the Dice-player, <hi>the better he was at the Game, the worse he was;</hi> so here it is most true, the more these men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in this way of Cheating and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon mankind, the more is their Badness discover'd, and the greater is their Crime.</p>
               <p>And our <hi>Domestick Socinians</hi> agree with the <hi>Foreigners</hi> in this, for they use the same little Arts and Tricks to deprave the sense of Holy Writ, and to render it serviceable for their turn. If I should instance only in their strange and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable interpreting of the first verses of the first Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, that would be sufficient to let us see what a marvelous talent they have of misinterpreting and wresting the Holy Book. <hi>In the beginning,</hi> say <note n="*" place="bottom">An Accurate Examination of the Principal Texts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Christ's Divinity, p. 24, 25, 26.</note> they, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99330:19"/>
as much as in the beginning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, or the Gospel-state, though there is not the least colour for any such Gloss from the whole Context, and though all Expositors both Antient and Modern have understood it otherwise. <hi>The Word was with God,</hi> i. e. when Christ ascended into Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> some time before his Publick Ministry, though there is no foundation for any such surmise, as I shall immediately shew. <hi>And the Word was God, or a God,</hi> (for so these nice Criticks will have us read it, though it is well known to the Learned that the omission of the <hi>Article</hi> is not argumentative) <hi>i. e.</hi> he was appointed to be a kind of God, or God's Representative, as Magistrates are call'd <hi>Gods.

               <p>From these and such like Conceits, which their Writings abound with, you may discern the Air and Genius of these Men: you cannot but take notice that they love to play upon words and phrases, they delight in coining sophistical Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

Our late Revivers of the Cause are furnish'd with the same Skill, and use it as advantageously. They will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to own Christ's <hi>Divinity,</hi> they will say Christ is <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>True God;</hi> and yet if you come to the trial, they wholly renounce it, and tell you <note n="‖" place="bottom">An Answer to a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter touching the Trinity.</note>

the <hi>Turks</hi> confess <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be. Though our Blessed Saviour be so often stiled <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> in the New Testament, yet the Antitrinitarians would needs persuade us that the meaning of it is no other than this, that he was a <hi>Great and Eminent Man:</hi> whence it follows, that they hold Christ to be <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in the same sense that the Papists talk of their <hi>Lord God the Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So they will tell you that the Death of Christ is an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of mankind, and yet, <hi>whatever they pretend, they really own no such thing,</hi> as the Reverend Bishop <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> rightly remarks, and irrefragably proves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Exceptions, in his Admirable Treatise against <hi>Crellius.</hi> And in several other Instances it might be shew'd that they intolerably abuse and deceive the world. In brief, never was Prejudice more rampant, never were Fallacies so often placed in the room of Arguments, never was Reason so grosly abused, never was Logick so ill employ'd, never were Grammer and Criticism so scandalously thrown away as in the Writings of these men: and all is done to distort the Word of God, to elude the meaning of the Holy Ghost, to plead against the Lord of Life
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99330:21"/>
and Glory, and against the only way and means of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>Here, under this First Head, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Abusing of Scripture,</hi> I will take notice of One Particular Instance of it, which to the Common Reader perhaps may be a Rarity. They thinking it necessary that <hi>Christ,</hi> being but a mere Man, (for they hold him to be no other) should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily instructed by God as to his Office of the Messias, and therefore it would be requisite that he should (like St. <hi>Paul)</hi> be taken up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there be taught particularly how to discharge his Office, and how to teach men upon Earth; Accordingly they were to find out some Texts of Scripture which might be strained to support this Fiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ went up into Heaven in the time of the forty days Fast, or some time before he began to Preach, that he might receive Instructions from God concerning the Gospel-dispensation, and concerning the things that he was to deliver upon earth. To this purpose they pitch upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. <hi>No man hath ascended up into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man who is in Heaven,</hi> and they would persuade us that these words
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99330:21"/>
are spoken concerning that <hi>Ascension</hi> which they fancy. But this meaning cannot be fastned upon them, because we are here plainly inform'd that Christ came down from Heaven first, and then afterwards ascended thither; whereas it is their assertion that he first ascended, and then came down thence. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible therefore to stretch these words so as to make them serviceable to the foresaid Conceit.</p>
               <p>But they alledg another Text, <hi>What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascended up where he was before? John</hi> 6. 62. but this is as wide from their purpose as the other, for these words were spoken after Christ began to preach, and therefore can't be understood of that Ascension which they dream of, because they suppose that to have been before his Publick Preaching, whereas our Saviour here speaks of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to come, <hi>What and if ye shall,</hi> &amp;c. His Ascension therefore was not past at that time. And further, our Saviour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us here that he was in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ascension thither, which is a plain and undeniable proof of his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for he was not there before as to his Humane Nature; <hi>that</hi> these Gentlemen themselves acknowledg, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99330:22"/>
the words must be meant of his being in heaven with his Father from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of having <hi>the same Glory which he had with him before the World was,</hi> as he speaks himself, <hi>John</hi> 17. 5. And the other forecited place confirms this, for 'tis expresly said <hi>he came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (and he could not do that unless he were before in heaven) yea and <hi>is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which both passages are meant of his Divine Eternal Nature, as to which he always was and is in heaven. He is said <hi>to come down thence</hi> when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to assume our human nature, to be made flesh, and with this ascended a short time after his Resurrection, and not before. Thus they have unwarily made choice of these Texts, from which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Deity</hi> of Christ is so plainly deduced, a doctrine which they can't endure to hear of. Besides, from what hath been said it appears that these Texts are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpose for which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them: and particularly this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is spoken of the Ascension of Christ which was then to come, and therefore can't be meant of that which they talk of.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding this the Socinian Writers hold a <hi>Double Ascension</hi> of our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99330:22"/>
Saviour; and they had it from their <note n="*" place="bottom">Socin, in Catechesi.</note> Great Master, who was the first Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Figment. <note n="†" place="bottom">De Divin. Christi. cip. 4. Cont. Frantz. Exam. cent. errorum.</note>

                  <hi>Volkelius</hi> and others publish it as a very Great Truth, nay they fancy it to be the First Step to all Christ's Undertakings, and therefore must be of mighty Concern. The New Set of Socinian Writers hold the same, <hi>Before Christ enter'd on his office, he was taken up into heaven,</hi> say <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">An Accurate Examination of the principal texts alledg'd for Christ's Divinity. chap. 5.</note> they, <hi>to be fully instructed and inform'd in the nature and quality of his Office, and of that whole charge which he was to deliver to men.</hi> Yet, this Invention hath nothing in the whole Evangelical History to favour it. If there had been any such thing, the <hi>New Testament</hi> would not have been silent: it would have been mention'd by the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> or one of them at least, as a very considerable part of Christ's Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yea, the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> without
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99330:23"/>
doubt, which mentions his <hi>Ascension in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven</hi> after his resurrection, would have particularly mention'd this, if he had <hi>before ascended,</hi> it being (as they say) of such eminent importance, <hi>viz.</hi> to fetch down from heaven a Religion for us, as they are pleas'd to speak. This Ancient <hi>Symbol</hi> would have taken notice that our Saviour went up twice into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, once to take his Instructions from God the Father, and afterwards to sit at his right hand. But neither here, nor in the whole Narrative of his Actions in the <hi>Gospels</hi> do we meet with any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former Ascension. If the Reader is desirous of a farther confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>Antecedent</hi> or <hi>Preparatory</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, let him consult the Admirable <note n="*" place="bottom">On the 2d Article of the Creed.</note> Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> who excellently shews the improbability, unreasonableness and absurdity of it.</p>
               <p>I will only add this as observable, that they confute their New Doctrine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for concerning the very Texts which they alledg for it, which speak of <hi>Christ's being in heaven,</hi> and <hi>coming down from heaven</hi> a late Writer of the Socinian Perswasion saith thus, <note n="†" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications of the doctrine of the Trinity.</note> 
                  <hi>These Texts

amount to no more than this, that the Lord Christ is a Messenger, really come forth from God to Men: as much is true of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> And so every Prophet ascended up to heaven as much as our Saviour did. Thus they baffle themselves: and they must needs do it, it cannot be help'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they make use of Scripture to such evil purposes, because they study to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and distort the sense of it. Their business is to bring the Bible to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Opinions, and not to form these by that. Nay, if Scripture be so express against them that they know not how to evade it, they abandon it rather than they will quit their own Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This is the way of them all: and one of them who was more open-hearted than the rest, lets us know by his own practice what those of his Perswasion should do on the like occasion; <note n="*" place="bottom">Smalc.

               </p>
               <p>To summ up all then that hath been said, I ask whether the Socinians assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Repugnancies in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether their questioning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of some of the Books, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the whole as deprav'd, whether the wilful wresting of particular places to establish their own Opinions, whether (I say) these be not plain Marks of <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and such as directly tend to make men <hi>Atheists.</hi>

                  <p>The Writings of some of the<hi> Socinians, </hi>as well as of<hi> Vaninus </hi>and<hi> Machiavel, </hi>who seem to assert a God, prove them not to be<hi> no Atheists. </hi>They have a Licence to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble.<hi> Socinus </hi>allows not of the proof of a Deity either from any inward dictates in a mans Mind, or from any outward ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the World.

Their notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's<hi> Eternity </hi>is Unscriptural, and unworthy of his Excellent Nature. Therefore no Learned Writer allows of a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99330:25"/>
Successive Duration in God, properly and strictly speaking.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly, we will see what their Opinions and Apprehensions are concerning <hi>God,</hi> which is the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I propounded to speak of. It is true, some of them in their Writings have laudably asserted and maintain'd the Being of a God. <note n="*" place="bottom">De Deo &amp; Attributis.</note> 
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man among them that hath professedly and designedly undertaken this task, and he hath done it learnedly and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and I verily believe heartily, for I count it an Injury to detract even from an Adversary. But there is another sort of men who act under a Disguise, and cunningly undermine that Cause which they seem to promote. An example of this was <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who was an arrant <hi>Atheist,</hi> and was burnt for being so, and yet writ for the <hi>Existence of a God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd against the <hi>most Pestilent Sect of Atheism,</hi> as he calls it in his <hi>Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Divinae Providentiae.

               <p>And yet hear what the foresaid <hi>Crellius</hi> saith of this man, <note n="†" place="bottom">De Deo &amp; Attrib. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <q>It appears from many passages in his Writings that, notwithstanding what he seems to say sometimes, (for it was necessary to cover his Atheism in some manner) he did not acknowledg any Religion at all.</q> And again afterwards thus, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Cap. 6.</note> 
                  <q>He plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough shews that he really acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99330:26"/>
that there is no God, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this) that he hath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse to alledg why he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a God.</q> If a Socinian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (and one of the Learnedest and Ablest of them) thus censures this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then there may be ground to suspect that <hi>some</hi> of those of the Party who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Being of a God, are not sincere in doing so, but make that a Pretext and Shew to disguise the Badness of their other Opinions: and it may be thought that as <hi>Machiavel</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> were <hi>Countrymen,</hi> so in other respects they are more nearly allied. The <hi>Racovians</hi> will patiently suffer a man to dissent, or seem to dissent from them in many things, if they know him to be right as to the main. They will permit him to use his Pen against some of their Beloved Doctrines, and yet at the same time they will own him as theirs.</p>
               <p>There is a plain proof of this in those two Eminent Persons, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi> The former seem'd to be a great Abhorrer of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> as appears from an <note n="*" place="bottom">H.

it the <hi>Poison of the Church</hi> and the <hi>Worst of Heresies, at the mentioning of which all pious men are horribly afraid.</hi> And it is well known that he defended the <hi>Satisfaction of Christ;</hi> and yet he is reckon'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by the <hi>Socinians</hi> to be of their Perswasion. The latter hath in his Writings seemingly oppos'd some of the Points which <hi>Socinus</hi>'s followers adhere to, at least he doth not throughly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, and yet our Modern Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers for the Cause put him into the Catalogue of their Writers. Whence we may infer that the Party have a Licence to Dissemble; their Words and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do not always correspond with their Apprehensions; and consequently when some of them assert a Divine Being, we cannot thence conclude their real Belief of it: or when they seem to confute the contrary opinion, we can't certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that they are in good earnest. <hi>Wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> some say, was too well acquainted with Diabolical Magick, though he writes against it, and defies it. Our <hi>Hopkins,</hi> the Witch-finder, some think, was vers'd in the Black Art himself, and practis'd it.</p>
               <p>I would offer it to the consideration of Wise and Discerning Men whether <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99330:27"/>
hath not gratified the <hi>Atheists</hi> (not to say, that he hath shew'd his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be one) when he not only tells us that there is no proof of a <hi>God</hi> from any innate apprehensions of his being and nature, <hi>(The notion of</hi> God, <note n="*" place="bottom">Praelect. cap. 2.</note> saith he, <hi>is not written in mens hearts, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle in their breasts whereby they can by the use of Reason come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God.)</hi> But adds likewise that he cannot be proved from without, that is, from any of the Works of the Creation; though these have been always voted by the Wisest Men (both Pagans and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) to be a Sufficient Topick whence we may argue a <hi>Deity.</hi> Yet he stiffly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, and will not admit of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay though his denial be a direct opposing of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The invisible things of God, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead.</hi> The Being and Attributes of God, though they are Invisible, are understood, and as it were seen by the visible things of the Creation. This is the plain meaning of the Text, and yet he will not by any means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg

it, but by an unaccountable forcing of the words labours to pervert the Sense of them, against all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Grammar, Criticism, Reason, the Context, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This looks very ill, that we have no notice of a Divine Being from our own Natural Reasons, nor from the Make and Structure of the World. Who but <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> would have believ'd this? and who but a Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer to Atheism would have broach'd it? Especially seeing it is so groundless and senseless an Opinion, and so easily to be confuted, for if there be no inward impressions of the being of God on Mens Minds, and no arguing from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and visible works of the Creation, then it is certain no Pagans could have arrived to the notion of a God, which yet we see they have, and there is no Man denies it. Wherefore one would suspect that the foresaid Gentleman had a great Mind to maintain and divulge a Paradox which he could not but be sensible would be very grateful to the worst sort of Men, if <hi>Atheists</hi> are such.</p>
               <p>But I wave this, and will consider the <hi>Socinian Opinions concerning God</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the first of his <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi> and after that to the <hi>Trinity of

I proceed therefore to the next Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of God, the denial of which I tax'd the <hi>Racovians</hi> with. And here I will first prove the Charge, and then briefly represent the Unreasonableness and Absurdity of this notion which the Socinians frame of God. For the sake of the English Reader I will translate out of the Latin the very Words of one of their Principal Authors, <note n="*" place="bottom">Crellius de Deo &amp; Attribut. cap. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>When we</hi> (saith he) <hi>name</hi> a Spirit, <hi>we understand a Substance void of all Grossness, such as we behold in visible bodies. Thus we say that Angels are</hi> SPIRITS, <hi>and so we call our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner Part (which Philosophers rather call a</hi> SOUL) <hi>and the Air (though it lie open to some of our Senses, as the Touch) and other bodies like to this: Every one of which hath so much the more this name</hi> (viz. SPIRIT) <hi>allotted to it by how much it is the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi> Again he expresses it thus, <note n="†" place="bottom">Commentar. in Johan. 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit or Spiritual Essence is that which is opposed to that Essence which is Corporeal, that is, which is Crass,</hi> viz. <hi>of such things which we behold with our Eyes, especially of those that are Terrene.</hi> And a <note n="‖" place="bottom">Comment. in 1. Epist. ad Corinth. cap. 15. v. 45.</note> third time he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es this, for he reckons <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99330:29"/>
and the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men in the same rank with <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Subtile Bodies,</hi> telling us that these are <hi>Spirits</hi> in the proper and strict sense. Our <hi>Home-Socinians</hi> think and speak the same, as is apparent from <note n="*" place="bottom">Scripture. Catechism. Chap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>J. Bidle,</hi> who openly declares that <hi>God is of a Visible and Corporeal Shape.</hi> Thus it is plain that the Immaterial Nature of the Deity is discarded by them, and the best Notion that they can frame of him is that he is a Thin Airy Body. Which how disparaging it is to the Divine Being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be conceiv'd by every Serious Thinking Man. For let Matter be never so fine and subtile, yet still it is Matter. The Animal Spirits (as they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally call'd) are bodies as well as any others: and when they are never so Agile and Brisk, they have still a Corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and being such they are Finite and Circumscribable, which is unworthy of the Nature of the Supreme Being. Therefore this was the rational dictate of Improv'd Minds that God is Incorporeal: this was the sense of <hi>Plato</hi> (as <note n="†" place="bottom">Sine corpore ullo Deum vult esse, ut Graeci dicunt, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Again, all Matter of it self is Unactive and Dull, because it hath no inward Principle to act and inform it. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver motion and agitation it hath is from without first of all: all its Influence is put into it by another. Which to conceive of God is the greatest Blasphemy, as well as Absurdity. Further, all Matter or mere Body is in its own Nature void of Sense and Perception: and it is not the Fineness and Agility of it that will make it Think and Apprehend. The reason is, because Cogitation or Apprehension is another distinct thing, and quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from a Material Being: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ridiculous to imagine that what is merely Corporeal hath a faculty of Thinking or Conceiving, of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Willing. To be Cogitative is far different from being Divisible or Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the notion of Cogitation doth not in the least involve in it the notion of Division. There is such a disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ideas of these things that no rational man can bring it into his thoughts that Matter is capable of Perceiving or Performing the acts of the Mind.

But how derogatory is it to the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Perfect Nature of the Deity? It is no other than limiting and confining the Divine Being, and making that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite which is Infinite. If God's Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be denied, his Infiniteness must be so too. And yet (which shews the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Inconsistency of their notions) these foresaid Writers pretend to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that his Wisdom and Power are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, as if Infinite Perfections could be seated in a finite subject. Or rather, these Perfections may be said to be God Himself, and therefore if they be Infinite, the Nature of God must needs be such. His Transcendent Nature is of that kind that it hath no bounds, no dimensions; and what is so, is Every where, and in all places, though not circumscribed by any. But they have such a kind of noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning God as <hi>Pliny</hi> had of him, who denies the Universal Presence of God in the World (as also his Concern for it) because, saith he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Plin. Nat. Hist. l. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Divinity must needs be polluted by so base and manifold a Ministry.</hi> This is the very reason which some of them assign why they refuse to acknowledg the Divine Ubiquity. But
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99330:31"/>
it is the grossness of their conceptions that makes them think thus, for the nature of God is such that he is incapable of being defiled and polluted by being any where. The most filthy places cannot annoy his Person and Essence. Wherefore here (as at some other times) they have very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philosophical apprehensions, and are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably mistaken about the nature of God.</p>
               <p>I might shew likewise how repugnant their Assertion is to that discovery of the Divine Nature which we have from the Inspired Writings. <hi>The heaven, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens cannot contain him,</hi> 1 Kings 8. 27. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? or whither shall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</hi> Psal. 139. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which excellent variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions is made use of on purpose to signifie this grand Truth, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to assign <hi>any</hi> place where God is not present. And this necessarily results from his Infinite Nature, which is without measure and quantity: yea, it is the very result of the Concessions of the <hi>Socinians</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99330:32"/>
themselves, for seeing they grant the <hi>Power</hi> of God is inseparable from his <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> it must needs follow that this is Immense (and consequently Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) as well as that. Notwithstanding this, the <hi>Socinians</hi> represent God as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> did, shut him up in Heaven.

Who can read that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable passage of the Psalmist, and not believe this? <hi>Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up-rising, thou understandest my thought afar off.

Here are the <hi>Ways</hi> or Actions, here are the <hi>Words,</hi> here are the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of Men distinctly specified; and they are all pronounced to be the object and matter of God's <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I desire the Reader to observe this further, that this Holy Man owns the doctrine of God's <hi>Omniscience</hi> though there were <hi>Difficulties</hi> in it, though he could not reach the Manner of it. <hi>Such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> saith he, <hi>is too wonderful for me: it is high, I cannot attain unto it,</hi> v. 6. As
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99330:33"/>
if he had said, How God knoweth and foreseeth all that I think, speak, and act, I am not able to determine: it is too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime a matter for me to search into; I am not able to give an account of it. But, however, I am satisfied concerning the truth and reality of it, because God can do more than I can comprehend. But <hi>Socinus</hi> was of another strain, he professedly declares that he disowns the Divine <hi>Prescience</hi> because he sees unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable <hi>difficulties</hi> in it, and he can't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>how it is:</hi> and his Brethren speak after the same rate. But how can they deny God's Prescience of Futurities when it is made the Peculiar Character of the Deity? or otherwise we can't make sense of those words <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 22, 23. <hi>Let them shew us what shall happen, and declare us things to come: shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi> This sort of Knowledg, <hi>viz.</hi> of those things that depend on the free acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, of which the Prophet here speaks (as appears from v. 25, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> distinguishes the True God from false and counterfeit ones, whereas the knowledg of some other Future things is vouchsafed to <hi>Men,</hi> to <hi>finite creatures.</hi> But this is here propounded as an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99330:34"/>
Argument and Evidence of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and this is to be found in Him alone. It is strange therefore that the <hi>Socinians</hi> should deny that to be in God which is Proper to him only, which is His Sole Prerogative. This certainly is a great eclipsing of the Divinity, and it can be resolv'd into nothing but this that they have a design to impair and affront the Essential <hi>Attributes</hi> of the Godhead as well as the Persons belonging to it.</p>
               <p>But then, how wild a thing is it to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that God can have no knowledg of these things, when we plainly see it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the manifold <hi>Predictions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Future Contingencies which the Sacred Scripture hath recorded? It is to be wondred at that, notwithstanding this, these men should be so blind: it is strange and unaccountable that they take no notice of their being baffled by the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling</hi> of those Predictions. Likewise, who sees not that the <hi>Providence</hi> of God extends it self to this sort of future actions and occurrences? for he manages these for great and excellent ends in the world. But how can he do this if he hath no knwledg of them? Can his Care and Providence be exercised about them, and yet he be wholly Ignorant of them?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99330:34"/>
Thus it is evident that at the same time that these men deny the Divine <hi>Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> they do also take away <hi>Providence,</hi> for it is impossible that God should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, order and take care of those actions and events which he knows nothing of. Which shews how absurd and ridiculous that passage in <hi>Socinus</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Praelect. cap. 8.</note> that <hi>this Prescience</hi> (which we assert to be in God) <hi>doth in some part take away and obscure that continual Care which he takes of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and renders him in a manner Idle.</hi> One would not imagine that such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent Thought should come into a mans head, and much less that it should be propagated, as we see in <note n="†" place="bottom">Not. ad Disp. 5. de Deo.</note> 
                  <hi>Vorstius</hi> and others. If they had not a strong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension to diminish and disparage the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and to foster <hi>Atheism,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they could not thus discourse, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they could not maintain that God is ignorant of what any Man will say, think or do the next moment, and that he hath no notice at all of such Future Occurrences as depend on the free will of man, till they actually come to pass, <hi>i. e.</hi> when every intelligent <hi>creature</hi> hath a knowledg of them.</p>
               <p>

There is yet another <hi>Attribute</hi> of God, concerning which they have a very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming notion, and such as is inconsistent with the Perfection of the Divine Nature.

mention'd, which are in the duration of other things; and consequently there are no Parts, and no Succession in the Eternal Duration of God.</p>
               <p>This I think no man will deny to be rational, that the Permanency of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of <hi>God</hi> should be differenced from that of <hi>Creatures,</hi> and accordingly that he should not be measured by Time as they are, I go upon this ground, that we ought to attribute the most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things to God, and on the contrary that we must not ascribe any thing to him that hath the least Shew of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and will diminish his Divine Nature. This is a safe and sound bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and on this I build my Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Temporal and Successive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought not to be attributed to God. If the persons I am now dealing with had attended to this Rule, had built on this basis, they would not have pronounced such strange things as they do concerning the Deity, they would have had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent conceptions of him, they would not have vented such undue Opinions and Surmises concerning the Divine Nature. But they, having taken up these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, endeavour to defend them: and it hath happen'd that some persons

of good Parts have undertaken the Cause, and have rendred it very plausible to such as have not an eye to the Infinite and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Excellency of God, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being.</p>

The<hi> Socinians </hi>denying him to be<hi> God, </hi>consequently deny his<hi> Satisfaction. </hi>That Text<hi> Rom. 3. 25. </hi>is urged against them.

               </argument>
               <p>THUS far we have seen how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective they are in their Notions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99330:37"/>
concerning <hi>God,</hi> as he is considerd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his <hi>Attributes.</hi> We will in the next place observe how faulty they are in their Conceptions concerning Him as he is to be considered in regard of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> contain'd in his Godhead. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, especially of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, bear witness that though there is but One Living and True God, yet in Unity of this Godhead there is a <hi>Trinity of Persons,</hi> of one substance, majesty, power and glory, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and that these are the very Eternal God. There is abundant proof of this from a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Plain and Obvious Texts: and yet the Disciples of <hi>Socinus</hi> stubbornly disown this Clear Truth. They have but a Text or two on which they pretend to build their belief of Christ's Ascending into heaven before he preach'd the Gospel, and yet these (though distorted and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied) they think a sufficient basis for that Conceit of theirs: but behold, there are above fourty Clear places of Scripture that express the Plurality of Persons in the Deity, and yet they refuse to attend to them. Which shews that their eyes are blinded, and that they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give themseves up to Mistakes.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99330:37"/>
The Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and Writers of the Church (who may well be supposed to have some knowledg and insight into this Catholick Doctrine) unanimously assert the Distinction of <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Subsistencies</hi> in the Godhead. Which is freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by their <note n="*" place="bottom">Socin. cont. Wiek. cap. 9.</note> Great Master, who expresly tells us that the <hi>Fathers</hi> both before and after the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> asserted the same doctrine that we do. And this hath been the constant professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Orthodox Churches of Christ in all ages. But notwithstanding this, there have been <note n="†" place="bottom">Moscorov. cont. Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecium. Slichting. cont. Meisnerum.</note> some since (unmindful of what their Master had acknowledg'd) that have endeavour'd to make the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of those Ancients speak for them, therein both contradicting <hi>Socinus</hi> and the Truth it self. Nay, even among the <hi>late Tracts</hi> published by the <hi>Socinians</hi> there is a formal Collection of the Testimonies of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Fathers</hi> against the Doctrine of the Trinity. So contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are these men to one another.</p>
               <p>There is no need of quoting any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Authors under this Head, for they all appear in a full body against the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99330:38"/>
doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Here the whole <hi>Posse</hi> of the <hi>Racovians</hi> shew themselves, unanimously and without exception de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that there is but One Person, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> in the Deity, and that the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are not God. As for the Blessed Son of God, who is the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father, begotten from everlasting by him, they affirm him to be no other than a Man, dignified with the title of <hi>God.</hi> And as for the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is co-es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential with the <hi>Father,</hi> some of them (who adhere to <hi>Bidle)</hi> hold he is an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> or <hi>Messenger</hi> of God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Person;</hi> but the rest of them deny his Personality, and averre him to be only the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Influence</hi> of God, and so is only a Quality or Operation: as if the Apostles were commanded <hi>to baptize all Nations in the name of an Operation,</hi> and at the same time were enjoyn'd to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the name of <hi>Two Persons.</hi> This is very harsh, yea it is very inconsistent and absurd. However, these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are resolv'd to adhere to it, and they bid open defiance to the Contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. One of the New Racovians tells us that the doctrine of the Trinity <note n="*" place="bottom">A Letter to the Clergy of both Universities. p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99330:38"/>
been partly the direct and necessary Cause, and partly the unhappy occasion of diverse Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Hurtful Errors and Heresies.</hi> And in an <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 5.</note> other place he declares that <hi>this doctrine is as little consistent with Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God as it is with Reason.</hi> But this is very mild and gentle in respect of what some other <hi>Unitarians</hi> belch forth. <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 1. de Trinit.

               <p>But more especially as to the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Atheism</hi> (which is yet a more Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crime) I request the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and weigh 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Take it thus with the preceding verse, which will lead us to the true sense of it, <hi>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son.</hi> As much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99330:39"/>
as to say, if there ever was a Person that might be truly call'd a <hi>Liar,</hi> if ever any one deserved that name, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that gainsays so plain a Truth as this (that <hi>Jesus is the Messias)</hi> is an egregious Liar and Falsifier, and merits to be call'd so. Yea, to such a one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not only the Title of a <hi>Liar</hi> but of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> because he is a direct Opposer of Christ as he is the <hi>Son</hi> of God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therein he denies both the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> For it follows, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father,</hi> i. e. he denieth the Father as well as the Son: for <hi>not having</hi> the Father is the same with <hi>denying him,</hi> as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the preceding clause, where it is call'd <hi>the denying of the Father.</hi> Now, I suppose the <hi>Socinians</hi> will grant that the <hi>denying of the Father</hi> is <hi>Atheism:</hi> wherefore they must also acknowledg that <hi>the denying of the Son</hi> is <hi>Atheism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this is included (according to these words of St. <hi>John) the denying of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Text which it may be they never thought of, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the force and influence of it: therefore I intreat them to ponder it now, and therein to see a Character of themselves. There were,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99330:40"/>
in St. <hi>John</hi>'s days some of their Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, some that opposed the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and especially the <hi>Deity of the Second Person:</hi> they labour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People (as their Successors do in our days) that the <hi>Father</hi> only was <hi>God,</hi> and that the <hi>Son</hi> was excluded wholly from the <hi>Divinity.</hi> Against these this Apostle writes, and lets them know that the <hi>Son</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and that he who hath the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to <hi>deny</hi> the Deity of the former, doth also <hi>deny</hi> the Deity of the latter. For such is the nature of the Godhead that one of these cannot be Alone. The <hi>Father</hi> is not without the <hi>Son,</hi> neither can be, as this latter cannot be without the other. They are so mutually joyn'd together that they cannot be separated. This Coherence is inviolable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that denies the Eternal Son of God, denies the Father: he that holds Christ is not the Son of God by Eternal Generation, in effect disowns the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father: and if he doth so, he is an <hi>Atheist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Text that is not question'd by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> though the next clause in the verse hath been doubted of by them and some others. These are Words of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99330:40"/>
Beloved Disciple, who lay in his Master's Bosom, and had extraordinary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of the Spirit, and was favour'd in a peculiar manner with Divine Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Revelations. This is he that may be called the <hi>Great Eagle</hi> (and that name was given him by the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and much more deservedly than <hi>Maimonides</hi> was called so by the Modern <hi>Jews)</hi> because he soared so high, and was so quick-sighted in the Mysteries of the Gospel, and had so piercing and saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious judgment. Therefore on all these accounts I urge this Text upon <hi>Socinus</hi>'s followers, wishing them to be sensible of the force of it. <hi>The denyal of the Son, i. e.</hi> the denying of his Divinity, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in his being the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of God, is a denyal of the <hi>Father</hi> also. They that deny the Deity of the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Persons,</hi> in whom the Divinity as truly subsists as in the First, deny the Deity of the <hi>First Person.</hi> Whence it irrefragably follows that a <hi>Socinian</hi> is an <hi>Atheist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is so if this Syllogism will prove him to be one, He that denies the existence of the True God is an Atheist, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> doth the former, therefore he is the latter. The <hi>Major</hi> is the definition of an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and therefore can't be question'd.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99330:41"/>
The <hi>Minor</hi> therefore must be proved, which is easily done thus, He that denies Christ to be the True God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the same substance with the Father, denies the existence of the True God: but a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian denies Christ to be the true God, <hi>i. e</hi> of the same substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ergò.</hi> The Second Proposition will not be denied by these Gentlemen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am to clear the <hi>Major,</hi> and that is soon done thus, If the denying of the Divinity of the Son be the denying of the Divinity of the Father, then he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Christ to be the True God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the existence of the True God: but the denying of the Divinity of the Son is the denying of the Divinity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ergò.</hi> The first Proposition will be yielded, I conceive therefore I am to take care of the second, and that is soon done from the forecited Text, which is the very substance of it, <hi>Whosoever deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Son, the same hath not the Father.</hi> The Socinians do the former, therefore they are guilty of the latter. There is such a Connection between these two, the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> they being Co-es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential and Co-eternal, that if you deny the Divinity of the one, you deny that of the other. Therefore they are <hi>Atheists</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99330:41"/>
that deny the Divinity of our Saviour: therefore in the interpretation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Apostle St. <hi>John</hi> Socinians are such, for they deny the Divinity of Christ, and in denying of that deny the Divinity of the Father.

               <p>Perhaps it may be expected here that I should maintain the contrary Truth, and formally prove and defend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Blessed <hi>Trinity:</hi> but because there have been so many Treatises lately published on this subject, and because I design a Just Discourse upon it my self,

among others which I intend to offer to the world upon the <hi>Articles of the Creed,</hi> I will dismiss this Point at present, after I have made this one request to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he would vouchsafe in the most serious manner to consult the Writings of the New Testament, and studiously to compare those places together which refer to this Sublime Matter; and then he will clearly discover the Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of it. Nay, he will be convinced of this from what our Saviour himself saith concerning it: for though (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good reasons) he was not forward to declare his Divine Nature and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet he often uttered such words as implied that he was <hi>the Eternal Son of God;</hi> as when he said, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am,</hi> John 8. 58. <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> John 10. 30. (which the Jews well understood, when they laid this to his charge, <hi>Thou makest thy self God,</hi> v. 32, 33.) <hi>He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,</hi> because we are but One. <hi>John</hi> 14. 9. <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me,</hi> v. 10.

And denying him to be <hi>God,</hi> they conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently disown his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which is another Black Crime chargable upon them, and that very justly.

This is the opinion they have of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Death of our Blessed Lord. And to propagate this they endeavour by all means to vilifie his <hi>Priesthood.</hi> They manifestly confound his <note n="*" place="bottom">Cat. Racov. de Prophet. Christi munere.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Regal</hi> Office. And they would perswade us that his <note n="†" place="bottom">Socin. de Servat. par. 2. c. 15. Praelect. cap. 24. Cat.

to us. And in the same places of their Writings where they assert this, they also add that God remits the sins of men without any Compensation to his offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Holiness and Justice, for this they say is contradictory to the other. Nay, they tell us that <note n="*" place="bottom">Cat. Racov. cap. eod.</note> 
                  <hi>there is not in God that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice whereby he is moved to punish Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But shall we believe the <hi>Racovian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words? <hi>God set him (i. e.</hi> Christ) <hi>forth to be a Propitiation, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins.</hi> Rom. 3. 25. and in the next verse, <hi>to declare his righteousness, that he might be just,</hi> i. e. to make it appear that God would not pardon sin without <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> made to his <hi>Justice.</hi> The Holiness and Righteousness of God's nature, and the opposition of them to Sin oblige him to animadvert upon it. Wherefore Sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go unpunish'd, and consequently it cannot be forgiven without Satisfaction; that is, either the guilty person must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or the fault and punishment must be transferr'd on another. And whereas these Great Masters of Reason alledg that Christ could not be punish'd because he was an Innocent Person (for it is injustice

Christ under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the Punishment which we deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which should have been inflicted on us, and thereby he fully satisfied God's Justice, which, as he is Absolute and Supreme Governour of all the world,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99330:44"/>
requires that Sin should be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>How unreasonably then do the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Writers cry out against this Just and Wise Dispensation of Heaven? Yea, how Irreligious and Prophane are they in exploding and scoffing at that which is the Only Way of Man's Salvation; I may justly take up the words of an Ancient and Pious Father on the like occasion, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theodoret. de Provid. Serm. 6.</note> 
                  <q>I doubt not but if God had taken ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to effect our Salvation, they would also have found fault with that, for they are fastidious, and hard to please, and are only skill'd to Cavil at the Mysteries of the Divine Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> So far as we know, this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Method of Redeeming lost Man was Necessary, because Satisfaction could not otherwise be made to the offended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven, nor could the Injury done to him be fully repaired. But we are sure of this that this Satisfaction and Reparation were really made by Christ the Son of God.</p>
               <p>This is evident from those Texts of Scripture which acquaint us that he took the Guilt of our Sins upon himself. <hi>He
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99330:45"/>
was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> as any thing possibly can be that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty which was due to us for our sins and transgressions was transferr'd on him, and he thereby Satisfied for us. And this is the meaning of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Christ was once offer'd to bear the Sins of many:</hi> and of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>He was made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Curse for us,</hi> he underwent the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sin which we in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should have undergone, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he suffer'd that Cursed death of the Cross.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Satisfying</hi> for us is plainly denoted by the frequent mention of <hi>Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, i. e.</hi> doing some Great thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he <hi>purchased the favour of God</hi> for us, when we were enemies to him. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>God hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18. Or, in other terms, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. It pleased the Father that in him should
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99330:45"/>
all fulness dwell, and (having made peace through the blood of his cross) by him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all things unto himself,</hi> Col. 1. 19, 20, 21. And accordingly, <hi>you hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the body of his flesh through death,</hi> v. 22. And in several other places this <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is expresly mention'd. And whereas they acknowledg (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by these plain Texts) that <hi>Christ reconciled us unto God,</hi> but then <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that it is not said, <hi>He reconciled God to us,</hi> it is a vain and childish suggestion, and a mere playing upon words, and therefore is not worthy of a serious man, for <hi>our being reconcil'd unto God</hi> and <hi>his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconcil'd to us</hi> amount to the same: one is included in the other, or one at least follows upon the other. If we are reconcil'd to God, it is a natural conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that God is so to us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these <hi>Objectors</hi> shew themselves here (as they do upon several other occasions) to be very Triflers.</p>
               <p>The Satisfaction made by our Saviour is likewise manifest from those places of the New Testament which make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>sufferings for us, dying for us, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life for us,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. John 10. 11, 15. Rom. 5. 6. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. 1 Thess. 5. 9, 10. Heb. 2. 9. 1 Pet. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>1. 3. 18.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99330:46"/>
and many other places which inform us that Christ freely substituted himself in the room of lost men, and suffer'd in their stead.</p>
               <p>And this doctrine is undeniably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from those Texts which represent Christ as a real <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 3. 25. 1 John 22. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Propitiation</hi> and <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for our sins, and consequently as a true and proper <hi>Expiation</hi> for them, I say <hi>proper,</hi> because <hi>Socinus</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are not backward to acknowledg that he <hi>expiated</hi> for Sin, but then they mean it not in the proper sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he deliver'd us from the guilt of Sin by the efficacy and merit of his Blood. This likewise is plainly set forth to us in those Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Christ our Passover</hi> (i. e. our Paschal Lamb) <hi>is sacrificed for us.</hi> Ephes. 5. 2. <hi>He hath given himself for us an Offering and a Sacrifice for a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smelling savour:</hi> especially those in the <note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap. 9. 26. 10. 10, 12. and other places.</note> 
                  <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> which speak of Christ's <hi>Offering himself,</hi> and being a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and thereby making an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto God for us upon earth: which destroys that Senseless Fiction of theirs, that he was not a <hi>Priest</hi> till he came to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99330:46"/>
Heaven. This is undeniable that where the Oblation of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is, there is the <hi>Priest;</hi> now, it was here upon Earth that he was a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he offer'd his own blood upon the Cross, and therefore he was a <hi>Priest</hi> upon Earth. Therefore it is said, <hi>When he had by himself purged our sins (viz.</hi> here by his blood) <hi>he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. He first offer'd himself a Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice for us, and then appear'd in glory and triumph in heaven.</p>
               <p>Other Texts speak of Christ's <hi>ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. and of <hi>redeeming us,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. 1 Cor. 1. 30. And this <hi>Redemption was by his Blood,</hi> Eph. 1. 17. 1 Pet. 1. 18. call'd <hi>the Blood of God.</hi> Acts 20. 28. This was the <hi>Price</hi> that was paid for us, and so it was a Proper <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> This Price was paid to God's Justice, to free us from the Penalty which was due by the Law, to rescue us from eternal wrath and misery.</p>
               <p>This is the doctrine which the Holy Scripture teacheth us, and this is the faith of all who rightly understand those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ suffer'd and died to satisfie the Divine Justice in our stead, and thereby to expiate for our sins, and to redeem us from death and hell, and to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99330:47"/>
purchase life and salvation for us. The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny this, and thereby subvert the whole Gospel, turn Christianity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, ruine the very foundations of our Religion, and pluck it up by the roots. According to the doctrine of these Men <hi>we are yet in our sins,</hi> for there is no True Expiation for them; we are in a State of Misery, we are overwhelm'd with our own Guilt, we are hopeless helpless crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and our condition is deplorate, for there is no Satisfaction made to God for our transgressions.</p>
               <p>Nay, they are not content barely to renounce the contrary doctrine, but they explode it with great derision and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. First, as to <hi>Christ's Merits,</hi> we are told by <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. Frantz. Disp. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Smalcius</hi> that it was taught by <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Ostorodus</hi> that <hi>the opinion of those is false, absurd and pernicious who have invented and feigned that there is any such thing as Merit in Christ.</hi> And <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> himself is bold to call it <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>

               <p>But are the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the same opinion?

               <p>If this be true, then St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s doctrine is <hi>fabulous, By one man sin enter'd into the world,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>By one man's disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many were made Sinners, v.</hi> 19.

                  <hi>Smalcius</hi> will by no means grant that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in a state of Immortality, but that he was naturally Mortal, and though he had not sinn'd, yet he should have died. With whom agrees <note n="†" place="bottom">De V. R. l. 3. c. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Volkelius,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently asserting that Mortality is not the effect and punishment of the Fall.

               <p>And hence issue a great many Unsound Assertions, which are in great vogue with all <hi>Socinians.</hi> If there be no Corruption convey'd to <hi>Adam</hi>'s race, if they receiv'd no hurt by his Fall, then they have (as he had) a natural power to do all that God requires of them. <hi>They still have an ability by nature to imbrace all good, and to avoid all evil;</hi> which are the express terms used by their <note n="†" place="bottom">Socin Praelect cap. 5.

                  <hi>Racovian</hi> Divinity, It is not the Spirit of God that enlightens mens minds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables them to receive the Truth: the Spirit of God is not the original of all Grace in us. This is clear from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they form concerning the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit,</hi> by which is meant, say <note n="*" place="bottom">Cat.

As for the former, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians enjoy it; as to the latter, it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to those that believe and obey the Gospel; whence it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is not requisite before our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or obedience.

                  <hi>God's sealing what he hath promised, in the hearts of those that obey him:</hi> which is the same with what was mentioned before, <hi>viz.</hi> a certain hope of eternal life, and this is wrought in those that already believe and obey.

               <p>The present Set of Unitarians hold the same: they scoff at the particular aids and efficacy of the Spirit in order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; <note n="†" place="bottom">Trinitarian Scheme of Religion. p. 24.</note> they mock at the <hi>inward word which God</hi> speaks to the heart, whereby the word written or preach'd is rendred effectual, whereby Sinners are first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, and then reclaim'd.

In this the <hi>Socinians</hi> agree with the Old <hi>Pelagians,</hi> if the Writers of those times give us a true account of them. These let us know that it was confidently affirmed by them that it is in the power of man to choose spiritual good without the <hi>special</hi> assistance of God: yea, that it is possible to keep the Commandments so strictly and exactly that they shall not stand in need of Pardon: that they may arrive to such a Perfection in this life that they shall be able to live without sin, as <note n="‖" place="bottom">Epist. ad Cresc.</note> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <note n="**" place="bottom">Lib. 2. de Peccat.

That the <hi>Socinians</hi> have a Touch of this last (to say no more) might easily be proved from what is said by <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. Frantz. disput. 12.</note>

                  <hi>Bidle,</hi> and others of them; and indeed it partly follows from the abovesaid Principle. But the falseness and impiety of it are discernible by those who regulate their thoughts and apprehensions by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and who attend to that <note n="**" place="bottom">The 10th.</note> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Church, <hi>The condition of man after the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works to faith and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</hi> There is nothing plainer and clearer in the New Testament than this, that man can do nothing without the particular assistance of God that will be available to his Salvation. And if any man asserts the contrary, he makes void the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for he came to redeem us and save us because we were not able of our selves to effect any such

thing. Wherefore to say we that can of our selves and by our own natural strength do the things that are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and will be conducible to our Eternal Salvation, is to render the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>Christ</hi> useless and unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this is that which the persons I am speaking of drive at, and thereby undermine Christianity it self.</p>
               <p>In brief, judg of the <hi>Doctrines of the Socinians</hi> from what we find in <note n="*" place="bottom">Slichting. in Eph. 5. 6</note> one of the Heartiest Souls of them all, who in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the Epistle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> reckons these following Particulars among <hi>Vain and Lying Words, i. e.</hi> Groundless and False Doctrines, <hi>viz.

               <p>But what can be more contrary to those discoveries which are made to us in the Sacred and Inspired Writings? Our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour saith, <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living Mat.</hi> 22. 32. which words are spoken of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> who are long since departed this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99330:57"/>
life, wherefore it is undeniably evident that these Patriarchs <hi>live.</hi> But they do not live as to their bodies, therefore it must be meant of their Souls. The same Infallible Instructer ascertains us that <hi>he who hears his word, and believes in him who sent him, is passed from death to life, John</hi> 5. 24. Which words though they may be interpreted concerning a state of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death and spiritual life in this world, yet they have a fuller meaning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in them the passing of believers at their death into a better life than they had before, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi> of which he speaks in the very same verse. And such are said <hi>to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> (as if it were <hi>already</hi> done, which is usual in the Scripture-stile) because of the Certainty of the thing hereafter. But the <hi>Socinian</hi> Theology runs counter to this, they say believers <hi>pass from life to death,</hi> to a state that is wholly uncapable of sense, life or action. Those words of our Saviour, <hi>this day shalt thou be with me in paradise, Luke</hi> 23. 43. prove that the Soul enjoys it self immediately after death, and is in a state of Bliss and Happiness. The Apostle <hi>had a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, Phil.</hi> 1. 23. and assigns this as a reason, <hi>which is far better,</hi> that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99330:58"/>
is, far better than <hi>to abide in the flesh,</hi> to continue in this world, which he speaks of both before and after these words. But according to <hi>Socinus</hi>'s followers <hi>it is far worse,</hi> for after the Soul's departure from the body it hath no understanding, no perception at all of <hi>Christ,</hi> or any thing appertaining to him.</p>
               <p>Again, these men confront not only Scripture but reason: they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as bad Philosophers as Divines, for if they had a right apprehension of the Nature of Humane Souls, they would not talk after this rate. Their notion destroys the very Soul of man, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives it of its Essential and Inseparable Quality, which is <hi>Thinking.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they grosly imagine that the Body helps the Soul in its operations, yea that this cannot subsist without the assistance of that; whereas according to the best notions we can form of the body, as it is now corrupted, it is a hindrance to the operation of the Soul. And as for the Soul, it is so far from being worsted by its Separation that it is in a much better condition as to its actings than it was. Death is but snuffing of this <hi>Candle</hi> (so 'tis call'd <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27.) it makes it shine the brighter. When the Soul
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99330:58"/>
leaves the Body, it becomes more brisk and active than ever, being freed from that fleshly clog and luggage which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it. This is True Philosophizing, but the other is the very dregs of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism.</hi> It degrades the Rational Part of Man, especially that of Good Men, for all Separate Souls according to them go to the same place, the wicked and the godly are alike as to that, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them till the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Last Judgment. Which is a great deal worse than the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which assigns different <hi>Limbus</hi>'s to the good and bad. And then, they are all equal as to this, that they are Senseless, and uncapable of knowing or acting, or any ways exerting themselves. Though the Soul exists, yet it is as if it were not, it hath nothing of its True Nature, which is in a manner thrusting the Rational Spirit out of its being. Who doth not see that the belief of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility and Inactivity of the Soul makes way for the belief of its Non-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence after the death of the body? And so all Religion is dampt, and the hopes of a Future State are quite laid in the dust.</p>

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99330:59"/>
The Socinian Writers verge upon this: thus from the pen of one of the Authors before mention'd we have such words as these concerning the Soul, <note n="*" place="bottom">Volkel de V. R. l. 3. c. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Properly speaking, it neither dies nor lives, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes Life as long as it is joyn'd to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: wherefore properly speaking, it can't be said to be Immortal, for Immortality belongs only to those beings which themselves actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live.</hi> And speaking another time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Souls that are separated from their bodies, he intimates their Non-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence for a time, for he applies those words to this purpose, <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 19.</note>

publishing to the world that <hi>though it be easily granted that the Soul is not made of bone or flesh or muscles, or nerves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains doubtful whether it be not a very Thin Body consisting of Vapour, or Air, or Ether diffused through this Crass Body.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if <hi>God</hi> himself be but a Finer Sort of Body (as these <hi>Racovian</hi> Writers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him) it is no wonder that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man to be such, for why should they exalt it above the nature of the Supreme Being? So the everlasting subsistence both of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men is hereby shock'd. As to the latter of which I desire it may be observed that though <hi>Smalcius</hi> (one of their Great Scribes) will by no means be thought to deny the Immortality of them, because that may seem a little too gross, yet he industriously and purposely evades, yea opposes (and so do some others of the Perswasion) those Texts of Scripture which are made use of by Divines to prove the Soul's Immortality and Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence after the death of the body.</p>
               <p>This shews what they are inclinable to, this acquaints us that they have but an indifferent opinion of the Immortality of Humane Souls, which the very Pagan Philosophers with great earnestness and

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99330:60"/>
which may unexceptionably be laid to their Charge, that though generally they own a future Rising from the dead both of the just and unjust, yet they deny that they shall rise with the same bodies. They are the express words of <hi>Smalcius,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Exam. cent. ertorum.</note> 
                  <hi>We believe not that these bodies, which we now carry about us, shall rise again, Volkelius</hi> expresses the sense of the rest when he tells us that our bodies which shall be raised at the last day <note n="†" place="bottom">De V R. l. 3. c. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>shall have not only other qualities, but another matter of substance,</hi> and in plainer terms, <hi>Other bodies shall be substituted in their room.</hi> And what is the reason? because, saith he, these bodies which we now have shall vanish, perish, and consequently we shall never more have any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>These Great Pretenders to <hi>Reason</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digest the Identity of the Dying and Rising body, because they think it is a doctrine too hard to be conceiv'd, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many Difficulties in it which it is not easie to solve. But what then? must it therefore be counted Unreasonable and Incredible? I deny the Consequence, for there are many things which are hard
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99330:61"/>
to be understood, and yet we freely give assent to the truth of them. We meet with several Occurrences, of which we can't give an exact and punctual account. Some Secrets in Nature are inveloped with an impenetrable Veil. God hath done more than we are in a capacity to comprehend. He is pleas'd to reserve some things from our clear and distinct knowledg, and yet every wise man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the reality of them. It is so here, a Christian man believes that the same flesh which was dissolved by death shall be united to the soul at the last day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is not able to assign the Manner and Way of it. But he looks upon the thing it self as very Reasonable, because raising of the Same Flesh is possible with Him with whom nothing is impossible. Suppose the bodies of the dead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to nothing; notwithstanding this, he can bring them again into being, for this was the case of all things at first: they were not, and afterwards they were by God's Almighty Power. Shall we then think it impossible for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitate the same body, though we should grant it to have been for a time annihilated? It is true, God cannot make the same body to be, and not to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99330:61"/>
at the same time, because this is a plain Contradiction, but he can make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to exist at the last day which had lost its existence for a time. And so all the <hi>Objections</hi> about humane bodies being eaten and devour'd by men or beasts, and those beasts eaten by Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are easily removed.</p>

This Argument is thus represented by a <note n="*" place="bottom">Bishop Pearson on 11th. Article of the Creed.</note> Great Man, <q>The Identity of the body rais'd from death is so necessary, that the very name of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> doth include or suppose it; so that when I say, there shall be a Resurrection of the dead, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thus much, that the bodies of Men which lived and are dead, shall revive and rise again. For at the death of man nothing falleth but his Body:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99330:62"/>
                     <hi>the spirit goeth upward,</hi> and no other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy falleth but his own; and therefore the body, and no other but that body, must rise again, to make a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> So that it follows hence that those who disbelieve the Resurrection of the <hi>same body,</hi> in effect deny the Article of the Resurrection of the body, for the <hi>same body</hi> must rise, or none at all.</p>
               <p>This is evident from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body.</hi> The same individual body that died must revive, that the same bodies wherein sin was committed may be punished for sinning.

               <p>In all which they manifest an <hi>Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> temper: and more especially in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and opposing this Explication of the Article of the Creed they have shew'd an <hi>Atheistical</hi> Spirit, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways disgusts that Truth which flows from the Scriptures, and is revealed to us by the Holy Spirit in them; for herein they let us see that they are backward to give credit to the Supreme Truth God himself. And besides, there is a farther <hi>Tang of Impiety</hi> in this Opinion of theirs, because it bereaves God of the Glory of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99330:63"/>
his Infinite <hi>Power</hi> in reuniting the same bodies to the same souls at the last day: it eclipses the honour of his <hi>Mercy</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding believers in the same flesh wherein they serv'd and worship'd him in this life: it obscures his <hi>Justice</hi> in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing sinners in those very fleshly Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they had here on earth, and wherein they did so much mischief in the world. And lastly, it being such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishment of the doctrine of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> it is to be fear'd it will have too great an influence on the lives and conversations of men. They being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled as to the full belief of this, they will waver in their Faith of the Future State, they will be regardless of that Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Concern, and they will be backward to fit themselves for it. Thus the <hi>Racovian</hi> doctrine is an impediment to Religion, and a nourisher of Vice and Ungodliness.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THIS will be further discover'd in their notion concerning the <hi>Last Judgment:</hi> which, say they, consists not in any <hi>Trial</hi> or <hi>Judging</hi> of the World, in any calling them to <hi>Account,</hi> but only in assigning them their different lots and

                  <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelius</hi> makes no distinction between the <hi>Judging</hi> and <hi>Punishing</hi> of the wicked. The Judg knows who are to be saved, and who to be damn'd, and therefore need not use any Formal Citation, or lay open mens lives. But those who talk thus should remember that human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be exposed at that day, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath not a perfect knowledg of them, but because it is his Pleasure that Men should be acquainted with them, that the Good Actions of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous may be applauded, and that the Evil ones of the unrighteous may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the face of the whole World. That this is the will of God we learn from the Sacred Writ: and where can it be learnt but there? Therefore for these men to Argue, and reason the matter, notwithstanding the express will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, is a sign of a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and irreligious frame of mind. Is not the Transaction of the Last day repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us as a Formal Judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess? Doth not the Scripture speak of the <hi>Judg,</hi> Acts 10. 42. 2 Tim. 4. 8. Heb. 12. 23.

               <p>Further, it is said expresly that then Men <hi>shall give an Account,</hi> viz. of their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> Mat. 12. 36. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Pet. 4. 5. and can any but <hi>Volkelius</hi> imagine that <note n="*" place="bottom">De V. R. l. 3. c. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>this Form of Speech signifies that they shall be punished, if they be guilty of such and such Crimes?</hi> Again, in the Description of the General Resurrection and Last Judgment it is said, <hi>The Books were opened, and the dead were judged out of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99330:65"/>
those things that were written in the books,</hi> Rev. 20. 12. which imports that there shall be a Scanning of their Lives; their Thoughts, words and deeds shall be plainly Discover'd: these as well as the Persons of Men shall <hi>appear</hi> before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, they shall be manifested and laid open. Thus the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Error, as it is repugnant to Good Reason and Common Sense, so it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Holy Book of God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made to us there.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, can there be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gratification (excepting what I shall mention next) to all Atheists than this, that none of their actions shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for? Let men blaspheme, curse God and Man, abjure Religion, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the faithful Professors of it, give themselves up to all manner of Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and Immorality, and live and die in the commission of all that is impious and execrable: yet they shall never hold up their hands for this at the Last Bar, there shall be no particular Account giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or taken of any thing of this nature. Yea, let Men live all their Days in a course of Dissembling, in a mere form of Godliness, in an external Shew of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst they inwardly abhor all that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99330:66"/>
is Good and Vertuous: nay, let them be guilty of the most horrid villanies and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties in secret, let them privily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murder, adultery, incest, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fact is Horrid and Detestable, and let them descend into the grave with the guilt of these upon them, without the least motions of Godly Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; yet be it known to them that they shall never be Examined concerning any of these past actions, no not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most secret of them. Whatever Enormities they have been guilty of here, they shall be passed by in silence hereafter, and never be mention'd to their Shame and reproach.

               <p>The last thing which I propounded to speak of under this Head of my Discourse is the <hi>Punishment</hi> which is awarded at that Final Close of the world.

and never to be any more.

               <p>It is certain that this is a doctrine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow'd of by the Church of Christ in all ages, and therefore disallow'd because re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to those discoveries of God's will which we have in the infallible Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Evangelists and Apostles.

And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99330:68"/>
must it not be the same if it be Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? This makes the punishment of all Equal, for one can't be more Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated than another, and consequently it can't be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </gap> that life for ever, that thereby they may suffer that Torment which they deserve for their Sins, then we may understand what our Saviour saith, then we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how it shall be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for some than others at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that is, the Misery of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned shall be proportion'd to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Crimes, they shall be punish'd according to the Heinousness of their Enormities <hi>mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</hi> But there can be no such thing as this, if there be an utter <hi>Extinction</hi> of the wicked at the last day; If their very <hi>persons</hi> perish, they are uncapable of any Punishment; and if that be true, it can't be said it shall be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for one than another, which yet is the determination of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself.</p>
               <p>Again, is it reasonable to believe that the Reprobate shall perish and be extinct when the Holy Scriptures assure us that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99330:68"/>
                  <hi>they shall be cast into everlasting fire?</hi> Mat. 18. 8. which is call'd <hi>Hell-fire</hi> in the next verse; and when we are ascertain'd they shall at the last day <hi>depart into everlasting fire,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. which in the last verse of that chapter is call'd <hi>everlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Is it the meaning of this Direful Doom that they shall cease to be; and sink into Nothing? Is it the punishment of the Cursed at that day that they shall be void of all sense of pain and misery, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they shall be uncapable of any Punishment? yes, this is the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Socinians</hi> put upon the words. Particularly <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. Frantz. disp. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Smalcius</hi> and <note n="†" place="bottom">Comment. in 1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> urge this notion of <hi>Everlasting Fire,</hi> and make it to be of the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication with Eternal Perdition, Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Annihilation. But how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly is this done, when this <hi>Everlasting Fire,</hi> to confirm us in the belief of the Endless Perpetuity of it, is in other places of the Gospel term'd <hi>Unquenchable fire,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. and in <note n="‖" place="bottom">43, 44, 45, 46, 48.</note> five verses (which is exceeding remarkable) in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. it is call'd <hi>the fire that is not quenched,</hi> and <hi>that never shall be quenched.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:99330:69"/>
I argue then thus, That Fire which is <hi>unquenchable,</hi> which shall never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd is of Endless duration: but Hell-fire is such, therefore it is of endless duration. It is impossible to withstand the force of this Argument. I do not say it is impossible for a Whiffling Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter, one that delights in Cavelling, to raise an Objection against it, for what Truth is there (though never so Great) which the Wit and Sophistry of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heads cannot suggest something against? But this I say, it is impossible that any one who is serious and in good earnest, and hath a reverence for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures should not acknowledg that the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the Infernal Torments is fully declared and confirmed by this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said expression of <hi>Unquenchable Fin.</hi> And we are to reckon all the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Texts as so many different and distinct Proofs of the <hi>eternal</hi> duration of that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which the wicked shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>
               <p>And this is call'd not only <hi>fire that is not,</hi> and <hi>shall not be quench'd,</hi> but <hi>the Worm that dies not,</hi> Mark 9. 44, 46. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any shew of sense or reason be synonymous with <hi>Annihilation.</hi> Shall these men then be call'd <hi>Rational</hi> (tho
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99330:69"/>
I know none call them so but themselves and their Admirers) who assert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Do they not shew themselves Masters of Great <hi>Reason</hi> when they tell us that <hi>the Worm which dies not,</hi> is that <hi>which utterly ceases to be,</hi> when they hold that <hi>not to be at all</hi> is <hi>being in everlasting fire or punishment?</hi> Those that can assent to these Propositions are <hi>Reasonable</hi> Men indeed: Yes, in their own esteem, but not otherwise. Whence perhaps it was that <hi>Volkelius</hi> (who in other matters sticks close to the <hi>Racovians)</hi> by reason of the gross Inconsistency of this Opinion was offended at it, as appears from <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s <hi>Sixth Epistle</hi> to him: and we do not find in his Writings (as is noted by <note n="*" place="bottom">On the 11th. Article of the Creed.</note> Bishop <hi>Pearson)</hi> that he ever assented to it.</p>
               <p>I might alledg 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, a place which not only shews that the <hi>same body rises</hi> (for which I made mention of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but also that the wicked shall be punish'd afterwards in their bodies, for the <hi>receiving the things in their bodies</hi> (the word <hi>done</hi> being not in the Original, nor need it be in the Translation) is their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dealt with in way of <hi>Punishment</hi> or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99330:70"/>
                  <hi>Reward</hi> as to their bodies, which cannot be unless they subsist both in body and soul, to endure that Punishment, or to enjoy that Reward. This I conceive is very clear, and it is impossible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with their being reduced to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with their perishing for ever.</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>Objected</hi> that in the Scripture it is often said of the Wicked, that they shall be <hi>destroyed,</hi> they shall <hi>perish,</hi> they shall <hi>die,</hi> which is as much as to say, they shall be Annihilated, they shall be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Essence. I Answer briefly, they mistake the meaning of those expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, for it is plain and manifest from what hath been premised that these terms, <hi>destruction, perdition, death</hi> denote not the Privation of Existence, but of the former state and condition which they were in, and their Changing it for one that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Miserable. To an unprejudiced and discerning eye, and that attends to the Stile of Scripture, it is evident that these expressions signifie the utter Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the damned from God; and the undergoing of his Wrath to eternity; and consequently they imply Pain and Torment, yea the never-ceasing inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them unto endless ages. This is that which is meant by the <hi>second death</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:99330:70"/>
threatned to the Wicked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14, 15. 21. 8. for in those places we find that <hi>the lake of Fire</hi> and <hi>the second death</hi> are sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous, which shews that the <hi>death</hi> of the Damned is no other than their Everlasting Punishment, their being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the flames of the <hi>everlasting fire</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this, the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> persist in their Opinion, and flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Perpetuity of Hell-Torments. Which is that which the <hi>Atheist</hi> would have, that which he constantly professes as his belief, that after death the Soul perishes; or if it chances to hold out in its Subsistence some time, yet at last it will vanish into a Non-entity. There cannot be a more Pernicious Doctrine than this, for first it diminishes the Guilt of Sin, as if it did not deserve Eternal Torments, as if these were above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of the Greatest Sins and Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for so the <hi>Racovian</hi> Writers speak. Again, this gives Men occasion to deny the Wisdom and Justice of God, which is a considerable Step to Atheism.

               <p>Moreover, this encourages men in the commission of Sin, for they chear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with this that they shall presently have an end of their Misery, there shall be a speedy release from their Pains, their Torments (if there be any) shall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have an end, for they are told by <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s disciples that <hi>Everlasting Fire</hi> wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Indeed such an Inference from the Doctrine is genuine, and no other could be expected to be made by these persons. Wherefore as long as the Premises are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, we must look for no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. It is true, it hath happen'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99330:71"/>
sometimes that their own Principles and Maxims have not had an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them in their Acting, they do not follow the natural conduct of them. But this is certain, the nature of their principles promotes a vicious life: these are in themselves apt to excite men to all sin and wickedness. As on the contrary, the belief of the Endless Punishment which is denounced against Impenitent Sinners quickens men in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is an Effectual Motive to them to forsake their Sins, is a Powerful Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the performance of all Christian Offices, and whatever is pleasing unto God. Take away this, and what a Damp is there to Vertue and Religion? Shall the worst and vilest men live here in splendor and in a fruition of all things according to their hearts desire, and shall they afterwards meet with no Penalty for all their cursed actions? Must they only be deprived of their beings, and at the same time of the sense of all that is painful or hurtful? In short, shall they neither be punish'd here, nor hereafter? Or is this all their Punishment, not to suffer any? Then <hi>Hell</hi> is but a Fable (as some of the Poets represented it,) then <hi>Damnation</hi> is but a Fiction. And who will not add,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99330:72"/>
that this is the high Road to <hi>Atheism?</hi> These are the things that make <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> so plausible at this day, this makes all men of Atheistical Principles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Lives cry it up, for it quenches the flames of Hell-Fire, which men have been so much affrighted with.</p>
               <p>Hence we may guess that <hi>Racovianism</hi> will be a Fashionable Doctrine, if there be no Check put to it. It is no wonder that so many persons favour it, that those who defend it are Applauded. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this is plain, They present them with such a Scheme of Religion (for it is likely they'll call it so) as is grateful to their Vicious Inclinations, and assures them of Impunity after all the most hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and enormous actions of their lives. These men truly are to be pitied, for they can discourse and argue very well if they please; some of them have a good Talent that way, only they abuse it. They are great Admirers of Reason, and yet they are so far misled as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe such an irrational and groundless notion as this, that not only the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but the souls of all the Wicked shall perish and be annihilated. Some of the Wise <hi>Pagans</hi> express'd their belief of the Immortal State even of the <hi>Worst</hi>

I will take notice here of three of them: The first is an Assertion lately vented, or rather lately furbush'd up, and in some formality presented to the world by one that is a Well-willer to the <hi>Racovian</hi> way. I mean Mr. <hi>Lock:</hi> for now it is the Catholick belief and vogue of his very Friends and Favourers that he is the Author of the late Treatise concerning <hi>the Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> And seeing his own Friends and Admirers call it by <hi>his name,</hi> I hope it is no offence in me to do so. The Summ of it is this, that <hi>in all the books of the</hi> NEW TESTAMENT <hi>there is but One Single
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99330:73"/>
Article of Christian Faith necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to be believed and assented to by us: and this Article is no other than this, that</hi> JESUS IS THE MESSIAS. I have elsewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this to be a <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine: and it is well known that a <hi>Professed Unitarian</hi> (of a considerable standing in the world) hath publickly asserted this Proposition <hi>in terminis,</hi> and hath labour'd to defend it, and dedicates his undertakings to Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi> They both confidently aver that the sole believing of this constitutes a Christian, and a Member of Christ; and there is no necessity, in order to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that any thing more should be the object of our belief. This is the doctrine which they industriously maintain: but how Unreasonable and Groundless it is, I have made evident in another place (to which I refer the Reader) where I have shew'd that this is one way to extirpate the Christian Religion out of the world, and to introduce Infidelity. Only at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I insert it here to make up the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Farce.</hi> It was not proper to leave it out of the <hi>Rhapsody of Heretical Opinions</hi> which those men are Professors of. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoken so largly of it already. I will now only make two or three Reflections on it and its Author, and so dismiss it.</p>

It may be observ'd that <note n="*" place="bottom">In his Treatise of <hi>Humane Understanding,</hi> book 1.</note> he began first to deny the <hi>Natural Notions and Principles</hi> that Mens Minds furnish them with: and this was an Introduction to his late enterprize. He by no means allows of <hi>Connate Idea's,</hi> those Treasuries of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledg. It is remarkable that he that is so much against the <hi>Scholastick Way,</hi> and <hi>Systems,</hi> yet maintains the Old Maxim of the <hi>Schools,</hi> that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is a mere Blank, with nothing written in it. Where it might be noted further that herein he exactly agrees with <note n="†" place="bottom">Praelect. cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Socinus,</hi> whose words I quoted before. Though these <hi>Natural Impressions</hi> in all mens minds are the foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Standard of Truth as well as of Morality, yet he wholly renounces them. But if this Gentleman had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Socinus</hi> in nothing but this, or matters of the like nature, I should never have mention'd it, for though it is my perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that there are these Innate Notices and Idea's in humane souls, yet I censure no man for his mere dissenting from me in this Speculative Point. That which I only observe now is that from his laying
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99330:74"/>
aside those <hi>Natural Principles</hi> he proceeds to slight the <hi>Christian ones,</hi> to curtail the Articles of our <hi>Faith,</hi> to ravish <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> it self from us.</p>
               <p>And whereas he tells us he designed his Book for <hi>Novices</hi> and <hi>Weak Christians,</hi> he cannot but be ashamed of such an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for whether Christians be weak or strong, the Necessary and Indispensable doctrines of Christianity must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from them, much less must they be denied for their sake. This were to make a <hi>Double Christianity,</hi> which is a strong and unaccountable representation of it, not unlike the Conceit of some <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Doctors, who say there is a <hi>Messias</hi> the Son of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and a <hi>Messias</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> a humble and poor <hi>Messias,</hi> and a glorious or pompous one. Surely the Gentleman cannot forbear blushing at such pitiful Inventions as these, which are so like his own. I know nothing can excuse him but what his own Pen hath suggested in another place, where he cries out <note n="*" place="bottom">Essay of Humane Understanding, book 4. chap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Is there any thing so extravagant as the imaginations of men's brains? where is the head that hath no Chimaera's in it?</hi>

Here I would observe likewise what sort of people admire his Notions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his late enterprize about <hi>One Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Christianity only.</hi> There is very much to be gathered from this, <hi>viz.</hi> what kind of persons are eager to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Sentiments, and to commend them to the world.

This Great Figure compounds for those Cyphers. Wherefore in a religious fit

(as it were) he <hi>blesses God</hi> for this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> and professes he finds it <hi>an evidence that he is not able to resist,</hi> because (poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) he is not willing.

                  <hi>Nothing but this alone, namely that [Jesus Christ is the Messias] is required absolutely to denote and characterize a man a Christian.</hi> And this Zealous Proselyte adds further that all are <hi>Sectaries</hi> that offer other notions than Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath in that book, that <hi>draught of Christianity,</hi> as he calls it. Thus we see who are Mr. <hi>Lock's</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Deism</hi> and an <hi>Antipathy against Priests (i. e.</hi> all Professed Ministers and Guides in Religion) are necessary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in order to being his Converts.</p>

               <p>I am apt to think well of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himself who was the Collector of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> but I pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty him for his unhappy choice of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his more unhappy and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less defending it, wherein he strains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Reason and Conscience, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99330:76"/>
his Cause: otherwise he would not have used such Arguments as he doth, and repeated them. He had got some credit by his former attempts concerning <hi>Humane Understanding</hi> and <hi>Education;</hi> and now his Name being up, he is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempted to shew his Parts, and to discover his great antipathy against <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems,</hi> which he every where strikes at; the design of which is to establish one of his own, or to foster <hi>Scepticism</hi> by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down all others. He unfortunately ingages in a Province above his capacity, and boldly attempting to correct and amend <hi>Christianity,</hi> overthrows it. He makes our <hi>Saviour</hi> a Coward, he turns the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> into wast pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he perverts the plain words of the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and he misrepresents and doubts of the most <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of the Christian Religion. One would wonder that such wild conceptions should possess any thinking head. It is strange that any serious man can believe these things, and frame such thoughts of Christianity. It is true, the Fundamental Articles of our Belief are few; but there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>a few</hi> and but <hi>one only,</hi> which is the thing that this Writer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, even with the hazard of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99330:77"/>
and the forfeiture of his formerly acquired reputation.</p>
               <p>But he and his Friends (the <hi>One-Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle-men)</hi> seem to have made Satisfaction by their profound Silence lately, whereby they acknowledg to the world that they have Nothing to say in reply to what I lately laid to their charge, and fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against them, both with relation to this Gentleman in particular, and to the Professed <hi>Socinians</hi> in common. Some of them faintly give out that I have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Mr. <hi>Lock;</hi> If so, then they would oblige the world by shewing the Mistake, and letting men see wherein and in what instances I have misapprehended his sense and meaning. He that pretends to bear such a Love to the <hi>bulk of mankind,</hi> should now shew it: and so he would, if he could. If their case had not been desperate, I should have heard from them before this, for 'tis well known that our <hi>Modern Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> court all opportunities of setting the Press on work. And they had time to do it before his Majesty's <hi>Injunctions</hi> were publish'd: not to say, that some of them have ventured to the Press since. Besides, these <hi>Injunctions,</hi> I conceive, debar them not not from clearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (if they could) from those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99330:77"/>
Objections and Exceptions which have been made against their Assertions. Wherefore I take it to be an unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble verity, that these men, who were voted such Champions by the Party, are vanquished, and that they <hi>have not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered</hi> because they <hi>could not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But from all hands I hear that their more retired language and countenances speak their extraordinary disturbance and disorder of Mind. It is observed that some of them cannot conceal their great Regret and Passion, but in a Raving Manner express their dislike of what I have writ. Which I take to be an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Argument that they are baffled, that they are wounded under the fifth rib. For they having no supports from Reason and Arguments, therefore they fly to down-right Raillery. Thus they let their Cause die, because they cannot keep it alive. And indeed, as it is observ'd of less perfect Animals, which are hastily form'd and produced, that they are short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived; so fares it with Opinions that are defective and imperfect, and found out of a sudden, they are generally exploded in a short time, and scarcely survive their Chief Authors.

and Maim'd Opinion about <hi>One Article:</hi> this Mushrom Notion that hath no root and foundation, will soon decay and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Another Dangerous Notion relating to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is, that every thing in it is to be submitted to the exactness of <hi>Reason,</hi> and what will not bear that Test, is no part of Christianity. <hi>Socinianism</hi> was first of all founded on this basis, this was the main thing that was insisted upon. <hi>Socinus</hi> makes it his business to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the doctrines of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Christ's Satisfaction,</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. by force of Reason. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are to be required in all things that concern our Salvation,</hi> saith <note n="*" place="bottom">Refut. lib. de Verbo Incarnato. cap. 3.</note>

They can evade plain places of Scripture, they can overturn the foundations of Religion, they can settle their own Opinions, they can impose upon the belief of mankind by this one Artifice.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99330:78"/>
and Truths of Christianity to it. When the Trinitarians assert the doctrine of Christ's Divinity, when they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Incarnation of the Son of God, when they affirm that there are Three Personalities or Subsistencies in the Deity, and when they profess their assent to other the like Articles of the Christian Faith, they are cried out against because they are <hi>not level to humane conceptions, no Idea can be formed of them,</hi> they <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our Natural Notions;</hi> and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alone they are laid aside by them as <hi>Contradictions, Absurdities, Impossibilities, Pure Non-sense,</hi> for so they are wont to express themselves in their late Writings. They boast that <note n="*" place="bottom">History of the Unitarians, pag. 24.</note>

               <p>I thought fit to add these passages (out of their Modern Prints) to those which I had occasion to mention before in my <hi>Discourse concerning the Causes of Atheism,</hi> that it may appear, whatever the Late Unitarians pretend, that they own this Maxim, that every thing in Religion is to be submitted to the searches of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But certainly this is a Principle that destroys <hi>Christianity,</hi> for a great part of this is founded on mere Revelation, and the discoveries of God's will which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend our reasonings: and therefore it is a vanity to think that Reason must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all in the Christian Religion. It is true, Natural Reason was placed in us by Him who is the Father of Lights, and we must not attempt to extinguish it: but neither must this Candle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to take upon it the office of the Sun, to act beyond its proper strength and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99330:79"/>
power. <hi>Reason</hi> is like the <hi>Rule</hi> with which we measure things: to know the length or breadth of them we apply the Rule to them, and so find out the just di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of them. But then we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to measure <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are of a certain length and breadth, such as our Rule will serve to measure: else there is no use of the Rule. In a resembling sort, what we would measure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by the Rule of Reason must be Finite, <hi>i. e.</hi> proportioned to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The things which are Infinite and Immense are not to be measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Scanty Rule; such are the Divine Nature, the Sacred Trinity, the Union of God and Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Reason must act according to its due Measures, and be employed according to the Strengths which are allow'd it. It must not determine in those things which are not of its cognizance, and such are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and Divine Mysteries. There are no Demonstrative Arguments in things of this nature, neither are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. We are to acquiesce in God's Word: that is sufficient Reason. And accordingly all the Great and Wise Men of this age, (as well as of former ones) all persons of the most penetrating judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99330:80"/>
of the most extraordinary sagacity rest in this, and are satisfied. But the New Disciples of <hi>Socinus</hi> pretend to be men of greater sense and understanding, and demand of us to make out every thing in the Christian Religion, even the profoundest matters of it, by strict rules of Reason and Logick. Thus (as I had occasion not long since to observe) they joyn with the <hi>Deists</hi> to root out Christianity, and use the same methods and art that they do. They irrationally extol humane Reason, and extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose it to Reveal'd Religion, so as to exclude this latter, and to vilifie the Author of it. And thus it will appear at last that <hi>Atheism</hi> lurks under the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name of <hi>Deism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This very Notion of the excessive sway of Natural Reason in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath had a great and malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon some Others, who are not <hi>Profess'd Socinians,</hi> as a <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> of Apostacy.</note> Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (though of a different perswasion from the <hi>Church of England)</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <q>In pursuit (saith he) of the same Principles with those of the men of this way, not a few begin absolutely
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99330:80"/>
to submit the Scripture and every thing contain'd in it to the judgment and sentence of their own Reason, which is the true Form and Spirit of <hi>Socinianism</hi> visibly acting it self with some more than ordinary confidence. What is suited unto their Reason they will receive; and what is not so, let it be affirmed an hundred times in the Scripture, they will reject with the same ease and confidence as if they were <hi>Imaginations</hi> of men like themselves. Both <hi>books</hi> that are written to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and the common <hi>discourses</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do fully testifie this advance of the Pride of the minds of men. And he is careless about these things who seeth not, that the next Stage is downright <hi>Atheism.</hi> This is that Dunghil which such blazing exhalations of Pride at last fall into.</q> It seems there are Others, besides me, that have had an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that <hi>Socinianism</hi> tends directly to <hi>Atheism.</hi>

               <p>But see the mighty Prevalency of Truth! It will forcibly make its way, even from the mouths of its professed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. The <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Socinians</hi> (as you heard before) agreed in this that <hi>Reason</hi> is the sole Judg in matters of

Faith, and that what is <hi>above Reason</hi> is not the object of our belief.

The Third Beloved Conceit of theirs concerning <hi>Christianity</hi> is, that there are no <hi>Mysteries</hi> in it. Which indeed follows upon the former Opinion, for if nothing is to be believ'd in the Christian Religion but what is made out by Exact Reason, then there is nothing Mystical and Obscure in it. This is a Point mightily urg'd of late by our homebred <hi>Racovians</hi> and their Adherents, who have publish'd a small Essay entituled [An Impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the word <hi>Mystery</hi> as it is taken in the Holy Scripture,] where they cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tell us that MYSTERY <hi>is the Tutelar God of the New Systems framed by Worldly Christians:</hi> and it is <hi>the Vail of Absurdities,</hi> and such like foolish representations they make of it; and think themselves very Witty and Piquant when they call the Trinitarians <hi>Mystery-men,</hi> as doth the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer</hi> of the <hi>Exceptions</hi> against Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s <hi>Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. But (which is far worse) they pervert the meaning of the Sacred Writ, and wilfully (I fear) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the word <hi>Mystery</hi> otherwise than it is used in the New Testament, of which I hope to give the Reader an account some other time, and to settle the true sense and import of the word as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in those Holy Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:99330:82"/>
All that I will say at present is that True and Substantial Reason informs us, if we attend to it, that God's bare Word is sufficient to determine our assent and belief: and the Holy Scriptures acquaint us that there are Unsearchable <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 13. 11. 1 Cor. 2. 7. Eph. 6. 19. Col. 2. 2. 1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Mysteries</hi> in the Christian Religion; that there is <hi>hidden wisdom,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. that there are <hi>deep things of God,</hi> v. 10. that there are <hi>things hard to be understood,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. that <hi>we know in part, and see through a glass darkly,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. All which, and many other passages in Sacred Writ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us that there are Unfathomable Depths, Unconceivable Abstrusities in Christianity, and that it is out of our ken and reach to apprehend them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are obliged to believe some things which are unaccountable to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and reason. Yea indeed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter of Faith are those things which we cannot have any notice of by the mere natural exercise of our faculties. <hi>Revelation</hi> here is enough, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and we ought (and that with the greatest <hi>Reason)</hi> to depend upon it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, because we know it is Infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99330:83"/>
But because I intend at another time to insist particularly on the proof of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that <hi>Christianity not only was, but is a Great Mystery,</hi> I will not prevent my self here. Let it only suffice at present that I have caution'd the Reader against our Adversary's groundless Assertion, that there is nothing dark and obscure in the Christian doctrines, that there is no such thing as <hi>Mystery</hi> in any of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles belonging to this Holy Institution. They pretend to oblige the world by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging and laying all open to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Others are dark, intricate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd and muddy, but they only are the Authors that are Clear and Bright, and write with shining <hi>Japan</hi> Ink. In brief, they and the <hi>Deists</hi> talk much of <hi>the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reason,</hi> and brag of their making all things out by these, though general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they prove as vain and idle as the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Etymologists,</hi> and the common <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale's</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Service and Rites.</p>
               <p>But here perhaps it will be <hi>Objected</hi> that I have in this and the foregoing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar misrepresented these men, for it will be said that in one of their Writings it is positively asserted that <note n="*" place="bottom">An Impartial Account of the word <hi>Mystery, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>there are some
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99330:83"/>
Mysteries and incomprehensible Secrets in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> To which I answer, This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor explains his meaning afterwards, and thereby shews what he holds, for this is one of his Propositions, that <hi>we must not give the name of Mystery to those doctrines which are contrary to the light of Nature or Reason,</hi> and he means by these doctrines all those Divine Truths in the Gospel which are <hi>above</hi> our Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and which we cannot comprehend and discern by the light of Nature; and so it appears that this Writer, though he seems to allow of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> yet in reality he disowns them, which is no infrequent thing with them.</p>
               <p>But it will be said that another of their Authors is of opinion that <note n="*" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications of the doctrine of the Trinity.</note> 
                  <hi>there are some things to be believed which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</hi> I answer 1. Whatever he and some of late assert, it is certain that it was a receiv'd and acknowledg'd opinion among the <hi>Socinians</hi> heretofore that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be believed but what we can comprehend. It was a Standing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with them all, Not to admit any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle into their Creed but what they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99330:84"/>
could make out by exact Reason; and therefore it is well known that they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doctrine of the Trinity and other Great Articles of the Christian Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not fathom them by Reason. This was the approved Notion in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s days, and in <hi>Crellius</hi>'s (as hath been shew'd in another place). 2. I answer that this very Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that place where he throws off this Old Socinian doctrine, takes it up again, and falls to proving that there is nothing in Religion, be it never so high, but may be comprehended; he is so bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident as to say that we have <hi>as clear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and adequate a conception of what is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Unbounded as of a spire of Grass,</hi> and that the nature of one is as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible as the other. 3. I add this, that though this Writer and some others of the Party endeavour at other times to shift off that foresaid Principle, yet it is plain that it is <hi>Good Socinianism</hi> at this very day, as I have proved from some express <note n="*" place="bottom">Some Thoughts concerning the Causes of Atheism p. 71, 72.</note> quotations out of the Writings of the <hi>New English Racovians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99330:84"/>
But it will be said again, that the same Author tells us that the men of his Party <hi>deny the Articles of the Trinity and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not because they are My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, or because they do not comprehend them, but because they are Contradictions, Impossibilities, and pure Non-sense.</hi> But who sees not that <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> &amp;c. are the same with these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and that therefore they call them by that former name, because (as they would make us believe) they can't comprehend them, they have <hi>no idea, no notion</hi> of them (as they speak at other times:) and what is this but to say, They are <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries?</hi> only they choose to cloth it in a more bold and prophane sort of language, calling them <hi>Non-sense, Contradictions,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it is evident that they impose upon the world, and whilst they cry out of <hi>Contradictions,</hi> are guilty of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and whilst they make a shew of believing some things <hi>above Reason,</hi> are really of another perswasion. It is plain then that it is their business to lift up <hi>Reason,</hi> so as to depress <hi>Christianity:</hi> it is to be fear'd that some of them are very eager against <hi>Mysteries,</hi> thereby to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate that which is deservedly stiled by the Apostle <hi>the Mystery of Godliness:</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99330:85"/>
they are inraged against the main branch of it; <hi>God manifest in the flesh.</hi> One who is no Over-valuer of Mysteries, no not of that he treats of, tells us that <note n="*" place="bottom">Some Considerations concerning the Trinity. p. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>he hath no small reason to believe there are several who strike at Christianity it self, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of bringing down the value of Mysteries:</hi> much more than by the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right denying of all Mysteries in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. By this <hi>Polonian</hi> Stratagem they undermine all Religion, yea, the Being, Nature and Attributes of God himself, which contain great Abstrusities, depths, and mysteries in them: and so in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this their Opinion which they so warmly defend and stickle for there is a strong biass to <hi>Atheism.</hi>

of<hi> other </hi>parts of Christianity.<hi> Water-Baptism </hi>(as they call it) is voted by them to be unlawful. Yet they hold it not unlawful to retain the practice of it in the Church. This argues a Double Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                  <hi>It is possible for a created being to be equal to God, nor doth it imply any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and absurdity, yea it is most worthy of God: and consequently the power of a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated thing may be equal to that of God, and so there is no infinite disproportion between the power of God and the power of a creature.</hi> These are the Extravagancies he runs himself into.

And a <note n="*" place="bottom">Christianity not Mysterious.</note> late Writer who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knows what the <hi>Socinians</hi> are, and what they hold, finds fault with them for this at least, that <hi>they worship a Creature-God,</hi> which he condemns (and that justly) as not reconcileable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

                  <q>That our Lord Christ is to be worship'd, was never made a question by the Unitarians. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is concerning the kind or sort of Worship: Trinitarians say, he is to be worship'd as God: we say, he is to be worship'd as one whom <hi>God hath exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Priest and a Saviour,</hi> one whom <hi>God hath given to be head over all things to the Church.</hi>
                  </q> This distinction is to no purpose, for even the <hi>New Socinians</hi> hold that Christ is <hi>God</hi> (and they will not stick to say, <hi>truly God)</hi> as he is <hi>thus exalted,</hi> and as he is <hi>the Head over all things;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99330:89"/>
according to them he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd <hi>as he is truly God.</hi> This is very plain, and though they may make use of their shifts and subterfuges to evade it, yet any Discerning Man may discover the vanity of their attempt. An <note n="*" place="bottom">Of Worshiping the Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>the Father hath given Christ authority and dominion which makes him a fit object of worship.</hi> This is the same that the other Gentleman said, he is made a <hi>God</hi> by his being <hi>exalted;</hi> by his being <hi>Head over all things</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a <hi>God,</hi> and is truly so, and as such is to be worship'd by all Christian Men. Thus the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Socinians</hi> agree, though these latter pretend to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the former about this Point.</p>
               <p>I will here add what an <note n="‖" place="bottom">A Confession of Faith touching the Holy Trinity according to the Scriptures, p. 12.</note> other of their Moderns saith, <hi>Christ is our God by reason of his Divine Sovereignty over us, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to such Sovereignty.</hi> They are the very words of one of the late Prints, which was first extant in the year 1648, but was reprinted in 1691, and therefore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99330:90"/>
vouch'd by this present Set of Socinians. Their reprinting it is a plain owning of it, and yet they say they have not been of this Opinion these <hi>seven years.</hi> It seems these men are not acquainted with their own Authors, and know not what their own People say. It was unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said that they had not, for so long a time professed a Parity of Worship due to the Father and the Son, for it is evident that they in effect own it. But from that saying of theirs they would hint this, that once in <hi>seven years</hi> or thereabouts <hi>Socinianism</hi> changes, and we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some new discoveries. This is to prepare us against the next Climacteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Year of it, when it is likely they will agree to present us with more refined noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the <hi>Worshiping of Christ.</hi> For truly this which comes down from the <hi>Old Unitarians</hi> is very gross and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.</p>
               <p>It is very strange and surprizing that Persons who lay claim to a greater share of <hi>Reason</hi> than the rest of mankind, should assert that a <hi>Creature</hi> is the proper object of Divine Adoration, that Christ is to be worship'd with Sacred and Religious Worship, and yet that he is not a God. These are unaccountable Positions, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99330:90"/>
such as destroy the very nature of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for God is to be worship'd because of his Transcendent Nature, which is such that no Creature, no Finite being hath it communicated to it. This makes God the sole object of Divine Worship; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shalt thou serve.</hi> It is express'd <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively:</hi> therefore a mere man cannot be exalted to the honour and worship which are due <hi>only</hi> to God. And consequently the foregoing Assertions null the nature of God, and make the Creatures equal with him. We find that when <hi>Cornelius fell down at Peter's feet and worship'd him, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter took him up, saying, Stand up, I my self also am a Man,</hi> Acts 10. 25, 26. Which one place vacates all their Adoration of Christ, for if <hi>Peter</hi> would not let <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> worship him because he was but a <hi>Man,</hi> as himself was, then neither ought any one to worship <hi>Christ</hi> if he be but a <hi>Man.</hi> The Reason is the fame here that it was there. Or if he had an <hi>Angelick</hi> Nature, that doth not make him capable of being worship'd, for as St. <hi>Peter</hi> forbids <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> so the <hi>Angel</hi> would not suffer St. <hi>John</hi> to give this Divine Honour to him: <hi>See that thou doest it not,</hi> Rev. 19. 10.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99330:91"/>
Though he was God's Minister and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, and was a <hi>God</hi> in the very same sense that these men say <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> yet he was not to be worship'd. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears hence that <hi>Adoration</hi> is founded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and that what is but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Angelical is not Adorable.</p>
               <p>Are these the men that talk and write against the <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as that of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans?</hi> Yes, some of them have done so, but can it be believed that it was in good earnest, when it is one of their Grand Articles that the Divine Honour which is due to God may be derived to another who is not God? According to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple neither Pagan nor Popish Idolatry can be condemned, nay they must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of. If Creatures may have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Adoration given them, then <hi>Angels and Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Images</hi> of these latter may be adored, which is the doctrine and practice of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and then that Text, <hi>I will not give my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to another,</hi> Isa. 42. 8, which all the <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers make use of against the <hi>Papists</hi> to prove their foresaid practice unlawful, is to no purpose. And why then do the persons I am speaking of, whilst they follow the Example of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99330:91"/>
                  <hi>Romanists,</hi> seem to condemn them? They give Divine Worship to one whom they acknowledg not to be <hi>God,</hi> strictly and properly speaking: and the <hi>Papists</hi> do no other. These may as well adore the Saints and Angels as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do Christ, if he be but a fellow-creature, as they assert him to be. This was the sense of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> who charg'd the <hi>Arians</hi> with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And there is the same, nay greater reason (as I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily demonstrate, because the <hi>Arians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted the nature of Christ to a higher pitch) to tax <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers with this Crime, seeing they assert and defend the giving of Divine Worship to <hi>Christ,</hi> though he be not <hi>God, i. e.</hi> the Infinite Eternal Omnipotent Being, but only a <hi>God</hi> by Office and Institution, by Place and Dignity, as <hi>Kings</hi> are said to be <hi>Gods.</hi> It is plain then that whilst the Socinians stigmatize the <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> they cannot shift off the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> themselves: for how that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which is peculiar to God can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Creature <hi>(i. e.</hi> one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be so) and yet no <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> be committed, is impossible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. Wherefore we conclude that the Socinian Worshipers are Idolaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:99330:92"/>
This is another proof of their justly lying under the imputation of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> yea and such as is mix'd with those <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> that can never be enough explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. They first deny Christ to be God, and then they pay the Adoration to him which is due only to God. They abjure his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and degrade him into the state of a Creature; and then, to make amends as it were, worship him as a Creator. They destroy his Deity, and then think to repair it by this means. <hi>Orestes</hi> was not half so wild when he kill'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> and then celebrated a Feast in her honour. What strange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is this, to reckon our Saviour as a Fictitious God, and yet to pretend to venerate him as a True one? One would scarcely imagine that such Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies should be entertain'd by men that boast of their faculty of Reasoning. But they having once admitted so Great an Error as the denial of Christ's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is no wonder that they plunge themselves into innumerable others, it is no wonder that they run themselves into <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self, that most hateful and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Enormity, that worst of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanations, which by degrees will extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the notion of the True God, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99330:92"/>
bring in direct Atheism. Surely then here is more than a smack of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> more than an <hi>Atheistick</hi> Tincture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> is an eminent act and part of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under this <hi>Second General Head</hi> of my Discourse, where I treat of <hi>Worship,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what thoughts the Gentlemen have concerning this. They are agreed that <hi>the First Table of the</hi> DECALOGUE, <hi>which prescribes the Worship of God, requires not</hi> PRAYER, <hi>and that in no part of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament this act of Worship is mention'd as a Duty, but that it was added afterwards by Christ, and not till then.</hi> These are the express terms of <note n="*" place="bottom">Explicat cap. 5.

                  <hi>Socinus,</hi> of <note n="†" place="bottom">De V. R. l. 4. c. 9.</note>

                  <hi>Racovian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism.</hi> But can any man that forms right thoughts concerning the <hi>Jewish Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi> of which God was the immediate Author, think that it contain'd not in it the Precept of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is so natural a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Worship? Was not that First Commandment <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> and that Comment upon it <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve

him,</hi> Deut. 6. 13. a General Precept for God's Worship, and can any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is so signal a part of it, and appropriated only to God (though it seems the <hi>Socinians</hi> are not of that mind) is not comprehended in it? Can we think it is not necessarily included, though it be not expressed? Nay, Who can imagine that there were not Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Plain Injunctions for Praying when the Publick Worship of the Jews and their Sacrificing was always attended with this part of Devotion? as is clear from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 19. 7. 12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 10. But they will say, their meaning is that there is no <hi>Express</hi> Command for Praying in the Old Testament. If this be it that they mean, then lo an Express Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> Here is not only <hi>Invocation</hi> but <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> or Praising of God (which is an other part of <hi>Prayer)</hi> in plain and explicit terms commanded.</p>
               <p>But have they nothing to reply? Yes, for they never want some Evasion. But certainly there never was any so silly, so impertinent, so foreign as that which one of their Great Penmen makes use of. <note n="*" place="bottom">Volkel. de V. R. l. 4. c. 9.</note> He
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99330:93"/>
flies to <hi>Socinus's</hi> (I might have said to <hi>Bellarmine's)</hi> distinction of <hi>Counsels</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> and hath the boldness to tell us that these words of the Psalmist, or rather indeed of God himself, are only a <hi>Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> or <hi>Counsel,</hi> but not a <hi>Command.</hi> You will think, I suppose, he was put hard to it when he was forced to give such an answer as this, which is not only found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Gross Conceit of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> but is no way applicable to the present purpose, for the foresaid words concern all men at one time or other, but <hi>Counsels</hi> have respect only to some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and some peculiar emergencies. It is true, this Author adds concerning this passage of the Psalmist, that if it be not admitted that it contains a <hi>Counsel</hi> only, then he is willing to grant that a <hi>Command</hi> is comprehended in it, but with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso, that the Command <hi>be not counted Equal with the other Precepts contain'd in the Law.</hi> Which is as bad an Exposition as the former, and shews what sorry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions they have concerning the Great and Solemn Office of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as if this were not of equal importance with the rest of the Precepts of the Law, or (which is yet worse, and yet is implied in his words) that some Precepts of the Divine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99330:94"/>
Law comprised in Holy Scripture are to be observ'd, but others may be dispens'd with, as not being of equal Authority with the rest. This favours of <hi>Impiety</hi> as well as the other Evasion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
               <p>But let us hear what Other Reasons these Men pretend to give of that which they thus fondly dream of, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was no Precept for <hi>Praying</hi> under the Law. First, they tell us that <note n="*" place="bottom">Smalc. de Div. Christi cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>whatever good things the Israelites had and enjoyed, were due to them by Right, because they were promised them by the Law, and therefore there was no need that they should pray for them.</hi> It seems it was superfluous to Ask those mercies and blessings of God, which he was Bound to give them. They were a Debt, and therefore were to be Claimed without any Imploring of God. Is not here again a plain siding with the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, and their Device of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Perfection?</hi> for they suppose that the blessings which those people enjoy'd were the Deserved Wages of their Work, and might be demanded of God as their Right, not ask'd as a Favour: and also this is supposed that they perfectly and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99330:94"/>
without the least defect and fault obey'd all the Divine Laws; otherwise their very Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Failing would have been cause sufficient why they should Pray unto God for pardon and forgiveness. But it seems they wanted not these, and therefore it was needless to make their Addresses to him. These are the Rare Notions of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Divines: or, to speak more plainly, these are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sentiments of these persons.</p>
               <p>Another Reason assigned in the same place is to this effect, <hi>Those who were under the Old Law had no Precept given about Praying, because those Duties which the Law prescribed them and required of them were of that nature that they might be performed without any singular help and assistance from God: why therefore should they invoke the Divine Aid?</hi> And an other of their Writers joyns with him, <hi>The Commandments</hi> (saith he) <hi>that were in the Law did not in themselves surpass humane strength: and the Earthly Happiness which was promised was not so great that there was need of Prayers to obtain it.</hi> The former Reason was ill enough, but this is much worse, and hath more than a <hi>Tang</hi> of that which I objected to them. It is indeed the common and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent usage of these Writers to admire and cry up the Natural Strength and Abilities of Man, asserting him to be such a Creature as can do all his work of himself, and by his own Native Power. Nay, under the <hi>Law</hi> it seems (when man had not those helps and <note place="bottom">Volkel. l. 4. c. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:99330:95"/>
advantages which he hath now) he was able to keep all God's laws, and entirely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey all his Commandments without the Divine Aid, for God gave no Precept about Praying to him and asking his assistance. And if there was no Precept then there was no Obligation upon them to do any such thing (nay, as some of these Gentlemen seem to confess, it had been a Sin to pray to God, because there was no Law or Command for it.) Consequently since they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to observe all the Divine Precepts and Rules, they had power enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without any assistance from God, to do it fully. Therefore <hi>Prayer</hi> was an idle impertinent piece of Devotion; and when <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Ezra, Nehemiah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the other Holy Men whom we read of in the Old Testament, poured out Prayers and Petitions unto God, it was more than they need have done, more than they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, because there was no Command for it.</p>
               <p>What shall we think of these <hi>Socinian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that discourse after this rate? Can it be believed that they have any great Reverence for the Scriptures, that they have a sense of the Weighty and Important Duty of Prayer, that they have due thoughts concerning the Weakness and Imperfection of Man's Nature, that they have becoming apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divine Help and Power? In a word, can it be thought that they speak and think of God as if they had a real belief of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:99330:95"/>
Unto <hi>Worship</hi> without doubt belongs the <hi>Solemn Time</hi> appointed by God himself for his Service. Wherefore let us see what the judgment of the <hi>Unitarians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> is concerning this matter. The Observation of a Seventh Day is not of Divine Right, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be celebrated as such by <hi>Christians,</hi> say <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 4 c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Volkelius</hi> and the Author of the <note n="†" place="bottom">De Prophet. Christi mun. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Catechism.</hi> And the latter of these adds that it is a <hi>Ceremonial Observance,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not obligatory under the Gospel, <hi>for the Religion of Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>as it utterly takes away all Ceremonies, so the choice of Days,</hi> for which he quotes <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. And yet see how consistent these Men are with themselves: though this and all Ceremonious Observances are quite abolished by an express Command and Authority, yet in the next clause they are pleas'd to be so indulgent as to suffer the observation of the <hi>Lord's day, Since it was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated of old by Christians, we grant the same Liberty to all Christians.</hi> It is very graciously done of them to grant that which they before asserted to be contrary to the Word of God, for if it be <hi>utterly taken away</hi> by that Word, it is now contrary to it, and is no longer to be permitted. Whence then have these Men Authority <hi>to suffer the observation of the Lord's day,</hi> since they themselves vouch the utter Abolishing of it? They are very great folks, you must know, and can do what they please. They have a Power, a Prerogative above others, and by vertue of this they can give a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99330:96"/>
Licence to observe that Day which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the forenamed place, they say, utterly condemned. Who knows where to have this People? First, they pronounce the keeping of this day to be unlawful, and then they tell us it is lawful to keep it. It is evident from this Contradiction that they have nothing of solidity and consistency to alledg in behalf of their Opinion.</p>
               <p>To vote the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> to be Part of the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> is ridiculous, because the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of it was practised before the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law</hi> was given, and therefore is none of that Law. It hath a Generally Moral and Perpetual Foundation, because Right Reason (which is in all Men, and is immutable) dictates the Celebration of it, in as much as it is Reasonable that we should imitate God in whatever he commands us. He resting from the works of the Creation on the seventh day, thereupon instituted a Cessation of all worldly labour and business among all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind on that day, and so dedicated it to his honour and worship, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. whereby the observance of it becomes, on <hi>that account,</hi> and in <hi>that respect Moral.</hi> It is not strictly <hi>Moral,</hi> but because the devoting some Certain and Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Time to God's Service is Moral, therefore <hi>so far</hi> the observing of a Seventh Day is Moral. And as for that <hi>particular seventh day,</hi> or that one day in Seven which we <hi>now</hi> keep, it was separated and hallowed by the <hi>Apostles</hi> (who had Authority from Christ to do it,) and so it became an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Institution, and consequently is <hi>more than Moral.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99330:96"/>
the <hi>Socinians</hi> who, with the <hi>Quakers</hi> and some other High-flown Sects, hold that <note n="*" place="bottom">Barclay's Apology.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no obligation to keep the first day of the week more than any other,</hi> despise the Gospel.

He therefore that accounts it not a Holy Day, and keeps it not as such, plainly manifests a spirit of Impiety and Prophaneness.</p>

they that receive Baptism rightly, are grafted into the Church. The promises of the forgiveness of Sin, and of our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be sons of God, by the Holy Ghost, are visibly sign'd and seal'd, faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and grace increased by vertue of Prayer unto God.</q> And indeed this hath been the constant perswasion of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Religious Men: this hath been their firm and grounded belief concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> that these Ordinances were appointed for Great and Excellent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should be, when right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually administred, Chanels of Grace and of the Holy Spirit, Pledges of God's good will in the Gospel, and Signs of the Remission of our sins: and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> should be a help to our Faith and all our other Graces, and a solemn Seal and Assurance of the Divine Favour to us, as well as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Death of our Saviour.</p>

It is falsly said (saith he) that it is a Seal of Grace and Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, a Confirmation of the Promises and of our faith in them. It is erroneously said that it was instituted to be a Memorial of Christ's Death: though he had in express terms said a little before, <hi>There is no other end of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> than <hi>that the remembrance of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with giving of thanks and setting forth his cruel death should perpetually remain in the Church.</hi> Whereby it appears he had forgot what he had said: but he was not forgetful to disparage this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But can we be so uncharitable as to think that the <hi>Unitarians</hi> of our times are guilty of this?

find them no where but in the Books and Sermons of the Superstitious admirers or idolaters of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things,</hi> i. e. the Books and Sermons of all Protestants. And here it will not be amiss to take notice how both the Sacraments are most Abusively treated by these <hi>English Socinians,</hi> which will further evince that they have a right to the Character which I have given them. Their language is as follows, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <q>Let a man in black sprinkle you with some of the Church's Water, or give you a bit of Bread, or a sup of Wine, over which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Wonder-working words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Mother Church's Ritual; though by nature you are as bad as the Devil, you shall presently be inclin'd to as much good as will save you from Hell, and qualifie you for Heaven. And this no less certainly, if you are one of the Elect (for else the Churches Incantation produces only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary effect and a false appearance of good) no less certainly, I say, than by tying the <hi>Norman</hi> Knot you may gain the love of the person you desire, or by other Devices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the learned books of Magick you may cause Hatred, raise Winds, and do a thousand other Feats which have no more natural and real agreement with those Causes that are said to produce them, than Faith and Obedience have with a bit of Bread or with a sprinkling of water.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It can't be said he speaks this of the way of administring Baptism and the Eucharist in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for in this place he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly speaking of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99330:98"/>
of the <hi>Church of England in her Prayers and Offices of the Service-book, and in her Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Homilies:</hi> so that it is plain he means the celebration of both Sacraments accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the custom and manner of <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches,</hi> and more particularly of Ours. And that he makes himself merry with the <hi>Protestant,</hi> not <hi>Popish</hi> manner of administring the Lord's Supper is evident further from this, that he mentions not only the <hi>giving a bit of Bread,</hi> but a <hi>sup of Wine,</hi> which latter is not given to the People in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is well known, and this Author knows as well as any man. Wherefore he must of necessity speak of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as they are administred in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, and you see what jolly work he makes of it. <hi>Mother-Church</hi> is with him a term for any <hi>Eminent Reform'd Church:</hi> as it is indeed the Style of these men, they in their late Writings usually call any Church of Note that differs from them, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church.</hi> The Lawful Minister that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends on the Sacred Institutions of Baptism and the Lord's Supper hath no better Title with them than <hi>the man in black.</hi> Baptism for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth is the <hi>Churches Water,</hi> and the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament cannot be more decently express'd by him than by <hi>a bit of Bread</hi> and <hi>a sup of Wine:</hi> and the words of <hi>Institution</hi> pronounc'd by our Saviour himself are scoffingly call'd <hi>the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working words,</hi> and (which is yet more prophane and impious) an <hi>Incantation,</hi> a Charm, a Spell. Then he scandalously uses the terms of <hi>Devil, Hell</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> as if he believ'd no such things: and to confirm us
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99330:99"/>
in this perswasion concerning him he proceeds (after he had jeer'd <hi>the Elect)</hi> to compare the Solemn and Evangelical Ordinances of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and the Lord's Supper to the <hi>Lewdest, Vilest,</hi> and <hi>most prophane</hi> things imaginable, yea to the Feats of <hi>Magick</hi> Art.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that the most Sacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Religion are derided by this sort of men, who by such passages as these discover themselves to be of a very unsanctified temper. It is no wonder that those who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to this wild and prophane way of talking, blaspheme even the Son of God and the Holy Ghost, vilifying the blessed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the former, and disregarding the powerful assistance and aids of the latter, and denying the Divinity of both. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they abuse and debauch Christianity, and all the Excellent Principles of it, when they give themselves this Liberty, and let fly against all that is Sacred and Venerable. Who will not say (and that on just grounds) that here is more than a Vergency to that cursed genius which I have before mention'd?</p>
               <p>But let us go on, and enquire more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into their apprehensions about <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi> Concerning this they have espoused this groundless conceit, that now among <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> it is an Insignificant Rite. The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their <note n="*" place="bottom">Socin. 2 Epist. ad Radec.</note> Great Master is this, <hi>Baptism was prescribed to none but Heathens: among those who make publick profession of Christianity there is no need of it: at this time it doth not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99330:99"/>
concern the Church at all, but is a mere indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing.</hi> Most of his followers represent it after the like manner, and say <note n="†" place="bottom">Volkel. l. 6. c. 10, 14, 19. Smalc. Disp. de baptismo.</note> 
                  <hi>there was no Command for Water-Baptism,</hi> as they call it. <hi>Baptism is ceas'd,</hi> saith <note n="‖" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Volkelius, it belonging only to those First Times.</hi> And if you urge the express words of the Institution of it, Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">De Baptismo aquae, cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> answers that it is not meant of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Water. And in the same place he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove that this was not enjoyn'd by Christ, but was only freely taken up by the Apostles, and was a Temporary Rite. To which their Chief <note n="†" place="bottom">Volkel. l. 6. c. 14. Smalc. disp. de Baptismo.</note> Doctors say <hi>Amen.</hi> And if you ask the Reason why it is not obligatory now, they will put you off by saying, the Christian Religion is Internal and Spiritual, and admits not of such an external and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ceremony as Baptism. And yet these <hi>Sons of Reason</hi> apply not this to the Other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but acknowledge it to be perpetual in the Christian Church, though it be an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sensible Rite: this interferes not with the Spirituality of the Christian Religion. Which lets us see how Partial they are in their Arguing.</p>
               <p>Further, let us mark the inconsistency of these men: notwithstanding there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for this Sacrament, notwithstanding it is a mere Ceremonial Rite, notwithstanding it is abolish'd (for all this they hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99330:100"/>
yet they defend the Lawfulness of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. It may be used, they say, in the Christian Church, especially when they have any <hi>Turkish</hi> or <hi>Jewish</hi> Proselytes (for <note n="‖" place="bottom">Socin. de Baptismo aquae. Volkel. l. 6. c. 14. Ostorod. Instit. cap. 39.</note> they mention these particularly) for because they are come over to the <hi>Turks</hi> in the point of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> they expect I suppose that some of them will return the kindness, and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to some parts of their Religion. So, it seems, the Sacrament of Baptism is kept up only for the sake of some <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> who are expected to honour <hi>Socinianism</hi> with their Conversion.</p>
               <p>But though Baptism, as it hath respect to Adult Persons, is in some sort tolerated by these men, yet the Baptizing of <hi>Infants</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemned by them <note n="†" place="bottom">Socin. de Bapt. aquae. Smalc. cont. Frantz. Cat. Racov. de Prophet. Christi munere. cap. 4. Moscorov. de Baptismo. Slichting. cont. Meisner.</note> all, <hi>as a practice founded on no Precept or Example.</hi> They agree with the Old Pelagians and Anabaptists that <hi>Children</hi> have nothing to do with this Rite, and they give the same Reasons (if we may call them so) for their Tenent that they did, as appears from the very words of the <note n="*" place="bottom">De Proph. Mun. Christi. cap. 4, qu. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Racovian Catechism,</hi> which excludes Infants because <hi>they cannot themselves, by reason of their age, acknowledge Christ for their Saviour.</hi> And <note n="†" place="bottom">Slichting. Comment. in 1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> one of their Chief Rabbies determines in brief thus, <hi>Infants not knowing what they do, or what is done to them, are not to be baptized.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:99330:100"/>
And therefore an <note n="*" place="bottom">Wolzogen Compend. Relig. Christianae.</note> other calls it <hi>a Vain and Childish action.</hi> And he thinks he is facetious when a little after he stiles it <hi>the Childish Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Children.</hi> And this is the sense of the Unitarians of the last Edition, <hi>The Baptists or Anabaptists,</hi> say <note n="†" place="bottom">Of Wor shiping the Holy Ghost. p. 5.</note> they, <hi>worthily labour in the vindicating of Baptism to those that are capable of it, from those that are uncapable of it.</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Trinitarian Scheme of Religion.</note> They determine that <hi>Baptism was appointed by Christ to initiate Jews and Heathens into the Christian Church,</hi> and consequently none but these are to be enter'd into the Church by this Rite: herein exactly following their Master <note n="*" place="bottom">De Baptismo aquae.</note> 
                  <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who tells us that if any heretofore left their <hi>Judaism</hi> or <hi>Paganism,</hi> they were to be baptised; but those that are born of <hi>Christian</hi> Parents are not to be baptised. Then they add (in the same place) <hi>that no person is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of baptism but such as can profess and intend the thing signified by Baptism,</hi> viz. <hi>a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and a new life:</hi> consequently all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are excluded.</p>
               <p>And now who would not think that <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism</hi> were wholly discarded by the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that they cannot with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence allow of it? But behold yet a farther proof of their Repugnancies, of their jarring with themselves as well as with the Truth, of their contradicting their own sentiments as well as those of the Christian Church. Though they have spoken so contemptibly of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99330:101"/>
Institution, though they openly confess that Children are not capable of it, though they publish to the world that there is neither Command nor Practice for it, yet some of their Authors whom I have mention'd hold it may be practised in the Church. What therefore is it that these men will not say or do, if they have a mind to it? The whole Sect of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are against Paedobaptism, and so far they are to be commended that they approve not of that in others which they are perswaded is unlawful in it self. But here is a sort of Religionists that cry down the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising of Children as an empty and childish Ceremony, as void of all Allowance from Scripture, and unreasonable and absurd in it self, and yet the practice of it is not unlawful in the Church. He that hath a Talent of solving Contrarieties, let him use it here, for here is great occasion for it.</p>
               <p>But this must be said indeed, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. Ministrorum Transylvan. de unius Dei cognitione.</note> some of the High-fliers among them, who are most consistent with themselves and their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, cry out against the Baptising of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as <hi>Anti-Christian,</hi> and not to be tolerated by any means in the Christian Church: for truly if it be of that nature which we have heard it represented to be, there is no reason it should be suffer'd any longer. Wherefore those of the Party before mention'd are guilty of a double Irreligion, first in slandering this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in prophanely scoffing at this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, this Evangelical Rite ordain'd by our
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99330:101"/>
Lord himself; Secondly in allowing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring of it in the Church, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have thus reproach'd it, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it as a thing utterly unlawful. What will the Impious Despisers of Religion, what will the Atheists say to this? Are they not hereby confirm'd in their dislike and contempt of what is Sacred? Are they not taught to open their mouths against God and whatever is Religious, and yet (notwithstanding that) to make some shew of outward allowing them? Is not here an Example set them for this purpose, and do we not see it daily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Thus it appears that these men strike at Religion, yea strike it down, and then would pretend to raise it up as it were: but this is only adding Dissimulation to their gross Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, which renders their Guilt the greater, and mightily aggravates their Crime.</p>

And who could expect any other thing? for they who have so abused and perverted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity it self, would not fail to treat the Ministers of it with contempt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, yea wholly to make void their Office and Charge. This is a fresh evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth and reality of what I formely tax'd them with.</p>
               <p>One thing further I will observe that according to the Socinian Writers there is <hi>a</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Socin. Epist. 3. ad Radec.</note> 
                  <hi>Necessity of openly adhering to some Congregation professing Christ's discipline; and that Congregation must be such as they think to be purer than the rest.</hi> This is the whole design and subject of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s book <hi>De Officio hominis Christiani,</hi> to shew that they must be of some Church, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of those who were then call'd <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Ebionites.</hi> That is in plain terms, those who are of the <hi>Anti-Trinitarian</hi> perswasion must have a Gather'd Church, and there make publick profession of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99330:104"/>
their belief, and openly teach those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they are perswaded to be true. And yet I offer it to be taken notice of that though this be profess'd in their Writings to be an Indispensable Point of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they regard not the practising of it. None of our <hi>English Socinians</hi> have any Set Meetings for the propagating of their doctrine, as men of other perswasions have at this day. We cannot but take notice that all Parties who think their Way to be True and Good hold distinct Congregations on the Lord's day, or at other Solemn times, and then make profession of their particular Way and Worship. It is well known that this is the usage and practice of all the different Parties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They did it even when they had a Prohibition from the Government, but now much more openly when they are not restrained by Publick Authority. But there is not so much as one single Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of Religion and Worship upheld by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> tho it is certain that their way of worship differs from that of all Other Parties, because the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Worship is different, I mean as to their consideration of it, for they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour as a Creature, and no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99330:104"/>
other. Which one thing should make them assemble together in a distinct place and manner from all other Professors of Religion. They should, if they acted according to their own Principles, have a peculiar Church, and openly preach up their Perswasions, and declare against the <hi>false</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Worship</hi> of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianity but themselves, for <hi>so</hi> it seems they esteem it.</p>
               <p>Thus, I say, they are obliged to do, if they will be consistent to themselves.</p>
               <p>They must form an Assembly of their own, and if they want Members, they know where to have them: it is but sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for some more of their brethren in <hi>Transylvania, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. and so they may be stock'd. I do not see how they can possibly omit the Meeting together as a Church, suppose in <hi>London</hi> or some other convenient place, for their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Ecclesiastical Government or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline oblige them to this. If they say that some Prudential Considerations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to do otherwise, then it is clear that their Prudence is of such a sort that it outweighs, yea wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes their Duty: and surely men of their Reason and Judgment will not boast much of such a Prudence. Besides, if they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99330:105"/>
pretend Discretion and Prudence for their not Assembling together, then in so doing they tax all the Meetings and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other Perswasions as herds of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and Impolitick Men: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a Charge as this savours of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I leave it to themselves to judg.</p>

                  <hi>the people of the kingdom of</hi> Poland <hi>and of the Great Dutchy of</hi> Lithuania <hi>ought to joyn themselves to the Assemblies of those that were call'd Arians,</hi> that is, those who profess'd <hi>Socinus</hi>'s doctrine. Now, will not any rational and considerate man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hence that our <hi>English Socinians</hi> are very cold and unconcerned in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? for though according to the Scheme of their <hi>Church-Government</hi> they ought to Meet together in a visible and solemn manner, yet they are so Indifferent that they will not, or so Cowardly that they dare not do it. Which breeds a suspicion of them that they only act a Part, and that at
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99330:106"/>
another time they will be at something else.</p>
               <p>Which appears from this likewise that, tho they under hand manage their Cause, and write in defence of it, yet they conceal their Names and Persons. They are against <hi>Mysteries,</hi> but they keep in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and will not let the world know who they are. This evidently convinces us how Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they are, for if they were verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that their doctrine is really True, and that it contains in it Substantial and Necessary Points of Faith and Religion, they would not, they could not act thus under a disguise; but they would be sensible that it is absolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to discover themselves, and to deal above board, and to be plain and free in their owning of the Cause; for if they be Verities of Necessary Concern in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (as they sometimes pretend) then they are worth the Publick owning, and these persons may glory in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them. But we see they dare not (even in this Juncture when Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was allow'd them, and they might safely speak their minds) appear with open face, and set their Names before their Writings. This shews that they have no true Zeal for their Cause, yea that at the bottom they are but little or not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99330:106"/>
And if they be not deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that which is their Darling Point, what can we think of them as to the rest?</p>
               <p>But it is not only Cowardize, but something of a worse nature that makes them thus mask themselves. These <hi>Knights Errant</hi> (who come not like those of old to do kindnesses to the distressed) will not vouchsafe to lift up the beavers of their helmets, and let us see who they are, because by this concealment they are abler to do the greater mischief. They lie hid, and publish not their Names, that thereby they may have the advantage of saying what they please, and aspersing whom they will with their audacious pens; that by this means they may have free liberty to disturb the world, to unsettle men in their Opinions, to beget Disputes and Wranglings, to bring in Scepticism and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in Religion, and at last Atheism.</p>
               <p>I could moreover add, under this Third General Head, their unscriptural Notion concerning <hi>the Church, viz.</hi> that, like other Societies, it may be extinct. Whereas it hath been the constant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all <hi>Protestants</hi> (as well as those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) that the Church of God is perpetual, and shall
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99330:107"/>
never be wholly extirpated, these men vouch that <hi>there is no necessity of asserting any such thing.</hi> So <note n="*" place="bottom">V. R. l. 5. c. 4.</note>

From these and several other plain passages in the Writings of the Old and New Testament it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this is a Truth impregnable, that the True <hi>Church</hi> of Christ shall never fail, that God's special Providence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, that it hath been and shall be preserved in all Ages, and that it shall endure to the World's End. But their contrary perswasion shews us what a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99330:107"/>
mean esteem they have of what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Holy Scriptures, and how Indifferent they are as to the duration or extinction of the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, I come to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what their Sentiments are in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Morality.</hi> But I sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely declare I intend not here any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon their <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> for I am a perfect stranger to them: I know nothing of the Gentlemen but their Books: or if I knew any thing that were a blemish in their Conversation, if I were able to rake up materials to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them blameable in point of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, I should think it an unworthy act so much as to mention it, for those are Weak and Feeble Arguers who make use of such Methods. It is irrational to judg of Opinions from the Personal miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of any men. My business at present is to set before the Reader the thoughts and apprehensions of some of their Chief Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning some Points of Morality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Officious Lies were never forbidden either by Moses or Christ in the Old or New Testament, &amp; consequently are lawful</hi> saith <note n="*" place="bottom">De V. R. cap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Volkelius.</hi> And he adds this reason, <hi>because they are profitable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99330:108"/>
to some:</hi> as if that would render them Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when the Apostle hath instructed us in the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. We are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>to do evil,</hi> that <hi>good may come</hi> of it. The consideration of Advantage and Profit cannot render that lawful which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in it self, as all <hi>Lying</hi> is; and the reason is because it is a Transgression of the Divine Law. To prove that this Profitable Lying is not unlawful, they alledge Examples out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but we may observe that at other times they make nothing of Examples thence, because (say they) the Gospel requires of persons greater perfection than the Law did, as their Gloss upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. evidences. But now, though they must <hi>not swear at all,</hi> yet they may <hi>lie,</hi> i. e. if it be in an officious and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, notwithstanding those Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prohibitions of all Lying, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 17. 12. 22. 13. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 9. If this Doctrine were generally preach'd (as it is by these men) it would have a pernicious effect in the world, and all Lies would be reckon'd some way or other <hi>Officious,</hi> and Truth and Sincerity would soon leave the earth.</p>
               <p>I might mention <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Explication of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. <hi>Whosoever looketh on a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99330:108"/>
to lust after her, hath committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery already with her in his heart;</hi> which he restrains to looking on a <hi>Married woman,</hi> not on any other: and he favourably speaks of the <hi>motions of Concupiscence,</hi> even when he is discoursing of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Christian Law above that of <hi>Moses,</hi> which looks very strange. And besides, he strikes in with the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> who determine Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence to be no Sin. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ostorod. Instit. cap. 4.

But I will not make use of their Opinion against the main body of the <hi>Anti-Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> because I verily believe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not of it: and some of them have particularly shew'd their dislike and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it.</p>

Yet they are not ashamed to give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Religion of the Holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Saints till the coming of Christ. How high an affront is this to the Divine Majesty, that he should allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of these Impurities and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? for this they must necessarily hold because they declare that these were no Sins, nor were they disliked by God, otherwise he would have forbid the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them.

If these be not Contradictions, tell me what are.</p>
               <p>But I will briefly shew that both <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and these his followers herein oppose themselves to the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, and the Appointment of the Universal Lawgiver of the world, which is no mean Instance of their Irreligious inclination. That Ancient Law, <hi>Gen</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</hi> is not abrogated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is still in force. The Magistrate hath here a Commission to put to death persons for Murder. Here is a Divine Warrant for this Bloody Execution. And our Saviour's words have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied this way by very Judicious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, <hi>They that take the sword, shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99330:112"/>
with the sword,</hi> Mat. 26. 52. <hi>i. e.</hi> they that use the sword unlawfully, they that unjustly shed humane blood, are worthy of Death, and this generally is their portion. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 11. shew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is lawful for Magistrates to put to death those whose Crimes deserve it. <hi>If I be an Offender,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die.</hi> Both Capital Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Punishments are authorized by the same Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. where speaking of the Magistrate, he saith, <hi>He beareth not the sword in vain, i. e.</hi> he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it so as strike with it, to do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with it, when there is occasion. So ridiculous is that Exposition of the place which <note n="*" place="bottom">Smalc. cont. Frantz. disp. de rebus civisib.</note> One of the Socinian Writers gives, <hi>viz.</hi> It is said, <hi>He bears the sword,</hi> but yet he must not <hi>use</hi> it. It is evident from this Text (as well as from those before mention'd) that God himself hath put this Weapon into the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's hand, and why then should any presume to disarm him?</p>
               <p>I acknowledge a Christian Ruler ought to be very Cautious and Tender in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99330:113"/>
the point of mens Lives, and perhaps it would be better to be sparing of them in some cases, where generally according to the Laws, as they are now in force, there is a forfeiture of Life. It was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare heretofore among our Ancestors to inflict death for some of those Crimes which now are made Capital. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner had not so much work when Banishment and Confiscations were more in use. But it is certain that there are such flagitious enormities, such heinous and detestable villanies as require no less a recompence than Death it self. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the case of Blood-shedding a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation is due, for blood calls for blood. This fatal Retribution is founded not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the foremention'd Positive Law given to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and never since repeal'd, and also on the Allowance of the <hi>New Testament</hi> (as you have heard) but on the Common Law of Equity and justice. Wherefore the Magistrate hath authority, when publick Justice and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity require it, to take away mens lives. Which our Church thought fit to make <note n="*" place="bottom">The 37th.</note> one of her Articles. <hi>The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian Men with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99330:113"/>
death for heinous and grievous offences.</hi> Nay, the Publick Ministers of Justice are so far from offending in doing this, that they are extraordinarily guilty if they omit it, especially if they suffer Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to go thus unpunish'd, for blood-shed is the way by Gods appointment for the avenging of willful homicide and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>I mention these things that we may see how injurious the <hi>Unitarians</hi> are both to the Ecclesiastical and Civil Ministers. They not only null the function and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the former (as I shew'd you) but they rob the latter of a great and considerable part of their Office. They will not allow them a power to punish Offenders, especially Capitally. With the <hi>Donatists</hi> of old and some <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> afterwards they agree to defend this Proposition, that no man ought to be put to death, let his Crime be never so black and bloody: they hold that the Effusion of humane blood is in all cases unlawful. They had this immediately from the <hi>Italian</hi> Innovator, who knew it would serve his followers to very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable purposes. For it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to begin first with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st he should have begun with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99330:114"/>
them. They take away his Punitive Power, and then they know he can't hurt them. They are against all Capital Inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lest they should tast of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The design of these Opposers of Magistracy is that they may have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to vent what Doctrines they please, that they may even expel out of the world some of the Fundamental Truths which have been embraced in all ages of the Church. It is to be fear'd that the design at the bottom is that all Magistrates should throw away their Swords, divest themselves of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Punish, that hereby there may be a Liberty to do what they please; and then at last it is likely they will usurp the Sword, and take upon them that Office which they denied to the Magistate. Though they despoil the Praetor of his Axe as well as Rods, yet they will make use of them themselves.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THUS I have gone through the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Particulars and Members which make up the Body of <hi>Socinianism:</hi> and I have now only this further to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, that both as to some of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances before mention'd, and as to one or two which I have not yet taken notice of, they apparently symbolize with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:99330:115"/>
They joyn hands with them in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Evangelical Counsels,</hi> as we may satisfie our selves from what their Great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Dictator saith on <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 43, 44. It is true, in his Explication of <hi>v.</hi> 17. of that Chapter he rejects the Popish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Counsels,</hi> as it is there on that occasion applied. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his shifting! In this place he makes out his Opinion by using that Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only he disguises it under the term of <hi>Monitions,</hi> instead of <hi>Counsels.</hi> He holds that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 25. 21. <hi>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat,</hi> &amp;c. to be of this sort; it is an Advice which we may follow, or not, as we please: it is not a Command, no man is enjoyn'd to do this. But after this rate any of the Plain Commands in Holy Scripture may be evaded, for we may alledg this which <hi>Socinus</hi> here starts that <hi>though the words are propounded in the way of a Precept, yet they have not the force of one,</hi> but only are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions or Counsels, which a man may observe if he thinks fit, else not. And so in other Particulars I have hinted their Correspondence with <hi>Rome,</hi> as in their vilifying of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be Corrupted: likewise in their notion of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99330:115"/>
they say is not proper and peculiar to God; the <hi>Papists</hi> excuse the Worship which is paid by them to Angels and Saints by alledging that this Honour may be communicated to others besides the Deity; and so doth <hi>Socinus</hi> stiffly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Divine Honour is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to him that is by nature God. Both parties agree in the doctrines of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> Both accord in this likewise that the Magistrate must not meddle with the Church, that he hath no Authority to punish Offenders in point of Religion.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they agree in the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Venial</hi> and <hi>Mortal Sins.</hi> See <hi>Crellius, Eth. l. c.</hi> 5. and <hi>Volkelius, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. Frantz. disp. 9. de Hypocr.</note> 
                  <hi>Smalcius</hi> peremptorily asserts that those are <hi>Venial Sins which do not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eternal death, and that there are such sins.</hi> But the rest only say God hath not constituted Eternal Punishment as the just recompence of all Sins. <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 4. cap. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Volkelius</hi>'s express words are, <hi>Venial Sins are those for which God hath not appointed the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternal death, so that of themselves they deprive no man of eternal life.</hi> But this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99330:116"/>
contradicts the Apostle, who speaks without any reserve and limitation, <hi>The wages of sin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. And you may be satisfied that even Eternal Death is included in that general term, for <hi>death</hi> in this former clause of the verse is directly oppos'd to <hi>eternal life</hi> in the latter one. That they symbolize in the doctrine of <hi>Praying for the dead</hi> may be gather'd from what a Great Man among them saith, <note n="*" place="bottom">Slichting Comment. in 2 Tim. 1. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no wonder that those who believe no middle state of the dead, pray not for them. But those that believe this, do well in praying for them.</hi> He adds, <hi>There is a much more certain succour and aid in the prayers of the living for the dead, than in the prayers of the dead for the living.</hi> They affect the way of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the manner of excusing their worshiping the Son of God, although they hold him not to be God, but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for as the <hi>Romanists</hi> palliate their Idolatrous Worship in praying to Saints and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by saying that this Adoration is paid ultimately to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so not only the Old but the New <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> use the same language, telling us

I charge not these latter with any formed intentions of promoting the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause; but they may be Factors for <hi>Rome,</hi> though perhaps they know it not. However, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it may be consider'd how Inconsistent these men are when they make a shew sometimes of being great Enemies to the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> and yet at other times abet and befriend it. Would not a Thinking Man be induced to believe that they are at the bottom Favourers of the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Interest? Lastly, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any considerate man whether this be not more probable than what the <hi>Socinians</hi> charge the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> with,

That the Reader may have a Summary View together of all the preceding do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> I will be yet briefer, and couch the whole in a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99330:117"/>
Draught, which you may call, if you please, the <hi>Creed of a Socinian.</hi> It may be drawn up in this Form and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I believe concerning the <hi>Scripture</hi> that there are Errors, Mistakes and Contradictions in some places of it: that the Authority of some of its books is questionable, yea that the Whole Bible hath been tamper'd with, and may be suspected to be Corrupted.</p>
                  <p>I believe concerning <hi>God</hi> that he is not a <hi>Spirit,</hi> properly speaking, <hi>i. e.</hi> Immaterial and Incorporeal, but that he is such another sort of Body as Air or Ether is: that he is not Immense and Infinite, and every where Present, but is confined to certain places: that he hath no Knowledg of such future events as depend on the free will of man, and that it is impossible that these things should be foreknown by him: that there is a Succession in God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Duration as well as there is in Time, which is the measure of that Duration which belongs to Finite beings.</p>
                  <p>I believe further concerning <hi>God,</hi> that there is no distinction of <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Subsistencies</hi> in him, and that the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are not God, the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99330:118"/>
former of these being only a Man, and the latter no other than the Power or Operation of God: that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Merit</hi> in what Christ did or suffer'd; that therefore he could not make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the sins of the world: and the contrary Assertion is deceitful, erroneous and pernicious.</p>
                  <p>I believe concerning the <hi>First Man</hi> that he was not created in a state of Uprightness, that the Image of God in which he was made, consisted not in Righteousness and Holiness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that he did not lose these by his Fall, for he could not lose what he had not: that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Posterity have receiv'd no hurt, have had no stain or blemish derived to them by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, and the contrary Opinion is a fable, a dream, a fiction of Antichrist: that Mankind (having receiv'd no damage by the fall of our First Parents) have still an ability by nature to desire and imbrace all Spiritual Good, and to avoid all that is Sinful and Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: that therefore there is no need of the help of the Holy Spirit, and that men may believe and repent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all religious acts without his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and influence (yea indeed the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99330:118"/>
                     <hi>Spirit</hi> is but an Operation it self:) that men are counted righteous before God, not for the Merit of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> (for he had no Merit) but for their own good works.</p>
                  <p>I believe concerning the <hi>Future State</hi> that the Souls of the deceas'd have no knowledg, no perception of any thing, they are not sensible of any rewards or pains, neither are they capable of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, so that in a manner they may be said not to Exist, for their life, activity and sensibleness are vanish'd, and their very Nature is absorpt. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we shall not rise with the Same Bodies, which we have now, at the last day, but that another Matter or Substance shall be substituted in their place. I believe that men shall not at the day of Judgment be required to give an Account of their actions: the most Flagitious Sinners shall not be Examined concerning any thing of their past life, they shall not be Tried or Judged. Only they shall be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and their Punishment is this, To utterly eease and perish for ever: the <hi>Unquenchable Fire</hi> is nothing but Annihilation.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99330:119"/>
I believe, as to <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in it is to be submitted to the dictates of Humane Reason, and what cannot be explain'd and made out by this is no part of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and consequently that there are no doctrines appertaining to it which are <hi>Mysterious</hi> and Superiour to our Reason.</p>
                  <p>I believe, as to <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> that it may be given to another besides God, that a Creature may (if God thinks fit) be the object of Adoration, and consequently <hi>Christ</hi> (who is but a Creature) may be worship'd with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, even the same that is paid to God the Father. I believe that <hi>Prayer</hi> (as eminent an act of Worship as it is) was not required in the Old Testament, for God's people had no need of Praying then, they were able to do all that was commanded them in their Religion without the Divine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and therefore the Invoking of God became not a Duty till Christ's time. I believe the <hi>Lord's day</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly so call'd) is a Ceremonious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance, and abolish'd by the Gospel, which takes away all Choice of Days. I believe that there is no Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

convey'd or conferr'd in the use of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and particularly that <hi>Baptism</hi> is an useless Rite which the Christian Church under the Gospel hath nothing to do with, but more especially the Baptizing of <hi>Children</hi> is insignificant, vain and childish, and hath neither Precept nor Example to commend it to us. I believe there is no Distinct Function or Office of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in the Christian Church, and that the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> it self may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred by any private Christian or Brother.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Moral Points</hi> I believe that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious Lies are lawful, that the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Concupiscence are not Vitious, that idle or obscene words, gluttony, drunkenness, riot, luxury, and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure desires and lusts were not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den till Christ's time, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were no Sins.</p>
                  <p>I believe, concerning <hi>Magistrates,</hi> that they have no power of Life and Death, it is not lawful for them now under the Gospel to inflict Capital Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments on any Offenders or Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, no not Murderers and Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:99330:120"/>
Concerning some other Articles, I believe as the <hi>Church</hi> believes, I mean the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for we symbolize with them in several points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, after all I believe that though the foresaid Articles are necessary to make a man a <hi>Socinian,</hi> yet the belief of only One is enough to make a Man a <hi>Christian:</hi> and that One Article is, that <hi>Jesus is the Messias;</hi> in which it is not included whether he be <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> whether he satisfied the Divine Justice for our sins, and by vertue of his Death purchas'd Life for us. But when I say, I believe <hi>Jesus is the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> I mean only this that such a Man of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was Anointed, Ordain'd, and Sent of God to be a Saviour, and that this is He who was foretold and promis'd to be sent by God. This is all I believe, and there is no Necessity of believing any thing more.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> and I have faithfully drawn it up out of their own Admired and Applauded Writers. I know it will be said here that some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides professed <hi>Socinians</hi> hold <hi>some</hi> of these things. To which I answer, I made it not my present business to observe what
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99330:120"/>
                  <hi>Others</hi> say, but to represent what that body of men, who are known by the name of <hi>Socinians,</hi> profess and own. Again, it is not <hi>one</hi> of these Opinions alone (excepting that concerning the Blessed <hi>Trinity)</hi> which can give the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Socinian:</hi> it is the <hi>Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them that must do it. Therefore Iinsist not on any one Single Opinion of lesser importance. Those that bear upon them the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Complex Characters</hi> which I have layd down in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse are the Persons that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd. In short, I write not (and never will by God's assistance) to humour and gratifie any Party of Men, but to assert and vindicate the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to all Good Men. And therefore if any sort of persons shall censure my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I shall have recourse to my own Innocence and Integrity, that is, my hearty designs and indeavours to advance that Cause which I verily believe hath <hi>Truth</hi> on its side, because it hath the <hi>Scriptures</hi> on its side.</p>
               <p>If they shall say (and what will they not say)? that the <hi>English Socinians</hi> give not their suffrage to all these Particulars, which I have produced and named, and therefore my Charge against the <hi>Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:99330:121"/>
doth not reach them, I desire these following things may be considered, and then this Evasion will be found to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak and useless, and nothing to their purpose: and it will appear that this Scheme of <hi>Socinianism</hi> belongs to <hi>them</hi> as well as to the rest.</p>
               <p>First, we are not sure that some of those who go under the name of <hi>English Socinians</hi> are not <hi>Foreigners.</hi> Is not <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>'s Stock somewhere harbour'd among them? Have there not been seen strange <hi>Outlandish</hi> Books at the Press of late? May we not suspect some <hi>Transylvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Polanders</hi> employ'd in the work lately? Are we not sure that there are some <hi>Irish</hi> as well as <hi>English</hi> ingaged in the service? Why then are we nice in distinguishing, when they are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd as to their work and design?</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for our very <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Native Socinians,</hi> they borrow'd their Opinions from those <hi>Foreigners,</hi> they fetch'd them from those Writers, and they maintain them by the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they did. They use the very same Texts, and urge them after the same manner: they follow them step by step, vouch their Reasonings, applaud their Discoursings; only they dress up
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99330:121"/>
their notions in an <hi>English</hi> garb, and give them a more Modish Turn than they had before. That's all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between those Authors and these of late in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, though some of the Moderns are so politick as to be silent about some of the Points that I have mention'd, yet we have no reason to gather thence that they are not inclin'd to imbrace them. It is a remarkable hint of a very <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Wallis. 4th. Letter concerning the Trinity. p. 5.</note> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Person, <hi>There is reason to suspect</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the Socinians have some other odd Tenents; which they think fit rather to conceal than to deny.</hi> For we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this, that they would first gain their Main Point, the overthrow of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and all the Maxims that relate to that. This is the Leading Card with them, and therefore they chiefly insist on this, intending (we may suppose) to urge the rest afterwards. For it would be too much to undertake at one time to defend all the other doctrines. And besides, it would be too odious to reject so many receiv'd Propositions at once. Therefore they go not this way to work, lest they

<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  </gap>

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:99330:123"/>
should be universally cried down. It is their cunning to proceed gradually, and to undermine Christianity by steps. That is the reason they have not in their Writings touch'd upon <hi>some</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Opinions. But it is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd but that they have a good esteem of them, and will in time (when they have dispatch'd their Main Business) betake themselves to the hearty defence of them.</p>
               <p>But, fourthly, if I were to give a Scheme of the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, should I not discharge that Province suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently if I gave a true account of it from the Writings of the generality of Divines of that Communion and Profession in other Countries, though I had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted every individual Papist in <hi>England</hi> about the Points? Yes surely. And so it is here, <hi>Socinianism</hi> was not begot in <hi>Britain,</hi> it is of Foreign Breed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Writings of those Foreigners who were profess'd <hi>Socinians</hi> are to be consulted and produced when we are to give a True Pourtraiture of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and accordingly this Method I have taken. It was not necessary to ask every Little Pretender or Retainer to it in every corner of this Countrey whether
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99330:123"/>
he was exactly of the same Cut with the <hi>Outlandish</hi> Writers in every thing, as if <hi>Socinianism</hi> were to be measured altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>their</hi> sentiments and perswasions. No: Socinianism is not to be defined by what one or two Upstart Writers dictate: this, as <hi>Popery,</hi> is to be judged and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated according to the Generality of the persons that profess it. And that is it which I have been doing, I have been giving an estimation of it according to the Greatest Numbers of those who own themselves to be <hi>Socinians.</hi> In this I have dealt fairly, and no man can blame me for it.</p>
               <p>Nay, fifthly, I have decipher'd <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi> not only according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Most</hi> who own and profess it, but of the <hi>Chiefest</hi> and <hi>Learnedest.</hi> I have not only brought upon the Stage the Opinions which are held by the Main Body of them, but I have consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Choicest Writers on the several subjects. There are other Socinian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom I have not mention'd, as <hi>Goslavius, Voidovius, Gittichius,</hi> &amp;c. but I chose out those that are renowned among them. I could have produced the Assertions which are to be found in <hi>Servetus, Valentinus Gentilis, Bernardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99330:124"/>
Ochinus, Franciscus Davidis, Somme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Georgius Blandrata,</hi> who made way for the reception of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s doctrine against the Holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> I could have quoted a later Author, one <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ovius</hi> who in his <note n="*" place="bottom">Cogitata Sacra Varii Tractatus.</note> Writings hath said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning most of the Points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. Yea, this <hi>Volume</hi> of his is order'd by the Party to be adjoyn'd to the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum Polonorum.</hi> And besides, the Reprinting of it in the year 1692 shews that it is Authentick among the <hi>Modern Socinians.</hi> But I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this <hi>Polonian Knight</hi> (for such they tell us he was) he being not so well known to the world as the rest that I have named. I chose rather to make use of those Names which are of general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and Credit among the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> and whose Writings they have a great and universal regard for, so great and universal that they take all they say from them. If I had always listned to the Majority of Voices, to only what the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest part of them say, (though that were sufficient) it is likely they would have blamed me: but now seeing I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise attended to the determination of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99330:124"/>
those who are reckon'd the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent among them, I'm sure they can have nothing to object against me. They must not think to shuffle us off by saying the <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>English Unitarians</hi> are not the same, for you see that these latter are included in the former, and both of them make up One Body of Men who are known by the name of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and who are all of them profess'd and sworn Opposers of the <hi>Sacred Trinity.</hi> Thus, I suppose, I have fully answer'd what was <hi>Objected,</hi> and it is manifest that our own Countreymen no less than Foreigners are concern'd in the Character which I have given of these men.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Author concludes with<hi> Inferences </hi>from the whole, viz.<hi> 1. Socinianism </hi>is a Complication of Old and New Errors. Quakers and Muggletonians sprang thence.<hi> 2. </hi>It is strange boldness in the<hi> Socinians </hi>to pretend to ground their Opinions on Scripture.<hi> 3. </hi>What hath been said gives us a right Idea of these persons. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they are no<hi> Christians: </hi>but great favourers of<hi> Judaism </hi>and<hi> Turcism, </hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the latter.<hi> 4. </hi>We must enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain none of their Principles.<hi> 5. </hi>We are to take notice of the tendency of them to<hi> Irreligion </hi>and<hi> Atheism. Socinians </hi>and<hi> Atheists </hi>at this day friendly agree. Yet the former have the confidence to charge the<hi> Trinitarians </hi>with<hi> Idolatry </hi>and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism. The Author writes nothing in way of<hi> Recrimination, </hi>but from a sense of the Reality of the things themselves. He appeals to the judgment of the Sober and Religious. He thinks not himself concern'd to take notice of every scurrilous or trifling Opponent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw from the whole I will make some brief <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Reflections,</hi> and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99330:125"/>
so conclude. First, see how faulty, how erroneous, how dangerous, how perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Socinians</hi> is. It fails not in one or two Points only, but in a vast number, as I have let you see. It is patch'd up of several different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions fetch'd from sundry quarters, it is a Fardle of mix'd and disagreeing Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is a Nest of Heterodoxies, a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limafrey of Old and New Errors, a Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Heresies taken from <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi> the <hi>Sabellians, Samosatenians, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Photinians, Macedonians,</hi> who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi> They joyn with <hi>Jews, Pagans</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> in disowning and denying this Great Mystery of Religion. Other false opinions they have borrow'd from the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> (a sort of Antient Hereticks) concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and the Effect of it, and man's Natural strength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in spiritual matters: so that these men deal in Brokers ware, Old Opinions trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up anew. Again, They comply with the <hi>Papists</hi> (as I have shew'd) in several of their sentiments and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and if there be any <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is certain the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cannot clear themselves of that crime. They tread in the steps of the Old <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:99330:126"/>
and of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Antient and Modern <hi>Libertines</hi> about the nature of <hi>Spirits,</hi> of <hi>Separate Souls,</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection of humane bodies,</hi> of the <hi>Last Judgment,</hi> and of <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They espouse the cause of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> they follow those <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> who disallow of the solemnizing of any special Time, particularly the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>day,</hi> who disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the benefit and use of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and deride the Office and Call of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Church. It is observable that in their late Pamphlets they with great rudeness and incivility speak of <hi>Preaching.</hi> In one place, I remember <hi>School-boys and Preachers Rhetorick</hi> are joyn'd together by them: and in five or six other places they have a fling at the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which they mention with great disdain. It seems the <hi>Profess'd Instructors</hi> of the people are very much out of their favour. They laugh at the <hi>Orthodox</hi> (as they call them) for <hi>thundring it from their Pulpits, that matters of Faith are above Reason.</hi> So the <hi>Letter to the Clergy of both Universities,</hi> chap. 10. And those that will not reject the <hi>Trinity</hi> and other doctrines exploded by the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> are <hi>Priest-ridden.</hi> Letter of Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, p. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:99330:126"/>
They adhere to other <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as to their mistaken conceits concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magistracy and the Secular Sword. They perfectly accord with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their opinions about the <hi>Trinity, Christ's Satisfaction, Original Corruption,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ministerial Function and Mission,</hi> concerning <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christian Sabbath, going to War,</hi> &amp;c. So that any considerate man may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that <hi>Quakerism</hi> is the spawn of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, they seem to have given rise to the wild Sect of <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> who from them have learnt to hold but <hi>One Person in the Godhead,</hi> viz. God the Father, and to call the <hi>Trinity</hi> or a <hi>God of Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> (as they speak) <hi>a Monster</hi> (as our Gentlemen are pleas'd also to express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.) They have been taught from them to renounce the Power of the Christian Magistrate, and the Office of a Christian Minister: they are instructed by them in their Tenents concerning the Spirits or Souls of men, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they can't act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, and that therefore they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct as soon as they are separated from it.</hi> They are the very words of this late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they are taken from the <hi>Racovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> An other detachment is that <hi>the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99330:127"/>
Bodies of the deceased, wherein they lived and died, shall not rise again, shall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any more.</hi> This is their language: whence it is evident that <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton</hi> suck'd their Principle from <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> and his Adherents. And thus you see that as the <hi>Socinians</hi> borrow from several Sects, so they set up others: they receive and distribute Poison, and thereby doubly endanger mankind. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is apparent that they borrow from <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> and thereby yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring mischief upon the world.</p>
               <p>And from the whole it is evident that these persons are corrupted not only in some matters of lesser moment, but in those that are of the highest concern: not only in merely Speculative doctrines, but such as immediately relate to Practise: not only in some Principles that respect the Circumstances of Christianity, but in those that are Substantial and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, those that are of the very Essence of the Christian Faith. Let this be seriously thought of, that we may have a true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the mischief of <hi>Socinianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Observe the strange <hi>boldness,</hi> as well as <hi>falshood,</hi> of these men. They are often in their Writings insinuating into their Readers that they build all their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99330:127"/>
Assertions on the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and thence they require their assent to what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. But from the several Particulars which I have insisted upon it is clear that they have no ground to require or claim it upon that account, for I have manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover'd the opposition of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents to the plain dictates of the Holy Spirit in the Bible. There they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as spurious and adulterate Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there they are rejected as Pernicious and Poisonous doctrines. And yet they have the confidence to ground these on the authority of the Inspired Writings, the Sacred Oracles of Truth, yea <note n="*" place="bottom">J. Bidle in the Pref. to his Scripture-Catechism.</note> One of them tells the world that he was brought to these Perswasions <hi>by reading the Scripture;</hi> that hereby they may the more effectually impose upon the minds of men, who they think will be ready to attend to that which they pretend is bottom'd on the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, These things which have been suggested may be serviceable to give us a <hi>Right Idea</hi> of the persons I have been dealing with. Surely those who have thus mangled and abused Religion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to have a Good Intention
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99330:128"/>
in the work which they are about at this day, yea they must be thought to have a very Bad one. We may argue thus, It is no wonder that they that pervert and deprave <hi>so many doctrines</hi> of Religion, do more especially enervate the Mystery of the Blessed <hi>Trinity.</hi> If it were only on the account of all their other wild noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we might have reason to suspect, yea to condemn their blasphemous Opinion concerning our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> viz. their flat denial of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and of his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. It is not to be marvel'd at that they proceed thus far, having done so much besides, having in other Points of Christianity shew'd what a faculty they have of perverting and distorting the Truths of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>What I have said therefore will be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to enlighten the Reader, that he may understand what manner of persons these are; that (to speak plainly) he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are no <hi>Christians.</hi> Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretences they make to that Title, it is impossible they should with reason lay claim to it, for they neither are <hi>baptised</hi> into the Christian Faith, nor do they make <hi>Profession</hi> of it, as you have heard: but on the contrary they subvert <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> it self, and deny the Divine Author
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99330:128"/>
of it. How then can these men challenge the name of <hi>Christians?</hi> Nay, I could observe that they industriously comply with <hi>Jews and Turks,</hi> in opposition to and defiance of all Sober <hi>Christians.</hi> To gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the former, they think fit to renounce the avowed Principles of the latter. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they follow their Old Friend <hi>Servetus,</hi> who had convers'd a long time with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and had espoused many of their Opinions, and was a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of them. Especially he declar'd his approbation of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and thought it reconcileable with the New Testament, if the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> were laid aside. It is often mention'd by <hi>Socinus</hi> and other <hi>Racovian</hi> Writers that this doctrine and that of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> hinders <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> from embracing the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> And even the <note n="*" place="bottom">A Letter of Resolution concerning the Trinity, p. 17, 18.</note> late <hi>Socinian</hi> Penmen in their <hi>New Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi> talk much of this, that the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> puts a stop to the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens:</hi> and thereupon they are very earnest with their Readers to abandon this Great Point of Christianity, in mere complacency with those Infidels.</p>

And more particularly it is observable how favourably they speak of <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> or <hi>Turcism:</hi> they profess themselves forward to believe that <note n="*" place="bottom">The same Letter, p. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Mahomet had no other design in pretending himself to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but to restore the belief of the Unity of God, which at that time was extirpated among the Eastern Christians by the doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation.</hi> Mahomet <hi>meant not his Religion should be esteemed a New Religion, but only the Restitution of the true Intent of the Christian Religion. Therefore the Mahometan Learned men call themselves the True Disciples of the Messias.</hi> They further (in the same place) insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate their approbation of the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> above that of <hi>Christianity,</hi> they magnifie the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and <hi>the more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sect of Mahomet,</hi> as the <hi>Saracens</hi> call'd it; and at the same time they represent the <hi>Modern Christianity</hi> (which professes the doctrines of Christ's Incarnation and the Trinity) <hi>no better or other than a sort of Paganism and Heathenism.</hi> These are their very terms, P. 19. and they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to what was said by them before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Trinitarian doctrines are of <hi>Heathen descent and original,</hi> P. 15. and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99330:129"/>
afterwards (to vary the phrase) <hi>of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick Extraction,</hi> P. 16. I appeal now to the Reader whether this be not right <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian,</hi> whether it be not the very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and dialect of the <hi>Polonian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;</hi> which shews that these are iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the <hi>English Unitarians</hi> as to this matter; and at the same time it yields us a true Pourtraiture of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I have been representing to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we should be very careful that we entertain none of their foresaid Opinions. I question not but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would have made this Inference, though I had not. But this I request of him, that he would out of Choice and Judgment do this, as being throughly apprehensive of that <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> which attend those Principles. For this purpose I have display'd them, and I hope that Special Hand of Providence (for I cannot but acknowledg it as such) which directed me to it, will back it with a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, see the tendency of the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> and of the whole mass of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Points to <hi>Atheism.</hi> They vilifie the Scipture, they adulterate the true Meaning of it, they introduce unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99330:130"/>
sentiments concerning God and Religion, they decry the great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Truths of the Gospel, they baffle the apprehensions which we ought to have of a Future State: and what doth all this drive at but the undermining of <hi>Religion,</hi> yea and <hi>Divinity</hi> it self? So fitly was this Question inserted by a <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In his</hi> Introduction for the reading of History.</note> Learned Man, above sixty years ago, among his other <hi>Enquiries</hi> at the end of his <hi>Compendium of Ecclesiastical History, Whether Socinianism be not an Introduction to Atheism?</hi> So truly was it said lately by an Observing Pen, <note n="†" place="bottom">Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Letter to Dr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>In several respects our Socinians seem to be serving the designs of the Atheists.</hi> I wish the Christian world would open their eyes, and see this <hi>betimes,</hi> and thereby prevent the unexpressible Danger which otherwise will unavoidably follow. I offer it to be taken notice of that the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Atheistical</hi> party joyn hand in hand at this time, and agree together in a very friendly manner to laugh at and defie the Fundamental Principles of Religion. Such a Reflection methinks should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to those of the Modern Penmen of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99330:130"/>
the <hi>Socinian</hi> Perswasion who are sober and considerate. They write (whether they know it or no) to please and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the Wild Gallants, those in city and countrey that are of Lewd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or of none at all. Nothing is more evident at this day than that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Writings are highly acceptable to those that espouse the Cause of <hi>Atheism,</hi> to the profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>edly Prophane and Irreligious. These are the men that applaud them, and cry them up, and think they are fraught with great Wit, Argument and Reason. I appeal to Impartial Judges whether this doth not shew the near Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, if not Identity between these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and those I am mentioning. He that doth not see this, sees nothing.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if what I have said sound harsh in these Gentlemens ears, I request them to call to mind how severe they have been in censuring the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> and particularly in charging them with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Though <hi>Slichtingius</hi> and one or two more are unwilling to say in express terms that we are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> yet both he and all the party assert that which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, for they say we worship a mere Figment, a Fancy of our own (for so they blasphemously stile the Holy <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:99330:131"/>
we set up an <hi>Idol</hi> of our own brain for an object of Divine Worship. But our Home-bred Unitarians are yet bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and speak it out without any min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that <note n="*" place="bottom">A Letter to the Clergy of both Universities.</note> 
                  <hi>the Trinitarians are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Pagans, and much worse,</hi> and this they often inculcate. But certainly, to tax us with <hi>Idolatry</hi> when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves professedly <hi>worship a Creature</hi> (as hath been observ'd before) is the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Conceit that ever enter'd into any man's head: the Boldness, Inconsistency and Non-sense of it are so great that we can't sufficiently stand amazed at it.</p>
               <p>Nay, not only <hi>Idolatry</hi> but <hi>Atheism</hi> is laid to our charge. I find that <note n="†" place="bottom">De Trinit Erroribus.</note> 
                  <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> calls the Trinitarians <hi>Atheists</hi> very frequently. And even the <hi>Modern Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> in their late writings expresly fix this Crime upon them, for their words are these concerning the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">A Letter of Resolution concerning the Trinity. p. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>By its natural absurdity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility it did not only at first give a check and stop to the progress of the Gospel, but ever since it hath served to propagate Deism and Atheism.</hi> The doctrine it self cannot
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99330:131"/>
do this without its being urged and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by those that assert it: therefore it is as much as if they had said, Those who defend the <hi>Trinity</hi> propagate Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism. Now, it will not be denied, I think, that those who propagate Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism are <hi>Atheists.</hi> Wherefore according to these men a <hi>Trinitarian</hi> is an <hi>Atheist.</hi> In an <note n="*" place="bottom">Trinitarian Scheme of Religion.</note> other place they say, <hi>he may be justly suspected of Atheism,</hi> and they mention on what account. Others of them tell us that <note n="†" place="bottom">A Letter to the Clergy of both Universities. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatever Zeal the Trinitarians may pretend to have for Religion, they take the right way to make men Scepticks and Atheists.</hi> And the last man that wrote in defence of the Socinian Cause com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of us, that <note n="‖" place="bottom">The Exceptions of Mr. <hi>E.</hi> &amp;c. examin'd. p. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>we make that a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of Religion which contradicts the best reasonings of mankind whereby they prove the existence of God.—Thence loose men deny there is any God at all.</hi> Thus you see what the <hi>Socinian</hi> Charge is against us.</p>
               <p>Whence you may perceive that Mine is but a Counter-Charge, and therefore they have no reason to find fault with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99330:132"/>
the foregoing Retaliation, especially when with the utmost Sincerity I declare that my Charge against them was not founded upon theirs, or occasion'd by it, for it was since the time that I drew up mine against them that I found this Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in some of their Papers. Which may convince any unprejudiced person that what I have said with reference to the Anti-Trinitarians is not in way of Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for I did not know that their Writings had any thing of that nature against those that defend the Trinity. But it was and is from a sense and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the truth of the thing it self, and that alone that I have, and do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thus tax them, and turn their Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy upon themselves. And truly I have done it with a sensible compassion all the while, for I cannot rejoyce (as some seem to do) at finding an occasion of Censuring and Blaming others. I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what I have said to the Consciences of all Sober, Faithful and Judicious Men, all Sincere Lovers of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Let these judg between us and our Adversaries.</p>
               <p>And now, to shut up all, if any one with calmness and sobriety, laying aside all levity and scurrility, all artifice and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99330:132"/>
sophistry, shall offer any thing as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial in way of Reply to what I have said, I shall not be backward to meet him with a Rejoynder. Otherwise I shall not think my self concern'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what he saith. If he appears like a Generous Man of War, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him: but if I see him come on in a <hi>Privateering</hi> way, I tell him before hand, I will make off from him. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to encounter any Fair Adversary, but if any man shall make it his business to cavil and raise trifling Objections against what I have said, I will take no other notice of him than to despise him.</p>
               <p>He must not think that I will throw away my Time and Arguments upon every Squib that is flirted. I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to do than to mind the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of every Goose-quill. In a word, I think not my self obliged to write a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication every time a Perverse Scribler will be dashing Ink against me.</p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS ON Mr. <hi>Bold's SERMON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN half of the sheets of my foregoing Discourse were printed off, my Bookseller sent me a little Piece with Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s name to it: but I presently cast my eye upon the bottom of the Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and there saw that these Papers came from the lower end of <hi>Pater-Noster-Row,</hi> and thence I gather'd who had a hand in them. I found that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> had prevailed with a Gentleman to make a <hi>Sermon</hi> (I thank him for doing me that honour) upon my Refutation of that <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Vindication</hi> of it. Indeed it was a great Master-piece of Procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we can't but think that that Man must speak the Truth, and defend
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99330:135"/>
it very impartially and substantially who is thus brought on to undertake the Cause.</p>
               <p>But truly I am exceedingly oblig'd to the <hi>Penman</hi> for the course he hath taken, for he hath saved me the labour of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Confutation in Mode and Figure, he having himself contradicted the very Proposition which he lays down, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there is but One Point or Article neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believ'd for the making a Man a Christian.</hi> This he pretends to maintain as an undeniable Truth, and yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that <hi>Other Points are necessary to be believ'd.</hi> Serm. page 32. And again, <hi>There are Many Points</hi> (besides this) <hi>which Jesus Christ hath taught and revealed, and which every sincere Christian is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably oblig'd to endeavour to understand.</hi> p. 29. And afterwards, <hi>There are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Points and Articles, which, being known to be reveal'd by Christ, Christians must indispensably assent to.</hi> p. 33. And he reckons up several of these Articles and Propositions, which are the very same which I had mention'd in my <note n="*" place="bottom">The Causes of Atheism. Socinianism unmask'd.</note> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses against the Conceit of <hi>One Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> Now, if there be <hi>Other Points</hi> and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99330:135"/>
                  <hi>Particular Articles,</hi> and those <hi>Many,</hi> which a sincere Christian is obliged, and that <hi>necessarily</hi> and <hi>indispensably</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and believe and assent to, then this Writer doth in effect yield to that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which I maintain'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the belief of One Article is not sufficient to make a Man a Christian,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he runs counter to the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he had laid down. For I bring the business to this issue, If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of one single Article be enough to constitute a Man a Christian, yea a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christian, then the belief of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is not <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,</hi> for though the knowing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of more may be some ornament and embelishment to him, yet it can't be said that it is <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Indispensable,</hi> because nothing is so in Christianity but what contributes to the <hi>making a Man a Christian,</hi> a <hi>Sincere Christian.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it undeniably follows that when this Gentleman acknowledges that there are <hi>More</hi> Articles, than this <hi>One,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be believ'd, and that <hi>Necessarily</hi> and <hi>Indispensably,</hi> he must needs grant that those Articles, which are thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and indispensable, are necessary to <hi>make a Man a Christian,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99330:136"/>
the assenting to that Single Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Jesus is the Messias,</hi> doth not consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a man a <hi>Member of Christ,</hi> or a <hi>True Christian.</hi> For if More Propositions and Articles are <hi>Necessary, Indispensably Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> then that One is not sufficient. This is a plain case, and none but such as are master'd with Prejudice can possibly resist the evidence of it.</p>
               <p>He goes on still to confute himself, saying, <hi>A True Christian must assent unto this, that Christ Jesus is God,</hi> p. 35. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, he <hi>MUST,</hi> he owns here that there is an <hi>absolute Necessity</hi> of this belief. Whereupon I ask him, is this belief ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>to make a Man a Christian,</hi> or not? He cannot say <hi>it is not,</hi> because to believe Him to be <hi>God</hi> who really is so is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing in <hi>Christianity,</hi> it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely requisite to constitute a Man a Christian, a True Christian, for a Man can't be such unless he hath a knowledg of Him that is True God. This surely none will undertake to deny. Hence then it inevitably follows that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor must hold that the assenting to this Proposition, that <hi>Christ Jesus is God,</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>to make a Man a Christian.</hi> And if this be necessary, then something else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the believing of <hi>Jesus to be the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99330:136"/>
(as the Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>his Abettors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and explain that Proposition, for they include not the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ in it) is absolutely necessary <hi>to make a Man a Christian.</hi> Which is the thing that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> denies, and yet we see it is a natural and unavoidable Consequence from what he asserts in his <hi>Sermon.</hi> So that in effect he positively saith, The believing of more than that <hi>One Article</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd is absolutely requisite to make a Man a Christian.</p>
               <p>In another place speaking of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Scripture gives of the <hi>Holy Spirit, viz.</hi> that he is <hi>God,</hi> he adds that <hi>a true Christian is as much obliged to believe this as to believe that Jesus is the Christ,</hi> p. 40. See here the force and energy of Truth, it will make its way through the teeth of those that oppose it. He that had professedly asserted and maintain'd that <hi>the knowledg of this One Point, that Jesus is the Christ, constitutes a person a Christian,</hi> now as plainly and professedly contradicts this Position, by declaring that we are as MUCH obliged to give assent to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Holy Spirit is the True God,</hi> as to that One Point. For this is the case, if a True
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99330:137"/>
Christian be as MUCH obliged to believe one as the other, then 'tis certain that <hi>Christianity</hi> is as <hi>much</hi> concerned in the belief of one as of the other: and if so, then a Man can't be a <hi>Christian</hi> without this belief; whence it irrefragably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the <hi>One Point</hi> he speaks of is not sufficient to <hi>make a Man a Christian:</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he will submit to this Nonsense that a man can be a <hi>Christian,</hi> a <hi>True Christian</hi> though he believe not those things without which he can't be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is sufficient, I suppose, to give you a tast of Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Self-Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the same time of the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness and Groundlessness of the Notion which the Author of the <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of Christianity</hi> hath publish'd to the world. I wish for the sake of this our present Penman, who seems to be a Man that hath some relish of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety, that he had not thus expos'd himself and his Friend toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>There hath been a Pair of Advocates for this Conceit of a <hi>Christian of One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle:</hi> the one a Layman, the other a Churchman: the first a Professed <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> and, having little to say for his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99330:137"/>
Friend, stuff'd his Pamphlet with what <hi>Crellius</hi> afforded him: the latter, you see, (after great study and deliberation) hath made as inconsiderable advances in the Cause; and though he appears in the form of a <hi>Preacher,</hi> yet he hath said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing answerable to the Specious Title of his <hi>Sermon, The true Knowledg of Christ Jesus;</hi> but on the contrary hath said very ill things, to the lessening and impairing, yea to the defaming of that <hi>knowledg</hi> and belief of our Saviour, and of the Articles of <hi>Christianity</hi> which are necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us. From what he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered we may infer that there hath been one Vain Effort more in the world than there was before. And this is his just and deserved Character that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the Cause he undertook, and hath dispatch'd himself and it with his own Weapons unwarily handled.</p>
               <p>But let me address my self to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman a little more closely (if I can speak more closely than I have already:) Verily, Sir, it is strange that a Man of your Sobriety and Temper should be thus easily drawn off, that you should so far debase your self and the Post you are in, as to be Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Journeyman, (he having himself it seems, given over
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99330:138"/>
working at the Trade) that you should accept of the Office of an Under-Puller for <hi>Racovianism.</hi> Was it not enough that the Author of the <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Christianity</hi> had been publickly defended by <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> that he had been approved of and vindicated by the profess'd Votaries and Disciples of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> that he had the good word of all the <hi>Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Neuters</hi> in Religion, that he was caressed and admired by the <hi>Men of Wit</hi> about the Town who make it their business to banter Christianity, and (in a word) that he was cried up by the <hi>Atheistical</hi> and <hi>Debauched,</hi> who as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly railly all <hi>Religion</hi> as the late <hi>Field-Officer</hi> doth <hi>Priests;</hi> was it not enough, I say, that the <hi>Rationalist</hi> found all these to be his Patrons, but must Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> strike in with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and vote this Writer to be the <hi>Christianissimo</hi> (next to LOUIS) of this Age?</p>
               <p>Not that I would be thought to detract in the least from the Gentleman's Worth, for (to give him his due) it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted that he hath a'great share of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> (as his first book he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd sufficiently demonstrates) and of <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> (as his next book testifies)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99330:138"/>
and of <hi>Politicks,</hi> as some late Papers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us, wherein he hath abundantly shew'd how acute and ingenious a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector he is in the point of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> especially <hi>Guinea's</hi> and the <hi>Lowering</hi> of them. But I am not obliged to think that his Talent lies so advantagiously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Theology,</hi> especially <hi>Christianity.</hi> I can't approve of his introducing a <hi>Clipt</hi> Christianity, and thrusting upon us a <hi>False Coin,</hi> a <hi>Counterfeit Stamp</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I cannot (and never will) conceal my dislike of his teaching the men of this too Giddy Age to truck their <hi>Old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> for a New Notion or Fancy of the pretended <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of that <hi>Christianity</hi> which he shapes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>And yet, Sir, you are pleas'd to take part here, and that with no common Zeal. Which strange behaviour, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unaccountable Fascination hath stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd not a few of your Friends and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, who (with my self) own that you have done much Good by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writings, but fear now that you will do as much Harm. The Devout and Pious had other apprehensions of you when they look'd into your <hi>Practical Sermons, Invitations,</hi> and <hi>Meditations;</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:99330:139"/>
and therefore they stand amazed since they have perus'd your late Productions, and observing there that you are come to the <hi>Necessity of but One Article of Faith,</hi> they expect that you may in time hold that <hi>None is Necessary,</hi> which is the scope and design (whether you take notice of it or no) of those that have lately influenc'd upon you. Let me be free with you, and tell you that it is the sense of your Friends that, if your Pen runs for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this strain, you will write rather like a <hi>Turkish Spy</hi> than a <hi>Christian Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> I beseech you therefore, Sir, by all that is good and sacred, and by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which you have heretofore gain'd among the Religious and Pious, that you would not dissemble with your self, and choak your inward Perswasions, and abuse your self and the world too. I wish with all my heart that you would account with your self for this late <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding,</hi> and consider how scandalous it will be when your Auditors and Readers shall find that you are sailing to <hi>Racovia</hi> with a side-wind. I beg of you by the bonds of our most Holy Christianity that you would, whilst it is time, prevent a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Apostacy.</hi> Wear not the detestable Character of a <hi>Renegade.</hi> Sir, I most
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99330:139"/>
passionately request you to ponder that smart and upbraiding Query which our Blessed Saviour used to some of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> when he saw that they <hi>went back, Will Ye also go away?</hi> John 6. 67.

               <head>REFLECTIONS ON THE Animadversions.</head>
               <p>LET us come next to the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions</hi> which are tack'd to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And truly I am inclined to clear the Gentleman under whose name this Pamphlet goes from being the Composer of this part of the book. I can scarcely believe that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> would offer such a Crude and Shallow thing to the publick: but I am partly of the mind that these <hi>Animadversions</hi> were transmitted to him, and he was desired to publish them as his own, that it might be said (which was never said before) that a Man with a <hi>Name,</hi> and with Open face, that one without a Vizour warranted the late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity;</hi> that it might be said that a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> the Reverend <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Steeple</hi> vouched these strange notions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:99330:140"/>
But I must needs say I do not take him to be the <hi>Animadverter:</hi> one reason of which Conjecture is because I have heard that these very Objections and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which are here used were made use of by the <hi>Party,</hi> and therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that though they appear under the name of <hi>S. B.</hi> yet they might more truly have had <hi>J. L.</hi> or <hi>A.</hi> &amp; <hi>J. C.</hi> (who took care to send them) prefix'd to them.</p>
               <p>I will likewise offer other probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which may induce any Considering man to think that the person who made the <hi>Sermon</hi> was not the Author of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions:</hi> for first I appeal to any man that knows the <hi>Difference of Stiles,</hi> whether this be not observable in these two Pieces. Indeed when Different matters are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the same Writer, there may be a great inequality in the Strain, but it is never or very rarely observ'd when the same Subject is handled by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as is pretended in the present case. Secondly, There is this Mark to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the first part of the book from the latter, the one is printed in two different Characters, all along the words and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which <hi>Mr. B.</hi> thought were more Emphatick or Remarkable than the rest are put in a Letter which distinguishes
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99330:141"/>
them from the other words and sentences in his Discourse. But you may observe that there is not this Distinction in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> they (like the <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Christianity</hi> and its <hi>Vindication)</hi> are (excepting a very few places) all in the same Character. It is not the way of that Author in his Writings to distinguish words, or express their Emphasis by the difference of Letters. This to me is no inconsiderable thing, for you scarcely find any Author of late that writes after that manner. However, we may be almost sure that this part of the book is not Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s, for the same Author in the same book would not Vary as to this thing we are speaking of, as we see here done.</p>
               <p>Again, Thirdly, you can't but take notice that the <hi>Animadversions</hi> are printed in a Larger and Fairer Character than the <hi>Sermon:</hi> which thing you will seldom or never find in the same book, written by the same Author, and upon the same Subject, and printed together. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers Mr. <hi>B</hi> to have no title to the latter part of this Undertaking, and it likewise discovers the Imprudence of the <hi>Publisher</hi> who would suffer those Papers to come into the world with such apparent marks
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99330:141"/>
whereby they may be known to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by two different persons, and yet at the same time would have but <hi>One Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's</hi> Name to the whole.</p>
               <p>Add to all this that unsufferable Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the <hi>Epistle to the Reader</hi> before the <hi>Animadversions</hi> (which we may suppose was made for Mr. <hi>B.) When the book against the Reasonableness of Christianity fell into my hands</hi> (faith this Writer) <hi>I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came to be furnish'd with a truer and more just notion of the main design of my own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise or Sermon than I had upon my looking over it cursory</hi> (I suppose he would have said <hi>cursorily) presently after it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd:</hi> as if the <hi>design</hi> of his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise could be made known to him by an other Man's Writings. Which carries that Inconsistency and even Nonsense with it which I believe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not own himself to be the Author of, and therefore I cannot but impute it to that Jumble of two Writers in this Volume, which confounded the <hi>Epistolizer</hi>'s noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and made him discover, before he was aware, that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> was not the True Parent of this off-spring to which the Epistle is prefix'd. No, no: he that drew up this Epistle had some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>King of Ham.</hi> Here
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99330:142"/>
is strong Fancying and Personating, here is direct Counterfeiting and Falsify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They have made a Tool of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and under the shelter of a <hi>Clergyman</hi>'s Name have impos'd their notions upon the Reader.</p>
               <p>But whoever was the Author of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> I will make a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon them, and with that <hi>Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Temper</hi> which the <hi>Epistolizer</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to be in my <hi>former productions,</hi> but insinuates is wanting in my latter ones. As to which I have only this to say to him, I can be Deemed to be too warm a writer by none but such as are too Cold and Phlegmatick. The The <hi>Animadverter</hi> hints that <hi>I give vent to something to which he will not adventure to assign a proper name</hi> p. 32: but though he will not do this latter, I will, that is, I sincerely protest to him and the Reader that I intend to give vent to <hi>Truth</hi> (and that only) which hath been smother'd and stiffled by him in his late undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the <hi>One Article.</hi> My business shall be to shew in brief by what Weak and Impertinent Methods he hath done this.</p>
               <p>The Proposition which he would be thought to patronize is this, that <hi>Jesus and his Apostles did not teach any thing as
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99330:142"/>
necessary to be believ'd to make a man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian but only this One Proposition, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of Nazareth was the Christ or the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi> Animadv. p. 1. but he maintains this Post with as little success as the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Gentleman did, for afterwards he declares it his opinion, that <hi>a Convert to Christianity</hi> (i. e. <hi>a Christian,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it in another place) <hi>must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe as many Articles as he shall attain to know that Christ Jesus hath taught.</hi> p. 21. which wholly invalidates what he had said before, for if a Christian <hi>must</hi> give assent to all the Articles taught by our Saviour in the Gospel, and that <hi>necessarily,</hi> then all those Propositions reckon'd up in my late Discourse, being taught by Christ or his Apostles, are <hi>necessarily</hi> to be blieved, and consequenly <hi>One</hi> Point only is not necessary. But he will say, the belief of those Propositions <hi>makes not a man a Christian.</hi> Then I say, they are not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> and (as the other Gentleman adds) <hi>Indispensable:</hi> they may be said to be Useful and Convenient, but he can't pronounce them <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,</hi> for what is of absolute <hi>Necessity</hi> in Christianity is absolutely requisite <hi>to make a Man a Christian.</hi> Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that from his own words, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99330:143"/>
there is no foundation for this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Jesus and his Apostles taught nothing as necessary to be believed to make a Man a Christian, but only this One Article that Jesus was the Christ:</hi> and therefore this Animadverter contradicts himself. And who can expect any other, when he takes no care of what he saith himself, and minds not what others suggest in this matter. It is worth the Readersob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that notwithstanding I had in <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In</hi> Socinianism Unmask'd.</note> twelve pages together <hi>(viz.</hi> from the 8th to the 20th) proved that Several Propositions are necessary to be believ'd by us in order to our being Christians, yet this <hi>Sham-Animadverter</hi> attends not to any one of the Particulars which I had mention'd, nor offers any thing against them, but only in a Lumping way dooms them all in these Magisterial Words, <hi>I do not see any Proof he produceth,</hi> p. 21. This is his wonderful way of Confuting me, by pretending that he can't see any Argument or Proof in what I alledg; and all the world must be led by his Eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus, though I had in five or six pages together evinced this Truth, that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99330:143"/>
                  <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the Messias</hi> are not terms of the very same signification, nay that among the <hi>Jews</hi> they were not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd so (as I made appear from several Texts; especially <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37.) yet after all I have this for my pains, <hi>I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> saith he, <hi>that he</hi> (meaning <hi>me) pretends to offer the least proof that these Terms were not synonymous among the Jews,</hi> p. 47. yet he doth not so much as offer one syllable to disprove what I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and closely urg'd on that head thro' the greatest part of a Chapter. This is the guise of our Sagacious <hi>Animadverter.</hi> He out-doth the famous <hi>Gladiator</hi> (whom <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> tells us of) that was wont to blunt the Edg of all his Adversaries Weapons only with looking upon them, but this Marvelous Fencer doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>seeing</hi> or <hi>perceiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when I had reduced the sum of my Discourse into a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> he tells me <hi>I there stop, whereas I should have proceeded to prove that Jesus Christ or his Apostles taught that no Man can be a Christian, or shall be saved unless he hath an explicit knowledg of all those things which have immediate respect to the Occasion, Author, Way, Means and Issue of our Salvation, and which are necessary for our knowing the true nature and design of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99330:144"/>
it,</hi> p. 23, 24. And yet the Reader may satisfie himself that this is the very thing that I had been proving just before, and indeed all along in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therefore it was not necessary to add any Farther <hi>Medium,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another <hi>Syllogism,</hi> I having secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Proposition before. Yet the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Gentleman tells me, <hi>I here stop:</hi> which may convince the Intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he eares not what he saith.</p>
               <p>It may be guess'd from what he hath the confidence to say p. 31, <hi>viz. There is no enquiry in</hi> the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity <hi>concerning Faith subjectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, but only objectively,</hi> namely, <hi>with what sort of Faith the Articles of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are to be believed,</hi> I say it may be gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from this what a Liberty this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter takes to assert what he pleases; for let any man consult p. 191, 192 in that Treatise, and he shall find that the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Faith</hi> is spoken of (though not there call'd <hi>Subjective)</hi> but it is very much mistaken and perverted. Again, how can this <hi>Animadverter</hi> come off with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily declaring that <hi>subjective faith is not enquir'd into</hi> in the Treatise of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> when in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place p. 35, 36 he avers that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99330:144"/>
Faith and Christianity consider'd sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively are the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a Mighty Arguer doth he shew himself to be when, to what I said and fully proved in my fourth Chapter of <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> he most gravely and profoundly replies, <hi>I think it needless for me to say any thing to it.</hi> p. 30. And further this Great Disputant shews his Parts in another very clever way that he hath of dealing with me, and that is this, when he finds something that he dares not Object against, he thus shifts me off, <hi>His Reasoning is to me,</hi> saith he, <hi>so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ouded by his way of expressing himself, that I am too Dull to perceive what his Reasons are, and wherein the Strength of them doth lie,</hi> p. 9. And again, concerning a whole Chapter he thus pronounces, <hi>I shall say no more of it,</hi> saith he, <hi>but that my Dullness is such I can't discern the least appearance of reasoning in it,</hi> p. 49. Here is nothing tolerable or excuseable in all this but this one thing, his Truth and Modesty in confessing himself to be <hi>Dull,</hi> which yet the Reader was convinc'd of before this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
               <p>The Reader cannot but take notice that in the other parts of this Author's <hi>Animadversions</hi> he makes it his whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99330:145"/>
either merely to Repeat what he pleases in the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> or the <hi>Vindication</hi> of it, and to vouch it with much confidence, or else when he alledges any thing that I have asserted to throw it off by barely denying what I say. This is the great Excellency which this Gentleman is admirable for.</p>
               <p>Thus you see the genius of this Writer, you see what weak and sorry <hi>Stuff</hi> (to return him his own words) he troubles the Press with. He doth not make any offers of Reason, there is not the least shadow of an Argument; he scorns to pretend to any thing of that nature. One would think a man might be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear in the world with such Poor Tackling. As if he were only hired to say something against me, tho not at all to the purpose. And truly any Man may discern a Mercenary Stroke all along.</p>
               <p>I seriously advise him (whoever he is) not to enter the Lists again unless he be better provided: for I find that persons are more confirm'd than ever in the Truth of what I have writ, since such Dablers as himself, set on by a parcel of <hi>Polonian</hi> Squires and a few <hi>Town-Sparks,</hi> have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to oppose my Assertions. If a Score of such Easie Writers as this were
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99330:145"/>
all upon me at once, I could bear it very well. A Man need not fear being hurt by such Feeble Scribes, who make it their main business to confute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not me. And hereby (we thank them) they promote our Cause (which is that of Truth) and even with their own Pens baffle those Errors which they are the Authors of, as Scorpions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers afford Antidotes against the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs they cause.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiss to take notice of some things in the Close of the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi> for here seems to be a parting blow of Wit in our Author; which being a mighty <hi>Rarity (i. e.</hi> in the stile of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Noster-Row</hi> a <hi>Black Swan)</hi> with this sort of Writers, it must not be omitted. And out of respect to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I will the rather take notice of it, because though this Reverend Author was not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (they coming into his hands) he might prick in here and there a fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>The Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> saith he, <hi>will as certainly be the cause of much mischief as</hi> Tenterton-Steeple <hi>was the cause of</hi> Goodwin Sands, p. 49. Look you what a dainty piece of Ingenuity is borrow'd from an Old Thread-bare Saw.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99330:146"/>
But it is quite spoilt when I have told him that it is an Other <hi>Steeple</hi> (that in <hi>Dorsetshire)</hi> from whence we may justly fear such <hi>Sands</hi> and <hi>Shelfs</hi> on which the Christian Faith will be endanger'd to be shipwrackt.</p>
               <p>But there is another Ingenious Touch, p. 52. <hi>The Men of Art in all the Parties are agreed not to speak favourably of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of Christianity.</hi> But who are these <hi>Men of Art?</hi> Ay, there lies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Not to hold the Reader in suspense, these <hi>Men of Art</hi> (written in Letters dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the rest, and thence we may guess the Author of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> which is mark'd and distinguish'd after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, had a hand in it) are <hi>University Men,</hi> or Men of <hi>University-Education,</hi> whom a late Writer exposes because they are not adjusted to <hi>his,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 145, 158, 162, 164.</note> 
                  <hi>Thoughts of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Again, These <hi>Men of Art</hi> are the General Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they are the far Greatest Part of those that <hi>dissent</hi> from our Church in the point of Discipline and Ceremonies. They are all the Sober Heads of both these Perswasions, who unite in the Main <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> profess'd and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99330:146"/>
subscrib'd to by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nay, they are the Whole Body of the <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad as well as at home. These are the <hi>Men of Art,</hi> who by this Gentleman's friends are at other times call'd <hi>Systematick-Men,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Mystery-Men,</hi> and by way of derision <hi>Orthodox.</hi> These are the <hi>Men of Art</hi> who are also so called you must know in Contradistinction to the <hi>Plain Fellows,</hi> for so the Racovians stile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Treatise of the <hi>Trinitarian Scheme of Religion.</hi> But when this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith <hi>these men of Art are in an Evil Conspiracy,</hi> what is the meaning of that? It is no other than this, that they joyntly agree to disallow of and condemn a late upstart Conceit, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the belief of One sole Article of Christianity is sufficient not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to denominate but to constitute any Man a Christian.</hi> Now, would not a Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man perswade himself that this Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Concurrence of all the Learned, Wise, Sober and Religious in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is rather to be deemed a <hi>Happy Union</hi> than a <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> and that an <hi>Evil</hi> one?</p>
               <p>And whereas this Writer tells us that the book of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is of eminent use to overthrow and ruine Faction,</hi> p. 51, I must needs declare that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99330:147"/>
I'm of the contrary opinion, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have abundantly proved, in a late <note n="*" place="bottom">Socinianism Unmask'd.</note> Discourse I publish'd, that the Notions which the Treatise of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> is fraught with administer to <hi>Faction,</hi> and something <hi>Worse</hi> amongst us, which I have been warning the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of in the preceding Discourse.</p>
               <p>The short is, this Gentleman and I can't agree about Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s Book, for he at least <hi>saith</hi> (for we are not certain of his <hi>Thoughts)</hi> and that without any Proof, that <hi>it is one of the best books that hath been publish'd for at least these sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years,</hi> p. 52: but I'm of opinion, and I'm sure I have Proved it, that it is one of the Worst that hath appear'd in the world since the date of Christianity.</p>
