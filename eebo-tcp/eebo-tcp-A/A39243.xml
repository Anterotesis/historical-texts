         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Iuſtices ſhall not therefore ceaſe to doe right in

            <p>For the underſtanding of this Statute.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Iudiciall proceedings by the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>
according to conſcience and equity, is not any
diſturbance, or delay of Common right.</p>
            <p>But is the doing of right and Iuſtice in caſes, which
the common Law cannot helpe, for common right
ſtandeth not only in the ſtrict rigour, and extreamity
of the Law (for often <hi>ſummum ius oft ſumma injuria)</hi>
but rather in the doing of right, according to equity
and conſcience: And the Iudges of the common
Law themſelves, doe almoſt every day extend their
diſcretion, to ſtay and mittigate the rigour and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the common Law: and in ſo doing doe, well
notwithſtanding the ſtrict word of their oath.</p>
            <p>Declareth the law concerning writs of ſearch,<note place="margin">Stat. 14. Ed. 3. Cap. 14.</note> and
in the end of the ſame Statute, theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That
by commandement of the great Seale, noe Privie
Seale, nor point of this Statute, (viz. concerning
Search) ſhall be put in delay.</p>
            <p>Nor that the Iuſtices, of whatſoever place they be,
ſhall lett to do the common law by commandement,
which come to them under the Great Seale or Privie
Seale.</p>
            <p>The Common Law hath alwaies allowed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the Chancery, in caſes of conſcience and
<pb facs="tcp:94355:4"/>
equity; and therfore the words (to doe the Common
law) muſt not be conſtrued too preciſely, as thereby
ſtop all Courts of equity, for it ſtandeth with the
common law, as well that equity and conſcience bee
miniſtred, where the common law cannot helpe, as
that ſtrict Iuſtice be miniſtred according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law, when the common law may ſerve.</p>
            <p>The Chancery doth not commonly ſend any Writ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
or Commandement to the Iudges, under the great
Seale co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to ſtay to do Iuſtice, but awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Iniunction to the parties, that ſeeke to have the
advantage of the ſtrictneſſe of the common law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
equity and conſcience: nevertheleſſe there be
plentiful examples that Writs of <hi>ſuper ſedeas,</hi> under the
great Seale have beene directed to the Iudges, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſpeciall cauſes, and have in all times (untill of
late) beene dutifully obeyed, as in caſes of priviledge
and to ſtay their proceedings: <hi>Reges in conſulto</hi> and
divers others, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is to bee remembred, that many Iudges of
the common Law have complayned, and ſued for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in the Chancery; and have beene ſued and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
there, and obeyed the orders of that Court in
caſes of equitie and conſcience, which could not bee
relieved by the Common law.</p>
            <p>This Statute is perſuing two former <hi>Stat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stat. 42. Ed. 3. cap. 3.</note> one 37.
<hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. which giveth <hi>paenam Talionis,</hi> againſt
thoſe, which make falſe ſuggeſtions to the King: the
other 38. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. which confirmeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſtatute in all things ſaving <hi>pro paena Talionis.</hi> And
this 42. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. explayneth the two former, and
provideth that the people be not greived by falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
which doe often times make their accuſements
more for vengeance and ſingular profits then for the
<pb facs="tcp:94355:5"/>
profits of the King and his people, and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth
that none bee put to anſwer (which is to bee
intended upon ſuch accuſation and falſe ſuggeſtions)
without. 1. preſentment before Iuſtices, or 2. matters
of Record, 3 by due proceſſe, or 4. by Writ originall
according to the onely law of the land.</p>
            <p>In this Statute, the intent is to bee conſidered,
firſt to explaine, the ſecond former ſtatute <hi>Anno</hi> 27.
<hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and <hi>Anno</hi> 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. as is before noted, 2.
that the antient law of the land bee obſerve, that is;
That for matters determinable by the common law,
none bee put to anſwer, but by preſentments or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Record, or by originall Writt, or by due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
But therein is not meant, that the ordinarie iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
proceedings in the Chancery, in matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and conſcience (not being remediable by the
Statutes of the common law) ſhould be taken away
or reſtrained: But that in ſuch caſes, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
againſt parties called in by due proceſſe, for
that is according to the antient law of the land.</p>
            <p>So the practiſe and experience hath beene ever
ſince, which is the true and certaine interpretation of
that Statute and of all other Statutes.</p>
            <p>The words be theſe:<note place="margin">Stat. 4. Hen. 4. Cap. 23.</note> Whereas as well in plea Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or as in plea perſonall after Iudgement given in
the Courts of our Soveraigne Lord the King, the
parties be made to come upon greivous paines ſome
time before the Kings Councell, &amp; ſometime in the
Parliament to anſwer therof anew, to the impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the parties aforeſaid, and ſubvertion of the
Common Law of the Land: It is ordained and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
that after Iudgement given in the Court of
our Soveraigne Lord the King, the parties and their
Heires thereof ſhall be in peace untill the Iudgement
<pb facs="tcp:94355:5"/>
ſhall bee undone by attaint, or by errour, if there bee
errour, as hath beene uſed by the Lawes in the time
of the Kings progenitors.</p>
            <p>For underſtanding of this Statute the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is,</p>
            <p>Whether there be any thing in the word or intent
of this Statute to take away, or reſtraine, or impeach
the Iuriſdiction of the Chancery to give remedy and
releife according to conſcience and equity in caſes,
which cannot bee remedied by the ſtrict rules of the
common law, by attaint, or by Writ of errour.</p>
            <p>For the reſolving of this queſtion, is to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
what hath beene uſed by the lawes, before the
making of this Statute.</p>
            <p>And to this point I muſt ſay, I have not ſeene any
record or Preſident, that the Court of Chancery hath
beene reſtrayned to heare and determine cauſes of
conſcience and equity, and to give reliefe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as well after, as before Iudgement given by the
Judges of the Common Law.</p>
            <p>But before the making of this Statute;<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n. Stat. 29.</note> there bee
many precedents and records to prove,<note place="margin">Ed. 3. cap. 1.</note> that the King
and his Councell, and the Kings Commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be auditors <hi>querelarum</hi> &amp; Court of Rome,
&amp; ſome, pretending to have power and authority for
the Pope, did take upon them to examine ſuch Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to reverſe and undoe the ſame, which ſeemeth
to be the point remedied by this Statute: And this
is within the direct and preciſe words of the Statute,
whereupon it may be inferred and concluded, that is
the words ſhall bee taken preciſely in the ſtrict
<pb facs="tcp:94355:6"/>
ſence; Then the King himſelfe and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and the Parliament, who in time of the Kings
progenitors, uſed to examine &amp; reverſe Iudgements,
ſhall be bound and reſtrained by the <hi>Statute;</hi> But the
Chancery medleth not with the reverſing of the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments
given by the Iudges of the common Law, but
in allowing the ſame to be good and juſt, according to
the ſtrict rule of the Common Law (whereunto the
Iudges are ſworne) doth examine only the equity
of the caſe, according to the rule of equity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and taketh order with the partie, to doe that
which in equity and Conſcience ought to bee done,
which the Iuſtices of the Common Plees hath no
power to doe, and that ſeemeth to be the true reaſon
that the Statute doth not once mention the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
            <p>And it cannot reaſonably be conceived, that the
Parliament meant to bind the Chancery (which is
not named) or the King or his Counſell and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
it ſelfe, which are expreſſely named: That
they ſhould not releive parties that are greived by the

this Statute, and all other Statutes, this rule ſhould be
obſerved: 1. to underſtand, and conſider what was the
miſcheife at the Common Law, which the Parliament
meant to remedie within this Statute. It appeareth to
have beene the reverſing and undoing of Iudgements
by the King or his Counſell, or his Commiſſioners or
Parliament, which might and ought to be examined
by attaint or errour, as is aforeſaid, but not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Iuditiall proceedings in Chancery, according to
equity and conſcience to give releife to the partie
grieved, by the ſtrict rigour of the Common Law or
in caſes which could not be remedied by attaint or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or by any other ordinarie meanes by courſe of
the Common Law, and where they in that equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
proceeding did not attempt to reverſe or impeach
the judgement given by the Common Law, but to
admit and allow the ſame to be good and juſt, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared.</p>
            <p>The next is how this Statute was underſtood and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
expounded at, and ſoone after the tyme of the making
of that, for in all caſes <hi>contemporanea expoſitio</hi> is ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be regarded: and for it (as I ſaid before) I have
not ſeene any Record or Precedent that this Statute
hath beene expounded to reſtraine the Chancery, to
proceede in their ordinary courſes, to give releife in
caſes of equity, according to good conſcience. Nere
the time of the making of it, or many yeares after.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe no ſuch materiall or effectuall record
or precedent can be ſhewed. And for later times as
in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and ſince, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb facs="tcp:94355:7"/>
and examples bee ſo frequent, and ſo plaine
&amp; direct, as nothing is more common; and it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and true rule <hi>Intellectus currit cum praxi.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And if any ambiguity, or doubt ſhould bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon the words and intent of this Statute, ſith it
concernes the juriſdiction of the Kings Courts, which
have no power, nor authority but from the King
whom they ſerve. One Court ought not to take upon
them to Iudge and deſide their owne Iuriſdiction, and
the Iuriſdiction of another of the Kings Courts: But
then <hi>Bractons</hi> rule is to be holden:<note place="margin">Bracton. lib. 2. fol. 34.</note> (that is) that the
King's interpretation is to be expected, Who is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and expound all doubtfull or obſcure words in

Lords Spirituall and Temporall,<note place="margin">22. Edw. 3.</note> and the Commons.</p>
            <p>And where ſome new conceits have beene lately
imagined, that the partie grieved ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
before Iudgement or elſe not to be heard or
relieved after Iudgement by reaſon of this Statute.
This is but a cavill and a Sophiſticall diſtinction not
worthie the anſwering. For before hee bee hurt, he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hath no cauſe to complaine, &amp; that, which hurts him,
is the Iudgement grounded upon the ſtrickteneſſe &amp;
rigour of the Common Law, againſt equity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and when he feeles the wound, it is time for
him to complaine to ſeeke remedie, by complaining
of the wrong, which is done unto him by the rigour
of the Common Law, contrary to equity and a good
conſcience, and of this ſort be the precedents and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Laſtly it is to bee lamented that the antient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawes are ſo much neglected and contemned,
<pb facs="tcp:94355:7"/>
and almoſt growne obſolete and out of uſe: that for

Iudges to take mature conſideration of it. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
I will ſay nothing.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let the Iudges now conſider, how they
obſerve in their Courts and proceedings, the words
and intent of this Statute, whether after Iudgements
the parties be in peace, untill the Iudgement bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done

Iudgement without attaint or errour to the manifeſt
deluding of the true and antient Maximes of the
common Law, and without regarding of the words
of the Statute. And thus ſuites for one, and the ſelfe

            <p>Both theſe Statutes were ſpecially provided
to reſtraine the uſurpation of the Pope, and the

and reſervations.</p>
            <p>By the Statute <hi>Anno</hi> 27.<note place="margin">Stat. 27. Ed. 3. Cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Edward</hi> 3. it appeareth,
That notwithſtanding the two former ſtatutes <hi>Anno</hi>
25. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. yet the uſurpation of the Pope, and the
Church of Rome, was ſo exorbitant, that the Nobles
and Commons complained in this Parliament, and
prayed further remedie for the ſame, alledging that
divers of the people have beene drawne out of the
Realme, to anſwer of things whereof Counſance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
to the Kings Court, or of things whereof
Iudgements be given in the Kings Court, or which
ſue in another Court, to defeate or impeach the
Iudgements given in the Kings Court, in prejudice
and diſheriſon of the King and his Crowne, and of
all the people of his Realme, and the undoing and
diſtraction of the Common Law of the ſame Realme
at all times vſed.</p>
            <p>This is the Miſchiefe, which was complained of and
was deſired to be remedied.</p>
            <p>The Offenders, againſt whom remedie is ſought, are
theſe, which draw any out of the Realme by plea.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the Counſance being to the Kings Court
or of things, wherof Iudgements be given in the Kings
Court, or which doe ſue in another Court, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
<pb facs="tcp:94355:9"/>
or impeach the Iudgements given in the Kings
Court.</p>
            <p>Then the remedie provided is,</p>
            <p>That ſuch offenders ſhall receive puniſhment by
two moneths, to be before the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
or in his Chancery, or before the Kings Iuſtices
of the one Bench or other, or before the Iuſtices of
the King, which to the ſame ſhall bee deputed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

done in this behalfe, and if they come not, then to be
out of the Kings Protection, &amp;c. Provided, that
when they doe come before, they be out-lawed, they
ſhall be received to anſwer.</p>
            <p>Now it will appeare manifeſtly that the intent of
the Parliament, was not to reſtraine or puniſh any
that complayned and ſued in the Chancery, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
according to equity and Conſcience; In Caſes
wherein, by the ſtrict rules and rights of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

not releive them, neither are there any words in the

their uſurpation in the Caſes mentioned in the

further in drawing the people out of the Realme to

the Kings Court, or of things whereof Iudgements
bee given in the Kings Court, or by ſuit in another
Court, to defeate or impeach the Iudgements given
in the Kings Court; In prejudice, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the preamble, wherein this miſcheife is declared,
it appeareth that the drawing of the people out of the
Realme to anſwer to thoſe Caſes, ſpecially remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
was the greife of the people, for which they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
remedie.</p>
            <p>But by ſuites in the Chancery to be relieved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to equity and conſcience in caſes, in which the
Iudges of the Common Law could not give remedy,
the people were not driven out of the Realme, nor
Iudgement given in the Kings Courts, were not
ſought to be defeated or impeached, but conſcience
and equity to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>Nor ſuch ſuites in the Chancery cannot bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
to be any other court then the Kings Court;
For the <hi>Chancery</hi> is one of the Kings ſupreame Courts
of Iuſtice, and as much or more greived by the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
uſurpation of the Pope and his Courts as any
other of the Kings Courts: Neither could ſuch ſuits
in the <hi>Chancery</hi> being the Kings own ſupreame court,
bee in prejudice or diſheriſon of the King and his
Crowne, and of his people; or the undoing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Common Law at all times uſed; And
I ſuppoſe there can no record or warrantable prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
be ſhewed that ſuch proceedings in the <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
hath in times before uſed (that is before. 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.)
Beene conſtrued to be the undoing or deſtruction of
the Common Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94355:10"/>
And hereupon it may bee inferred and concluded,
that thoſe, which complaine and ſue in the <hi>Chancery</hi>
for releife and remedie, according to equity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
in ſuch caſes as the Iudges of the Common
Law cannot remedie, are not any offenders within
the words or meaning of this Statute.</p>
            <p>And this will appeare more plainely by the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which is provided; that is, that the offenders ſhall
have garniſhment by two moneths, to appeare before
ſuch Iudges, as are aſſigned to give remedie in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
before mentioned in the Statute, which are theſe:
The King and his Counſell the Chan. the Iuſtices
of one Bench or the other, or other Iuſtices of the
Kings, which ſhall be deputed.</p>
            <p>Wherein is to be noted, that the Chancery is the
ſecond Court that is appointed to give Iuſtice againſt
ſuch offenders, as the Parliament meant, and is placed
next after the King and his Councell, and before the
Iudges of the one Bench or the other (between whom
the Parliament giveth no prioritie nor precedent) &amp;
addeth ſuch other Iuſtices as the King ſhal depute: By
which power the King may by the Statute exclude
both theſe Courts, &amp; appoint other Iuſtices, if it ſhall
pleaſe him ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Now it is too abſurd to ſay or imagine that
the ordinarie and juditiall proceedings in the
<hi>Chancery</hi> by the Kings owne Authority, in caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred can be in prejudice or diſheriſion of
the King or his Crowne or deſtruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; or that the Parliament did ſo meant or
underſtand, ſithe they have deſigned the <hi>Chancery</hi> to
bee a ſpeciall or prime Court to puniſh offenders
againſt the ſaid Statute.</p>
            <p>And to reſort to the true rule <hi>Contemporanea expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94355:10"/>
for <hi>Intellectus currit cum praxi.</hi> I have not ſeene
nor heard that any perſon hath beene charged, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
by ſuit in the nature of a Praemunire upon
this Statute for ſueing in the Chancery in the Caſes
before remembred, or in any other like caſes.</p>
            <p>The Statute 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was grounded upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
uſurpations of the Pope and Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which were in ſome ſort provided for, by the
former Statutes <hi>An.</hi> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. But the Parliament
<hi>Anno</hi> 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. finding the ſame too weake, and the
Church of Rome did not only continue their former
uſurpations, but did daily increaſe the ſame more
and more, did therefore deviſe further remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their inſolent and outragious exceſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherein appeareth that the ſpeciall mark, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
both thoſe Parliaments aymed &amp; directed their
Actions, was to provide and give remedy againſt
the wicked proceedings of the Pope and Court of
Rome, and not to reſtraine the juriſdiction and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of any of the Kings owne Courts in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
and juditiall proceedings, either in law or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by that, which is before remembred, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declared, yet the ſame is made more manifeſt
by the Statute <hi>Anno</hi> 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Stat. 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>By which it appeareth that in 9. yeares ſpace, after
the Parliament <hi>An.</hi> 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the Pope and Church of
Rome ceaſed not to goe on ſtill in their wicked and
inormious uſurpations upon the king &amp; the Crown,
and therefore that Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
plainely, that it was the Court of Rome, that
dealt in caſes, whereof the Counſance and ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions
pertaine to the King and his Royall Court;
and for remedie thereof ordaineth, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Statute made <hi>Anno</hi> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and <hi>Anno</hi> 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
<pb facs="tcp:94355:11"/>
ſhall be in all things affirmed and executed, adding
alſo ſome further puniſhments and proviſions againſt
the offenders, directing the proceeding therein to be
before the King and his Councell, onely without
mentioning any other Courts, as 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. did.</p>
            <p>So as upon conferring together theſe three Statutes
viz. 25. 27. and 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it appeareth that the intent
of al theſe Parliaments was onely to puniſh offenders,
that maintained the uſurped and pretended authority
of the Pope, &amp; Church of Rome, and proſecuted any
Action or ſute by vertue of the ſame in any caſe,
whereof the Counſance and finall diſcuſſing pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the King and his Courts; And therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doubt bee conceived upon any words in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it is to be explained by the Statute 25.
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. going before, and the Statute 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
after.</p>
            <p>After all theſe Statutes,<note place="margin">Stat. 16. Ric. 2. Cap. 5.</note> yet ambitious uſurpers,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And alſo that the Pope did ordaine and purpoſe to

which the king ſhould bee deſtitute of his Councell;
<pb facs="tcp:94355:11"/>
and the treaſure of the Realme to bee made away out
of the Realme, and ſo the Regality &amp; Crowne ſhould
be made ſubject to the Pope in perpetuall diſtruction
of the King and his Crowne, and all the Realme.</p>
            <p>In which caſes, and in all other caſes attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, his Crowne, and Regalitie, the Lords
Temporall and Commons, did promiſe to ſtand with

the Lords Spirituall promiſed alſo, to ſtand with the

caſes bound by their alleagiance with a ſpeciall prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation

of Biſhops, and tranſlating of Prelates,
according to the Lawes of the holy Church, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is ordained and inacted, that if any purchaſe

ſuch tranſlations, proceſſes, and ſentences of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,

touch the King, againſt him, his Crowne and Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

bring or receive the ſame within the Realme, or make
thereof notification or any other execution within, or
without that they, &amp;c. ſhal forfit, &amp;c. and to be put out
of the Kings protection, &amp; be attached, &amp;c. and ſue in
proceſſe of Premunire, &amp;c. And againſt others, which
ſue in other courts in derogation of the Kings royaltie.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth plainely, that the Pope and
Court of Rome continued ſtill, and proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their exorbitant uſurpatiou upon the Crowne
and Kings Royaltie, and the common Lawes of the
Kingdome; So this Parliament endavoured to meete
with, and ſtand with the ſame, namely in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
caſes, which are ſpecially mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Iudgements given in the Kings Court in
<pb facs="tcp:94355:12"/>
theſe pleas and caſes, and in tranſlating of Prelates
&amp;c. and in other caſes attempted againſt the Kings
Crowne and Regality; But it is manifeſt, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and the ſcope and drift of the Parliament was
onely againſt the Pope and Court of Rome, and
againſt thoſe perſons, that perſue any ſuch Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
proceſſe, &amp;c. or other things, which touch the
King, or againſt his Crown, or Regality or his Realme
as is aforeſaid, and which being, notifie or execute the
ſame within the Realme or without, theſe be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which the Parliament had cauſe, and meant to
puniſh; and it is ſtrange and improbable that any
learned Iudge of the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
ſhould ſtretch or extend the words of this Statute
further, then only againſt the uſurped aurhority of the
Pope, and Church of Rome; But it ſeemeth that
ſome that take pleaſure <hi>ludere in vorbis, dormitare in
ſenſibus,</hi> and to diſpute <hi>de apicibus juris, equi &amp; boni ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
praetermiſſâ,</hi> and to profeſſe learning <hi>peritiâ literali
non intelligentiâ ſpirituali;</hi> And ſo are contented <hi>verba
legis tenere &amp; vim legis ignorare,</hi> have gone about to
preſſe and ſtraine the word of this Statute, not onely
againſt the Pope and Church of Rome, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Kings owne High Court of Chancery, and
other his Majeſties Courts of Equitie in <hi>England,</hi>
grounding, their opinion and conceit upon theſe
words of the Statute.</p>
            <p>If any purchaſe, in the Court of Rome or elſe where,
any ſuch Tranſlations, or proceſſes, or other things
which touch the King: And for the better underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hereof, it is to bee remembred, that the Pope &amp;
Court of Rome kept their Seiges and Court not at
Rome onely, but ſometimes at <hi>Avignion,</hi> ſometimes
at other places; and divers Antipopes beeing at one
<pb facs="tcp:94355:12"/>
and the ſelfe ſame time, kept their ſeverall ſeiges and
Courts at ſeverall places, and yet each of them chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
and pretended to have ſupreame juriſdiction,
power, and authority over and above the King and his
Crown, &amp; regality in the caſes before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred; And
therefore it was requiſite and neceſſarie for the King
and the Parliament to withſtand and provide remedy
againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>And that is the true and right underſtanding of
<hi>Ou Aylors:</hi> For it is too abſurd to ſay, or imagine that
the King or Parliament meant to extend the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Kings owne Courts of equity in <hi>England,</hi>
which dirived their authority and juriſdiction from
him onely: and heard and determined, as his ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
according to equity and conſcience, ſuch caſes
as the Iudges of the common Law could not by the
ſtrict rules of the Common law Iudge &amp; determine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Courts and the Iudges, &amp; Miniſters therof,
the King had power to ſuppeſſe, altar, and puniſh at
his pleaſure, and therefore againſt theſe the Lords
Temporall and Commons needed not to engage
themſelves to ſtand with the King and the Crowne,
and to live and dye, Nor the Lords Spirituall &amp; Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
to promiſe to ſtand with the King, as they were
bound by their alleageance, with their Cautious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
for the ordinarie, legall &amp; iuditiall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
the Chancery and Courts of equity according
to conſcience.</p>
            <p>The King, nor his Crowne, nor Regality, nor the
Common Law were not in any danger, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was by the ambitious uſurpation of the Pope, and
the Church of Rome, and by the proceedings in the
Courts holden by that uſurped authority; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
againſt them the Parliament provide this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb facs="tcp:94355:13"/>
following, the example of the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Courts which this Parliament, &amp; the Parliament

of the Kings regalitie and deſtruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, but not the Kings owne Courts of equity
and Conſcience. And for the further clearing of this
doubt, if it be worthy to be made a doubt, how theſe
words <hi>ou Ayllors</hi> ſhall be underſtood, in the 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.
