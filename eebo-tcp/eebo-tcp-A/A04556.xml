         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The second part of the most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Historie of the seauen Champions of Christendome.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>How Sa. <hi>Georges</hi> three sonnes were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into the famous Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> and after how their Mother was slaine in a wood with the prickes of a thornie brake, her bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing she gaue her sonnes, <hi>S. Georges</hi> lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ouer her bleeding bodie: and likevvise of the Iourney the seuen Champions intended to Ierusalem to visit the Sepulcher of Christ.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter Saint <hi>George</hi> with the other six Champions of Christendom (by their inuincible conquests) had brought into subiection, al the Easterne Parts, and by dint of bloodie warres yoaked the stubborne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels euen to the furthest boundes of <hi>India,</hi> where the golden Sunne begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to arise, as you heard discoursed in the former Part of this Historie, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:1507:5"/>
with the conquest of Imperiall Diadems, regall crownes and kingly scepters to the rich and plentifull Country of <hi>England:</hi> where in the famous Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> they manie a day soiourned, a place not onely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied with sumptuous buildings, but grac'd with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of valiant Knights and gallant Gentlemen of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiour, and therewithal adornd with troopes of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of diuine and celestiall beauties, that trip it vp and downe the stréetes like to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Quéenes, when as they tyed the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Warriers in the silken snares of loue: whereby it séemed rather a paradice for heauenlye Angels, than a place for earthly inhabiters.</p>
            <p>Here the Christian Champions laide their Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, here hung they vp their weapons on the bowers of peace, here their glistering corslets rusted in their Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, here was not heard the warlike sound of drums nor siluer trumpets, heere stood no Centinells nor Courts of guard, nor barbed stéedes prepared to the battaile, but all things tended to a lasting peace, They that had wont in stéeled coates to sléep in champion fields, lay dallying now in beds of silke: they that had wont with wearie armes to wéeld the warlike fawchions, sate now embracing louely Ladies on their knées: and they whose eares had wont to heare the rufull cryes of slaughtered souldiers, were now orecloyd with musickes pleasant harmonie.</p>
            <p>In this delicious manner liued these Champions in the Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> burying the remembrance of all theyr former Aduentures in the lakes of obliuion, and spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their times in honorable Tiltes and courtly Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: wher S. <hi>George</hi> performed manie atchiuements in honor of his beloued Ladie, &amp; the other Knights in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their Mistresses.</p>
            <p>But at last Saint <hi>Georges</hi> thrée Sonnes, <hi>Guy, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> being all three borne at one birth, as you heard before in the wildernesse, and sent into thrée seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kingdomes by their carefull Father to be trained vp:
<pb facs="tcp:1507:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the one into <hi>Rome</hi> to the warlike <hi>Romanes.</hi> another vnto <hi>Wittenberg</hi> to the learned <hi>Germanes,</hi> the third into <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> to the valiant <hi>English.</hi> But now being growne to some ripenes of age and agilitie of strength, they desired much to visit their parents, whom they had not séene from their infancies lying in their cradles: and to craue at hys hands the honor of true Knighthood, and to weare the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Spurre of Christendome.</p>
            <p>This earnest &amp; princely request so highly pleased theyr Tutors, that they furnished them with a stately traine of Knights, and sent them honourably into <hi>England</hi> where they arriued all thrée at one time in the famous Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> where their entertainments were most prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their welcomes so honorable, that I want arte to describe and memorie to expresse.</p>
            <p>I omit what sumptuous Pageants and delightfull Showes the Cittizens prouided, and how the stréetes of <hi>London</hi> were beautefied with tapestrie, the solemne bels that rung them ioyfull welcomes, and the siluer strained instruments that gaue them pleasant entertainment. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I passe ouer their fathers ioy, who prized their sightes more precious in his eyes, than if hee had béen made sole Monarch of the golden mynes of rich <hi>America:</hi> or that euerie haire that grew vppon his head had been equalled with a kingdome, &amp; he to giue as manie golden diademes in his Armes. Also the Mothers welcomes to her Sons, who gaue them more kisses than shee breathed foorth groanes at their deliueries from her painful womb in the wildernesse.</p>
            <p>The other Champions curtesies were not the least nor of the smallest in account to these thrée yong Gentlemen: but to be short, Saint <hi>George</hi> (whose loue was deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Children) in his owne person conducted them vnto their lodgings, whereas they spent that day and the night following in royall banquetting amongest theyr Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Frend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1507:6"/>But no sooner appeared the Mornings Sunne vppon the Mountaine tops, and the cleare countenaunce of the Elements made motion of some insuing pastime, but S. <hi>George</hi> commaunded a solempne Hunting for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his Sonnes.</p>
            <p>Then began his knights to arme themselues in troops, and to mount vpon their nimble Iennets, and some with well armd Boare-speares in their handes, prepared for the game on foote: but S. <hi>George</hi> with his Sonnes clad in gréen vestments like <hi>Adonis,</hi> with siluer hornes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at their backes in scarffes of coloured silke, were stil the formost in this Exercise. Likewise <hi>Sabra</hi> (intending to sée her Sonnes valours displaied in the field, whether they were in courage like their Father or no) caused a gentle Palfray to be prouided, whereon she mounted her Princely Person to be a witnes of these Siluane sportes: she was armd with a curious brest-plate wrought like to the scales of a Dolphin, and in her hand she bare a siluer bow of the Turkish fashion, like an Amazonian Queen, or <hi>Diana</hi> hunting in the groues of <hi>Arcadie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in this gallant manner rode forth these Hunters to their Princely pastimes, where after they had ridden some sixe miles from the Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> fell from Sa. <hi>Georges</hi> nose thrée drops of purple blood, whereat hée so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly started, and there withall he heard the croaking of a Flight of night Rauens, that houered by the Forrest side, all which he iudged to be dismall signes of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing stratagem: but hauing a princely mind he nothing discouraged thereat, nor little mistrusted the wofull acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that after happened, but with a noble resolution en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Forrest, accounting such foretelling tokens for olde wiues ceremonies. Wherein they had not passed the compasse of halfe a mile, but they started a wilde &amp; swift Stag, at whom they vncoupled their Hounds, and gaue bridle to their horses, and followed the game more swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than Pirates that pursue the Merchants vppon the
<pb facs="tcp:1507:6"/>
seas. But now behold how frowning Fortune chaunged their pleasant pastimes to a sad and bloodie tragedie: for <hi>Sabra</hi> proffering to kéepe pace with them, delighting to behold the valiant incounters of her yong sonnes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careles of her selfe thorough the ouer swiftnes of her Stéede, shee slipped beside her saddle, and so fell directly vpon a thornie brake of brambles, the prickes whereof more sharpe than spikes of stéele entered to euerie part of her delicate bodie: some pierced the louely closets of her starre bright eyes, whereby (in stead of christall pearled teares) there issued drops of purest blood: her face before that blushed like the mornings radiant countenance, was now exchanged into a crimson red: her milk white hands that lately strained the yuorie Lute, did séeme to weare a bloodie scarlet gloue: and her tender paps that had so often fed her Sonnes with the milke of nature, were all berent and torne with these accursed brambles: from whose déep wounds there issued such a streame of purple gore, that it conuerted the grasse from a liuely gréen to crimson hicu, and the abundance of blood that trickled from her breast, began to inforce her soule to giue the world a wofull fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Yet notwithstanding, when her beloued Lord, her sorrowfull Sonnes, and all the rest of the wofull Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, had washed her wounded bodie with a Spring of feares, and when she perceiued that she must of force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her life to the furie of imperious death, shee breathed foorth this dying Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Deare Lord (said she) in this vnhappie Hunting must you loose the truest Wife that euer lay by Princes side: yet mourne you not, nor gréeue you my Sonnes, nor you braue Christian Knights, but let your warlike drummes conuay me royally vnto my Toombe, that all the world maye write in brazen Bookes, how I haue followed my Lord (the Pride of Christendome) thorough many a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die field, and for his sake haue left my Parents, Frends, and Countrey, and haue trauelled with him through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

a daungerous Kingdome: but now the cruell Fates haue wrought their latest spites, and finished my life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am not able to performe what loue he hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of me. And now to you my Sonnes, this blessing do I leaue behinde: euen by the paines that fortie wéekes I once indured for your sakes, when as you lay enclosed in my wombe, and by my trauels in the wildernes, whereas my grones vpon your birth day did (in my thinking) cause both trées and stones to drop downe teares, when as the mercilesse Tygers &amp; tamelesse Lyons did stand like gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lambes, and mournd to heare my lamentations: and by a Mothers loue that euer since I haue borne you, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; follow your Father in all his honorable attempts, harme not the silly Infant, nor the helplesse Widdow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the honour of distressed Ladies, and giue fréely vnto wounded Souldiers: séeke not to stain the vnspotted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with your lusts, and aduenture euermore to redéeme true Knights from captiuitie: liue euer professed enemies to paganisme, and spend your liues in the quarrel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Christ, that Babes (as yet vnborne) in time to come may speake of you, and record you in the Bookes of fame to be true christian Champions. This is my bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and this is the Testament I leaue behinde: for now I féele the chilnesse of pale death closing the closets of my eyes: Farewell vaine world, déere Lord farewell, swéet Sonnes, you famous fellowes of my <hi>George,</hi> and all true Christian Knights, adieu.</p>
            <p>These words were no sooner ended, but with a heauie sigh she yéelded vp the ghost: whereat Saint <hi>George</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient in his sorrowes) fell vpon her liuelesse bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, rending his haire, and tearing his Hunters attyre from his backe into a thousand péeces: and at last when his griefes somewhat diminished, he fell into these bitter lamentations.</p>

Christian fields, dead is the Dame that for her beautie stained all Christian women: for whom Ile fill the aire with euerlasting moanes. This day hencefoorth be fatall to all times, and counted for a dismall day of death. Let neuer the Sunne shew foorth his beames thereon againe, but clowdes as blacke as pitch couer the earth with fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full darknes. Let euerie Trée in this accursed Forrest, hencefoorth be blasted with vnkindly windes: let bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, hearbs and flowers consume and wyther, let grasse and blooming buds perish and decay, and all things néere the place where shee was slaine, bee turned to a dismall, blacke and sable colour, that the Earth it selfe in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning garments may lament her losse. Let neuer Birde sing cherefully in top of trées, but like the mournfull mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke of the Nightingale, fil all the aire with fatall tunes: let bubling riuers murmure for her losse, &amp; siluer Swans that swim thereon sing dolefull melodie: let all the dales belonging to these fatal woods be couered with gréene bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed serpents, croaking toades, hissing snakes, and sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing cockatrices: in blasted trées let fearfull Rauens shrike, let howlets crye, and crickets sing, that after this it may be called a place of dead mens wandring ghosts. But fond wretch, why doo I thus lament in vaine, and bathe her bléeding bodie with my teares, when gréefe by no meanes will recall her life? Yet this shall satisfie her soule, for I will goe a Pilgrimage vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; offer vp my teares to Iesus Christ vpon his blessed Sepulcher, by which my stained soule may be washt from this bloody guilt, which was the causer of this sorrowfull dayes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe.</p>
            <p>These sorrowfull words were no sooner ended, but hée tooke her bléeding limmes betwéene his fainting armes, and gaue a hundred kisses vpon her dying coloured lips, retayning yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour of Alablaster new washt in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple blood, and in this extasie a while lying, gaue waye to others to vnfold their woes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1507:8"/>But his Sonnes whose sorrowes wer as great as his, protested neuer to neglect one day, but duly wéepe a sea of teares vpon their Mothers graue, till from the Earth did spring some mournfull flower, to beare remembrance of her death, as did the Uiolet that sprung from chast <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> blood, when <hi>Venus</hi> wept to sée him slaine. Likewise the other sixe Champions (that all the time of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations stood like men drownd in the depth of sorrow) began now a little to recouer themselues: and after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by the honour of true Knighthood, and by the Spur and golden Garter of S. <hi>Georges</hi> leg, to accompanie him vnto the holy Land, bare footed without either hose or shoo, onely clad in russet gaberdines, like the vsuall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes of the world, and neuer to returne till they haue payd their vowes vpon that blessed Sepulcher.</p>
            <p>Thus in this sorrowful manner wearied they the time away, filling the woods with Echoes of their lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and recording their dolors to the whistling windes: but at last, when blacke Night began to approach, and with her sable mantles to ouer-spred the christall firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they retyred (with her dead bodie) backe to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London,</hi> where the report of this tragicall accident, drowned their friends in a sea of sorrow: for the newes of her timelesse death was no sooner bruted abroad, but the same caused both olde and young to lament the losse of so swéete a Ladie. The siluer headed age that had wont in scarlet gownes to méete in Councell, sat now at home in discontented griefes: the gallant youths and comely vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that had wont to beautefie the stréetes with costlye garments, went drouping vp and downe in blacke and mournfull vestures: and those remorcelesse hearts that sildome were opprest with sorrow, now constrained their eyes like fountaines to distill a floud of brinish and pearly teares.</p>
            <p>This generall griefe of the Citizens continued for the space of thirtie dayes, at the ende whereof Saint <hi>George</hi>

Also a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer coloured Swan swimming vpon a Christall riuer, as a token of her beautie: for as the Swan excelleth al other fowles in whitenes, so she for beautie excelled all Ladies in the world.</p>

            <p>Thus after the Toomb was erected, and the Epitaph ingrauen in a siluer Tablet, and al things performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint <hi>Georges</hi> direction, he left his Sonnes in the Cittie of <hi>London</hi> vnder the gouernment of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish King: and in companie of the other sixe Champions, he tooke his iourney towards <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were attired after the manner of Pilgrimes, in russet gaberdines downe to their foote, in their hands they bore staues of Ebon wood tipt at the endes with siluer, the pikes whereof were of the strongest <hi>Lydian</hi> stéele, of such a sharpnes that they were able to pierce a target of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys shell: vppon their breasts hung Crosses of crimson silke, to signifie that they were Christian Pilgrimes, trauelling to the Sepulcher of Christ.</p>
            <p>In this manner set they forward from <hi>England</hi> in the Spring time of the yeare, when <hi>Flora</hi> had beautefied the earth with Natures tapestrie, and made their passages as pleasant as the Gardens of <hi>Hesperides,</hi> adorned with all kinde of odoriferous flowers. When as they crossed the seas, the siluer waues séemed to lye as smoothe as christal yce, and the Dolphins to daunce aboue the waters, as a signe of a prosperous iourney. In trauelling by land, the wayes séemed so short and easie, and the chirping melody of birdes made them such musique as they passed, that in a short season they arriued beyond the borders of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and had entred the confines of <hi>Africa.</hi>

Now their naked legs and bare feet, that had wont to stride the stately stéedes, and to trample in fields of Pagans blood, were forced to clyme the craggie mountaines, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the torments of pricking briers, as they trauayled thorough the desert places and comfortlesse solitarie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He swift foote stéedes of <hi>Titans</hi> fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Carre had almost finished a yere, since <hi>Sabraes</hi> Funerall was solemnized: in which time Saint <hi>Georges</hi> thrée Sonnes had visited their Mothers Tomb oftner than there were dayes in the yeare, and had shed as manie teares thereon in remembraunce of her loue, as there were starres in the glistering veyle of Heauen: but at last these thrée yong Princes fell at a ciuill discord and deadly strife, which of them should beare the truest loue vnto their Mothers dead bodie, and which of them should be held in greatest estéeme. For before manie dayes were expired, they concluded to offer vp thrée seuerall deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at her Tombe: and he that deuised a gift of the rarest prize and of the straungest qualitie, should bee held in the
<pb facs="tcp:1507:11"/>
greatest honour, and accompted the noblest of them all. This determination was spéedily perfourmed, and in so short a time accomplished, that it is wonderfull to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>The first thinking to excéed his brothers in the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his Gift, made repaire vnto a cunning Inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, which had her abiding in a secret caue adioyning to the Cittie, whom he procured (through manie rich giftes and large promises) by arte to deuise a meane to get the honor from his Bretheren, &amp; to haue a gift of that strange nature, that all the world might wonder at the report thereof.</p>
               <p>The Inchauntresse (being won with his promises) by her artes and magicke spells, deuised a Garland contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the diuersitie of flowers that euer grew in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gardens: and though it were in the dead time of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when as the siluer ysicles had disroabd both hearb and flower of their beauties, and the Northerne snow lay frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on the mountaine tops, yet was this Garland contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after the fashion of a rich Imperial Crowne, with as manie seuerall Flowers as euer <hi>Flora</hi> placed vppon the downes of rich <hi>Arcadia:</hi> in diuersitie of colours lyke the glistering Raine-bow, when as it shineth in her greatest pride: and casting such an odoriferous sent and swéete sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as though the Heauens had rained downe showers of Campheere, Bisse, or Amber-gréece.</p>
               <p>This rare and excéeding Garland was no sooner fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Inchauntment, and deliuered into his hands, but he left the Inchauntresse sitting in her Ebon chaire vpon a blocke of stéele (practising her fatall artes), with her hair hanging about her sholders, like wreaths of snakes or inuenomed serpents: and so retourned to his Mothers tombe, where he hung it vppon a pillar of siluer that was placed in the middle of the Monument.</p>
               <p>The second Brother likewise repaired to the Tombe, and brought in his hand an yuorie Lute, wheron he plaid
<pb facs="tcp:1507:11"/>
such inspiring melodie, that it séemed like the harmony of Angels, or the celestiall musique of <hi>Apollo</hi> when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended heauen for the loue of <hi>Daphne,</hi> whom hee turned into a Bay trée. The musicke being finished, he tied! ys Lute in a damaske scarffe, and with great humilitie hee hung it at the west ende of the Tombe vppon a knobbe of Iasper stone.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the third Brother likewise repaired with no outward deuotion or worldly gift: but clad in a vesture of white silke, bearing in his hand an instrument of death, like an innocent Lambe going to sacrifice: or one readie to be offered for the loue of his mothers soule.</p>
               <p>This strange manner of repaire, caused his other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to stand attentiuely, and with vigilant eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the conclusion.</p>
               <p>First, after he had (submissiuely and with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) let fall a shower of siluer teares from the cesternes of his eyes, in remembrance of his Mothers timeles tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie, he prickt his naked breast with a siluer bodkin, the which he brought in his hand, from which there trickeled downe some thirtie drops of blood, which he after offered vp to his Mothers Tombe in a siluer bason, as an euident signe that there can be nothing more dearer, nor of more precious price, than to offer vp his owne blood for her loue. This ceremonious gift caused his two other Brothers to swell in hatred like two chased Lions, and with furie to run vpon him, intending to catch him by the haire of the head, and to drag him round about their Mothers Tomb, till his braines were dasht against the marble pauement, and his blood sprinkled vppon her graue: but this wicked enterprize so mooued the Maiestie of heauen, that ere they could accomplish their intents, or staine their hands in his blood, they heard (as it were) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyse of dead mens bones ratling in the ground. And thereupon (looking fearfully about) the Toombe seemed of it selfe to open, and thereout to appeare a most terrible and ghastly shap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

pale, like vnto ashes, in countenance resembling theyr Mother with her breast besmeard in blood, and her bodie wounded with a hundred scarres: and so with a dismall &amp; rufull looke she spake vnto her desperate Sonnes in thys manner.</p>

               <p>This being said, she vanished from their sight, lyke to the brictl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This wofull and vnexpected noyse, caused the Knights to alight from their horses, and to sée the euent of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.

Most Noble Knights quoth shée, and true renounded men at armes, to tell the cause of my passed miseries were a pricke vnto my soule, and the discourse thereof will burst my heart with griefe, but considering your Nobilities the which I perceiue by your Princely behauiours, and your kinde curtesies extended towards me, being a Uirgin in distresse, vnder the hands of these lustfull <hi>Negroes,</hi> whom you haue iustly murdred, shall imbolden me, though vnto my hearts great griefe, to discourse the first cause of my miserable fortune.</p>

But casting their gazing eyes vpon my beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they were presently inchaunted with a lustfull desire, onely to crop the swéete bud of my virginitie. Then with a furious and dismall countenaunce, more blacke than than the sable garments of sad <hi>Melpomine,</hi> when wyth her strawberie quill she writes of bloodie tragedies: or with a heart more crueller, than was <hi>Neroes</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Romane Emperour when he beheld the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of his naturall Mother layde open by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and mercilesse commaundement: or when he stood vpon the highest toppe of a mightie mountayne to sée that famous and Imperiall Cittie of <hi>Roome</hi> set on fire by the remorselesse handes of his vnrelenting Ministers, that added vnhallowed flames to his vnholie furie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:15"/>These mercilesse and wicked minded <hi>Negroes</hi> with violent handes tooke my aged Father, and most cruellye bound him to the blasted bodie of a wythered oake, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the entrie of his Cell: where, neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent honor of his siluer haires, that glistered like the frozen ysicles vpon the Northerne Mountaines, nor the strayned sighes of his breast, wherein the pledge of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was inthronized, nor all my teares or exclamations could anie whit abate their cruelties, but like grim dogs of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> they left my Father fast bound vnto the trée, and like egregious vipers tooke me by the tramells of my golden haire, and dragd me like a silly Lambe vnto this slaughtering place, intending to satisfie their lustes with the flower of my chastitie.</p>
               <p>Here I made my humble supplication to the Maiestye of Heauen, to bee reuenged vppon their cruelties: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to them the rewards of bloodie rauishments by the example of <hi>Tereus</hi> that lustfull King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and hys furious Wife, that in reuenge of her Sisters rauishment caused her Husband to eate the flesh of his owne Sonne.

Yet neither the frownes of heauen, nor the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble threates of hell, could mollifie their bloodie mindes: but they protested to perseuer in that wickednes, &amp; vowd that if all the leaues of the Trées that grew within the Wood were turned into Indian Pearle, &amp; made as weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie as the golden Streames of <hi>pactolus,</hi> where <hi>Mydas</hi> washt his golden Wish away: yet shuld they not redéeme my chastitie from the staine of their insatiable and lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desires.</p>
               <p>This being said, they bound mee with the tramells of myne owne haire to this Orenge trée, and at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb facs="tcp:1507:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they proffered to defile my vnspotted bodie, but by the mercifull working of God, you happily approached, &amp; not only redéemed me from their tyrannous desires, but quit the world from thrée of the wickedest creatures that euer nature framed. For which (most noble and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knights) if euer Uirgins prayers may obtaine fauor at the Maiestie of Heauen, humbly will I make my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that you may proue as valiant champions, as euer put on helmet: and that your fames may ring to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Princes eare, as far as bright <hi>Hiperion</hi> showes hys golden face.</p>
               <p>This tragicall tale was no sooner ended, but the thrée Knights (whose remorcefull hearts sobbed with sighes) imbraced the sorrowfull Maiden betwixt their armes, &amp; earnestlye requested her to conduct them vnto the place, whereas she left her father bound vnto the withered oke. To which shee willingly consented, and thanked them highly for their kindnes: but before they approched to the olde mans presence, what for the griefe of his banishment and the violent vsage of his Daughter, he was forced to yéeld vp his miserable life to the mercies of vnauoydable death.</p>
               <p>When Saint <hi>Georges</hi> valiant Sonnes (in companie of this sorrowful Maiden) came to the trée, and (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their expectations) found her Father cold and stiffe, both deuoyd of sense and féeling, also finding his hands &amp; face couered with greene mosse, which they supposed to be done by the Roben red-breast and other little birds, who naturally couer the bare parts of anie bodie which they finde dead in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

her children: but when the thrée young Knights percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the comfortless sorrow of the Uirgin, and how she had vowd neuer to depart from those solitary groues, but to spend the remnant of her daies in company of his deadly body, they curteously assisted her to burie him vnder a ches-nut trée, where they left her continually bathing his senceles graue with her teares and returned backe to their horses, where they left them at the entry of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest tied vnto a lofty pine, &amp; so departed on their Iorney.</p>
               <p>There we will leaue them for a time, and speak of the seauen Champions of Christendome, that were gone on Pilgrimage to the Cittie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and what strange aduentures happened to them in their trauels.</p>

Therefore prepare your eares to entertaine the strangest Discourse that euer tung pronounced, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied aged man in the height of his extremitye dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
               <p>I was in my former yeres (whilst Fortune smilde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my happines) the principal Commaunder and chiefe Owner of a certaine Fountaine, of such a wonderfull &amp; precious vertue, that it was valued to be worth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iudea:</hi> the water thereof was so strange in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that in foure and twentie howers it wold conuert anie mettall, as of brasse, copper, yron, lead or tinne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rich refined golde: the stonie flint it would turne into pure siluer, and anie kinde of earth into excellent mettal.
<pb facs="tcp:1507:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
By the vertue thereof I haue made the leaues of Trées more richer than Indian Pearle, and the blades of grasse of more value than the Iewels that be found in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The richnesse thereof was no sooner bruted through the world, but it caused many forraine Knights to trie the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, and by force of armes to bereaue me of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this Fountaine. But at that time Nature graced me with one and twentie Sonnes, whereof seuen be yet liuing, and the onely comfort of myne age: but the other fourtéene (whom frowning Fortune hath bereaued me of) manie a day by their valiant prowesse and matchles forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes defended the Fountaine from manie furious assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: for there was no Knight in all the world that was found so hardie nor of such inuincible courage, that if they once attempted to incounter with anie of my valiaunt Sonnes, but they were either taken prisoners, or slaine in the combat.</p>
               <p>The fame of their valors, and the riches of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rung through manie strange Countreyes, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to the eares of a furious Giant, dwelling vppon the Borders of <hi>Arabia:</hi> who at the report thereof came armed in his stéely coate with a mightie bat of yron on his necke, like to the furious <hi>Hercules</hi> that burst the brazen gates of <hi>Cerberus</hi> in twaine, and in state and bignes like the Sonne of <hi>Ioue</hi> that bore the mightie mountaine <hi>Atlas</hi> vpon his shoulders: he was the conquerour of my sonnes, and the first causer of my sodaine downfall. But when I had intelligence of the ouerthrow of fourtéen of my sons, and that he had made conquest of the wealthie fountaine, I with the rest of my Children, thinking all hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie to be past, betooke our selues to this solitarie course of life, where euer since in this mansion or hermitage we haue made our abode and residence, spending our wealth to the releefe of trauelling Knightes and wandering Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hoping once againe that smiling Fortune would

aduance vs to some better happe: and to bee plaine right worthy Champions my hope was neuer at the height of full perfection till this present time, wherein your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent presences almost assure me that the hideous monster shalbe conquered, my fountaine restored, my Sonnes deaths (for dead sure they are) reuenged.</p>
               <p>The Champions with great admiration gaue eare to the strange discourse of this reuerent Iew, and intended in requitall of his extraordinarie kindnesse to vndertake this aduenture. And the more to encourage the other, Saint <hi>George</hi> began in this manner to deliuer his mind, speaking both to the Iew their hoast, and his valiant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Champions.</p>
               <p>I haue not without great wonder (most reuerent and curteous olde man) heard the strange discourse of thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable fountaine, and doe not a little lament that one of so kinde &amp; liberall a disposition should be dispossessed of so excéeding riches, for that wealth to a liberal nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone conuenient: neither am I lesse sorry, that so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane a monster and knowen enemie to all curtesie and kinde should haue the fruition of so excéeding great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: for to the wicked, wealth is the cause of their more wickednes But that which most grieueth me, is: that hauing so many valiant Knights to thy Sonnes, they all were so vnfortunate to fall into the handes of that relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Monster. But be comforted kinde olde man, for I haue hope by the power of heauen we were directed hither to punish that hateful Giant, reuenge the iniuries offered to thine age, satisfie with his death the death of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren if they be dead, and restore to thy bounteous possession that admirable rich fountaine.</p>
               <p>And nowe to you my valiant Companions I speake, that with mee through many dangers haue aduentured: let vs couragiously attempt this rare aduenture, wherein such honor to our names, such happines to our frends, such glory to God consistes, in recouering right to the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:19"/>
and punishing rightfully the wrongers of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that there be no contention among vs who shall begin this aduenture, for that I knowe all of you thirtie after honor, let lots bee made, and to whome soeuer the théefe lot falleth let him be formost in assailing the Giant, and God and all good fortune be our guides.</p>
               <p>The excéeding ioy which the old Iew conceiued, at the spéeches of Saint <hi>George,</hi> had néere hande bereft him of the vse of sense, so aboue measure was he ouerioyed. But at length recouering vse of spéech, he thus thankfully brake foorth.</p>
               <p>How infinitely I finde my selfe bounde vnto you, you famous and vndoubted Christian Champions, all my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes is not able to expresse: onely thankfulnes from the exchequer of a true heart shall to you bee rendred.</p>
               <p>The Champions without more words disrobing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from their Pilgrims attyre, euerie one selected foorth an armor fitting to their portely bodyes, and in stéed of their Ebone staues tipt with siluer, they welded in their handes the stéeled blades, and their féete that had wont to indure a paineful pilgrimage vpon the bare ground, were now redy prest to mount the golden stirrop, but as I said, they purposed not generally to assaile the Giant, but sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euerie one to trie his owne fortune thereby to obtaine the greater honor, and their déeds to merrit the higher fame, therfore the lots being cast amongst themselues which of them should beginne the aduenture. The lot fell first to Saint <hi>Denis</hi> the Noble Champion of <hi>France,</hi> who greatly reioyced at his fortune, and so departed for that night to get things in readines, but the next morning no sooner had the golden Sunne displaide his bewty in the East, but Saint <hi>Denis</hi> arose from his sluggish bed, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred himselfe in costly armor, and mounted vpon a stéede of Irone gray with a spangled Plumbe of purple fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on his burgonet, spangled with starres of golde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the azure firmament beautifyed with starres.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:20"/>After he had taken leaue of the other Champions, and had demaunded of the Iew where the Giant had his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he departed forward on his iourney: and before the Sunne had mounted to the top of heauen, he approached to the Giants presence, which as then sate vppon a block of stéele directly before the golden Fountaine, satisfying his hunger with raw flesh, and quenching his thirst wyth the iuyce of ripe grapes.</p>
               <p>The first sight of his vgly and deformed proportion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most daunted the valor of the French Champion, so as he stood in a maze, whether it were better to trie the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to returne with dishonor backe to his other fellow Knights. But hauing a heart furnished with true mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, he chose rather to dye in the incounter, than to returne with infamie: so committing his trust to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant Quéene of chaunce, he spurred foorth his horse, and assayled the Giant so furiously, that the strokes of his sword sounded lyke weightie blowes hammered vpon an anuyle.</p>
               <p>But so smally regarded the Giant the puissant force of this single Knight, that he wold scarce rise from the place where he sate: but yet remembring a vision that a little before appeared vnto him in his sléepe, which reueald vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, how that a Knight should come from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne clymates of the earth, which should alone <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nde the aduenture of the Fountaine, and vanquish him by forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: therefore not minding to be taken at aduantage, he sodainly started vp, and with a grim and furious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce he ran vpon Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> and tooke him horse, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, furniture and all vnder his left arme, as lightly as a strong man would take a sucking infant from his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and bore him to a hollow rocke of stone, bound about with barres of yron, standing néere vnto the Fountayne, in a valley betwixt two mightie mountaines. In which prison he closed the French Champion, amongst fourtéen other Knights, that were al Sonnes to the curteous Iew
<pb facs="tcp:1507:20"/>
as you heard before discourse<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and being proud of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he returned backe to his blocke of stéele, where we wil leaue him sitting, glorying in his own conceite, and speake of the other champions remaining in the Iewes house, expecting the French knightes fortunate returne: but when the sable Curtaines of darknes were drawne before the christall windowes of the day, and night had taken possession of the elements, and no newes was heard of the Champions successe, they iudged presently that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee was slaine in the aduenture, or discomfited and taken prisoner.</p>
               <p>Therefore they cast lots againe which of them, the next morning should trye his fortune, and reuenge the French knights quarrel, but the lot fel to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Noble champion of Spaine, where at his Princelie heart more reioyced, then if he had béene made King of the Westerne UUorld.</p>
               <p>So vpon the next morning by the breake of day, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred himselfe in rich and costly armor like the other Champion, and mounted vppon a Spanish Ginnet, in pace more swifter then the winde, and in portly state like to <hi>Beucephalus</hi> the proud stéede of <hi>Macedonian Alexander:</hi> his caparison was in color like to the waues of the Sea, his Burgonet was beautified with a spangled plumbe of sable feathers: and vpon his brest hee bore the armes of Spaine.</p>
               <p>Thus in this gallant manner departed he from the Iewes habitation, leauing the other Champions at their deuine contemplations for his happie successe, but his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune chanced contrarie to his wishes, for at the Giants first encounter he was likewise born to the rock of stone, to accompany Saint <hi>Denis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Giant was the strongest and hardiest knight at armes that euer set foote vpon the confines of <hi>Damasko,</hi> his strength was so inuincible, that at one time hee durst encounter with a hundred knights: but now returne we
<pb facs="tcp:1507:21"/>
againe to the other champions, whome when night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and likewise missing the company of Saynt <hi>Iames</hi> they cast lots the third time, and it fel to the Noble champion of Italy Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> whome on the next morning attyred himselfe in costly habiliments of war, and mounted vpon a Barbarian Palfrie as richly as did the valiant <hi>Iason</hi> when he aduentured into the Ile of <hi>Colcas,</hi> for the golden fleece: and for <hi>Medeas</hi> loue, his Helmet glistered like an Isie mountaine, deckt with a plumbe of ginger coloured feathers, and beautified with many siluer pendants. But his shining glory was soone blemished with a cloude of mischance, although hee was as valiant a knight as euer brandisht weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the fields of Mars, yet hee founde a disabilitie in his fortitude, to withstand the furious blowes of the Giant, that hee was forced to yeeld himselfe prisoner like the former Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</p>
               <p>The next lot that was cast, chanced to Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> of Scotland, a Knight as highly honoured for martiall discipline as any of the rest, his steede was of the breede of the Flemish Mares, clad with a caparison after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Brecians, his Armor varnished with greene oyles, like the color of the Somer fields vpon his brest he bore a crosse of purple silke, and on his burgonet a plumb of gréene feathers: but yet fortune so frowned vpon his enterprize, that he nothing preuayled, but committed his life to the mercy of the Giant, who likewise imprisoned him with the other Knights.</p>
               <p>The fift lot fell to Saint <hi>Pattricke</hi> of Ireland, as braue a knight as euer nature created, and as aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in his atchiuements: I feuer <hi>Hector</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian steede Praunst it vp and downe the stréetes of <hi>Troy,</hi> and made that age admire his fortitude: this Irish knight might counter-uaile his valor.</p>
               <p>For no sooner had the siluer Moone forsooke the Azure Firmament, and had committed her charge to the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="tcp:1507:21"/>
burnisht Sunne: But Saint <hi>Pattricke</hi> approached the sight of the Giant, mounted vppon his Irish hobby, cladde in a corselet of prooffe, beautified with siluer nayles: his plumbe of feathers, was of the color of Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins hayre, his horse couered with a vale of Orenge taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny silke, and his saddle bound about with plates of Steele, like to an Iron chayre.</p>
               <p>The sight of this valliant Champion so daunted the courage of the Giant, that hee thought him to bee the knight that the vission had reuealed, by whome the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture shoulde bee accomplished: therefore with no cowardly fortitude hee assayled the Irish knight, who with as Princely valor indured the incounter: but the vnkinde destinies not intending to giue him the honor of the victory, ecompelled the Champion to yéeld to the Giants forces, and like a Captiue to accompany the other imprisoned Champions.</p>
               <p>The next lot fell to Saint <hi>Dauid</hi> of Wales, who nothing discouraged at the discomfiture of the other Christian knightes, but at the mornings Suns vpryse into the azure firmament, glistered in his siluer Armor before the fountaine, with a golden Griffon shyning on his brest, where he endured long &amp; daungerous combate with the Giant, making the skyes to resound with echoes of their stroakes, but at last when the Giant percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that Saint <hi>Dauid</hi> beganne to growe almost breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, in defending the huge and mightie blowes of his stéeled batte, and chiefely through the long incounter, the Giant renewed his strength, and so redoubled his stroakes that Saint <hi>Dauid</hi> was constrayed lyke the other Christian Champions to yeeld to the Gyants mercies.</p>
               <p>But now the inuinsible and heroyecall Champyon of England Saint <hi>George,</hi> hee that is fames true knight, the mappe of Honour, and the worlds wonder,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:22"/>
remayning in the Iewes pauilion, and pondring in hys minde of the bad successe of the sixe Champions, and that it was his turne to try his fortune the next morning in the aduenture: he fell vpon his knées and made this humble supplycation to the Maiesty of God. O thou creator of this worldly Globe (quoth he,) O thou that hast fought for thy christian Knights in fields of purple bloud, and made the enemies of heauen to swim in streames of Crimson gore, O thou that hast giuen mee still the victory, graunt that I may confounde this bloudy and vnhumaine mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that hath discomfited sixe of the brauest knights that euer nature framed, euen as thou wast my ayde when I slewe the burning Dragon in Egipt: and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the terrible Giant that kept the inchaunted Castle amongst the <hi>Amazonians,</hi> euen so let me accomplish this daungerous aduenture, that all christians and christian Knights may applaude thy name, and in thy defence and iust quarrell, may stil be honored with the golden pledge of knighthood.</p>
               <p>In this manner spent hee away the night in making his deuine orations to heauen, for the happy successe of the next daies enterprize, whereon he vowed by the honor of his golden Garter, either to returne a worthy conquerer, or to dye a faithfull Martir. And when the day began to beautifie the Easterne Elements with a purple color, he repayred to the Iewes armory, and clad himselfe in a blacke Corselet, and mounted vpon a pitchy coloured steede, adorned with a bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> red caparison, in signe of a bloudy and tragicall aduenture, his plume of feathers was like a flame of fire quencht in blood as a token of speedy reuenge, hee arm'd himselfe not with a sturdy Launce, bounde about with plates of brasse, but tooke a Iauelin made of stéele, the one end far more sharper then the pointe of a néedle, the other end a ball of Iron in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mace of or club.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:22"/>Being thus armd according to his wished desires, hee tooke leaue of the Iew and his seauen Sonnes, who sate attyred in blacke and mournfull ornaments, praying for his happie and fortunate successe: and so departed spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the golden Fountaine, where hee found the Giaunt sléeping carelesly vpon his blocke of stéele, dreading no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing dangers.</p>
               <p>But when the valiant Champion Saint <hi>George</hi> was alighted from his horse, and had sufficiently beheld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed proportion of the Giant: how the hair of his head stood staring vpright like to the bristles of a wilde Boare, his eyes gazing open like two blazing Comets, his téeth long and sharpe like to spikes of stéele, the nayles of hys hands like the tallants of an Eagle, yet ouer them was drawen a paire of yron gloues: and euerie other limme huge and strongly proportioned like to the bodie of some mightie Oake, the worthie Champion awakened him in this order.</p>
               <p>Arise (sayd he) thou vnreasonable deformed Monster, and either make deliuerie of the captiue Knights, whom thou wrongfully detainest, or prepare thy vgly selfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the vttermost force of my warlike arme and death-prepared weapon.</p>
               <p>At which words the furious Giant started vp, as one sodainly amazed or affrighted from his sleepe: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making anie reply at all, taking his yron Mace fast in both his hands, he did with great terror let driue at the most worthie English Champion, who with exceeding cunning nimblenes defended himselfe from certaine dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by spéedie auoyding the blowes violence, and withall returned on his aduersarie a mightie thrust with the poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or sharpe ende of his Iauelin, which rebounded from the Giants bodie, as if it had béen runne against an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine piller.</p>
               <p>The which the inuincible Saint <hi>George</hi> perceiuing, he turned the heauie round ball ende of his massie iaueline,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:23"/>
and so mightely assayled the Giant, redoubling his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie blowes with such couragious fortitude, that at last he beate his braines out of his deformed head: whereby the Giant was constrained to yéeld vp his ghost, and to giue such a hideous roare, as though the whole frame of the Earth had béen shaken with the violence of some storme of thunder.</p>
               <p>This béeing done, Saint <hi>George</hi> cast his loathsome carkasse as a pray for the fowles and rauenous beastes to seaze vppon: and after verie diligently searched vp and downe, till he found the Rocke wherein all the Knightes and Champions were imprisoned: the which wyth hys stéely Iauelin he burst in sunder, and deliuered them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from their seruitudes, and after returned most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly backe to the Iewes Pauilion, in as great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and roialtie as <hi>Vaspasian</hi> with his Romane Nobles and Péeres returned into the confines of flourishing <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the admired and glorious conquest of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the reuerend olde Iew sawe the English champion returned with victorie, together with his other sixe fellow champions, and likewise beheld hys fourtéene Sonnes safely deliuered, his ioy so mightely excéeded the bounds of reason, that he sodainly swonded, and lay for a time in a dead traunce, with the exceedingnes of plesure he conceiued.</p>
               <p>But hauing a little recouered his decayed senses, hee gladly conducted them into their seuerall Lodgings, and there they were presently vnarmed, and their woundes washed in white wine and new milke, and after banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in the best manner hee could deuise. At which Banquet there wanted not all the excellencie of musique that the Iewes seauen yonger Sonnes could deuise, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling in their sweete Sonnets the excellent fortitude of the English champion, that had not onely deliuered their captiued Bretheren, but restored by that vgly Giants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued

death their aged Father to the repossession of his golden Fountaine.</p>
               <p>Thus after Saint <hi>George</hi> with the other sixe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions had soiourned there for the space of thirtie dayes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing placed the Iew with his Sonnes in their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired dignities, that is in the gouernment of the Golden Fountaine, they cloathed themselues againe in theyr Pilgrimes attyre, and so departed forward on theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Iourney to visite the holy Sepulcher of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ.</p>

               <p>And you chast Maidens that spend your liues in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of your God, euen by the plighted promise you haue made to true Uirginitie, I charge you to furnish foorth these warlike Champions with such approoued furniture as hath béene offered to this blessed Sepulcher, by those trauelling Knights, which haue fought vnder the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Christ. This is the pleasure of the Heauens great Guider, and this for the redresse of wronged Innocents in earth must be with all immediate dispatch foorthwith accomplished.</p>
               <p>This vnexpected voyce had no sooner ended, but the
<pb facs="tcp:1507:25"/>
Temple (in their conceites) séemed full strangely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound like the melodie of celestial Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the holy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the heauenly Rubens, as a signe that the Gods were pleased at their procéedings: then the twelue Uirgins arose from their diuine contemplations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the seauen Champions to the farther side of mount <hi>Syon,</hi> and there bestowed franklie vppon them, seauen of the brauest Stéedes that euer they beheld, with Martiall furniture answerable therunto, befitting knights of such estéeme: then the christian Champions beeing proude of their good fortunes, attyred them selues in rich and sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious corselets, and after mounted vppon their warlike coursers, kindly bidding the Ladies adiew: they betooke them to the worlds wide iourney. This trauell began at that time of the yeare, when the Sommers quéene began to spread her beauteous mantles amongst the gréene and fresh boughes of the hye and mightie Cedars, when as all kinde of small birds flewe round about, recreating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the beautie of the day, and with their well tuned notes, making a swéete and heauenlye melodye: at that time I say, these mightie and well estéemed knights the seauen Champions of Christendome, tooke the way from Ierusalem, which they thought to be most vsed: in which they had not many daies trauelled through the deserts and euer many a mountaine top, but they were meruailously troubled for lacke of their accustomed and dayly victuals, and could not hide nor dissemble their great hunger, so that the warre which they sustayned with hunger, was farre greater then the battels that they had fought against the enemies of Christ, as you heard discoursed in the first part of this Historye.</p>
               <p>So vpon a Sommers euening, when they had spent the day in great extreamitie, and night grewe on, being in a thicket of mightye trées, where as the siluer Moone with her bright beames glistred most cléerly, yet to them it séemed to bee as darke as pitch, for they were very sore
<pb facs="tcp:1507:25"/>
troubled for lacke of that which shoulde sustaine them: and their faces did showe and declare the perplexities of their stomackes.</p>
               <p>So they sate them downe vppon the gréene and freshe hearbes, very pensiue of their extreame necessitie, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to take their rests that night: but all was in vayne, for that their corporall necessities would not consent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: but without sléeping they walked vp and downe for that night, till the next day in the morning that they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their accustomed trauell and iourney, thinking to finde some food for the cherishing of their stomackes, and had their eyes alwayes gazing about, to espye some Uil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or house, wherein they might satisfye their hunger and take their restes.</p>
               <p>Thus in this helplesse manner spent they away the next day, till the closing in of the euenings light, by which time they grewe so faint, that they fell to the ground with féeblenesse: Oh what a sorrowe was it to Saint <hi>George,</hi> not only for him selfe, but to sée the rest of the Champions in such a miserable case, beeing not able to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and so parting a little from them, he lamented in this manner following.</p>

               <p>These and such like reasons vttered this valiaunt Champion of <hi>England,</hi> till such time as the day appeared and the sable curtaines of coale blacke night were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen. Then returned he to the rest of his Companie, where he found them verie weake and féeble: but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them in the best manner he could deuise to take their horses, and to trie the chaunce of their vtmost vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde fortune.</p>
               <p>Although Saint <hi>George</hi> as they trauelled was readie to dye by the way, and in great confusion of minde: yet rode he first to one then to another, comforting them, and making them ride apace: which they might verie well doo, for that their horses were not so vnprouided as theyr Masters, by reason of the goodly grasse that grew in those Woods, wherewith at pleasure they filled themselues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie night.</p>
               <p>The golden Sunne had almost mounted to the top of heauen, and the glorious prime of the daye began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, when they came into a great field verie plaine, and in the middest of it was a little Mountaine, out of the which there appeared a great smoake which gaue them to vnderstand that there should be some habitation in that place.</p>
               <p>Then the Princely minded Saint <hi>George</hi> said to the other Champions: Take comfort with your selues, and by little and little come forward with an easie pace: for I will ride before to sée who shall be our hoast this ensuing night.

all assured, whether hee be pleasde or no, yet shall hee giue vs lodging and entertayne vs like to trauelling Knights, and therewithall he set spurres to his horse, and swiftly scowred away like to a ship with swelling sailes vpon the marble coloured Ocean: his hast was so spéedy that in a short time he approached the mountaine, where at the furie &amp; rushing of his horse in running, there arose from the ground a mightie and terrible Giant, of so great height, that he séemed to bee a bigge growne trée, and for hugenes like to a rocke of stone: but when he cast his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eyes vpon the English knight: which seemed like two brazen plates or two torches euer flaming, he layde hand vpon a mightie club of Iron which lay by him, and came with great lightnesse to méete Saint <hi>George,</hi> but when he approached his presence, he thought him to bee a Knight but of small vallor and fortitude, he threw away his Iron bat, and came towards the champion, intending with his fistes and buffets to beat out his braines, but the courage of the English champion so exceeded, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the extremity of hunger, for like a couragious knight he raised himselfe in his stirrops, otherwise hee coulde not reach his head, and gaue him such a blowe vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with his keene edged fauchion, that he cut his head halfe in sunder, and his braines in great aboundance ran downe his deformed bodie: so that amazed hee fell to the ground and presently dyed. His fall seemed to make the ground to shake, as though a stony tower had béene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd, for as he lay vpon the earth, he seemed to be a great oake blowne vp by the rootes with a tempestious whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde.</p>
               <p>At that instant the rest of the champions came to that place, with as much ioy at that present, as before they were sad and sorrowfull.</p>
               <p>But when Saint <hi>Denis</hi> with the other knights, did sée the greatnes of the Giant, and the deformity of his body, they aduanced his valor beyond immagination, and dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

               <p>Upon this they concluded, and so generally entred the Giants house, which was in the maner of a great Barne cut out of the hard stone, and wrought out of the Rocke: therein they found a mightie copper Chauldron standing vppon a treauet of stéele, the féet and supporters thereof, were as bigge as great Iron pillers: vnder the same bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned such a huge flaming fire, that it sparkeled like the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye Furnace in burning <hi>Acharon:</hi>

               <p>The hunger they had, and their desire to eate, caused them to fall to their meate before it was halfe readye as though that it had béene ouer-sodden; but the two knights of Wales and Ireland, not intending to dine without bread and drinke, searched in a secret hollow caue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they found two great loaues of bread, as bigge in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe as the circle of a well, and two great Flagons full of the best Béere that euer they tasted, the which with great ioye and pleasure, they brought from the caue, to the great and excéeding contentment of the other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</p>
               <p>In stead of a knife to cut their victuals, Saint <hi>George</hi>

               <p>So giuing thankes to heauen for their good and happy fortunes, Saint <hi>George</hi> requested the Chompiens to take horsse, and mounted himselfe vpon his palfrey, and so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled from thence thorowe a narrowe path, which séem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be vsed by the Giant: and so with great diligence they trauelled all the rest of that day, till night had closed in the beautye of the heauens: at which time they had got to the top of a high mountaine, from whence a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before night they did discouer meruaylous great and playnes, the which were inhabited with fayre Cities and townes, at which sight these Christian Champions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

he remained almost beside himselfe, in such sorte that hee had almost fallen to the ground: The sorrowfull Squire remained a good while before he could speake, but at last when he came againe to himselfe, he began with a dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous complaint, crying out against the gods and fortune, because they had suffered so great a crueltie to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon this damsell.</p>
               <p>And making this sorrowfull lamentation, he vnloosed her from the trée, and layd her naked body vppon part of her apparell, the which hee found lying by, all besmear'd in blood, and afterwarde complained in this pitifull sort.</p>

               <p>But as I say: slumbring in the gréene meadowes, I dreamed that there was a great and fierce wilde man, which stood before me with a sharp faushion in his hand, making as though he would kill me, wherat me thought I was so frighted, that I gaue (in my troublesome dreams) many terrible shréekes, calling for succour to the emptie ayre. Then me thought there apperred before my face a company of curteous Knightes, which saide vnto mee, feare not old man, for we be come from the soules of thy daughters to aide and succour thée, but yet for all this, the wilde man vanished not away, but stroke with his faushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vppon my brest, whereat it s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

At the reading of this sorrowfull historie, Saint <hi>George</hi> with the other Champions did shed many teares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with there did increase in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a further desire of reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being moued with great compassion, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by their promisses made to the honor of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to perseuer spéedily on their vowed reuenge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined purpose: also calling heauen to be witnesse to their plighted oathes, protesting that sooner shoulde the liues of all the famous Romaines bee raised from death from the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> to <hi>Caeser,</hi> and all the rest vnto this time, then to be perswaded to returne from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, and neuer to trauell backe into Christendome till they had performed their vowes, and thus burning with desire, to sée the end of this sorrowfull aduenture: Saint <hi>George</hi> clapped vp the bloudy written booke, and gaue it againe to the Shepheard, and so they procéeded forwards towards the Iland where the Knight of the black Castle had his residence, guided onely by the direction of the old man, whose aged limbes séemed so lusty in traueling that it prognosticated a luckie euent: In which iorney wee will leaue the Champions for a time, with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouision that the Knight of the blacke Castle made in his defence, the successe whereof will be the strangest that euer was reported, and returne and speake of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> thrée Sonnes in the persute of their Father where we left them (as you heard before) traueling from the Confines of Barbarie where they redéemed the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Lady from the Tawny Moores.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any and dangerous were the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of the thrée valiant Princes in the persute of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint <hi>George,</hi> and many were the Countries, Ilands, and Princes Courts, that they search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtaine a wished sight of his martiall countenance, but all to small purpose, for fortune neither cast them happilie vpon that coast, where he with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Champions had their residence, nor luckily sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their eares the places of their arriuals.</p>
               <p>In which persute I omit and passe ouer many Noble aduentures that these thrée Princes atchiued, as well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the raging ocians as vpon the firme Land, and wholie discourse vppon an accident that hapned to them in an

Iland bordering vpon the confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iland where the Knight of the blacke Castle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as you heard in the last Chapter, vpon which coast after they were arriued, they trauelled in a broad and straight path vntill such time as they came to a verie faire and delectable forrest, where as sundry chirping birdes had gathered themselues together, to refreshe and shrowd themselues from the parching heat of the golden Sunne: filling the ayre with the pleasures of their siluer tuned notes.</p>
               <p>In this Forrest they trauelled almost two howers, and then they went vp to a small mountaine which was at hand, from the which they discouered very faire and wel towered townes with Princely pallaces very sumptuous to behold: likewise they discouered from the Hill a fayre fountaine wrought all of marble like vnto a Pill<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eshed their faces, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>After they looked round about them on euery side, and toward their right handes they espied amongst a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of gréene trées, a small Tent of blacke cloth, towards which these yong Princes directed their courses with an easie pace, but when they had entred the Tent, and sawe no bodie therin, they remained silent a while, harkning if they could heare any sturing, but they could neither see nor heare any thing, but onely they found the print of certain little féete vpon the same, which caused them more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to desire to know whose foote steps they were, for that they séemed to be of some Ladies or Damsels: so find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trace they followed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more the knights followed, the more the Ladies séemed to hast: so long they persued after the trace, that at the end they approached a little mountain wheras they found scattered about, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lockes of yellow haire, which séemed to be thrids of
<pb facs="tcp:1507:37"/>
golde, and stooping to gather them vp, they perceiued that some of them were wet with spots of blood, whereby they wel vnderstood, that in great anger they were pulled from some Ladies head: lik wise they saw in diuers places how the earth was spotted with droppes of crimson blood: then with a more desire then they had before, they went vp to the top of that litle mountaine, and hauing lost the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, they recouered it againe by gathering vp the hayre, where they had not traueled far vp the mountaine, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the waters side they heard a gréeuous complaint, which séemed to be the voice of a woman in great distresse, and the woordes which the knights did vnderstand were these: O loue, now shalt thou no more reioyce nor haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer dominion ouer me, for death I sée is ready to cut my thrid of life and finish these my sorowful lamentations how often haue I askt reuengement at the powers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against that wicked wretch that hath bene the causer of my banishment, but yet they will not hear my request: how ofte haue I made my sad complaints to hell? yet hath the fatall furies stopt their eares against my woful cryes. And with this she held her peace, giuing a sorowful sighe: which being done, the thrée christian knights turned their eyes to the place from whence they heard this complaint, and discouered amongst certaine gréene trées a Lady who was endued with singuler beautie, being so excellent that it almost depriued them of their harts &amp; captiuated their sences in the snares of loue, which libertie as yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lost: she had her haire about her eares, which hung de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly downe her comely sholders, through the violence she vsed against her selfe, and leaning her chéeke vpon her delicate white hand that was all to be spotted with blood, which was constraind by the scratching of her nailes vpon her Rosie colored face: by her stood another damsel which they coniectured to be her daughter for she was clad in vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin colored silk mor whiter then the Lillyes of the fields: and as pleasante to beholde as the glistring Moone in a
<pb facs="tcp:1507:37"/>
cleare winters fréezing night: yet for all this delectable sight, the thrée princly knights wold not discouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues but stood closely behinde the thrée pine trées which grew néere vnto the mountaine to heare the euent of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but as they stoode cloaked in silence, they heard her thus to confer with her beautiful daughter. Oh my <hi>Rosana</hi> (quoth she) the vnhappie figure of him, that without pitty hath wounded my heart and left me comfortles with the greatest cruelty that euer knight or gentleman left Lady: how hath it béen possible that I haue had the force to bring vp the child of such a father which hath bereaud me of my libertie? O you soueraigne gods of heauen, grant y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may establish in my minde the remembrance of the loue of thy adulterous father: oh girle borne to a further griefe, héere doe I desire the guider of thy fortunes, that thy glistring beautie may haue such force and power, whereby the shining beames thereof may take reuengement of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of thy mother: giue eare deare childe I say vnto thy dying mother, thou that art born in the dishonor of thy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by the losse of my virginity, héere doe I charge thée vpon my blessing, euen at my houre of death, &amp; swear thée by the omnipotent God of heauen, neuer to suffer thy beauty to be enioyd by any one, vntill thy disloyal fathers head bee offered vp in a sacrifice vnto my graue, thereby somewhat to appease the furie of my discontented soule, and recouer part of my former glorie.</p>
               <p>These and such like words spake this afflicted quéene, to the wonderfull amazement of the thrée yong Knightes, which as yet intended not to discouer themselues, but to marke the euent, for they coniectured that her woful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes were the induction of some strange accedent: Thus as they stoode obscurely behinde the trées, they sawe the young and beautifull Damsell giue vnto her dying mother, paper, penne and Inke, the which shée pulled from her Iuorie bosome, wherewith the gréeued quéene subscribed certain sorrowful lines vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was

O my swéete mother tell me not that you will dye, for it ads a torment more gréeuous vnto my soule then the punishments which <hi>Danaus</hi> daughters féele in hell, I would rather be torne in péeces by the fury of some merciles monster, or to haue my heart parted in twaine by the handes of him that is my greatest enemie, then to remaine without your companie, swéete mother let these my youthfull yéeres, and this my gréene budding beauty incourage you still to reuiue, and not to leaue me comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les like an exile in the world, but if the gloomy fates doe triumph in your death, and abridge your breathing ayre of life, and that your soule must néedes goe wander in the <hi>Elizian</hi> shades with <hi>Trufas</hi> shaddowe and with <hi>Didoes</hi> ghost, héere doe I protest by the greate and tender loue I

After this the dead Quéene neuer spake word more, for at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the cruell destinies gaue end vnto her life: but when <hi>Rosana</hi> perceiued her to be dead and she left to the world deuoide of comfort, shée began to teare the golden tramels from her head, and most furiouslye to beat her white and yuorie brest, filling the emptie ayre with clamors of her mones, and making the skies like an eccho to resound her lamentations, and at last taking her mothers letter in her hands, washing it with flouds of teares, and putting it next vnto her naked brest, she said: héer lye thou neare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioining to my bléeding heart, neuer to be remoued vntil I haue performd my mothers dying testiment. O work and the last worke of those her white and yuorie hands: heere doe I sweare by the honor of true Uirgins, not to part it from my bléeding bosom vntil such time as loue hath rent the disloyall heart of my vnkinde father, and in speaking this shée kissed it a thousand times, breathing forth milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sighes and straight with a blushing countenance as radient as <hi>Auroras</hi> glistring beames, she arose &amp; said: what is this <hi>Rosana,</hi> dost thou thinke to recall thy mothers life with ceremonious complaints and not performe that

her most in humane slaughter in a solitarie woode: this being done, he fortified himselfe in his blacke Castle, onely consorted with a cunning <hi>Nigromancer,</hi> whose skill in magick is so excellent, that al the knights in the world can neuer conquere the Castle, where euer since hee hath remained in despight of the whole earth.</p>
               <p>But now speake I of the tragical storie of my vnhappy mother, when as I her vnfortunate babe beganne first to strugle in her womb, wherin I wold I had bene strangled: she heard newes of her knights ill demeanure, and how he had wholly giuen himself to the spoile of virginitie, and had for euer left her loue, neuer intending to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the grief wherof so troubled her mind, that she could not in any wise desemble it, for vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a time being amongst her Ladies, calling to remembrance her spotted Uirgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the séede of dishonor planted in her wombe, she felt into a wonderfull and strange traunce, as though she had béen oppressed with sodain death, which when her Ladies and damsels beheld, they presently determined to vnbrace her rich ornaments, and to carrie her vnto her bed, but she made signes with her handes that they should depart and leaue her alone, whose commaundement they strait way obayed, not without great sorrow of them all, their loues were so déere. This afflicted Quéen when she saw that she was alone, began to exclaime against her fortune, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the fates with bitter exclamations, O vnconstant Quéene of chance (said shee) thou that hast warped such strange webs in my kingdom, thou that gauest my honor to that tirants lust, which without al remorse hath left me comfortles, tis thou that didst constraine me to set my life to sale, &amp; to sel my honor as it were with the crier, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me to do that which hath spotted my Princely estate, and stain'd my bright honor with blacke infamie: woe is me for my virginity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which my parents gaue me charge to haue respect vnto: but I haue carelessely kept it, &amp; smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Oh miserable Quéene, oh fond and vnhappy Lady: thy spéeches be too too foolish, for although thy desperate hand should pull out thy dispised harte from thy bléeding brest, yet can it not make satisfaction for thy dishonour.</p>
               <p>Oh Heauens, why do you not cast some fiery thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt downe vpon my head? or why doth not the earth gape and swallowe my infamous bodye?

               <p>With these and other like lamentations, this grieued Quéene passed away the time, till at laste she felte her wombe to growe big with childe: at the which she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued dubble paine, for that it was impossible to couer or hide it, and séeing her selfe in this case, like a woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abhorred, she determined to discouer her selfe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely vnto her subiectes, and deliuer her body vnto them to be sacrificed vnto their Gods: and with this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one day she caused certaine of her Nobles to be sent for, who straightway fulfilled her commaundement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when she perceiued her Lords, Knights and Gentlemen of honour came altogether before her, she couered her selfe with a rich robe and sate vpon her bed in her priuate cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber, being so pale and leane, that all them that sawe her had greate compassion vppon her sorrowe: beeing all set round about her bed and kéeping silence, she reuealed to them the cause of her griefe in this manner.</p>

               <p>After this when the Christian Knightes had pitifully bewailed the mizerie and vntimely death of her mother, they tooke their daggers and digged a déep graue vnder a Bay trée and buried her body, that hungry rauens might neuer seaze vpon it, or furious beasts teare it in péeces, nor rauenous Harpies deuour it: and after with the point of their daggers they in graued this Epitaph in the rinde of the Bay trée, which words were these that follow.</p>

               <p>The christian Knightes had not long time bewayled the a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as they went groping and féeling vp and downe, they found that they troad vpon no other thinges but dead mens bones, which caused them to stand still: and not

long after, they espyed a secret windowe, at the which entred much cléerenesse, and gaue a great light into the den where they were, by which they espyed a bed moste richly furnished with curtaines of silke, and golden pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants which stoode in a secret roome of the caue, behung with rich tapestrie of a sable colour: which bed when the Champions beheld, and being somewhat weary of their long fight which they had with the Giants in the Court of the Castle, they required some rest and desired some sleepe vpon the bed, but not all at one instant: for they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some daunger to bee at hand, and therefore Saint <hi>George</hi> as one most willing to be their watchman, and to kéep senternell in so daungerous a place, caused the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Champions to take their reposes vppon the bed, and he would be as wakefull as the cocke against all daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accidents: so the sixe Christian Knights repaired to the bed, whereon they were no sooner layde, but presently they fell into a heauy and dead sléep, in such sort that they could not be awaked by any manner of violence, not all the warlike drums in <hi>Europe</hi> if they were sounded in their eares, nor the ratling thunder claps of heauen were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to recall them from their sleeps, for indéed the bedde was inchaunted by the <hi>Nigromancers</hi> charmes, in such manner that whosoeuer but sate vpon the sides, or but the furniture of the bed, were presently cast into as heauy a sléepe as if they had drunke the ioyce of dwaile or the séede of Poppie, where we will leaue them for a tyme like men cast into a traunce, and speake of the terrible aduenture that hapned to S. <hi>George</hi> in the caue, who little mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of their inchantments, stoode like a carefull guard kéeping the furious wolfe from the spoile of the silly shéep: but vpon a sodaine his hart began to throb, &amp; his hayre to stand vpright vpon his head, yet hauing a heart fraught with inuinsible corage, he purposed not to awake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other knights, but of himselfe to withstand whatsoeuer hapned, so being in his princely cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there appéered to him as

hee thought the shape of a <hi>Magitian</hi> with a visage leane, pale and full of wrinckles, with lockes of blacke hayre hanging downe to his shoulders like to wreathes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed Snakes, and his body séemed to haue nothing vpon it but skin and bones, who spake vnto Saint <hi>George</hi> in this dispitfull manner: in an euill houre (said the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>) camst thou hether, and so shall thy lodging be, and thy entertainment worse, for now thou art in a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou shalt looke for no other thing, but to be meat vnto some furious beast, and thy surmounted strength shall not be able to make any defence.</p>
               <p>The English Champion whose heart was oppressed with extreame wrath: answered, O false and accursed charmer (said he) whome Gods confound for thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned artes, and for whom the fiends hath dig'd an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting tomb in hell, what furie hath inconst thée, that with thy false and deuelish charmes thou dost practise so much euill against trauelling and aduenterous Knightes, I hope to obtaine my libertie in dispight of al thy mischiefe and with my stronge arme to breake all thy bones in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>All that thou dost and wilt do wil I suffer at thy hands replyed the <hi>Nigromancer,</hi> onely for the reuengement that I will take of thée for the slaughter of the seauen Giants, which as yet lyes murthered in the court, and that very quickly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therewithall hee went inuisibly out of the Caue: so not long after at his backe hee heard a sodaine noise, and beheld as it were a window opening by little and little, where as there appeared a cleare light, by the which Saint <hi>George</hi> plainely perceaued that the wals of the Caue were washt with bloud, and likewise sawe that the bones whereon they treade at their first entry into the den were of humane bodies, which appeared not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long since their flesh was torne off with hard and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell téeth, but this consideration could not long endure with him, for that he heard a great rumor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and looking what it
<pb facs="tcp:1507:52"/>
should be, he saw that there was comming forth out of an other den, a mightie serpent with wings, as great in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as an Elephant, he had onely two féet which appeared out of that monstrous body but of a span length, and each foote had thrée clawes of thrée spannes in length, she came with her mouth open of so monstrous and huge a bigne, and so deformed, that a whole armed Knight horse and all, might enter in thereat, she had vpon her Iawes twoo tuskes which séemed to be as sharpe as any néedles, and al her body was couered with hard scales of diuers colours, and with great fury she came with her wings all abroad, Saint <hi>George</hi> although he had a valiant and an vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minde, yet could he not chuse but receiue some feare in séeing so monstrous a beast.</p>
               <p>But considering with him selfe, that it was then time, and great néed to haue courage, and to be expert and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for to make his defence, hee tooke his good cutting sword in his hand, and shrowded himselfe vnder his hard and stronge shéelde, and tarried the comming of that vgly monster.</p>
               <p>But when the furious beast saw that there was a pray whereon she might imploy her sharpe téeth, shee stroake with her inuenomous wings, and with her pearcing clawes she griped, and layd fast hold vpon Saint <hi>Georges</hi> hard shield, pretending to haue swallowed whole this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious warrier, and fastning her sharp tuskes vpon his helmet, which when she found so hard, she let goe her hold and furiously pulled at his target, with such a strenght that shee pulled it from his arme: with that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish knight stroake at her head a most mighty and stronge blow with his swoord, but in no wise it could hurt her, by reason of the hard scales wherewith it was couered, and though he gaue her no wound, yet for all that shee felt the blow in such sort that it made her to recoile to the ground, and to fall vpon her long and hideous tayle, then this oppressed Knight made great hast to redouble his force
<pb facs="tcp:1507:53"/>
to strike her another blow: but all was in vaine, for that vpon a sodaine she stretched her selfe so high, that he could not reach her head: but yet kinde Fortune so fauoured his hand, that he stroke her vpon the belly, whereas shee had no defence with scales, nor anie other thing but feathers: whereout issued such abundance of blacke blood, that it besprinkled all the denne about.</p>
               <p>This terrible and furious Serpent, when she felt her selfe so sore wounded, stroke at Saint <hi>George</hi> such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a blow with her taile, that if he had not séene it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it had béen sufficient to haue parted his bodie in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Knight to cleare himselfe from the blow, fell flat vpon the ground, for he had no time to make any other defence. But that terrible blow was no sooner passed ouer him, but straight waies he recouered his féete, at such time as the furious Serpent came towards him. Here Saint <hi>George</hi> hauing a great confidence in his strength, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such a valiant exployt, that all former Aduentures that hath béen euer done by anie Knight, may bee put in obliuion, and this kept in perpetuall memorie: for that he threw his sword out of his hand, and ran vnto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and imbraced her betwixt his mightie armes, &amp; did so squéeze her, that the furious Beast could not helpe her selfe with her sharpe clawes, but onely with her wings she beat him on euerie side. This valiant Champion and noble Warrier would neuer let her loose, but still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holding her betwixt his armes, continuing this peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and dangerous fight, till all his bright armour was imbrued with her bestiall blood, by which occasion shee lost a great part of her strength, and was not able long to continue.</p>
               <p>Long indured this great and dangerous incounter, and the infernall Serpent remained fast vnto the noble and valiant breast of the English Knight, till such time as he plainly perceaued that the Monster began to wexe faint, and to loose her strength. Likewise it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:53"/>
but Saint <hi>George</hi> wexed somewhat wearie, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the former fight he had so lately with the Giants. Notwithstanding when he saw the great weaknes of the Serpent, he did animate himselfe with courage, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing opportunitie by reason of the quantitie of blood that issued from her wounds, he tooke his trustie sword &amp; thrust it into her heart with such violence, that he cloue it in two péeces: so this infernall Monster fell downe dead to the ground, and carried the Christian Champion with her, for for that they were fast closed together, and by reason that the Serpent lacked strength, hée quickly cléered himselfe out of her clawes, and recouered his sword. But when he saw certainly that hee was cléere from the Monster, &amp; that she had yéelded vp her detested life into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brittle aire, he knéeled downe and gaue thankes to the immortal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God for his safe deliuerie. The venome was so great that the Serpent threw out to infect the knight, that if his armour had not béen of a precious vertue, hée had béen impoysoned to death.</p>
               <p>After the victorie was obtained and the Monster dead, he grew verie wearie and vnquiet, and was constrayned to sit and coole himselfe by a Well which was full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, standing by in a corner of the Caue, from whence the monstrous Serpent first appeared and came foorth. And when he found himselfe refreshed, he repayred to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted bed whereupon the other sixe Champions laye sléeping, dreaming of no such straunge accident that had happened to him: to whom he purposed to reueale the true discourse of all the dangers that had befalne him in that accident.</p>
               <p>But no sooner approached he vnto that inchaunted bed and had set himselfe downe vpon the one side thereof, and thinking to begin his discourse, but he presently fell into a heauie and dead slumber.</p>
               <p>There will we leaue them sléeping and dreaming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inchaunted bed, not to be wakened by anie means,

               <p>Then by his deuilish artes he caused seuen Lampes to burne continually before the entry of the Caue, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties whereof were so strange, that so long as the Lampes continued burning, the Champions should neuer be awaked and the fiers should neuer be quenched but by the water of an inchaunted fountaine, the which he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by magick arte had erected in the middle of the court guarded most strongely with fearefull shapes, and the water should neuer be obtained but by a Uirgin which at her birth should haue the forme of a Rose most liuely pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon her brest.</p>
               <p>These thinges being performed by the secrets of the <hi>Magitians</hi> skill added suth a pleasure to <hi>Leogers</hi> heart, that he thought himselfe eleuated higher then towers of heauen, for he accompted no ioy so pleasing vnto his soule as to sée his mortall enemies captiuated in his power, and that the <hi>Magitian</hi> had done more by his artes, then al the Knights in <hi>Asia</hi> could performe by prowesse: we will not now onely leaue the Champions in their sleeps drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of no mishap, but also the <hi>Magitian</hi> with <hi>Leoger</hi> in the blacke Castle, spending their time securely, careles of all insuing daunger, and speake now of the olde Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard whome the Champions at their first entring in at the gates of the Castle, where they left him to looke vnto their warlike palfries as they fed vpon the gréene grasse: but when this olde man coulde heare no newes of the Champions returne, he greatly mistrusted their confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that by some trecherie they were intercepted in

               <p>This Monster directed his way towards certaine Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of stone which stood in the Iland, and by reason of the stragling and greate noyse that the horsses made, he cast his head aside and espyed the thrée Knightes trauelling in companie of the Lady: vpon whome he had no sooner cast his blazing eye, but with a deuilish furye he ran towards them, and in stéed of a Club, he bare in his hand a mighty great and knotted Maple trée.</p>
               <p>These valiant Knightes neuer dismaide at the sight of this deformed creature, but against his comming, they chéered vp their horsses, and pricked their sides with their golden spurres, giuing a great shoute as a signe of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and withall, drawinge foorth their sharpe cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

swords they stood attending the furie of the Monster, who came roaring like a Bull, and discharged his knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted trée amongst the magnanimous Knightes, who with light leapes cléered themselues from his violent blowes, that his club fell downe to the ground with such a terrible fall, as thogh with the violence it wold haue ouerthrowne a Castle.</p>
               <p>With that the Knights presently alighted from theyr horses, thinking thereby more nimbler to defende them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and with more courage to assaile the Satyre. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie were the blowes on both sides, and dangerous the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, without signe of victorie inclining vnto eyther partie.</p>
               <p>During the Battell, <hi>Rosana</hi> (through the griefe and feare that she receiued) swounded vpon her palfray, &amp; had fallen beside his back, if she had not first closed her hands about the pummell of the saddle: and being come a little vnto her selfe, she made her humble supplication vnto the Gods, soliciting heauen, that she might rather be buryed in the Monsters bowells, thereby to satisfie hys wrathe, than to sée such noble Knights loose the least drop of blood, or to haue the smallest haire vpon their heads diminished: such was the loue and true zeale she bore vnto these thrée Knights.</p>
               <p>But Sa. <hi>Georges</hi> Sonnes so manfully behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the Encounter, bearing the prowesse of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers minde, that they made manie déepe wounds in the Monsters flesh, and such terrible gashes in his body, that all the gréene grasse was couered with his blacke blood, and the ground all to besmeared &amp; strewed with hys man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled flesh.</p>
               <p>When the diuelish Monster felt himselfe wounded, and saw how his blood stood vpon the earth like coniealed gore, hee fled from them more swifter than a whirlewinde, or like vnto an arrow forced from a musket, and ran in great hast to the Rockes that stood thereby, where presently he
<pb facs="tcp:1507:57"/>
threw himselfe into a Caue, pulling downe after him a Rocke of stone, which did close vp the entry, the which was done with so great lightnesse, that the Knights had no time to strike him, but after a while when they had blessed themselues to sée such a strainge and sodaine thing they assayed by strength to remoue the Rocke, and to cleare the mouth of the Caue, the which they did without any difficultnes.</p>
               <p>Yet for all that they coulde not finde which way they might enter in thereat, but like vnto Lyons fraughted with anger, fretting and chafing, they went searching round about the Rock to sée if they could espie any entry, and at last they found a great cliffe on the one side of the Rocke, and looking in thereat, they espyed the monster, lying vpon the floare licking of his bléeding wounds with his purple tongue.</p>
               <p>And séeing him, one of the Knights said: O thou traitor and distroyer by the high waies, O thou infernall deuill and enemy vnto the world, thou that art the deuourer of humane fleshe, and drinker of mans bloud, thinke not that this thy stronge and fast closing vp of thy selfe in this Rocke of stone shall auayle thee, or that thy deuelish body shall escape vnslaughtered out of our handes, no, no our bloudy weapons shal be sheathed in thy detested bowels, and riue thy damned heart asunder, and therewithall they thrust their weapons through the clift of the Rocke, and pearced his throat in such sorte that the monster pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dyed, the which being done they returned in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph like conquerers to <hi>Rosana,</hi> where they founde her halfe dead lying vpon her palfrie.</p>
               <p>But when shee sawe them returne in safetie like one new risen from death, with a ioyfull and lowde voice shee said, O God how hath it pleased thy deuine maiestie, to furnish these Knights with more strength and prowesse, then any other in all the world, else coulde they not haue choosd but haue béene ouercome by this remorceles mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:57"/>
which séemed to be of force to destroy kingdomes: therewithall she alighted in good state from her Palfray, and sate her downe vnder the shadow of a Pine-trée, where the thrée knights likewise sate downe, &amp; laid theyr wearie heads vpon her soft lap to sléepe, vpon whose faces she fanned a coole breathing ayre, and wiped their sweaty browes with her handkercher, vsing all the meanes shee could to moue them contentment.</p>
               <p>Long had they not reposed themselues vpon <hi>Rosanaes</hi> lappe, refreshing their wearie bodies with a golden sléepe, but they awaked and mounted vpon their stéedes, and the next morning by breake of day, they approached the sight of the blacke Castle, before whose walles they found seauen portly stéedes, féeding within a gréene pasture, and by them an ancient father, bearing in his face the true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of sorrowe, and caruing in the barke of trées the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of all his passed griefes: this man was the olde sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard which the seauen Champions of christendome (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their inchaunted sléepes in the Castle) lefte without the Gates to ouersée their horsses, as you heard before in the last Chapter.</p>
               <p>But Saint <hi>Georges</hi> sonnes (after they had a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the manner of the sheapheards silent lamentations) demaunded the causes of his griefe and wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned so néere the danger of the Castle? to whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, the curteous olde man answered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

But at last when Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Sonnes had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their former spéeches, one of them (though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reueale what they imagined) sayd vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde Shepheard: that likewise they came to bee reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that accursed Knight, for the spoyle of a beauteous and worthie Uirgine Quéene, done by the said lust inflamed Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Then the Ladie and the thrée Knightes alighted from their horses, and likewise committed them to the kéeping of the olde Shepheard: who courteously receiued them, &amp; earnestly prayed for their prosperous procéedings. So the thrée Knightes buckled close their armours, laced on their helmets, and put their shields vpon their armes, and in companie of <hi>Rosana</hi> they went to the Castle gate, the which glistered against the Sunne like burnisht golde: whereat hung a mightie Copper King, wherewith they beate so vehemently against the Gate, that it séemed to rattle like a violent tempestuous storme of thunder in the Element.</p>
               <p>Then presently there appeared (looking out at a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pillor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You Knights of strange Countreys said he, for so doth it appeare by your strange demeanours: if you desire to haue the gates opened, and your bones buried in the valts

               <p>Then one of the Knights went vnto the Iasper piller, and with a vehement breath sounded the inchanted trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet as S. <hi>George</hi> did before, whereat the gates flew open in like manner: wherein (without anie disturbance) they entred: &amp; comming into the same Court where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had fought with the Giants, they spied the inchanted Lampes, which hung burning before the entrie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caue where the Champions lay vpon the inchanted bed.

               <p>This importunate desire of <hi>Rosana,</hi> caused the thrée yong Knights not to loose anie time, but to search in euery corner of the Castle, till they had found the place wherin the Fountaine was: for as they went towards the North side of the Court, they espied another little doore standing in the wall, and when they came to it, they sawe that it was made all of verie strong yron, with a portal of stéele, and in the key hole thereof there was a brazen key, with t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet for all this they entered in thereat, and would not be daunted with anie ceremonious fear, but like knights of an heroycall estimation they went forward: wherein they were no sooner entred, but they saw that it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully darke, and it séemed vnto them that it should be a verie large Hall, and therein they heard verie fearefull howlings, as though there had bin a legion of helhounds, or that <hi>Plutoes</hi> Dogge had béen vice gerent of that place. Yet for all this these valiant Knights did not loose anye of their accustomed courage, nor wold the Ladie leaue their companies for anie danger: but they entred in further, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:1507:59"/>
tooke off their gauntlets from their left hands, whereon they wore meruailous great and fine Diamonds, which were set in rings, that gaue so much light, that they might plainly sée all things that were in the Hal, the which was verie great and wide, and vppon the walls were painted the figures of manie furious fiends and diuells, wyth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther straunge Uisions framed by Magicke arte, onely to terrefie the beholders. But looking verie circumspectlye about them on euerie side, they espied the inchanted foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine standing directly in the middle of the Hall, towards which they went with their shieldes braced on theyr left armes, and their good swords charged in their hands, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to withstand anie daungerous accident whatsoeuer should happen.</p>
               <p>But comming to the Fountaine, and offering to fill their helmets with water, there appeared before them a strange and terrible Griphon, which séemed to bee all of flaming fire who stroke all the thrée Knights one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in such sort, that they were forced to recoyle backe a great way: yet notwithstanding with great discretion they kept themselues vpright, &amp; with a wonderfull light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, accompanied with no lesse anger, they threw theyr shields at their backes, and taking their swordes in both their handes, they began most fiercely to assaile the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon with mortall and strong blowes. Then presentlye there appeared before them a whole legion of diuels with flesh-hookes in their hands, spitting forth flames of fire, &amp; breathing from their nosthrills smoking sulphure &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. In this terrible sort tormented they these thrée va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knights, whose yeres although they were but yong, yet with great wrath and redoubled force aduentred they themselues amongst this hellish crue, striking such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes, that in spite of them they came vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and proff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:60"/>Oh in what great trauel and perplexitie these Knights remained amongst this wicked and diuellish generation, for to defend themselues that they might attaine to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of this Aduenture, according to their knightlye promise.</p>
               <p>But during the time of all these daungerous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Rosana</hi> stood like one berest of sense, thorough y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the same: but at last remembring her selfe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie written in the siluer tablet, the which the knights perused by the inchaunted Lampes: the signification of which was, that the quenching of the lights should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished by a pure Uirgin, that had the liuely forme of a Rose naturally pictured vpon her breast: all the which <hi>Rosana</hi> knew most certainly to bee comprehended in her selfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore whilst they continued in their fight, she tooke vp a helmet that was pulled from one of the Knightes heads by the furious force of the Griphon, and ranne vnto the Fountaine and filled it with water, wherewith shee quenched the inchaunted Lampes, with as much ease, as though one had dipped a waxen torch in a mightie riuer of water.</p>
               <p>This was no sooner done and finished to <hi>Rosanaes</hi> chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest contentment, when that the heauens began to waxe darke, and the cléere skies to be ouerspred with a blacke &amp; thicke clowd, and it came with great thundrings &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and with such a terrible noyse, as though the earth would haue sunke: and the longer it indured, the more was the furie thereof, in such sort that the Griphon wyth all that deluding generation of spirits vanished away, and the Knights forsooke their incounters, and fell vpon theyr knées, and with great humilitie they desired of God to be deliuered from the furie of that excéeding and terrible tempest.</p>
               <p>By this sodaine alteration of the heauens, the knight of the Castle knew that the Lampes were extinguished,

               <p>The Nigromancer by his Arte likewise knew, that the Castle was yéelded vnto his Enemies power, &amp; that his charmes and magicke spells nothing preuailed: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he caused two ayrie spirits in the likenes of two Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to carrie him swiftly through the ayre in an Ebonie Chariot.</p>

               <p>These and such like reasons pronounced this disconted Champion, till such time as the elementes cleared, and that golden faced <hi>Phoebus</hi> glistred with splendant bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes into the caue through a secret hole, which séemed in their conceits to daunce about the vale of heauen, and to reioyce at their happie deliueries.</p>
               <p>In this ioyfull manner returned they vp into the court of the Castle, with their armors buckled fast vnto their bodies, which had not béene vnbraced in seuen dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where they met with the thrée Knightes comming to salute them, and to giue them the curtesies of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But when Saint <hi>George</hi> saw his Sonnes whome he had not séene in twice two yéeres before he was so rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ioy, that he swounded in their bosomes, and not able to giue them his blessing, so great was the pleasure he tooke in their fights.</p>

               <p>First they found within the Castle an armor fit for a woman, the which the inchaunter had caused to be made by magick arte of such a singuler nature that no weapon could pearce it, and so light in wearing, that it wayed no heuier then a Lions s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

was forced to lye broad waking like one disquieted by some sodaine feare: but as hee laye with wakefull eyes thinking vppon his passed fortunes, and numbring the minutes of the night with his cogitations, hée heard as it were a cry of night Rauens, which flew beating their fatal wings against the windows of his lodging, by which he immagined that some direfull accident were néere at hand: yet being not frighted with this fearefull noise, nor daunted with the croking of these Rauens, he lay silently not reuealing it to any of the other Champions that lay in the sixe seuerall beds in the same chamber: but at last being betwixt waking and sléeping, hee heard as it were the voice of a sorrowfull Knight that constrained these bitter passions from his tormented soule, and they contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these words following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh thou inuincible knight of England, thou that art not frighted with this sorrowful dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherein thou canst see nothing but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rise vp I say, from thy sluggish bed &amp; with thy vndaunted courage and stronge arme, infringe the charme of my inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <p>He which lay vpon the tombe, casting his eyes aside, espied Saint <hi>George,</hi> and knowing him to be a humane creature, with an inflicted voyce he said: Who art thou Sir Knight that art come into this place of sorrow, where nothing is heard but clamors of feare and terror?</p>
               <p>But tell me said Saint <hi>George,</hi> who art thou, that with so much griefe dast demaund of me, that which I stand in doubt to reueale to thée</p>

               <p>The English Champion that with a sad countenaunce stood beholding of the sorrowful damsel, and being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed at the sight which he had séene, answered and said: The Gods which are gouernours of my liberty, wil doe their pleasures, but touching the graunt of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest I neuer denied any lawfull thing to either Lady or Gentle woman, but with all my power and strength I was ready to fulfill the same, therefore demaunde what thy pleasure is, for I am readie in all thinges that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy remedie.</p>

This Magitian had a seuere &amp; graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and one that for wisedome better deserued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment than anie other in the kingdome, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well estéemed throughout all <hi>Babylon,</hi> almost equally with the king: for the which there ingendred in the kings heart a secret rancour and hatred towards him. Thys Magitian cast his loue vppon the yong Princesse <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and it was the Gods will that shee should repaye him wyth the same affection: so that both theyr hearts beeing
<pb facs="tcp:1507:66"/>
wounded with loue the one to the other, in such sorte that the fire kindled dayly more and more, and neither of them had any other imagination but onelye to loue: and not knowing how to manifest their griefes, they indured sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry great passions.</p>
               <p>Then loue which continually séeketh occasions, did on a time set before this Magician a wayting maid of <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaes,</hi> named <hi>Fidela:</hi> the which thing séemed to be wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught by the immortall power of the Goddesse <hi>Venus</hi>: oh what feare this Magitian was in to discouer vnto her all his heart, and to bewray the secrets of his louesicke soule: but in the end, by the great industrie and diligence of the waighting Maid (whose name was answerable vnto her minde) there was order giuen that these two louers shuld méete together.</p>
               <p>This faire <hi>Angelica,</hi> for that she could not at her ease enioy her true Louer, she did determine to leaue her own naturall Countrey and Father: and with this intention being one night with her Loue, she cast her armes about his necke and said.</p>
               <p>Oh my swéete and welbeloued Frend, séeing that the soueraigne Gods haue béen so kinde to me, as to haue my heart linked in thy breast, let me not finde in thée ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for that I cannot passe my time, except continually I enioye thy sight: and doo not muse (my Lord) at these my words, for the entyre loue that I beare to you, dooth constraine me to make it manifest. And this beléeue of a certaintie, that if thy sight be absent from mée, it will bée an occasion that my heart will lacke his vitall recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my soule forsake his earthly habitation. You knowe (my Lorde) how that the King my Father dooth beare you no good will, but doth hate you from hys soule, which wil be the occasion that we cannot enioy our harts contentments: for the which I haue determined (if you thinke well thereof) to leaue both my Father and my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Countrey, and to goe and liue with you in a strange
<pb facs="tcp:1507:66"/>
Land. And if you denie me this, you shall verie quickly sée your welbeloued Ladie without life: but I know you will not denie me it, for thereon consisteth the benefite of my welfare, and my chéefest prosperitie. And therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all shedding a few teares from her christall eyes, she held her peace.</p>
               <p>The Magitian (as one halfe rauished with her earnest desires) answered and said.</p>
               <p>My Loue and swéete Mistres, wherefore haue you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doubt that I will not fulfill and accomplish your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in all things? therefore out of hand put all things in a readines that your pleasure is to haue done: for what more benefite and contentment can I receaue, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy your sight continually, in such sort that neither of vs may depart from the others companie, till the fatall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenies giue end vnto our liues. But if it so fall out that fortune frowne vpon vs, that wee bee espied and taken in our enterprise, and suffer death together, what more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie can there be vnto my soule, than to dye with thée, and to leaue my life betwixt thy armes? Therefore doo not trouble your selfe my swéete Ladie and Mistres, but giue me leaue for to depart your presence, that I may prouide all things in a readines for our departures. And so wyth this conclusion they tooke leaue one of the other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away with as great secrecie as might possibly bee deuised.</p>
               <p>After this within a fewe dayes, the Magitian by hys inchauntments caused a Chariot to bee made, that was gouerned by two flying Dragons into the which without being espied by anie one, they put themselues, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their trustie wayting Maid: and so in great secret they departed out of the Kings Pallace, and tooke theyr iourney towards the Countrey of <hi>Armenia:</hi> in the which Countrey in a short time they arriued, and came without anie misfortune vnto a place whereas deepe riuers doo continually strike vpon a mightie rocke, vpon the which
<pb facs="tcp:1507:67"/>
stood an olde and ancient building, wherein they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to inhabit as a most conuenient place for their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, whereas they might without all feare of beeing found, liue peacefullie in ioying in each others loue.</p>
               <p>Not farre from that place there was a small Uillage, from whence they might haue necessarie prouision for the maintayning of their bodies: great ioy and pleasure th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se two Louers receiued when they founde themselues in such a place wheras they might take their ease and inioy their loues.</p>
               <p>The Magitian delighted in no other thing but to goe a hunting with certaine Countrie dwellers that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the next Uillage, leauing his swéete <hi>Angellica</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with her trustie <hi>Fidela</hi> in that stronge house, so in this order they liued together foure yeares, spending their daies in great pleasure: but in the end time (who neuer resteth in one degrée) did take from them their rest and repayed them with sorrow and extream mizerie. For when the King her father found her missiing, the sorrowe and griefe was so much that he receiued, that he kept his chamber a long time, and would not be comforted of anie bodie.</p>
               <p>Foure yeares he passed away in great heauinesse, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Courte with Ecchoes of his beloued daughter, and making the skies to resound his lamentations: sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was his foode, salte teares his drinke, and griefe his chiefe companion.</p>
               <p>But at last, vppon a time as he sate in his Chayre la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her absence with great heauinesse, and beeing ouercharged with griefe, he chanst to fall into a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some dreame, for after quiet sléepe had closed vp the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets of his eyes, he dreamd that he saw his daughter stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppo a Rocke by the sea side, offring to cast her body into the waues before she would returne to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that he beheld her Louer with an Armye of Satyrs and wilde men ready furnished with habiliments of warre to
<pb facs="tcp:1507:67"/>
pull him from his Throane, and to depriue him of hys Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Out of this vision he presently started from his chaire, as though it had béen one frighted with a legion of spirits, and caused foure of the chéefest Péeres of his Land to bee sent for, to whom he committed the gouernement of hys Countrey: certefying them that he intended a voyage to the Sepulcher at <hi>Memphis,</hi> thereby to quallifie the furie of his Daughters ghost, whom he dreamed to be drowned in the seas, and that except he sought by true submission to appease the angrie heauens, whom hee had offended by his vnnaturall sorrowes, hee should be deposed from hys Kingdome.</p>
               <p>None could withdraw him from this determination, though it was to the preiudice of his whole Land, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore within twentie dayes he furnished himselfe with all necessaries as well of armour and martiall furniture, as of golde and treasure, and so departed from <hi>Babylon</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately and alone, not suffering anie other (though many desired it humbly, and were verie earnest) to beare hym companie.</p>
               <p>But he trauelled not as he told his Lords after any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious order, but like a bloud-hound serching Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey after Countrey, Nation by Nation, and Kingdome by Kingdome, that after a barbarous manner hee might be reuenged vpon his Daughter for her disobedience. And as he trauelled, there was no caue, den, wood nor wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but he furiously entered, and diligently searched for his <hi>Angelica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At last by strange fortune he happened into <hi>Armenia,</hi> néere vnto the place whereas his Daughter had her resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: where, after he had intelligence by the Commons of that Countrey, that she remained in an olde ruynated Building on the top of a rocke néere at hand, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more tariance hee trauelled vnto that place, at such a time as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magitian her louing Husband was gone about
<pb facs="tcp:1507:68"/>
his accustomed hunting: where comming to the gate and finding it lockt, hee knockt thereat so furiously, that hee made the noyse to resound all the house ouer, with a redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Eccho.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Angelica</hi> heard one knocke, she came vnto the gate and with all spéed did open it. And when she thought to imbrace him, thinking it to be her Louer, she saw that it was her Father, and with a sodain alteration she gaue a great shrike, and ran with all the spéed she could backe into the house.</p>
               <p>The King her Father being somewhat angrie, like a furious Lion followed her, saying: It dooth little auayle thée <hi>Angelica</hi> to run away, for that thou shalt dye by thys reuengefull hand, paying me with thy death the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour that my royall crowne hath now by thy flight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.</p>
               <p>So he followed her till he came to the chamber where her wayting Maid <hi>Fidela</hi> was, who likewise presentlye knew the King: vpon whose wrathfull countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the image of pale death, and fearing the harme that should happen vnto her Ladie, she put her selfe ouer her bodie, and gaue most terrible, lowd, and lamentable shrikes.</p>
               <p>The King as one kindled in wrath, and forgetting the naturall loue of a Father towards his Childe, hee laid hand vppon his sword, and said: It dooth not profite thee <hi>Angelica</hi> to flie from thy death: for thy desert is such, that thou canst not escape from it: for heere mine owne arme shall be the killer of mine owne flesh: and I vnnaturally hate that, which Nature it selfe commaundeth me especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loue.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Angelica</hi> with a countenaunce more red than scarlet, answered and said: Ah my Lord and Father, wil you be now as cruell vnto me, as you had wont to be kind and pittifull? appease your wrath, and withdraw your vnmercifull sword, and hearken vnto this which I saye
<pb facs="tcp:1507:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in discharging my selfe in that you charge mee wthall, you shall vnderstand my Lord and father, that I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome and constrained by loue for to loue, forgetting all fatherly loue and my dutie towardes your Maiestie: yet for all that, hauing power to accomplish the same, it was not to your dishonour in that I liue honorablie with my husband: then the King (with a visage fraught with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ire) more liker a dragon in the woods of <hi>Hercania</hi> then a man of méeke nature, answered and said:</p>
               <p>Thou viperous brat, degenerate from natures kinde, thou wicked Traitor to thy generation, what reason hast thou to make this false excuse, when as thou hast commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted a crime that deserues more punishment then humaine nature can inflicte? and in saying these wordes, he lift vp his sword, intending to strike her vnto the harte and to bathe his weapon in his owne daughters blood, whereat <hi>Fidela</hi> being present, gaue a terrible shrike and threw her self<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But when the furious King sawe her in this sorte make her defence, he pulled her off <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the haire of the hed, offring to trample her delicate body vnder his féete, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make a way that he might execute his denermined purpose without resistance of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fidela</hi> when she sawe the King determined to kill his daughter, like vnto a Lyonesse she hung about his necke, and said: thou monstrous murtherer, more crueller then mad dogs in <hi>Egipt,</hi> why dost thou determine to slaughter the moste chaste and loyallest Ladye in the worlde? euen she within whose lappe vntamed Lyons will come and sléepe?</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:69"/>These wordes and teares of <hi>Fidela</hi> did little profite to mollifie the Kings heart, but rather like a wylde Boare in the Wildernes beeing compassed about with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Dogges, doth shake his members: euen so did thys King shake himselfe, and threw <hi>Fidela</hi> from him in such sort, that he had almost dasht her braines against the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber walls, and with double wrath hee did procure to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his furie. Yet for all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Fidela</hi> with terrible shrikes sought to hinder him, till such time as with his cruel hand he thrust the poynt of his sword in at her breast, so that it appeared foorth at her backe, whereby her soule was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leaue her terrestriall habitation, and flye into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice to those blessed soules, which dyed for true loues sake.</p>
               <p>Thus this vnhappie <hi>Angelica,</hi> when shee was most at quiet, and content with her prosperous life, then Fortune turned her vnconstant Whéele, and cast her from a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delight to a sodaine death.</p>
               <p>The yrefull King, when he beheld his daughters blood sprinkled about the chamber, and that by his own hands it was committed, he repented himselfe of the déede, and accursed the hower wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first motion of such a crime entered into his minde, wishing the hand that did it euer after might be lame, and the heart that did contriue it to be plagued with more extremities, than was miserable <hi>Oedipus:</hi> or to be terrified with her ghastly spirit, as was the <hi>Macedonian Alexander</hi> with <hi>Clitus</hi> shadow, whom he causeles murthered.</p>
               <p>In this manner the vnfortunate King repented hys Daughters bloodie Tragedie, with this determination, not to stay till the Magitian returned from his Hunters exercise, but to exclude himselfe from the companie of all men, &amp; to spend the remnant of his loathsome life among vntamed beasts in some wilde wildernes. Upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution he departed the chamber, and withall said: Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well thou liuelesse bodie of my <hi>Angelica,</hi> and may thy blood
<pb facs="tcp:1507:69"/>
which I haue spilt, craue vengeance of the Gods against my guiltie soule, for my earthly bodie shall indure a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable punishment. Likewise at his departure he writ vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chamber wals these verses following in his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters blood.</p>
               <l>For now to hills, to dales, to rockes, to caues I goe,</l>
               <l>To spend my dayes in shameful sorrow, griefe &amp; woe.</l>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fidela</hi> (after the departure of the King) vsed such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fury against her selfe, both by rending the golden tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melles of her hayre, and tearing her Rosie coloured face with her furious nayles, that shee rather seemed an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Furie subiect to wrath, than an earthly creature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with clemencie.</p>
               <p>She sat ouer <hi>Angelicaes</hi> bodie, wiping her bléeding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some with a damaske scarffe, which shee pulled from her waste, and bathing her dead bodie in luke-warme tears, which forcibly ranne downe from her eyes like an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Fountaine.</p>
               <p>In this wofull manner spent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sorrowfull <hi>Fidela</hi> that vnhappie day, till bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> went into the westerne seas: at which time the Magitian retourned from his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed hunting, and finding the doore open, he entered into <hi>Angelicaes</hi> chamber, where when he found her bodie weltring in congealed blood, and beheld how <hi>Fidela</hi> sate wéeping ouer her bléeding wounds, he cursed himselfe, for that he accompted his negligence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion of her death, in that he had not left her in more safetie. But when <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela</hi> had certefied him, how that by the hands of her owne Father she was slaughtered, he began like a franticke ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to rage against heauen and earth, and to fill the ayre with terrible exclamations.</p>
               <p>Oh cruell murtherer (said he) crept from the womb of some vntamed Tyger: I wilbe so reuenged vpon thée, O vnnaturall king, that all ages shal wonder at thy misery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:70"/>And likewise thou vnhappie Uirgin, shalt indure like punishment, in that thy accursed tung hath bruted this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall déed vnto my eares: the one for committing the crime and the other for reporting it. For I will cast such deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vengeance vpon your heads, and place your bodies in such continuall torments, that you shall lament my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies death, leauing aliue the fame of her with your lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>And in saying these words, he drew a Booke out of his bosome, and in reading certaine charmes and inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that was therein contained, he made a great &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie blacke clowde appeare in the skies, which was broght by terrible and hastie windes, in the which he tooke them vp both, and brought them into this inchaunted Castle, where euer since they haue remained in this Tombe, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly tormented with vnquenchable fire: and must eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue in the same extremitie, except some curteous Knight will vouchsafe to giue but thrée blowes vpon the Tombe, and breake the inchauntment.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you heard you magnanimious Knights, the true discourse of my vnhappie fortunes. For the virgine which for the true loue she bore vnto her Ladie was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this torment is my selfe: and this pale body ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the Tombe, is the vnhappie <hi>Babylonian</hi> King which vnnaturally murthered his owne Daughter: and the Magitian which committed al these villanies, is that accursed wretch, which by his charmes and diuellish En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments hath so strangely withstood your valiant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.</p>
               <p>These words were no sooner finished, but Sa. <hi>George</hi> drew out his sharpe cutting sword, and gaue thrée blowes vpon the inchaunted Tombe, whereat presentlye appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King standing before him, attyred in rich robes, with an Emperiall Diadem vpon his head: &amp; the Ladie standing by him, with a countenance more beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull than the damaske Rose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:70"/>When Saint <hi>George</hi> beheld them, he was not able to speake for ioy, nor to vtter his minde, so excéeding was the pleasure that he tooke in their sights. So without anie long circumstance, he tooke them betwixt both his hands, and led them into the chamber, whereas hee found the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights newly risen from their beds. To whom hée reuealed the true discourse of the passed Aduenture, and by what meanes he redéemed the King and the Lady from their inchauntments: which to them was as great ioye, as before it was to Saint <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, after they had for some sixe dayes refreshed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the castle, they generaly intended to accompany the <hi>Babilonian</hi> King into his Countrey, and to place him againe in his Regiment.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou doo well remember when that that the Christian champions had slaine the seuen Giants in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted castle, and had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest thereof, disloyall <hi>Leoger</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lord of the same, secretly fled: not for anie anger of the losse, but for the preseruation of his life.

<pb facs="tcp:1507:71"/>
her honour, and the confusion of his reputation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time his guiltie minde imagined, that the bléeding ghosts of the two Sisters (whom he both rauished and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) followed him vp and downe, haunting his ghost with fearfull exclamations, and filling each corner of the earth with clamours of reuengement.</p>
               <p>Such feare and terrour raged in his soule, that he thought all places where he trauelled, were filled with multitudes of of Knightes, and that the strength of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries pursued him, to heape vengeance vpon his guiltye head for those wronged Ladyes.</p>
               <p>Whereby hee curssed the hower of his birth, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the cause of his creation, wishing the Heauens to consume his bodye with a flashe of fire, or that the earth would gape and swallowe him: In this manner trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led he vp and downe, filling all places with Ecchoes of his sorrowes and griefe, which brought him into such a perplexitie, that many times hee would haue slaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and haue ridde his wretched soule from a worlde of mizeries.</p>
               <p>But it happened that one morning very early, by the first light of <hi>Titans</hi> golden toarch, he entred into a narow and straight path, which conducted him into a very thicke and solitarie Forrest, wherein with much sorrowe he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled till suche time as glistring <hi>Phoebus</hi> had passed the halfe parte of his iorney.</p>
               <p>And beeing wearye with the longe waye, and the greate waighte of his Armour, hee was forced to take some rest and ease vnder certaine freshe and gréene Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trées, whose leaues did bathe themselues in a faire and cleare Fountaine, whose streame made a bubling mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure on the pebble.</p>
               <p>Béeing set, he began a newe to haue in remembrance his former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted cruelty, and complaining of Fortune he published his great griefe, and although he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of complaining, and séeing hinselfe without all remidy,

               <p>O my déere Lord answered she, dost thou request of me to giue thy body a Sepulcher? well I sée that it is requisit, to séeke some to giue it vnto vs both, for I knowe my life can not continue longe, if the angry fates depriue me of your liuing companye: and without strength to procéed any further in speaches, she kissed his face with great sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and sighes, making within her selfe a terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte, tarying for the answere of her dying Father, who with no lesse paine and anguish of death, said:</p>

               <p>O my déere father sayd she, what small benefite haue I receiued for all my trauell and paine, the which I haue suffered in séeking of thée, and nowe in the finding of thée the more is my griefe, for that I came to sée thée dye? Oh most vnhappie that I am, where was my minde when I saw that fatall dagger pearce thy tender brest? whereon was my thought? wherefore did I stand still, and did not with great lightnes make resistance against that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow?</p>
               <p>If my strength would not haue serued me, yet at the least I shoulde haue borne thée companie: you furious beastes that are hid in your dens and déepe caues, where are you now? why doe you not come and take pittie vpon my griefe in taking away my life? in doing so you shewe your selues pittifull, for that I doe abhorre this dolorous life, yet she did not forget the promise that shee made him, which was to giue his body burial in her mothers tombe. This was the occasion that she did somewhat cease her lamentation, and taking vnto her selfe more courage then her sorrowfull griefe would consent vnto, she put the dead bodie vnder a mightie pine Apple trée, and couered it with leaues of gréene grasse, and like wise hung his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, vpon the bowes, in hope that the sight thereof would cause some aduenturous knight to approach her presence, that in kindenes would asist her to intombe him: heere we will leaue <hi>Rosana</hi> wéeping ouer her fathers body, and speake of the <hi>Nigromancer</hi> after his flight from the black Castle.</p>

               <p>The Magitian at this vnexpected noyse, cast his head on the one side, and espied <hi>Rosana</hi> newly awaked from a heauy sléep, most richly armed with a stronge inchaunted armor after the manner of the <hi>Amazonians,</hi> but for al that he did not let to make an ende of arming himselfe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing laced on his Burgonet, hee went towardes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder with his sworde ready drawne in his hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting her with mortall battell.</p>

                  <hi>Rosana</hi> who saw his determination, did procure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her selfe, and offend her enemy.</p>

to his ouerthrow, striking at each other such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blowes, and with so great furie, that manie times it made either of them to loose feeling: and both séeing the great force of one another, were meruailously incensed with anger.</p>
               <p>Then the valiant Lady threw her shéeld at her backe, that with more force she might strike and hurt her enemy: and therewithall gaue him so strong a blow vpon the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonet, that he fell astonied to the earth without anie féel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But when the Magitian came againe to himselfe, he returned <hi>Rosana</hi> such a terrible blow, that if it had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to alight vpon her, it would haue clouen her head in péeces, but with great discretion she cleared her self ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in such sort, that it was stroken in vaine, and with great lightnes she retyred, and stroke the Magitian so furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that she made him once againe to fall to the ground, al astonied, and there appeared at the visor of his helme the abundance of blood that issued out of his mouth: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he reuiued, and got vp in a trice, with so great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the smoke which came from his mouth, séemed like a myst before his helme, so that almost it could not be séene.</p>

               <p>The Magtion for safe garde of his life, presently agréed to performe her desires, and protested to accomplish what soeuer she demaunded.</p>
               <p>Then presently by his Arte he prepared his yron Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot with his flying dragons in a readines, wherein they layd the murthered bodye of <hi>Leoger</hi> vppon a pillowe of mystle-toe, and likewise placed themselues therein, wher in they were no sooner entred, with necessaries belonging to their trauelles, but they flewe thorowe the ayre more swifter then a whirl-wind, or a shippe sayling on the seas in a stormye tempest.</p>
               <p>The wonders that he performed by the way, be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and miraculous, that I want an Orators eloquence to discribe them, and a Poets skil to expresse them.</p>

               <p>Thus was <hi>Rosana</hi> with her fathers dead body, caryed through the ayre b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And at the last, they arriued néere vnto the confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> beeing the place of their long desired rest: But when they approached néere vnto the Queene of <hi>Armenias</hi> groue, they descended from their inchaunted Chariot, and bore <hi>Leogers</hi> body to his burying place, the which they found (since <hi>Rosanaes</hi> departure) ouergrowne with mosse

and wythered brambles: yet for all that they opened the Sepulcher, and layd his bodie (yet freshly bléeding) vpon his Ladies consuming carcasse: which beeing done, the Magitian couered againe the graue with earth, and laid thereon gréene turues, which made it séeme as though it neuer had béen opened.</p>
               <p>All the time that the Magitian was perfourming the ceremonious Funerall, <hi>Rosana</hi> watered the earth wyth her teares, neuer withdrawing her eyes from looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Graue: and when it was finished, shee fell into this most sorrowfull and distresfull lamentation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Oh cruell Destinies (said she) sith your rigours haue bereaued me of both my Parents, &amp; left me to the world a comfortlesse Orphane, receaue the sacrifice of my chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in payment of your vengeaunce: and let my blood here shed vpon this Graue, shewe the singlenesse of my heart. And with the like solemnitie may all their hearts be broken in péeces, that séeke the downfall and dishonor of Ladies.</p>
               <p>As she was vttering these and such like sorrowes, shee tooke foorth a naked sword, which she had readie for the same effect, and put the pummell to the ground, and cast her breast vpon the poynt. The which shee did with such furious violence and such excéeding hast, that the Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an although he was there present could not succour her, nor preuent her from committing on her selfe so bloodie a fact.</p>
               <p>This sodaine mischaunce so amazed him, and so grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his soule, that his heart (for a time) would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that his tung should speake one word to expresse hys passion.</p>
               <p>But at last, (hauing taken a truce with sorrowe, and recouering his former speach) he tooke vp the dead bodye of <hi>Rosana,</hi> bathed all in blood, and likewise buried her in her Parents Graue: and ouer the same he hung vp an

Epitaph that did declare the occasion of all their deathes.</p>
               <p>This being done to expresse the sorrowes of his heart for the desperat death of such a Magnaminious Lady, and the rather to exempt himselfe from the company of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine creatures: he erected ouer the graue (by magicke arte) a very stately Tombe, the which was in this order framed.

               <p>And néere vnto the sepulcher there lay a terrible great beast, headed like a Lyon: his brest and body like a wolfe, and his tayle like a scorpion, which séemed to spitte conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flames of fire: the sepulcher was compassed about with a wall of yron, with foure gates for to enter in ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: the gates were after the manner and cullour of fine Diamonds and directly ouer the top of the chiefest gate, stood a marble pillor whereon hung a table written with red letters: the contentes whereof were as followeth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He valiant Christian Champions hauing as you heard in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter going before, perfourmed the Aduenture of the inchaunted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, accompanied the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> King home to his kingdom of <hi>Assiria,</hi> as they had all verie solemnly and faithfully promised to him.</p>
               <p>But when they approached the Confines of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and made no question of peacefull and princely entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was neither signe of peace, nor likelihood of ioyfull or frendly welcome: for all the Countrey raged with intestine warre, foure seuerall Competitors vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly striuing for what to the King properly and of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
               <p>The vnnaturall causers and stirrers vp to thys blood-deuouring
<pb facs="tcp:1507:83"/>
controuersie, were the foure Noblemen, vnto whom the King vnaduisedly committed the gouernment of his Realme, when hee went in the tragicall pursute of his faire daughter, after his dreaming illusion that caused him so cruelly to séeke her death. And the breaking out into this hurly burly, grew first to head in this maner following.</p>
               <p>Two yeres after the Kings departure, these Deputies gouerned the publike State in great peace, and with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent policie, til after no tidings of the King could be heard notwithstanding so manie messengers as were in euerie quarter of the world sent to enquire of him: and then did Ambition kindle in all their hears, each striuing to wrest into his hand the sole possession of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>To this end did they all make seuerall frends: for this had they contended in manie Fights, and now lastly they intended to set all their hopes vpon this maine chaunce of warre, intending to fight all till thrée fell, and one remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victor ouer the rest, whose head should bee beautifyed with a crowne.</p>
               <p>But of traitors and treason the end is sodaine &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for no sooner had Saint <hi>George</hi> (placing himselfe betwéene the Battells) in a bréefe Oration shewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of the King, and he himselfe to the people disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his reuerend face, but they all shouted for ioye, and haled the Usurpers presently to death, and reinsialled in his ancient dignitie, their true, lawfull and long lookt for King.</p>
               <p>The King being thus restored married <hi>Fidela</hi> for her faithfulnes: and after the nuptiall Feasts, the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (at the earnest request of Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi>) departed towards <hi>Italy:</hi> where in <hi>Rome</hi> the Emperour spared no cost honourably and most sumptuously to entertaine those neuer daunted Knightes, the famous Wonders of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:84"/>At that time of the yeare when the Summers Quéen had beautefied the Earth with interchaungeable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Saint <hi>George</hi> (in companie of the Emperour) with the rest of the Champions chanced to walke along by the side of the Riuer <hi>Tyber,</hi> and to delight themselues with the pleasurable meades, and beauteous prospect of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Before they had walked halfe a myle from the Cittie, they approached an ancient Nunnerie, which was right faire and of a stately building, and likewise incompassed about with christall streames and gréene meddowes, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all manner of beauteous trées, and fragrant flowers.</p>
               <p>This Nunnerie was consecrated to <hi>Diana</hi> the Quéene of Chastitie, and none were suffered to liue therein, but such chast Ladies and Uirgins, as had vowed themselues to a single life, and to kéepe their Uirginities for euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted.</p>
               <p>In this place the Emperours onely Daughter liued a professed Nunne, and exempted her selfe from all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, except it were the fellowship of chast and Religious Uirgins.</p>
               <p>This vertuous <hi>Lucina</hi> (for so was shee called) hauing intelligence before by the ouerséeers of the Nunnerie, how that the Emperour her Father with manie other Knights were comming to visite their religious Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against their approach shee attyred her selfe in a gowne of white satten, all layd ouer with gold lace, also hauing her golden lockes of haire somewhat laid foorth: and vpon her head was knit a garland of swéete smelling flowers, which made her séeme celestiall and of a diuine creation.</p>
               <p>Her b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

face: nor neuer could the flattering Syrens more beguile the trauellers, then did her bright countenaunce inchant the English Champion for at his first entrance into the Nunnerie, he was so rauished with her sight, that he was not able to withdrawe his eyes from her beauty, but stoodszigag vppon her Rosie culloured chéekes, like one bewitched with <hi>Me-dusaes</hi> shadowes: but to bee shorte, her beauty séemed so Angellicall, and the burning flames of loue so fieres his heart, that he must either inioy her companye or giue ende to his life by some vntimely meanes.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>George</hi> beeing wounded thus with the darte of loue, dissembled his griefe and not reuealed it to any one, but departed with the Emperor back againe to the Citie, leauing his heart behinde him cloased in the stonye Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery with his louely <hi>Lucina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that ensuing night he could not enioy the benifit of sléepe, but did contemplate vpon the diuine beautye of his Lady, and fraughted his minde with a thousand seuerall cogitations how hee might attaine to her loue, beeing a chaste virgin and a professed Nun.</p>
               <p>In this manner spent hee away the night, and no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appéered the mornings brightnesse in at his chamber window, but he arose from his restlesse bed, and attyred him selfe in watchet veluet, to signifie his true loue, and wandred all alone vnto the Monastery wher he reuealed his déepe affection vnto his Ladye, who was as farre from graunting to his requests, as heauen is from earth, or the déepest seas from the highest Elements: for shee protested while life remayned within her bodye, neuer to yeild her loue in the way of mariage to anye one, but to remaine a pure virgin and one of <hi>Dianaes</hi> traine.</p>
               <p>No other resolution could Sa. <hi>George</hi> get of the chaste Nun, which caused him to departe in great discontent, intending to séeke by some other meanes to obtaine her loue, so comming to the rest of the Christian Champions,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:85"/>
he reuealed to them the truth of all things that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who in this maner counsailed him, that hee should prouide a multitude of armed Knightes, euery one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their handes a sword ready drawen, and to enter the Monastery at such a time as she little mistrusted, and first with faire promises and flattering speeches, to entice her to loue, then if she yéelded not, to fill her eares with cruell threatnings, protesting that if she will not graunt to requite his loue with like affection, he would not leaue standing one stone of that Monastery vppon an other, and likewise to make her a bloudy offering vppe to <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This pollicy liked wel Saint <hi>George,</hi> though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to prosecute such cruelty: so the next morning by break of day he went vnto the nunnery in company of no other but the christian champions armed in bright ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with their glistering swordes ready drawen, the which they caried vnder their side cloakes to pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uent sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>
               <p>But when they came to the Monastery, and had ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the chamber of <hi>Lucina</hi> (whom they found knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the bare ground at her ceremonious orasons) Saint George first proffered kindnes by faire promises, and afterward made knowne his vnmercifull pretended cruelty, and therewithall shaking their bright swordes against her vertuous brest, they protested (though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their mindes) that except he would yéeld vnto Saint <hi>George</hi> her vnconquered loue, they would bathe their weapone in her dearest bloud.</p>
               <p>At which wordes the distressed Uirgin, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with feare, sunke down presently to the ground, and lay for a time in a dead agony, but in the ende, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering her selfe, she lifted vp her angelicall face, shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder a cloude of pale sorrow, and in this maner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her minde.</p>
               <p>Most renowned, and well approoued Knights said she,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:85"/>
it is as difficult to me, to climbe vppe to the highest toppe of heauen, as to perswade my minde to yeeld to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of your requests.</p>
               <p>The pure and chast Goddesse <hi>Diana</hi> that sittes nowe crownde amongst the golden starres in heauen, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge my periured promise if I yéeld to your desires, for I haue long since deepely vowed to spende my daies in this religious house, in the honour of her diety, and not to yéelde the flower of my virginity to any one, which vow I will not infringe for all the Maiesty of Roome: you know braue champions, that in time the watery droppes will mollify the hardest Diamond, and time may weede out this deepe roote and impression from my heart.</p>
               <p>Therfore I request of you by the honour of true knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and by the loues you beare vnto your natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, to graunt me the liberty of seauen daies, that I may at full consider with my heart, before I giue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to your demaunds, and to the intent that I may make some publike sacrifice as well to appease the wrath which the chast Goddesse <hi>Diana</hi> may conceaue against me, as to satisfie mine owne soule, for not fulfilling my vowe.</p>
               <p>These wordes being no sooner ended, but the champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons incontinently without any more delay ioyfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and moreouer profered themselues to bee all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the same sacrifice, and so departed from the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery with excéeding great comfort.</p>
               <p>The champions being gone, <hi>Lucina</hi> called togither all the rest of the Nuns, and declared to them the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of her assailment, where after amongst this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous company, with the help of some other of their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued friends, they deuised a most strange sacrifice, which hath since been the occasion that so many inhumaine and bloudy sacrifices hath bin committed.</p>
               <p>The next morning after sixe daies were finished, no sooner did bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> shew his golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beames abroad,
<pb facs="tcp:1507:86"/>
but the Nunnes began to prepare all thinges in readines for the sacrifice: for directly before the doore of the Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stary, they hyred cunning workmen to erect a scaffold, all very richly couered with cloth of golde, and vpon the scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold (about the middle therof) was placed a faire table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered also with a Carpet of cloth of golde, and vppon it a chafingdish of coales burning: all this beeing set in good order, the Emperor with the Christian Champions, and many other Roman knights being present to beholde the cerimonious sacrifice, who little mistrusting the dolefull tragedie that after hapned.</p>
               <p>The assemblie béeing silent, there was straightwayes heard a swéete and hermonious sound of Clarions and Trumpets and sundrie other kind of Instrumentes: these entred first vppon the scaffolde, and next vnto them were brought seauen Rammes, all adorned with fine white woole, more softe in féeling then <hi>Arabian</hi> silke, with huge and mightie cragged hornes bound about with garlands of flowers: after them followed a certaine number of Nunnes attyred in blacke vestures, singing their accust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed songes in the honor of <hi>Diana</hi>: after them followed an auncient Matrone drawne in a Chariot by foure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virgins, bringing in her handes the Image of <hi>Diana</hi>: and on either side of her two auncient Nunnes of great estimation, each of them bearing in their handes rich ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of golde full of most precious and swéete wines: then after all this came the beautifull <hi>Lucina</hi> apparelled with a rich Roabe of estate, beeing of a great and inestimable value.</p>
               <p>Thus cerimoniously they ascended the scaffold, where the Matrone placed the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> behinde the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingdish of coales that was there burning: the rest of the Nunnes continued still singing their songs and drinking of the precious wines that was brought in the golden vessell: this being done, they all at once brought lowe the necks of the Rams by cutting their throates, whose bloods
<pb facs="tcp:1507:86"/>
they sprinckled round about the scaffold, and opened their bowelles and burned their inward partes in the chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish of coales.</p>
               <p>Thus with this slaughter, they made sacifice vnto the Quéene of Chastitie: at the sight whereof was present, the surfetting Louer Saint <hi>George,</hi> with the other sixe Christian Knightes armed all in bright armor, and were all verye attentiue to this that I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The sacrifice ended, this <hi>Lucina</hi> commaunded silence to be made, and when all the company were still she ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp her selfe vpon her féete, and with a heauie voyce distilling many salte teares: she said.</p>
               <p>O most excellent and chaste <hi>Diana,</hi> in whose blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some we vndefiled Uirgins doe recreate our selues: vnto thy deuine excellency doe I now commende this my last sacrifice, crauing record of all the Gods, that I haue done my best to continue a spotles maiden of thy most beautiful traine.</p>
               <p>Oh heauens shall I consent to deliuer my Uirginitie willingly to him whose soule desires to haue the vse of it, or shall I my selfe commit my vtter ruine and sorrowfull destruction, the which procéedeth onely by the meanes of my flouring beautie, the which woulde it had beene as blacke as the nightly rauens, or like to the tawny tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Moores in the furthest mountaines of <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O sacred <hi>Diana,</hi> thou blessed Quéene of chastitie, is it possible that thou doest consent that a Uirgin descended from so royall a race as I am, should procure to spotte the worthines of her predecessors, by yéelding her Uirgins honor to the conquest of loue without respecting my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or regarding my chaste vowe I haue made vnto thy diety?</p>
               <p>Well séeing it is so that I must néedes violate my selfe against all humane nature, I beséech thée to receiue the solempnitie of this my death, which I offer vp in sacrifice to thy deuine excellencie, for I am héere constrained with
<pb facs="tcp:1507:87"/>
mine own trembling hand to cut off the flourishing bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of these my dayes: for this I sweare before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of heauen, that I had rather offer vp my soule into the s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le of my chastitie, to the conquest of anie Knight in the world.</p>
               <p>And now to thée I speake thou valiant Knight of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> behold héere I yéeld vnto thy hands my liuelesse bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to vse according to thy will and pleasure, requesting onely this thing at thy hand, that as thou louedst mee ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, thou wilt loue me dead, and like a mercifull Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion suffer me to receaue a princely Funerall.</p>
               <p>And last of all, to thée diuine <hi>Diana</hi> doo I speake, accept of this my bléeding soule, that with so much blood is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thée.</p>
               <p>So in finishing this sorrowfull speach she drew out a faire and bright shining sword, which shee had hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly vnder her gowne, and setting the hylt agaynst the Scaffold (little looked for of her Father and those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were present) shee sodainly threw her selfe vppon the poynt of that Sword, in such a furious manner, that it ryued her bloodie heart in sunder, and so rendred her soule to the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of her, vnto whom she offered her bloodie and ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sacrifice.</p>
               <p>What shall I héere declare the lamentable sorrowes and pittifull lamentation that was there made by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and other Roman Knights that were present at this vnhappie mischance? so great it was, that the walles of the Monasterie ecchoed, and their pittifull shrikes ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the heauens.</p>
               <p>But none was more gréened in mind than the afflicted English Champion, who (like a man distraught of sense) in great furie rushed amongst the people, throwing them downe on euerie side, till he ascended vpon the scaffold: &amp; approaching the dead bodie of <hi>Lucina,</hi> hee tooke her vp in his armes, and with a sorrowfull and passionate voyce he
<pb facs="tcp:1507:87"/>
said. O my beloued ioy, and late my only hearts delight, is this the Sacrifice wherein (through thy desperatenes) thou hast deceiued me, who loued thée more than my selfe? is this the respite that thou requiredst for seauen dayes, wherein thou hast concluded thy own death and my vtter confusion?</p>
               <p>Oh noble <hi>Lucina,</hi> and my beloued Ladie, if this were thy intent, why didst not thou first sacrifice mee thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and Loue, wholly subiected vnto thy deuine beautie?

               <p>Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> accursed by this chaunce, because thou hast consented to so bloodie a tragedie, by the eternall powers of heauen, that neuer more thou shalt be worshipped, but in euerie Countrey where the English Champion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>Lucina</hi> in thy stead shall be adored.

               <p>No sooner had he deliuered these speaches, but incensed with furie he drew out his sword, and parted the image of <hi>Diana</hi> in two péeces, protesting to ruinate the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, within whose walls the deuice of this bloodie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was concluded.</p>

               <p>The Emperour had a Sonne, as valiant in armes as anie borne <hi>Italian</hi> except Saint <hi>Anthonie.</hi> This young Prince whose name was <hi>Lucius,</hi> seeing his sisters timeles

death and by what meanes it was committed, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended with a traine of a hundred armed Knightes, which continually attended vpon his person, to assaile the discontented Champions, and by force of armes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his sisters death.</p>
               <p>This resolution so incouraged the Romaine Knyghtes, but especially the Emperors sonne, that betwixt these two companies began as terrible a battle as euer was fought by any knights, the fearcenes of their blowes so excéeded the one side against the other, that they did resounde ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes, and they yeelded a terrible noyse in the great woods.</p>
               <p>This battell did continue betwixt them both sharp and fierce for the space of two houres, by which time the valor of the encensed Champions so preuailed, that most of the Romaine knights were discomfited and slaine, some had their handes pared from their shoulders, some had their armes and legs lopped off, and some lay breathles w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But when the valiant young Prince of <hi>Roome</hi> sawe his knightes discomfited, and hee lefte alone to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so many noble Champions, he presently set spurs to his horse, and fled from them like to a heape of oust forced by a whirlewinde.</p>
               <p>After whom the Champions would not persue, account<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting it no glory to their names to triumph in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of a single knig<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

After which, hee like a starued Lion trauersed along by the Riuer of <hi>Tybris,</hi> filling all places with his melancholy passions, vntill such time as hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a thicke groue, wherein he purposed to rest hys wearie limbes, and lament his misfortunes. After he had in this solitarie place vnlaced his Helmet, and huried it scornfully against the ground, the infernal Furies began to visite him, and to sting his breast with motions of fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reuenge. In the end he cast vp his wretched eyes vnto

This being said, he drew out his dagger, and ryued hys heart in sunder. The newes of whose desperate death, after it was bruted to his Fathers eares, hée interred hys bodie with his Sister <hi>Lucinaes,</hi> and erected ouer them a stately Chappell, wherein the Nunnes and ceremonious Monkes during all their liues sung Dirges for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens soules.</p>
               <p>After this the Emperour made proclamation through all his Dominions, that if anie Knight were so hardie as trauell in pursute after the English Champion, &amp; by force of armes bring him backe, and deliuer his head vnto the Emperour, he should not onely be held in great estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the Land, but receaue the gouernment of the Empire after his decease. Which rich proffer so encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the mindes of diuers aduenterous Knightes, that they went from sundry Prouinces in the pursute of Saint <hi>George,</hi> but their attempts were all in vaine.</p>

                  <p>Of the triumphs, tilts and turnaments that were solemnly held in Constantinople by the Grecian Emperour, and of the honorable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures that wer there atchiued by the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian champions, with other strange accidents that happened.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Easterne Parts of the world the fame and valiant déedes of the Champions of Christendome was noysed, with their honourable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, heroycall actes, and feates of armes, naming them the myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of nobilitie, and the types of bright honour. All Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (to whose eares the report of their valors was bruted) desired much to behold their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages. But when the Emperour of <hi>Grecia</hi> (kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping then his Court in the Cittie of <hi>Constantinople)</hi> heard of their mightie and valiant déedes, he thirsted after their sights, and his minde could neuer bee satisfied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, vntill such time as he had deuised a meane to trayne them vnto his Court, not onely in that he might enioy the benefit of their companies, but to haue his Court honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the presence of such renowmed Knights: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this manner it was accomplished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:90"/>The Emperour dispatched Messengers into dyuers parts of the world, giuing them in charge to publish tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out euery Countrey and Prouince as they went, of an honourable Turnament that should bee holden in the Cittie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> within sixe months following: thereby to accomplish his intent, and to bring the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Champions (whose companie hee so desired) vnto hys Court.</p>
               <p>This charge of the Grecian Emperor (as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) was spéedely perfourmed, with such diligence, that in a short time it came to the eares of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christian knights, as they trauelled betwixt the Prouinces of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> Who at the time appointed came in great pompe and maiestie to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to furnish foorth the honorable Triumphs.</p>
               <p>At the fame whereof likewise resorted thether a great number of Knights of great valour and strength: among whom was the Prince of <hi>Argler,</hi> with a goodly companie of noble persons: and the prince of <hi>Fesse,</hi> with many well proportioned Knights. Likewise came thether the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> in great state, and with no lesse maiestie came the King of <hi>Silicia</hi> and a Brother of his, who were both Giants. Manie other braue and valiant Knights (whose names I héere omit) came thether to honour the Grecian Emperour: for that he was verie well estéemed of them all. And as they came to honor the triumphs, so likewise they came to prooue their fortitudes, and to get fame and name, &amp; the praise that belongeth to aduentrous knights. It was supposed of all the companie, that the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> wold gaine by his prowesse the dignity from the rest, for that he was a Giant of verie big members, although his Brother were taken to be the more furious Knight: who determined not to iust, for that his Brother should get the honour and praise from all Knightes that came. But it fell out otherwise, as heereafter you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:90"/>So when the day of turniment was come, all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and damsels put themselues in places to beholde the iesting, and attired themselues in the greatest braue<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What should I say héere of the Emperours Daughter, the faire <hi>Alcida,</hi> who was of so great beauty that she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more liker a deuine substance then an earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and sate glistering in her rich ornaments amongest the other Ladies like vnto <hi>Phoebe</hi> in the Christall firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was noted of all behoulders to be the fairest Princes that euer mortall eye beheld: so when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was seated vppon his imperiall throane vnder a tent of gréene veluet, the Knights began to enter into the listes, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reat obedience vnto all the Ladies and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
               <p>After him entred a Pagan Knight, who was Lorde of Si<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tesie as the other did.</p>
               <p>Which being done, he beheld the King of Arabia, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to receaue him at the Iust: and the trumpets began to sound, giuing them to vnderstand that they must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues ready to the incounter: whereat these Knights were nothing vnwilling but spurred their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers with great fury and closed together with couragious vallure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:91"/>The king of Arabia most strongly made his encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and stroke the Pagan without missing vpon the brest: but the Pagan at the next race, being heate with furie stroke him so surely with his launce, in such sort that he heaued him out of his saddle, and he fell presently to the ground, after which the Pagan Knight rode vp &amp; downe with great pride and gladnes.</p>
               <p>The Arabian king being thus ouerthrowne, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the listes the king of Argier armed with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther furniture but with siluer male and a brestplate of bright stéele before his brest, his pompe and pride excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the knightes that were then present, but yet to small purpose his pride and arrogancy serued, for at the first encounter hee was ouerthrowne to the ground: in like sort did this Pagan vse fiftéene other knightes of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene seuerall prouinces, to the great wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperour and all the assembly.</p>
               <p>During all these valiant encounters Saint <hi>George</hi> with the other christian champions st<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d a farre off vpon a high gallery beholding them, intending not as yet to be séene in the tilte.</p>
               <p>But now this valiant Pagan after he had rode some sixe courses vp and downe the place, and séeing none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the tilt yarde, he thought to heare all the fame and honour away for that day.</p>
               <p>But at that same instance there entred the noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Prince of Fesse, being for courage the onely pride of his countrey hee was a merueilous well proportioned knight and was armed all in white armour, wrought with excellent knottes of golde, and hee brought in his company a hundred Knightes, all attired in white satten, and riding about the place he shewed his obedience vnto the Emperour and to all the Ladies, end thereupon the trumpets began to sound.</p>
               <p>At the noyse whereof, the two Knightes spurred their coursers and made their incounter so strong and with
<pb facs="tcp:1507:91"/>
such great furie that the proude Pagan was cast to the grounde and so departed the listes with greate disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Straight way entered the braue King of <hi>Silicia,</hi> who was armed in a glistering corslet of very fine stéele, and was mounted vpon a mighty and rich courser, &amp; brought in his company, two hundred knightes, all apparelled with rich cloth of gold, hauing euery one a seueral instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of musicke in their hands, sounding thereon most heauenly melody.</p>
               <p>And after the <hi>Silician</hi> king had made his accustomed compasse and courtesie in that place, hee locked downe his heuor and put himselfe in readinesse to iust.</p>
               <p>So when the signe was giuen by the chiefe harrolde at armes, they spurred their horses and made their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters so valiant, that at the first race they made their launces shiuer in the aire and the pieces thereof to scatter abroade, like aspen leaues in a whirlewinde.</p>
               <p>At the second course the young Prince of Fesse was caried ouer his horse buttockea, and the saddle with him betwixt his legs, which was a great griefe vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and all the company that did see him, for that he was wel beloued of them al, and held for a knight of great estimation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Silician</hi> king grewe proude at the Prince of Fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ouerthrow, and was so incouraged and so furious that in a small time he l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ft not a knight remaining on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe in their saddles that durste attempt to iust with him, but euerie one of what Countrey and Nation soere auoyded the attempt: so that there was no question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong eyther Nobles or the multitude but that vnto hym the vndoubted honour of the victory in triumph would bée attributed.</p>
               <p>And being in this arrogant pride, hee heard a great noise in the maner of a tumult drawing néere, which was the occasion that he stoode still, and to expect some
<pb facs="tcp:1507:92"/>
strange accident, and looking about what it should bee, he beheld Saint <hi>George</hi> entering the listes, who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his rich and strong armour, all of purple, full of golden starres, and before him roade the champions of France, Italy, Spaine and Scotland, al on stately cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, bearing in their handes foure silken streamers of fou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e seuerall colours.</p>
               <p>And the champion of Wales followed him carrying his shield whereon was portraied a golden Lyon in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble field, and the champion of Ireland likewise carried his speare being of knotty ash strongly bound about with plates of steele, all which shewed the highnesse of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in that so many braue Knightes attended vppon him.</p>
               <p>So when Saint <hi>George</hi> had passed by the royall seate whereon the Emperour sate, inuested in whose company was many knights of great authority, he rode along by the other side, whereas <hi>Alcida</hi> the Emperours faire Daughter sate amongst many gallant Ladies and faire damsels richly apparelled with vestures of gold, to whom he valed his bonnet shewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the courtesie of a knight and so passed by <hi>Alcida,</hi> at the fight of this noble champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not refraine her selfe, but that with a high and bold voice she said vnto the Emperour.</p>
               <p>Most mighty Emperour and my royall father (saide she) this is the Knight in whose power and strength, all christendome doth put their fortunes, and this is he whom the whole world admires for chiualrie.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>George</hi> although, he heard very well what the louely Princesse had said, passed on, and dissembled as though he had heard nothing, and so when he came before the face of his curious aduersary, hee tooke his shield and his speare and prepared himseife in readinesse to iust, and so being both prouided, the trumpets beganne to sounde, whereat with great fury, these two warlike knights met togither, and neither of them missed their blowes at their
<pb facs="tcp:1507:92"/>
encounter: but yet by reason that Saint <hi>George</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to extoll his fame, and to make his name resounde thorough the worlde, hee stroke the giant such a mighty blowe vpon his brest, that he presently ouerthrewe him to the ground, and so with great state and maiesty he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed along without any shew of disdaine, whereat the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gaue a great shoute that it resounded like an eccho in the ayre: and in this maner said.</p>
               <p>The great and mighty boaster is ouerthrown, and his furious strength hath little auailed him. After this many Princesse proued their aduentures against this English champion, and euery knight that were of any estimation iusted with him.</p>
               <p>But with great ease he ouercame them al in lesse then the space of two houres: so at such time as bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> began to make an end of his long iourney, and the day to draw to an ende, there appeared to enter into the listes the braue and mighty giant, being brother to the <hi>Scilici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> king with a mighty great speare in his hande, whose glimmering point of steele glistered through al the court, he brought with him but onely one squire, attired in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer male bringing in his hand another launce.</p>
               <p>So this furious giant without any care of curtesie due vnto the Emperour or any of his knights there present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the place, the which being done, the squire that brought his other speare, went vnto the English champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and saide. Sir Knight (quoth he) yonder braue and valiant giant, my Lord and Maister doth send vnto thée this warlike speare, and therewithall he willeth thée to defend thy self to the vttermost of thy power &amp; strength, for he hath vowed before sun set, to be either Lord of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes or a vassell to thy prowesse and likewise saith that he doth not only defie thée in the turniment, but also chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge thée to mortall battaile.</p>
               <p>This brauing message caused Saint <hi>George</hi> to smile, and bre <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In saying. these words he tooke the speare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the squire, and deliu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>red him his gauntlet from his hand to carry to his master, and so put himselfe to the standing, awaigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the encounter.</p>
               <p>At that time he was very nie the place where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour sate, who heard the answere which the English knight made vnto the squire, and was much displeased that the giant in such sort should defie S. <hi>George</hi> without any occasion.</p>
               <p>But it was no time as then to speake but to kéepe s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to pray vnto his Gods to take away his great pride and arrogancie.</p>
               <p>All this time the two warriours (mounted vpon their stéedes) tarried the signe to bee made by the trumpets, which being giuen, they set forward their coursers, with their speares in their restes, with so great fury and desire the one to vnhorse the other, that they both fayled in their encounter.</p>
               <p>The giant who was very strong and proude, when he sawe that he had missed his intent, he returned against Saint <hi>George,</hi> carrying his speare vppon his shoulder, and comming nie vnto him, vpon a sodaine before he could cleare hims<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:93"/>But when he sawe the great villany that the giant v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against him, his anger increased very much and so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his speare in the same sort, he went towards the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and saide.</p>
               <p>Thou furious and proude beast, thou scorne of nature and enemy of true knighthood, thinkest thou for to entrap me trecherously, and to gore me at vnawar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s like to a sauage boare: Now as I am a christian knight, if my knotty speare haue good successe I will reuenge me of thy cruelty.</p>
               <p>And in saying this, hee stroke him so furiously on the brest, that his speare passed through the giants body, and appeared foorth at his backe, whereby hee fell presently downe dead to the ground, and yéelded his life to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the fatall sisters.</p>
               <p>All that were present were very much amazed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and wondred greatly at the strength and force of saint <hi>George,</hi> accompting him the fortunatest knight that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wéelded launce, and the very patterne of true nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

               <p>So the Emperour descended from his imperial throne into the tilting place, with all his knightes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at armes, for to receaue the noble champion of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and desired him that he would go with them into his pallace, there to receaue al honors due vnto a knight of such desart: to the which he could not make any denial, but most vnwillingly consented, after this the Emperors daughter (in company of many courtly virgins) likewise descended their places, wher <hi>Alcida</hi> bestowed vpon saint <hi>George</hi> hir gloue, the which he wore for her fauour many a day after in his burgonet.</p>

the displeasure of the Emperour his Father: for he being the Sonne of so mightie a Potentate, and she the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so meane a Gentleman, was thought to be a match vnfit and disagréeable to the lawes of the Countrey: and therefore they could not be suffered to manifest their loues as they would, but were constrained by stealth to enioye each others most beloued and heartely desired compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>So vpon a time these two Louers concluded to méete together in a vally betwixt two hills, in distance from the Emperours Court some thrée miles, wheras they might in s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this manner entred she the Ualley, at such time as the Sunne began to appeare out of his golden Horizon, &amp; to shewe himselfe vppon the face of the Earth, glistering with his bright beames vppon the siluer floating Riuers.

               <p>So sitting downe vpon a gréene banke vnder the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a myrtle trée, she pulled a golden cawle from her head, wherein her haire was wrapped, letting it fall and

dispearse it selfe all abroad her backe, and taking out from her christalline breast an yuorie comb, she began to kemb her haire, her hands and fingers séeming to be of white a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lablaster, her face staining the beautie of roses and lyllies mixed together, and the rest of her bodie comparable to <hi>Hyrens,</hi> vpon whose loue and beautie <hi>Mahomet</hi> did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doate.</p>
               <p>But now marke (gentle Reader) how frowning For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune crossed her desiros, and changed her wished ioyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnexpected sorrowes. For as she sate in this deuine and angelicall likenes, there fortuned to come wandring by an inhumane tyrant, surnamed the Knight with 2. heads, who was a rauisher of virgins, an oppressor of infants, &amp; an vtter enemie to vertuous Ladies, and strange trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Knights.</p>
               <p>This tyrant was bodied like vnto a man, but couered all ouer with lockes of haire. Hee had two heads, two mouthes, and foure eyes, but all as red as blood. Which deformed creature presently ranne vnto the Uirgin, and caught her vp vnder his arme, and carried her away ouer the mountains into another Countrey, where hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to torment her, as you shall heare more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>No sooner found he the scarffe, but he was oppressed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly with sorrow, fearing <hi>Dulcippa</hi> was murthered by some inhumane meanes, and had left her scarffe as a token that she infringed not her promise, but perfourmed ii to the losse of her owne life.

               <p>In this resolution returned he home to the Emperour his Fathers pallace, dissembling his gréefe in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that none did suspect his discontented sorowes, nor the strange accident that vnto beauteous <hi>Dulcippa</hi> had happened.</p>
               <p>So vpon a day as he was imagining with himselfe, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the small comfort that he tooke in the Court, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the want of her presence whom so much hee desired, he determined in great secret as soone as it was possible to depart the Court.</p>
               <p>This determination he straight wayes put in practise, and tooke out of the Emperours Armourie verie secretly an excéeding good corslet, the which was all russet, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameled with blacke, and embrothered round about with a gilded edge verie curiously and artificially grauen and curued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:97"/>Also he tooke a shéelde of the same making, sauing that it was not grauen as the armour was, and commaunded a young Gentleman, that was Sonne vnto an ancient Knight of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of a good disposition and hardy that he should kéepe them safely, and gaue him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of his determined pretence.</p>
               <p>Although it did gréeue this young man verie much, yet for all that séeing the great fréendship which hee vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, in vttring his secret vnto him before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without replying to the contrarie, hee verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently tooke the armour, and hidde it, till hee founde a conuenient time to put it into a Shippe verie secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>So likewise he put into the same Ship two of the best horses which the Emperour had, and foorthwith he gaue the Prince vnderstanding, that all thinges were then in a readines, and in good order. <hi>Pollimus</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which when it was come he made himselfe readie with his apparell, and when all the people of the Court were at their rest, and in their deade sleepes, hee alone with his page, who was named <hi>Mercurio,</hi> departed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and went to the Sea side.

               <p>And being therein for that the winde was verie faire, he commaunded to waigh their Anckers and to hoyse vp Sailes, and to commit themselues to the mercy of the waters: as he commaunded all was done, and so in short time, they founde themselues ingulfed in the mayne Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, far from the sight of any land.</p>
               <p>But when the Emperour his Father vnderstood of his secret departure, the lamentation which hee made

was verie much: and he commaunded his knights to goe vnto the sea side, to know if there were anie ship that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted that night. And when it was told them that there was a B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot héere declare the great griefe and sorrowe which the Emperour felt in his wofull heart for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Sonne, which a long time he alwayes suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and feared.</p>
               <p>But when the departure of <hi>Pollemus</hi> was bruted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all sports and feasts ceased, and all the vassalls of the Country were ouercome with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall sorrow.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Pollemus</hi> sayled through the déepe seas thrée dayes and thrée nightes with a verie fayre and prosperous fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde.</p>
               <p>The fourth day in the euening, beeing calme, and no Winde at all, the Marriners went to take their restes, some on the poope, and some in the foreship, for to ease their wearied bodies:</p>
               <p>The prince (who sate vpon the poope of the ship) ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his page for his Lute, the which straight way was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him: and when he had it in his hands, he playde and sung so swéetely, that it séemed to be a most heauenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie, and being in this swéete musicke, he heard a verye lamentable crye, as it were of a Woman: and leauing his delicate musicke hee gaue a listening and attentiue eare to hearken, what this sorrowfull creature sayd, and by reason of the stilnes of the night, he might easely heare the voyce vtter these words.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then he heard another voyce which séemed to answere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now I haue thee in my power, there is no humane creature of power able enough to deliuer or redeeme thee from the tormentes, that (in my determination) I haue purposed thou shalt indure.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pollemus</hi> could heare no more, by reason that the Bark wherein they were passed by so swiftly: but hee supposed that it was his Ladies voyce which he heard, and that she was carried by force away.

               <p>Beeing in this cogitation, hee retourned to hys page which was asléepe, and strake him with his foote, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked him, saying: What didst not thou heare the great lamentation which my Ladie <hi>Dulcippa</hi> made (as to mee it séemed) beeing in a small Barke that is passed by, and gone forwards along the seas.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:99"/>to whome the Prince called againe, saying: arise I say, bring foorth mine armour, call vp the Marriners that they may launch their boate into the Sea, for by the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent <hi>Iupiter</hi> I sweare that I will not b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the meane time the Marriners had launched their bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te into the Sea, wherein he leaped with a hastie fury, and caried with him his page, and foure of the Marriners for to towe the Barke, and he commaunded them to take their way towards the other companie that passed by them.</p>
               <p>So they labored all the night till such time as bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his glistering beames gaue vnto them such light that they might discouer and see the other Barke, although somewhat a farre off.</p>
               <p>So laboured they in great courage, till two partes of the day was spent, at which time they sawe come after them a Gallie which was gouerned with eyght oares vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a side, and it made so great way, that with a trice they were with them, and hee saw that there were in her thrée Knightes in bright armour, to whome <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> called with a loude voyce saying. Moste curteous Knightes I request you to take me into your Gallie, that being in her I may the better accomplishe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
               <p>The Knightes of the Gallie passed by the Prince without making returne of any aunsweare, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewed that they made but little accompt of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:99"/>These thrée knightes were the sonnes of the English champion which departed from their father in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny towards Babylon, to set the King againe in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>But now to follow our history, the Prince of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople séeing the little account they made of him, with the great anger and fury that he receaued, he tooke an ore in one hand, and an other in the other hand, and with such strength he stroke the water, that he made the slothfull barke to flie, and laboured so much with his oares, that with a trice they were equall with the gally.</p>
               <p>So leauing the oares with a light leape he put himselfe in the gally with his helme on, and his shield at his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and being within he said.</p>
               <p>Now shall you doe that by force, which before I vsing great courtesie you would not yéeld vnto.</p>
               <p>This being said, one of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> sonnes tooke the incounter in hand, thinking it a blemish to the honor of knighthoode by multitudes to assaile him, so the two braue knightes without any aduantage the one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made their encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters so valiantly that it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all the beholders.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Constantinople stroake the Englishe Knight such a furious blow that he made him to decline his head to his brest, and forced him to recoile backwards two or three steppes, but he came quickly againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and returned him so mighty a blow vpon his helme, that he made all his teeth to chatter in his head, which was pittifull to sée.</p>
               <p>Then beganne betwixt them a merueilous and well foughten battle that al that beheld them greatly admired: with great pollicy and strength, they indured the bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all that day, and when they saw the darke and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous night came vpon them, they did procure with more courage and strength for to finish their battle.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Constantinople, puffing and blowing
<pb facs="tcp:1507:100"/>
like a bell lifting vp his sword with both his handes and discharged it so strongly vpon his enemy that perforce hée made him to fall to the ground and therewithal offered to pull his helmet from his head.</p>
               <p>But when the English Knight sawe himselfe in that sort, he threwe his shielde from him, and very strongly caught the other about the necke and held him fast, so that betwixt them beganne a mighty and terrible wrestling tumbling and wallowing vp and downe the gally brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their plankes and oares that it was straunge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde.</p>
               <p>At this time the night began to be very darke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they called for lightes, which presently were brought them by the Marriners, in the meane time these knights did somewhat breath themselues, although it was not much.</p>
               <p>So when the Lightes were brought, they returned to their late contention with new force and strength.</p>
               <p>O heauens said <hi>Pollimus,</hi> I cannot beléeue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary but that this is <hi>Mars</hi> the God of war that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in battle with me, and for the great enuy he beares against me, he goeth about to dishonour me.</p>
               <p>And with these wordes they thickned their blows with great desperatenesse.</p>
               <p>And althogh this last assault continued more then two houres, yet neither of them did faint, but at the last they both together lift vp their swoordes, and charged them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the one vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others helm with so great strength that both of them fell downe vppon the hatches without any remembrance.</p>
               <p>The rest that did looke vpon them, did beléeue verily that they were both dead, by reason of the aboundance of bloud which came foorth at their visors, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was perceaued that there was some hope of life in them.</p>
               <p>Then presently there was an agréement made betwixt
<pb facs="tcp:1507:100"/>
the Knightes of the gally and the Marriners of the barke that they should conioyne together and to trauell whither fortune would conduct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this order as you haue heard carried they these two Knightes without any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>But when the Prince of <hi>Constantinople</hi> came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with a loude voice he said, Oh God is it possible to be true that I am ouercome in this first encounter &amp; assault of my knighthood.</p>
               <p>Here I curse the day of my creation and the houre when first I merited the name of a knight, henceforth Ile bury all my honours with disgrace, and spend the remnant of my life in base cowardice, and in speaking these wordes he cast his eie aside and beheld the English knight as one newly risen from a trance, who likewise breathed foorth these discontented spéeces. Oh vnhappy son of S. <hi>George,</hi> thou coward and of little valour, I know not howe thou canst name thy selfe to be the son of the mightiest Knight in the world, for that thou hast lost thy honour in this last assault.</p>
               <p>This being said, the two weary knights concluded a peace betwixt them, and reuealed each to the other their names and liuing and wherefore they aduentured to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the which when it was known they sailed forwards that way whereas the dolorous woman went, so in this sort they trauelled all the rest of the night that remained, till such time as the day began to be cleare, and straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they descried land, to which place with great hast they rowed.</p>
               <p>And comming a land they found no vsed way, but one narrow path, the which they kept, wherein they had not traueiled long when that they met with a poore simple countrey man, with a great hatchet in his hand, and he was going for to cut some firewood from high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty trées, of whom they demaunded what countrey and land it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:101"/>This countrey (said hee) is called Armenia, but yet most curteous Knightes you must pardon me, for that I doe request you to returne againe, and procéede no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you doe estéeme of your liues, for in going this way there is nothing to be had but death.</p>
               <p>For that the Lord of this countrey is a furious monster called the two headed Knight, and he is so furious in his tyranny, that neuer any stranger as yet could escape out of his hand aliue.</p>
               <p>And for proofe of his cruelty no longer then yesterday he brought hither a Lady prisoner, who at her first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on shoare all to be whipt and beat her in such sorte that it would make the tyrannous tyrant to relent and pitty her distresses, swearing that eueryday he would so torment her, till such time as her life and body did make their seperation.</p>

                  <hi>Pollimus</hi> the Prince of Constantinople was very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to the olde mans words, thinking the Lady to be his <hi>Dulcippa</hi> after whom he so long traueiled: the griefe he receaued at this report stroke such a terrour to his hart that he fell into a sound, and was not able to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But Saint <hi>Georges</hi> sonnes who knew him to bee a Knight of much vallour incouraged him, and protested by the honour of their Knighthoodes neuer to forsake his company, till they saw his Lady deliuered from her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and he safely conducted home into his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>So traueiling with this resolution the night came on, and it was so darke, that they were constrained to séeke some place to take their restes, and laying themselues downe vnder a broad branched tree of Oake, they passed the night pondering in their mindes a thousand imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>So when the morning was come and that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of heauen began to glister with his beames vpon
<pb facs="tcp:1507:101"/>
the mountaine toppes, these martiall Knightes were not slothful, but rose vppe and followed their iourneies.</p>
               <p>After this they had not traueiled scarce halfe a mile, when that they hearde a pittifull lamentation of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who by reason of her lowde shrikes her voice was very hoarse, so they staid to heare from whence that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable noise should come.</p>
               <p>And presently a farre off, they behelde a high piller of stone, out of the which there came foorth a spoute of faire and cleare water, and thereat was bounde a woman all naked, her backe fastned to the piller, her armes backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward imbracing it, with her armes fast bounde behinde her.</p>
               <p>Her skinne was so fare and white, that if it had not béene, that they heard her lamentation, they would haue iudged her to haue béene an image made artificially of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lablaster ioyned vnto the piller.</p>
               <p>These warlike Knights laced on their helmets, and came vnto the place where she was, but when the prince of Constantinople saw her, he presenly knewe her to be his Lady and louely mistresse.</p>
               <p>For by reason of the coldnesse of the darke night, and with her great lamentation and weepings, she was so ful of sorrow and affliction, that she could scarce speake.</p>
               <p>Likewise the Princes hart so yerned at the sight of his vnhappy Lady, that almost he could not looke vppon her for wéeping.</p>
               <p>But yet at last with a sorrowfull sigh he said, Oh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell hands is it possible that there should remaine in you so much mischiefe, that whereas there is such great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fairenes, you should vse such basenes and villany? she doth more deserue to be loued and serued, than to bee in this sort so euill intreated.</p>
               <p>This wofull Prince with much sorrow did behold her white skin and backe all to be spotted with her red bloud, and taking a cloake from one of the marriners, he threwe
<pb facs="tcp:1507:102"/>
it vppon her and couered her body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tooke her in his armes, whilest the other knights vnlosed her.</p>
               <p>This vnhappy Lady neuer felt nor knew what was done vnto her, till such time as shee was vnbound from those bands and in the armes of her louer.</p>
               <p>Then giuing a terrible sigh she thought that shee had béene in the armes of the monstrous two headed knight s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying, Oh <hi>Pollimus</hi> thou true betrothed husband where art thou now that thou comst not to succour me? and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ceased her spéeches.</p>
               <p>This Prince hearing these words would haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, but he was disturbed by hearing of a great noise of a horse, which s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emed to be in the woods amongest the trées.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Knights intending to sée what it should be left the Lady lying vpon the gréene grasse in the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Prince <hi>Pollimus</hi> and the Marriners, and so saint <hi>Georges</hi> sonnes went towards the place, whereas they heard that rushing noise, and as they vigelently lookt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, they beheld the two headed monster mounted vpon a mighty and great palfrey, who returned to sée if the Lady were aliue for to torment her anew.</p>
               <p>But when he came to the piller and saw not the Lady, with an ireful looke he cast his eies, looking about him on euery side, and at last he saw the three knights, comming towards him with a reasonable and quiet pace, and howe the Lady was vntied from the piller wher he left her and in the armes of another Knight making her sorrowfull complaint.</p>
               <p>The two headed knight séeing them in this order, with great fury vpon his mighty horse he came towards them, and when he was neare them, he staid, and did behold the princely proportions, and gentle dispositions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that without my leaue hath aduentured to vntie the Lady from the piller where I left her, or come you to offer vppe your blouds in sacrifice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my fauchion, to whom one of
<pb facs="tcp:1507:102"/>
the thrée valiant brothers answered &amp; said, we be knights of a strange countrey, that at the sorrowfull complant of this Lady arriued in this place, and séeing her to be a faire and beautifull woman, and without any desert to be thus so euill intreated, it moueth vs to put our persons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture against them that will séeme farther to misuse her.</p>
               <p>In the meane time that the knight was speaking these wordes, the deformed monster was beholding him very presizely, knitting his browes with the great anger hee receaued in hearing his spéeches, and with great fury he spurred his monstrous beast, that he made him to giue so mighty a leape that he had almost fallen vppon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish knight: who with great lightnes did deliuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so drawing foorth his sword he would haue stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, but the beast passed by with so great fury that he could not reach him.</p>
               <p>Here began as terrible a battaile betwixt the two hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded knight and saint <hi>Georges</hi> sonnes, as euer was fought by any knights, their mighty blowes séemed to rattle in the elements like to a terrible thunder, and their swords to strike sparkling fier, in such abundance as though it had béene from a smithes anuile.</p>
               <p>During this conflict the English Knights were so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously wounded, that all their bright armours were stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a bloudy gore and their helmets brused with the terrible stroakes of the monsters fauchion, whereat they grew more inraged, and their strengthes beganne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in such sort that one of them stroake an ouerthwart blow with his trusty sword vpon his knée, and by reason that his armour was not very good he cut it cleane a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so that legge and all fell to the ground, and the two headed knight fell on the other side to the earth, and with great roring he began to stampe and stare like a beast, and to blaspheme against the heauens for this his sodaine mishap.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1507:103"/>The other two brothers seeing this, presently cut off his two heads, whereby he was forced to yéeld to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of imperious death.</p>
               <p>There was another knight that came with the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who when he sawe all that had passed, with great feare returned the way from whence he came.</p>
               <p>These victorious conquerours, when they sawe that with so great ease they were deliuered from the tyrantes cruelty, with lowde voices they saide, oh thou God whom we christians still doe worship, we doe giue thée humble thankes, and doe acknowledge this our good successe and victory both procéede from thée.</p>
               <p>Therefore we doe promise and vow before thy celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Maiesty, that once comming to our father and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian champions, generally to erect a shrine, and consecrate it to thy blessed sonne, vnder whose banner we euermore doe fight.</p>
               <p>This being said, they departed with conquest to the Prince of Constantinople, where they left him comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his distressed Lady.</p>
               <p>So when they were altogether, they commanded the marriners to prouide them somwhat to eate, for that they had great néede thereof, who presently prepared it, for that continuall they bore their prouision about them: of this banquet the Knights were very glad, and reioyced much at that which they had atchieued and commanded that the Lady should be very well looked vnto and healed of her harme receaued.</p>
               <p>So at the end of thrée daies when the Princesse Lady had recouered her health, they left the countrey of Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and departed backe to the sea whereas they had lefte their ships lying at roade, and there tarried vntill their comming.</p>
               <p>Wherein they were no sooner entered, but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners hoysed saile, and tooke their way toward Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople as the Knights commanded. The windes serued
<pb facs="tcp:1507:103"/>
them so prosperously, that within a small time they arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Greece,</hi> and landed within two dayes iourney of the Courte: which laye then at <hi>Peru,</hi> a myle from <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being aland, the Prince <hi>Pollemus</hi> consulted with S. <hi>Georges</hi> thrée Sonnes, what course were best to be taken for their procéeding to the Court. For saith he, vnlesse I may with the Emperour my Fathers consent enioye my déerest <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> I wyll liue vnknowen in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, rather than delight in the heritage of ten such Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyres.</p>
               <p>At last they concluded, that the Ladie should bee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a blacke veyle for being knowen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Pollemus</hi> in black armes, and the other Knights all sutable shuld ride together: which accordingly they did, and about tenne in the morning entred the Pallace: where they found the Emperour, the seuen Champions with manie other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the great hall: to whom one of Sa. <hi>Georges</hi> Sons thus spake.</p>

                  </gap>red manie hazards. His comming thus to your Court is to this end, to approoue her the onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertfull Ladie in the world, himselfe the faithfulst Knight against all Knights whatsoeuer: which with your Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall leaue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my selfe and these two my associates will maintaine: desiring your Maiestie to giue iudgement as we shall deserue.</p>
               <p>The Emperour condescended, and on the gréene before the Pallace, those foure ouerthrew more than foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Knights: so that Sa. <hi>George</hi> and thr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

of the Champions. Which the Emperour percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, gessed them to be of acquaintaunce: wherefore gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iudgement that the Knight should possesse his Lady, at his request they all discouered themselues.</p>
               <p>To describe the delightfull comfort that the English Champion tooke in the presence of his Children, and the ioy that the Emperour receiued at the returne of hys lost Sonne, requires more arte and eloquence, than my tyred senses can affoord. I am therefore here forced to conclude this Part, leauing the Flowers of Chiualrie in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Of whose following Aduentures I wil at large discourse hereafter: so that the gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (with a kinde looke and a smiling countenance) wyll curteously accept of this which is alreadie finished.</p>
