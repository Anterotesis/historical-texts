            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In moyst considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherof as also in zealous regard of that <hi>high</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance you shew vnto Schollers, I am bolde in steade of new Wine, to carowse to you a cuppe of newes: which if your worship (according to your wonted <hi>Chaucerisme</hi>) shall accept in good part, Ile be your daily Orator to pray that, that pure sanguine complexion of yours may neuer be famisht with potte-lucke, that you may tast till your last gaspe, and liue to see the confusion of both your speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies, Small Beere and Grammer rules.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowne to report, what a famous potle-pot Patron you haue beene to olde Poets in your daies, &amp; how many pounds you haue spent (and as it were throwne into the fire) vpon <hi>the durt of wisedome, called Alcumie:</hi>

            <p>Shall I presume to dilate of the grauitie of your round cap and your dudgion dagger? It is thught they wil make you be cald vpon shortly to be Alderman of the Stilliard. And thats well remembred, I heard saie when this last Terme was remooued to <hi>Hartford,</hi> you fell into a greate studie and care by your selfe, to what place the Stilliard should be remooued: I promise you truelie it was a deepe meditation, &amp; such as might well haue beseemed <hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> parliament of noses to haue sit vpon.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That booke was a learned booke, a labourd booke; for three yere before he put it in print, he had preacht it all without booke.</p>
               <p>I my selfe haue some of it in a booke of Setmons that my Tutor at Cambridge made mee gather euery Sunday. Then being very yoong, I counted it the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectest and frothiest forme of Diuinitie that came in that place. Now more confirmed in age and Art, I confirme my ill opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Neither do I vrge this as if it were a hainous thing for a man to put sermons in print after hee preacht them, but obserue the proud humor of the pert Didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, that thinks nothing hee speakes but deserues to be put in print, and speakes not that sentence in the Pulpit, which before he rough hewes not ouer with his penne.

               <p>These and a thousand more imperfections might haue beene buried with his bookes in the bottome of a drie-fatte, and there slept quietly amongst the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of the Presse, if in his Epistle he had not beene so arrogantly censoriall.</p>

               <p>Come thy waies downe from thy Doctourship said I? <hi>Erraui demens</hi> thou neuer wentst vp to it yet.</p>
               <p>Fie on hypocrisie and Dissimulation, that men should make themselues better than they are.</p>
               <p>Alas a Gods will thou art but a plaine moth eaten Maister of Art, and neuer pollutedst thy selfe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plaister of Doctourship.</p>
               <p>List Pauls Churchyard (the peruser of euerie mans works &amp; Exchange of all Authors) you are a many of you honest fellows, and fauour men of wit.</p>
               <p>So it is that a good Gowne and a well pruned paire of moustachios, hauing studied sixteene yeare to make thirteene ill english Hexameters, came to the Vniuersity Court <hi>regentium &amp; non</hi> to sue for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to carry two faces in a hoode, they not vsing to deny honour to any man that deserued it, bad him performe all the Schollerlike ceremonies and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue right appertaining thereto, and he should bee installed.</p>

               <p>A stripling that hath an indifferent prety stocke, of reputation abroade in the worlde already, and some credit amongst his neighbours as he thinketh, would

               <p>
                  <hi>Pumps and Pantofles</hi> because they were well blackt and glistered iolly freshly on it, being rubd ouer with inke, had their grace at length to be Doctour <hi>Ea lege,</hi> that they should do their acts (that is, performe more than they were able)</p>
               <p>Curst be the time that euer there were any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made with conditions, <hi>Vnde habeas quaerit nemo sed oportet habere,</hi> Howe Dorbell comes to bee Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour none asks, but Doctour hee must bee to make him right worshipfull.</p>
               <p>Acts are but idle wordes, and the Scripture saith, wee must giue account for euery idle word.</p>
               <p>Pumps and Pantofles sweare they will iet away with a cleare conscience at the daie of iudgement, and therfore do no Acts, giue no offence with idle words, onelie like a Hauke let flie at a Partridge, that turnes the taile and betakes her to a walnut-tree, so to Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford they trudge hauing their grace <hi>ad disputandum,</hi> and there are confirmed in the same degree they took at Cambridge: which is as if a Prentise heere in London, as soone as hee is enrould, should runne to some such Towne as Ipswich, and there craue to haue his Freedome confirmd as of London, which in truth
<pb facs="tcp:10607:16"/>
is no Freedome because hee hath not seru'd out his prentiship.</p>
               <p>Trust mee not for a dodkin, if there bee not all the Doctourship hee hath, yet will the insolent inke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne worme write himselfe Right worshipfull of the Lawes, and personate this man and that man, calling him <hi>my good friend Maister Doctour</hi> at euery word.</p>

                  <hi>Haud facile credo,</hi> I am sure the Printer beeing of that honestie that I take him for, will not affirme it.</p>
               <p>Marry this I must say, there was a learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of Phisicke (to whom Greene in his sickenesse sent for counsaile) that hauing read ouer the booke of Veluet breeches and Clothbreeches, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merrilie at the three brothers legend, wild Green in any case either to mittigate it or leaue it out: Not for any extraordinarie account hee made of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie of fooles, but for one of them was procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the same facultie of Phisicke hee profest, and willinglie hee would haue none of that excellent cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ill spoken off.</p>
               <p>This was the cause of the altring of it, the feare of his Phisitions displeasure, not any feare else.</p>
