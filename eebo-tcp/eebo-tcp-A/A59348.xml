            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEll, Lord have mercy upon us! What a crying Sin is turning <hi>Honeſt,</hi> and telling <hi>Truth,</hi> to thoſe <hi>Red-letter'd</hi> Saints the <hi>Whiggs?</hi> How many Rogues, Dogs, Raſcals and Villains, has poor <hi>Elkanah</hi> been call'd by them (for they <hi>raile</hi> as <hi>loud</hi> as they <hi>pray)</hi> and all alas, not for <hi>Libelling</hi> the Brother of a King, (for that was his Virtue) but for doing <hi>ill</hi> and being <hi>ſorry</hi> for it. How many Reprobates, Monſters, and what not, has his Apoſtacy from that Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Whig-gift of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> transform'd him to: Whilſt he raked up <hi>Dirt,</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> to throw in the Face of Princes, tho ſtoln from that ſink of <hi>Forgery</hi> the HISTORY OF THE BLACK BOX, what <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> hung upon his Lips; and what an Angel of Light was ſuch a Proteſtant Champion! But from that minute, that accurſed minute, that he ſpeaks Truth, and owns and repents of that <hi>Malice</hi> that animated him, tho into the very <hi>Unchriſtianity</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> what a falling <hi>Lucifer</hi> have they made him?</p>
            <p>Beſides, this is but the Crime of his <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Poſt-ſcript;</hi> but oh for his <hi>Narrative!</hi> his lewd, his filthy, his abominable Narrative. Reprobate of Reprobates, and Monſter of Monſters, having no fear of God before his Eyes, but led by the Inſtigation of the Devil, he has daſht their dear, their darling, their adored <hi>Dagon</hi> to pieces; and the diſconſolate Saints want Power to joyn the poor <hi>ſtumps</hi> of it together again.</p>
            <p>But alas! where <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot help them, <hi>Railing</hi> and <hi>Lying</hi> ſhall. And for an Eſſay of that Nature, we meet a harmleſs ſucking Devil of theirs coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, call'd REMARKS UPON <hi>E. SETTLES</hi> NARRATIVE, an Extraordinary piece for their <hi>Dagons</hi> Juſtification, being all <hi>Billings-gate</hi> and no <hi>Argument</hi> from the beginning to the end. That ſcurrilous ſenſleſs ſcribble that I ſhould have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd with Silence and Diſdain, had not the Barbarous Impudence of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended perſonal Reflections in it, a Maſs of as Brazen-faced Romance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, as ever Ink and Letters brought forth, extorted this Vindication from the Rancour of <hi>Abuſe</hi> and <hi>Villany.</hi> But truly there's a great deal of Cauſe for it. For where any thing comes in Print a little too <hi>unanſwerable</hi> for them, and they cannot make their Attempt that way, the Authors <hi>Perſon</hi> muſt be attacqued, and an Aſſault made upon his <hi>Reputation</hi> is their old practiſed way, to baffle that <hi>Reaſon</hi> they cannot otherwiſe overthrow; whilſt they <hi>Write</hi> as they <hi>Preach</hi> only to <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> ſuch as can be caught by Empty <hi>Noiſe,</hi> and Charm'd by <hi>Sounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I convince the World, how Notorious a Lyer the <hi>Remarker</hi> is in thoſe Raſcally ſtories laid at poor <hi>Elkanahs</hi> Door. I ſhall endeavor to anſwer ſome few paſſages in his Book, which to the unwary at firſt ſight may look a little like ſenſe, tho God wot, but a little indeed: He puts the Narrative writer this Queſtion. p. 11</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether it were not more probable that the Papiſts a People of debaucht and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principles, that bear no Conſcience towards Hereticks, perſecuted by poenal Laws</hi> [not when the Plot was hatching ſure] <hi>ſhould be induced out o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their Hatred of the Proteſtant Religion, and for the Advancement of ther own, to remove the Obſtacles of their Freedom and Happineſs by the Deſtruction of a Heretick Prince; then that a few inconſiderable Perſons without any Support or Encouragement ſhould dare to create ſuch a Horrid and Bloody Plot of their own Heads, and then venture their Lives by daring to juſtifye it to the Face of King and Parliament.</hi> Now what a doubty Queſtion has this <hi>Remarker</hi> made; and what an <hi>OEdipus</hi> muſt he be that anſwers it?</p>
            <p>That the Papiſts are thoſe debaucht and Murderous Principled Men I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but that their Killing the King by thoſe <hi>open day-light</hi> Aſſaſſinations ſworn in the Plot, could have been an Advancement of their Religion, and a removing the Obſtacles to their Freedom and Happineſs I utterly deny. For the bare-faced ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King by <hi>Pickerings</hi> Gun, by ſuch a hand, at ſuch a place, and in ſuch a Manner, as atteſted by the <hi>Plot-ſwearers,</hi> had been ſo remote a way from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing either the <hi>Papiſts</hi> or their <hi>Religion,</hi> that on the contrary it had been the <hi>direct</hi> means to have drawn down that Vengeance upon their Heads, from the <hi>Hundred
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105379:3"/>
fold</hi> ſtronger Proteſtant hands in <hi>England,</hi> as might have almoſt <hi>blotted</hi> them from the Face of the Earth. And as the Narrative tells you, if that were the higheſt reach of an Intrigue of a Hundred Years hatching, much good may do them with their <hi>Politicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had the Diſcoverers no <hi>Support</hi> nor <hi>Encouragement</hi> from making their Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, when from <hi>Infamy Jails</hi> and <hi>Beggary</hi> they ſtept up to Ten Pounds a week maintenance, and the honor of <hi>Whitehall</hi> Lodgings, <hi>Whitehall</hi> Guards to attend them, with the Pomp of <hi>bended Knees</hi> and up <hi>lifted Eyes</hi> from the adoring Crowd, and the continued <hi>Hoſannas</hi> OF ALL HAYLE THE SAVIOURS OF THE NATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON. Was it no Encouragement for ſuch a poor <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> Bird as <hi>Bedlox,</hi> newly releaſt from feeding on the <hi>Basket,</hi> to leap at the Kings Proclamation of <hi>500l</hi> for the Diſcovery of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfreys</hi> Murder? And tho ſeveral unhappy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſeen diſcouragements have befaln them <hi>ſince;</hi> Yet, they are not ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately unfortunate yet, but they have ſome Friends left. The Reverend Dr. the deſpiſed at the Profane: <hi>Whitehall,</hi> is ſtill honored by the ſanctifyed <hi>Citty Brotherhood.</hi> A large Houſe well furniſht, with Servants, Attendants, and all good things at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and all to the <hi>Son of a Weaver</hi> with not one farthing worth of <hi>Patrimony</hi> or <hi>Preferment</hi> is a ſign that Providence has not <hi>quite</hi> forſaken him? 'Tis true his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened</hi> Plot has left him in a little <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> at preſent. Yet let me tell you ther's a ſort of <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey,</hi> your <hi>kind fat Amſterdam</hi> Buntings, that like <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, take care to keep him <hi>well fed</hi> ſtill. And the true blew Proteſtant Guinneys collected and raiſed for the late defeated <hi>City Feaſt,</hi> were yet very <hi>honorably</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and the rewarded Dr. had a round Lump of that <hi>corroborating</hi> Gold to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven his <hi>fainting</hi> Spirits, and ſtrengthen his <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> Zeal. For I aſſure you 'tis but <hi>neceſſary;</hi> for great and long Cauſes require often <hi>Feeing;</hi> the Clients muſt be <hi>Bountiful</hi> to keep the Advocates ſafely <hi>retain'd.</hi> And tho ſome People may lay Poverty to his charge: to confute that error, the Dr. I aſſure them, does not <hi>pinch</hi> himſelf into a <hi>Jump</hi> for want of Cloth enough to make it up into a <hi>Gown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides why muſt it follow (ſuppoſe the Plot a piece of <hi>Subornation)</hi> that thoſe inconſiderable Perſons ſhould create it of their <hi>Own</hi> heads. What if the Heads of ſome conſiderable TOWER Jail Birds ſhould joyn with the Inconſiderable <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalſea</hi> Jail-Birds for the production of it. 'Tis not the firſt time that Quality and Raſcality have <hi>club'd</hi> together, and like the ſpurious Off-ſpring of <hi>Nilus,</hi> there goes ſome <hi>Sun-beam</hi> not all <hi>mud</hi> to make up the <hi>Monſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh but the greateſt and moſt damnable Crime in the Narrative is, <hi>it has ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whole Popiſh Plot, and conſequently affronted the King Lords and Commons, that have ſo unanimouſly and ſo frequently aſserted their Belief of the Popiſh Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to clear this Imputation from the <hi>Narrative</hi> and the <hi>Author,</hi> he hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that no man in the World can pay a greater Reverence to the King, or his Parliaments then himſelf: But in the height of all that Veneration due to Heavns Vicegerent, both from a Subject and a Chriſtian, I muſt ſay that the King Lords and Commons together are but <hi>Men,</hi> and as ſuch not <hi>Infallible.</hi> And <hi>Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Surprize</hi> may ſometimes deceive both <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Potentates.</hi> The King and his Parliament have declared there was a Plot againſt the Kings Life; and yet they have decreed no penalty or puniſhment to him that ſays, that <hi>Pickering</hi> was one of the <hi>worſt Gunners</hi> in Chriſtendom, and <hi>St. James</hi>'s <hi>Park</hi> the <hi>worſt</hi> ſpot of <hi>Ground</hi> for ſuch an Aſſaſſination. The Plot Diſcoverers have been credited by the King and Parliament; and yet if any Man ſhall but <hi>ASSERT</hi> what the Diſcoverers <hi>SWEAR,</hi> as <hi>ſacred</hi> as their Teſtimony has been, the Law will lay him by the heels for it. For he that ſhall <hi>aver</hi> that <hi>Wakeman</hi> was engaged to Poyſon the King, or <hi>Kerney</hi> one of the four <hi>Ruffians</hi> was hired to ſtab him, is lyable to be <hi>puniſht</hi> for it; for they have ſtood Tryal, and been <hi>acquitted</hi> by LAW, and as ſuch they have their <hi>Action</hi> againſt him that aſperſes, and traduces the <hi>Innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, I neither <hi>do,</hi> nor <hi>dare</hi> ſay that poor <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> were <hi>Innocent:</hi> and why becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> has pronounced them <hi>Guilty.</hi> And yet I may ſafely ſay that had they had the good Fortune to have lived a Year and a half longer than they did, 'twas not <hi>impoſſible</hi> nor <hi>unlikely</hi> they might have dyed in their Beds, for all their <hi>Screwed Guns</hi> or <hi>Silver Bullets.</hi> Beſides without Derogation to Kings or

their great Councels, not only their Votes have been ſeveral times <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Fraile;</hi> but even their Deliberate <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> are not always <hi>Goſpel?</hi> For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and one of his Parliaments made an Act that <hi>illegitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> both <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughters; and decreed a puniſhment for any Man that ſhould but aſſert their Right to the Crown, or ſo much as <hi>call</hi> them Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate <hi>[28th</hi> of <hi>Hen. 8th.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame <hi>Henry</hi> and another of his Parliaments <hi>[35th</hi> of <hi>Hen. 8th.] Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi> them <hi>Both</hi> again, by Virtue of which Legitimation they both ſucceſſively wore the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And all this <hi>Legally</hi> done by the King and the great Councel of the Nation. And yet in the Caſe of Legitimacy which relates to their <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> either the <hi>pro</hi> or the <hi>con</hi> muſt be Erroneous. And what if in our caſe, in the ſame Nature, only <hi>vice versâ,</hi> the King Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 78 and 79, ſhould have declared the Popiſh Plot ſworn by <hi>Titus, Bedlows, Dugdale, France, Dangerfield, Duffy, Murfey, Macna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Zeale, Lewis</hi> &amp;c. was LEGITIMATE, and the King Lords and Commons in another Parliament in 83, (or when His Majeſty pleaſes) ſhould declare the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Plot to be ILLEGITIMATE, I know nothing to the contrary but it lyes in their Breaſts and pleaſures to do it.</p>
            <p>But however <hi>Elkanahs</hi> Narrative has ſcurrilouſly and baſely arraigned the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of the Nation:—And why ſo! Is there one paſſage through the whole Book that <hi>ſays</hi> or <hi>Hints</hi> that the Popiſh Conſpirators had not their <hi>Legal</hi> Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and tho amongſt ſo many <hi>Hundred</hi> Treaſonable <hi>Letters, Commiſſions</hi> and what not, againſt them, their Accuſers produced nothing but HEARTY SWEARING for their Conviction, yet do not the Lord <hi>Chief J.</hi> at <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Tryal ſay that <hi>'tis by the Oaths of two Witneſses that our Lives and Fortunes ſtand or fall.</hi> And does the Narrative <hi>ſay</hi> or <hi>inſinuate</hi> that they had not <hi>two</hi> or <hi>more</hi> Witneſſes whoſe Oaths condemn'd them; for which the Jury brought them in <hi>Guilty,</hi> and the Judges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Duties condemn'd them as ſuch; and how then is the Juſtice or Judges of the Nation Impeached, when on the contrary they were ſo far from dying <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> that they dyed even <hi>ſummo jure,</hi> by the higheſt Juſtice in the Kingdom. Beſides, ſuppoſe <hi>Pickering</hi> was never engaged to Piſtol the King, and has yet dyed for it: So I have heard of ſome People that have been hang'd in Chains for a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> when the ſuppoſed Murdered Perſon has ſome Years after been found <hi>alive,</hi> and all this while the <hi>Judge</hi> and the <hi>unfortunate Jury</hi> neither <hi>arraigned</hi> nor <hi>arraignable</hi> for their <hi>Sentence</hi> or <hi>Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who then has the Narrative wronged, the Kings <hi>Evidence?</hi> No. That's <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> for to tell <hi>truth</hi> can wrong no body: and the <hi>Narrative</hi> is ſo far from <hi>belying</hi> them, that it recites not one paſſage but is <hi>recorded</hi> from their own <hi>Oaths.</hi> And why a Recital of what is <hi>ſworn</hi> in the Plot ſhould be a <hi>Burleſquing</hi> of the Plot I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand.</p>
            <p>Oh but telling Truth, ſays the Proverb, may ſometimes do harm; and in this caſe the whole Book tho with never ſo much truth in it, tends to the <hi>leſſening</hi> the Diſcoverers Teſtimony and a <hi>Stifling</hi> the whole Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis true indeed, why ſhould <hi>Elkanah</hi> be ſuch a <hi>Cudden</hi> as to endeavor the <hi>Stifling</hi> of the Popiſh Plot, when it ſaves him the labor, and <hi>Stifles</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor</hi> wanted a <hi>Body</hi> to laſt, and ſo the ſhort liv'd <hi>Exhalation</hi> has <hi>ſpent</hi> it ſelf, and is <hi>expired.</hi> But for my part I pay ſuch a profound reſpect to the Plot, that I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that it may have that preheminence above all Plots whatſoever, as to be the ONLY more than <hi>Phoenix</hi> of the Kind, and be never <hi>equalled</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of the World; and that it may find its juſt Merit in deathleſs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> Ide have it annexed to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>AMBOYNA,</hi> and when the <hi>Turk</hi> comes farther into Chriſtendom, have it preſented him to bind up with the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I ſolemnly avow the Plot was a <hi>good</hi> Plot, eſpecially whilſt 'twas <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>freſh;</hi> and if it has been ſet by till 'tis <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>ſtinks,</hi> 'tis no fault of mine. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Ingredients</hi> of the Plot are <hi>Rarities</hi> in their kind; but if the Plotters and Diſcoverers between them, have unfortunately made a <hi>Hotch Potch</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Oleo,</hi> and put them ſo <hi>fulſomly</hi> together till they <hi>nauſeate,</hi> can I help it. If the Swearers have <hi>contradicted</hi> each others Teſtimony, and ſometimes their <hi>own,</hi> is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105379:4"/>
               <hi>Elkanah</hi> to anſwer for it. Beſides as the Diſcoverers have ſworn the Jeſuits to be the greateſt ROGUES in the World through the whole Popiſh Plot, ſo <hi>Elkanahs</hi> Narrative has proved them through the whole Plot to be the greateſt IDEOTS in the World. And pray what Indignity is it to the Honor of King Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or ſcandal to the Juſtice of the Nation to add <hi>one blot</hi> more to the Scutcheon of a Jeſuit, and from a pack of <hi>Knaves</hi> to make them a pack of <hi>Fools</hi> too. If this be a <hi>Crime,</hi> Heaven mend all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I but</hi> Elkanah <hi>is criticiſing upon Dr.</hi> Oats <hi>his Commiſſions, and the Innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Forreign Thouſands all ready for Landing, upon the Kings Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>However as Chimerical as Armyes of Pilgrims may appear, and the reſt of the Popiſh Battalias deſignd for the Proteſtant Deſtruction,</hi> the Remarker <hi>gives you an aſſurance, that all thoſe Forreign Forces are plainly demonſtrated from Colemans Letters. What elſe means this ſignal paſſage,</hi> 
               <q>we have a mighty work upon our hands, the ſubduing of a peſtilent Hereſy which has domineerd over great part of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern world, a great while. There never was greater hopes of ſucceſs, ſince the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Till theſe our days. But the oppoſition we are like to meet with, is alſo like to be great, ſo that it imports us to get all the Ayde and Aſſiſtance we can.</q> Now can I find nothing ſo ſignal in this paſſage as ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to demonſtrate the Popiſh forces, ſworn into the Plot. I declare I have read over <hi>Colemans</hi> papers, attentively, and <hi>Time was</hi> if I could have found but the leaſt hint of Popiſh <hi>Ruffians,</hi> Popiſh Poyſons, Popiſh <hi>Screwd Guns,</hi> or Popiſh <hi>Armies,</hi> either from <hi>Spain, France, Jago, Meſſina,</hi> or any other Popiſh Country, in <hi>all</hi> his papers, the World ſhould have had it through both Ears. But ſince no ſuch thing occurs in all his Letters, give the Devil his due the <hi>Popedreaders</hi> of the World I am afraid, are miſtaken in that <hi>Garagantua</hi> of a Conſpiratour <hi>Coleman.</hi> If this paſſage in his Letters, to Father <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> was for calling in of French Armies, how comes it we have no anſwer in all <hi>Le Cheſe's</hi> Letters to <hi>Coleman</hi> relateing to <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> or one propoſition, <hi>how when</hi> or <hi>where</hi> his Maſter the King of <hi>France</hi> was to <hi>Land them</hi> If this Ayde and aſſiſtance was meant for Armies, and thoſe to be Landed, upon the King's being kil'd, how happens it, there is not ſome relation too in the Letters to the Kings <hi>Death.</hi> Theſe Conſpirators wrote in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and <hi>Characters,</hi> and therefore I know no reaſon they had, but they might Treat upon that ſubject too upon occaſion; eſpecially when (if you'l beleive the Popiſh Plot) they wrote ſo many <hi>hundred</hi> Treaſonable Letters <hi>ſeen read</hi> and <hi>carryed</hi> by <hi>Oats, Bedlow, Dugdale</hi> &amp;c. and ſo many of them in ſuch downright <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> Treason. I, but ſay thoſe ſort of People that ſee thro Milſtones; <hi>T's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that</hi> Coleman <hi>burnt all his Papers relateing to the more Dangerous part of the Plot; for example we find his Correſpendence ending in the Year 76, and that of his two laſt Years 77 and 78 was never found to this day, In that no doubt we ſhould have had the 4 Iriſh Cut throats,</hi> Wakemans <hi>Poyſon,</hi> Connyers <hi>Dagger,</hi> Blundels <hi>Fireballs, and all the Miſtery of</hi> Pilgrims <hi>and Black Bills as apparently made out, as</hi> Demonſtration <hi>and</hi> Record could manifeſt. Now what a ſort of credulous <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> can Fear, and <hi>Jealouſy</hi> make men. Becauſe the Papers found in <hi>Colemans Cloſet</hi> were not <hi>evidential</hi> enough to prove the Kings <hi>Murder</hi> and the Proteſtants <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> we muſt charge him with Crimes of which there is not the leaſt <hi>ſhadow</hi> to convict him of. For I appeal to any man of common Senſe; wheither if <hi>Coleman</hi> had continued his Correſpondence for the 2 following Years, and it were true, that upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Plot <hi>he burnt thoſe Letters relating to that Correſpondence;</hi> how comes it upon his ſearching his Cloſet for <hi>ſome</hi> Papers he did not burn All. He muſt needs be ſenſible that thoſe very Papers he left (to a Nation ſo Jealous of Popery as <hi>England,)</hi> were enough to <hi>hang</hi> him, and as certainly Life's dear, the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that had prompted him to burn the <hi>one,</hi> had infallibly inſtructed him to burn the Other. No; as 'tis plain he was <hi>ſurpriz'd,</hi> he had no time to ſecure <hi>any</hi> of his Papers, and the want of the two laſt Years Correſpondence, is a more evident ſigne, that the Treaty was <hi>broken off,</hi> and that either the <hi>ſubduing the Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilent northern Hereſy,</hi> was given over as a Work impoſſible; or elſe that grand <hi>Intriguer Coleman</hi> had only dreind the French Confeſſours and the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Pockets (for <hi>Money Money</hi> thro all his Letters is the great Burden of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105379:4"/>
ſong) and thoſe wonderful Promiſes of converting of Nations and <hi>ſubduing of Hereſies,</hi> were all but <hi>Ayr</hi> and <hi>Rhodomontado;</hi> till the poor <hi>cullyed</hi> Bigots at laſt had found out the <hi>Cheat,</hi> and ſo ended the <hi>Commerſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I could finiſh my Obſervations on the <hi>Remarks</hi> a new Whig Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion ſtarts up with an other pamphlet calld <hi>Reflections on Settles Narrative.</hi> For that <hi>paw Book</hi> ſets them all upon the Ferment, and <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> in the angry Saints, let me tell you, <hi>boyle high.</hi> And therefore if Rogue, Raſcal, Villain, Traytor, &amp;c. fly at random, you muſt conſider the Nature of the Beaſts, and therefore excuſe whatever <hi>Groſsneſs</hi> you meet, for the <hi>Sordidneſs</hi> of their writings is ſo eſſential to their Conſtitutions, that they cannot poſſibly auoy'd it.</p>
            <p>Theſe two dead doing Adverſaryes being much of an equal Proweſs and their Arguments and Batteries much of the ſame ſtrength, I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to make two diſtinct Replyes to them, but give you my ſence of their beſt, though weake Arguments promiſcuously as Diſcourſe or Occaſion ſhall offer. This laſt Antagoniſt falls vehement foul too upon the Narrative for all the <hi>Abſurdityes; Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencyes, Claſhing</hi> of <hi>Evidence, Contradictions, Improbabilitys,</hi> and <hi>Impoſſibilitys</hi> found in the Popiſh Plot, and in page 7th gives you this univerſal ſalvo for all the <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the whole Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Mr.</hi> Settles <hi>leave,</hi> Rome, <hi>in the ſeveral Attempts, it has made for the Perverſion Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Apoſtacy of great Brittain to the Popiſh Superſtition and Power, having been ſtill fruſtrated, notwithſtanding its Deſigns were contrived with all the Art and skill that Humane Witt, and Deviliſh Policy could ſuggeſt, and therefore having incurred the Juſt Reſentment, and Indignation of all thoſe who have in deteſtation all its abominable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes; I ſay, the Frequent Diſappointments of their Projects may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to have made them uſe the Precaution that in caſe they ſhould agen prove Abortive, and their Machinations be detected, that they might nevertheleſs appear in ſuch Lights as to ſeem improbable to the World, and that, then let the Iſſue be what it will, it muſt turn to their Advantage; ſince if the Plot had taken Effect, they had gain'd their main Point. But the diſcover'd, and diſappointed, yet the puzling Circumſtances, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities of the means, as it might bring the Reality of it into queſtion, ſo it might alſo the Truth of its former Conſpiracies, how manyfeſt ſoever. And they from thence have an occaſion of retorting them as Contrivances of their Enemies, and by that means purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Scandal and Odium which they had juſtly brought upon their Church by ſuch unchriſtian-like, nay inhumane Undertakings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well; never was Nonſenſe more Nonſenſically Defended. How far fetcht, and Sophiſtical is this feeble <hi>Crutch</hi> to help out the <hi>Lameneſs</hi> and <hi>Inconſiſtencies</hi> in the Plot. If the Reflecter had proved that the Plottets had amuzed their Agents ſuch as <hi>Bedlows Dugdule Oats</hi> &amp;c. with Interlarding <hi>Shams</hi> with <hi>Truth</hi> to invalidate and confound their Diſcoveries upon any Revolt from their cauſe, he had done ſome thing. But that's apparently falſe, for they never <hi>Doubted</hi> their <hi>Truth,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having their great <hi>April</hi> Conſult, Subſcribed by ſo many ſeveral Mens Hands, convey'd from Chamber to Chamber by any of their Head Conſpirators, the very <hi>Underling Oats</hi> has that great Truſt Impoſed in <hi>him,</hi> and the Invincible Demonſtration of the moſt monſtrous Deſign againſt the Kings Life, expreſly in <hi>plain Engliſh,</hi> put into his Power. Beſides all the Treaſonable Papers daily Truſted in <hi>Oats, Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Bedlows</hi> Hands, upon the leaſt falſhood in the Meſſengers, had put them paſt all hopes of bringing the Reality of their <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>former</hi> Guilt and Treaſons into Queſtion. So that, (tho truly I cannot make ſenſe of what this hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of words means,) if the Plot be true, <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo far from being guilty of ſo much <hi>foreſight</hi> as the Reflecter gives it, that <hi>Precaution</hi> is the leaſt Crime it has to anſwer for.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have their Confirmation of <hi>Oats</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the Plot in General; and now we ſhall give you their particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on the Narrative, at leaſt thoſe that ſo much as look like Reflections, or Arguments againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Reflecter very Heroically falls upon the Firſt Line of the Narrative, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Narrat. <hi>In the Year 78. it pleaſed thoſe Powers that inſpired them to raiſe up Mr.</hi> Oats, Bedlows, Dugdale, Prance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105379:5"/>
Which ſays the Reflecter, <hi>I muſt own I do not underſtand. What does Mr.</hi> Settle <hi>mean? that it pleaſed thoſe Powers that inſpired thoſe Powers?</hi> That's Grammar indeed, but no ſenſe; but there's neither Grammar nor ſenſe in theſe words, as Mr. <hi>Settle</hi> has ſet them down.</p>
            <p>You ſee Reader, what an Adverſary <hi>Settle</hi> is like to encounter by this firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque he gives him. When a School-boy in the under Form at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> would tell him that [THEM] only relates to <hi>Oats, Bedlow, Dugdale;</hi> and to have made it that Non-ſenſe the Reflecter intends it, <hi>viz. thoſe powers that inſpired thoſe powers,</hi> it muſt have been <hi>Thoſe powers that inſpired THEMSELVES.</hi> Juſt ſuch another remarkable correction he gives to <hi>Elkanahs</hi> falſe Grammar page 15. ſays <hi>Elkanah, here the Reader is deſired to take notice of the moſt matchleſs Example in Mr.</hi> Bedlow <hi>that ere HE met with,</hi> to which replies the Reflecter inſtead of <hi>[THEY have met with] if Mr.</hi> Settle <hi>will allow me to make it true Grammar</hi> for him. Now unleſs a Fellow had <hi>ſtudyed</hi> to Print himſelf a Block-head, nothing beſides <hi>ſtupidity</hi> Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible could have made [Reader] a plural Number. This egregious ſtumble in the very firſt ſtep into the Narrative, and this ſtrength of his <hi>Syntax</hi> is a little ominous, and he ſhews you what a <hi>Grammarian</hi> he is, to let you expect what a <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> you'le find him too. And as he ſays he <hi>underſtands</hi> no better, tis very likely he tells you true, by the Cudgels he takes up; for indeed Men of <hi>underſtanding</hi> begin to quit the Whig Cauſe ſo faſt, that <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> and indeed <hi>Common ſenſe</hi> will go a great way amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But firſt for the Killing the King.</p>
            <p>After the Reflecter has repeated the Narratives comical Deſcription of <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crings</hi> puiſſance in King Killing, he ſays, <hi>Now I appeal to Mankind if they can find any thing of a jeſt in ſo ſad and ſo ſerious a Theme, an Attempt the moſt execrable that was ever hatcht in Hell, the very thought whereof, tho ſuppoſe it but a FICTION, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of creating a Terror and Trembling in the moſt unhumane Barbarians.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> time he is in the Right. Truly ſuch a <hi>FICTION,</hi> the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable indeed that was ever hatcht in Hell, and the thought of ſo much Infernal <hi>Impudence</hi> and Diabolical <hi>Perjury</hi> that muſt attend that <hi>FICTION</hi> on one ſide, and ſo much Innocent LOUD TONGUED <hi>Blood</hi> on the other ſide, is enough indeed to create a Terror and Trembling in Barbarians and Infidels.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Settle</hi> tells you that the Looſneſs and Failure of <hi>Pickerings</hi> Gun in <hi>Oats</hi> his Narrative was in <hi>January</hi> as <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſend word to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but at <hi>Pickerings</hi> Tryal expreſly in <hi>March,</hi> being askt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir Ch. L. Do you know any thing of</hi> Pickerings <hi>doing Pennance and for what!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oats, <hi>Yes, my Lord, in the Month of</hi> March <hi>(for theſe Perſons have followed the King ſeveral Years) but he at THAT TIME had not lookt to the Flint of his Piſtol, but it was looſe, and he durſt not venture to give Fire, he had a fair opportunity and becauſe he miſt it through his own negligence he underwont Pennance, and had 20 ſtrokes of Diſcipline.</hi> Upon this ſays <hi>Settle.</hi> Can any thing be more ſtrange than that <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſhould ſend the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Fathers in <hi>January</hi> a perfect Relation of a Crime not committed till the <hi>March</hi> following. Now (hereupon ſays the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter) <hi>I cannot for the heart of me ſee an</hi> Elliotiſm <hi>in this whole matter; for might not</hi> Pickering <hi>commit the Crime in</hi> January <hi>or before, and not ſuffer the pennance till</hi> March <hi>following: For the Queſtion is only to the doing pennance, and the Anſwer is in</hi> March.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve the damnable Trecherous Eye-ſight of a Whig, that always ſees too little or too much. <hi>Oats</hi> ſwears that <hi>Pickering</hi> ſuffered pennance in <hi>March</hi> becauſe he at THAT TIME had not lookt to the Flint of his Piſtol, and yet the Reflecter <hi>ſpight of the heart of him</hi> cannot ſee but that very THAT TIME muſt be <hi>January</hi> two Months before.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſuch another fault <hi>ſpight of the heart of him</hi> cannot the Remarker forbear ſeeing too. ſays <hi>Settle.</hi> The Reader is humbly deſired not to be puzled to imagine how <hi>Pickering</hi> ſhould preſent a Gun (between a Piſtol and Carbine,) twice at the King, which one time for want of Prime, and another time (as <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſwears) by being charged with all Bullets and no Powder would not go off, and yet not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or ſo much as ſeen by any one of all the Kings Attendance, and that too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105379:5"/>
in ſo publick a place as St. <hi>James's Park,</hi> a place where there is not ſo much as a Bramble or Bryar, or any one Covert throughout it enough to ſhrowd a Pigmey, much leſs too Man-ſlayers, excepting the Oſiers within the Canal (but thoſe are moated round, and therefore inacceſſible.) To which the Remarker by a certain old Game call'd <hi>croſs purpoſes</hi> makes anſwer. <hi>The Devil's in</hi> Settle <hi>for putting ſhams upon the World. In the firſt place the Oath does not affirm that</hi> Pickering preſented the Gun, <hi>but that finding the defect of the Flint he deferd the Action till another time. Beſides he forgets that there was a very thick Grove at the end of the</hi> Pell-mell <hi>where His Majeſty might have made his unfortunate Approaches.</hi> And the Reflecter upon the ſame paſſage wiſely obſerves, <hi>the Traytor might ſculk behind one of thoſe great Trees, between which, he might have uſed his Hat or Cloak or Twenty other things, for the hindering a Diſcovery. But</hi> Settle <hi>with his Brambles and Bryars could not ſee Wood for Trees.</hi> That is to ſay, a Couple of fellows with each of them a Screwd-Gun could ſhelter themſelves in a Grove without one Branch of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, where the Trees ſtand three or four yards aſunder, and the largeſt of thoſe Trees have publick walks all round them, in a place too where no Man is ſuffered to wander out of the common walk, but the very Centries ſhall call him back. Oh but they concealed their Guns behind their <hi>Hats Cloaks</hi> or Twenty other things. But ſurely when the Gun miſcarryed once for want of powder in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and another time in the Pan, Was the Gun under the Hat, or the Cloak; or were the Silver Bullets to go through Hat Cloak Trees and all?</p>
            <p>But now for the Maſſacre. The Diſcoverers give you an account of Commiſſions given out, an Army to be raiſed; and <hi>Elkanahs</hi> Narrative makes it apparent, that Army could conſiſt of none but Papiſts, it being impoſſible as they had managed it, to have drawn in any other Malecontents into the Conſpiracy. Well, and where's the wonder of all this ſays the Reflecter, <hi>Is it not poſſible to liſt a Popiſh Army in a Proteſtant Country without being Diſcovered till they themſelves think convenient, being Tongue-tyed, awed, and ſpirited by ſuperſtition. Oaths</hi> &amp;c. All this granted, how will the Reflecter reconcile that Conceſſion of his p. <hi>19th.</hi> in which he yeilds <hi>that there were ſome of the Papiſts in the Old Kings Reign,</hi> (ſome Thouſands he might have ſaid) <hi>that ventured their Lives Eſtates and Freedoms in the Royal Cauſe; for in the moſt Barbarous Nations</hi> (continues he) <hi>there are ſome Perſons found who are JUST, UPRIGHT, HONEST and LOYAL.</hi> Now if this Popiſh Army was liſted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the Diſcoverers Swear, the blow being ready for ſtriking, I wonder how the Conſpirators did to ſingle out and liſt only thoſe <hi>Diſloyal</hi> Papiſts fit for their turn, and not unluckily communicate their intended Rebellion to ſo much as <hi>one man</hi> of thoſe Thouſands of <hi>Juſt, Honeſt, Upright, and Loyal</hi> Men of that Religion, that conſequently with all thoſe good Principles would not have fordorn to have <hi>detected</hi> the Conſpiracy. The Papiſts were not <hi>Gods,</hi> and 'tis not a little miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that as but <hi>Men,</hi> they ſhould have that aſſurance of all the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> they truſted, as not to be miſtaken even in <hi>one</hi> falſe Brother through a whole Army. Beſides the Reflecter is very unlucky in this point, for as <hi>Elkanah</hi> affirms, and the Reflecter does not deny, that the Papiſts by computation are not the <hi>150th.</hi> part of the Nation, and therefore in the Heretick Maſſacre one Man muſt have Kill'd near <hi>a Brace of Hundreds</hi> for his <hi>ſhare,</hi> if as there are ſo many Loyal Men amongſt the Party that would have ſtood <hi>Neuter</hi> at leaſt, if not <hi>reſiſted</hi> them, the Reflecter has unfortunately put them to the puſh of each mans Killing at leaſt <hi>twice as many,</hi> and the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of all this, the Reflecter does not at all doubt, it being as feazable an Archievement as the <hi>Knaves</hi> of <hi>Popeland</hi> ere contrived, or the <hi>Fools</hi> of <hi>Whigland</hi> ere <hi>believed.</hi> Nay to make the Motions of the Jeſuits a little more <hi>wondrous, Bedlow</hi> Swears before the Houſe of Lords, <hi>that the Papiſts had an Army of Forty Thouſand ſtrong all ready to riſe in</hi> London <hi>at 24 hours warning, beſides thoſe that ſhould have been poſted at every Ale-houſe Door to have Kill'd the Soldiers as they come out of their Quarters, and Lord</hi> Petre <hi>and</hi> Powis <hi>were to have Marcht with another Engliſh Army through</hi> Pembroke-ſhire: and yet as the Devil and ill luck would have it, 'tis unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably manifeſt that all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> are ſo far from forming ſo many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Armies, that they are not 40000 <hi>in all,</hi> Men, Women and Children through
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105379:6"/>
the whole Kingdom. Yet all this we are obliged to believe as true as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and he that dares deny it, flies in the face of Kings, Lords and Commons, and arraigns the whole Juſtice of the Nation. Beſides, to eternize the Memory of this glorious Preſerver of the Nation, tho tis notoriouſly known he died <hi>Raving,</hi> yet the true blue <hi>Briſtol</hi> Proteſtants could honour him with no leſs an Inſcription on his Herſe, than

            <p>But now to leave Mr. <hi>Bedlows</hi> Armies, and take a view of <hi>Dugdales</hi> Plot-Forces; the <hi>beſt Jest</hi> we have in all the Reflections, (for 'tis all but <hi>Farce)</hi> we meet in the <hi>11th.</hi> Page. <hi>Settle</hi> gives an account how prepoſterous, nay how impoſſible an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking 'twas for the Papiſts to have laid the Kings Murder upon the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, (as <hi>Dugdale</hi> Swears) and to have engaged the Epiſcopal party in the Maſſacre, upon the iſſue of <hi>Pickerings</hi> Gun, the ſaid <hi>Pickering</hi> being too ſhallow a Headpiece for ſo great a Maſterpiece of Cheat and Villany, as to lay it on the Diſſenters, and too known a Popiſh Face to paſs for a Presbyterian. To this the Reflecter anſwers (for there is nothing ſo Chimerical, but he finds an expedient for) <hi>Seeing the Papiſts were ever hovering about the Kings Perſon; upon the Blow given, might not they out of a pretended officious Zeal fall upon the Aſſaſſinate, mangle him in ſuch a manner as to render him altogether unknown again, for the perſon he was, and then lay it at whoſe door they pleas'd, either by real or forged words</hi> (forged words I underſtand not) <hi>that execrable Murder, and upon this the Church of</hi> England-<hi>Men out of a juſt Reſentment and Indignation for the loſs of their All in ſo Divinely good a Prince, are reaſonably to be ſuppoſed would revenge it with all the Heat, and all the vigour imaginable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now one would think, we had had Popiſh Plots enough in all conſcience; but this ſubtle Reflecter has wonderfully detected one Popiſh Plot <hi>more,</hi> and Heaven knows an <hi>Heroical one,</hi> being no leſs than a Plot of the great and <hi>mighty</hi> Popiſh Nobles, againſt the <hi>poor little</hi> Popiſh <hi>Pickering.</hi> Lord! what will not Popery do, and Reflections find out? But dear Mr. Little Plot, what if the Proteſtant Nobility about the King, which I fancy are always much ſtronger than his Popiſh Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had ſtopt theſe Lordly Popiſh Hands from Carbonading the poor <hi>deſperado,</hi> and preſerved him for a Gibbet, and if they could not have ſtept in time enough to have prevented a Popiſh ſtab, yet at leaſt have ſnatch'd his Carcaſe from thoſe bloody Popiſh <hi>Mince-meat-makers,</hi> and kept his Phyſnomy unmangled to have diſcovered the Aſſaſſinate; in what a condition had this Reflecters great and <hi>Lordly Plot</hi> been in, and Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Sham-Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs (ſays the Reflecter page <hi>12th) Let Mr. Settle not think to render the matter Improbable by hinting the Majority of the Proteſtants thoughout the Kingdom,</hi> (though a 150 to one odds, and a great part even of that uery infinite minority of Papiſts <hi>Juſt Upright Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Men) to <hi>ſurpaſs by much the Papiſts ſeeing the Latter meant to decoy the Church of England Men into the fact, which though they ſhould not have effected, yet ſo unexpected a Surprize upon People unprepared, and at Diſſeution and Diſtruſt amongſt themſelves, by Perſons MARTIALIZ'D and uſed to Arms, as is well known the Papiſts had been, and who for a long while before had been making all things ready for the well Managing of their undertakings, they might well enough promiſe themſelves Succeſs, each not needing to be an</hi> Almanzor <hi>or a</hi> Mars, <hi>or have the ſtrength and Soul of a</hi> Hercules.</p>
            <p>Now hang me if I can find out how 'tis well known the Papiſts have been <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tializ'd</hi> &amp; <hi>Uſ'd to Arms</hi> more then the reſt of their Country-men. I'm Senſible, Heavn be prais'd, they have had no Opportunity, nor <hi>occaſion</hi> to improve their Martial Skill ſince the Kings Return, and if it conſiſts in their <hi>former</hi> Experience, to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Eternal ſhame, we had too many Proteſtants, (ſuch as they were) that had as much Martial Learning at that time, though in a worſe cauſe, then the Papiſts. But, alas, the Refllecters meaning is, that they have practiſed Martial Diſcipline of a <hi>latter date,</hi> &amp; in order to this great Work in hand, like the 25000 <hi>Meſſina</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have had their <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> INVISIBLE.

How long was the <hi>Mobile</hi> poſſeſt, (nor are they yet undeceived) that the Papins had their places UNDERG ROUND to Diſcipline whole <hi>Bodyes</hi> of Men. Nor ſhall ye beat it out of the Heads of Ten Thouſand Engliſh Foot to this day, but that Mr. <hi>Choqueux's</hi> innocent Squibs, and Rocket caſes, deſigped for his Maſter <hi>Prince Ruperts</hi> Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, were Fireballs, and Cartrages and other Romiſh Ammunition belonging to the great Devil the Plot.</p>

Nay their fears and terror was ſo great, that on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night being removing the Body back to the firſt Room it lay in, Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> happening to come upon them at that inſtant they all ran away, and left the Body in the Entry, till he call'd to them and made them come back again <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet but two hours before they carryed out the Body, 'twas left in a Room, expoſed to the view of <hi>Bedlows, Lephaire</hi> and the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to the number of half a dozen Men all ſtrangers to <hi>Prance,</hi> with neither <hi>Prance</hi> nor one of his Comerades upon the Spot tho all ſo apprehenſive of a diſcovery.</p>
            <p>But next, ſays the Reflecter, <hi>Let us ſee Mr.</hi> Settles <hi>moſt remarkable Obſervation, viz.</hi> That few or none of thoſe numerous Letters and Packets, ſeen, read, carried and intercepted by the ſeveral Diſcoverers ſhould be couch'd in Ciphers, ſeeing they contain'd no leſs than all the propoſals for Regicides, Maſſacres, Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the reſt of their Villanies whatſoever. <hi>Now might not all thoſe Letters,</hi> (ſays the Reflecter) <hi>that had no Cipher be conveyed by ſuch hands and means as they might rely on for the ſafety of the Delivery, and be couch'd in ſuch Terms, tho
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105379:8"/>
not in Cipher, as to ſeem to an unprepoſſeſs'd Reader to contain nothing but indifferent matters, tho they were ſtuft up with rank Treaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now nothing but Impudence unparallel'd would pretend to anſwer a Book at this rate; Does not the Narrative in that very place prove all <hi>Dugdales</hi> Letters received by him tho directed all to other men, to be all conveyed by the <hi>Common Poſt,</hi> and that there was ſo far from any Caution uſed in the conveyance, that he ſwears <hi>he broke them all open, to above a hundred in number, and thoſe that he could not hanſomely ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al again, he threw by, and never delivered,</hi> and all without the leaſt Outery or Uproar from the Diſcoverers at the miſcarriage, though for the loſs of Treaſon in Grain. Nay were not the contents of thoſe Letters of ſuch a Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> at <hi>Corkers</hi> Trial, ſwears he received a Letter with [KIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING THE KING] in expreſs words in it.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſuch another Reply the Reflecter makes to the Narratives other as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> why <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhould ſpend ſo much labour and waſte paper in Ciphers and Characters, and Foreign Correſpondence, ſometimes puſhing on a TOLERATION, and otherwhile labouring for <hi>Prorogations</hi> and <hi>Diſſolutions</hi> of Parliament, upon their every leaſt motion in disfavour of the Roman Catholicks, if at the ſame time they had that vaſter Machine a working, that would have Crown'd their utmoſt wiſhes without it, when upon killing the King, and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Proteſtants, they had not only diſſolved the Parliament, but likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the Members in the Common Ruin, and by the Entry of Popery by the Sword they had put an end to the very Being and Conſtitution of Parliaments. To which anſwers the Reflecter, <hi>Well, might not theſe Proroguings and Toleration Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be managed in the interim, in caſe an, Obſtacle ſhould happen to the putting their main Plot in Execution. Does it not appear throughout the whole courſe of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, that the Jeſuits would leave no ſtone unturn'd for the bringing about their ends, and play at ſmall games rather than ſtand out.</hi> A ſmall game indeed, and the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Gameſters in Chriſtendom; for had the Papiſts intended ſuch an <hi>Univerſal Maſſacre;</hi> in my Judgment nothing ſo convenient for their purpoſe, as to have done it in the very <hi>Sitting</hi> of a Parliament. How much more eaſie had it been out of Mr. <hi>Bedlows</hi> three Engliſh Armies, to have planted ſome few Popiſh Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions at the <hi>Parliament houſe</hi> Door, or the Parliament mens <hi>Lodgings,</hi> to have killed <hi>Them too</hi> as well as the <hi>Soldiers</hi> as they came out; then to begin a Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre in a Prorogation time, when ſo many great Men as thoſe of the two Houſes, di<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Am afraid, Reader, I have already tired you with a Subject I my ſelf am weary of, a Reply to two ſuch ridiculous Adverſaries, being a Quarrel not worth engaging in, but only that the Whigs, right or wrong, are thoſe <hi>Opiniated</hi> Fools both of their <hi>Scriblers</hi> and their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> that to have kept ſilent had being giving them an occaſion of <hi>Triumph:</hi> and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of allaying that Vanity has given you this trouble. Thus far I have ſhewed you the extent of their <hi>little Reaſon,</hi> and now I care not if I give you the <hi>Latitude</hi> of their <hi>larger</hi> CONSCIENCES. Amongſt the numerous repeated Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcals and Traitours they call me, the Reflecter more particularly in (page the <hi>1ſt)</hi> tells you that in my Epiſtle, <hi>I have ſhew'd my ſelf the greateſt Villain that perhaps has been upon the face of the Earth, in that ſpight and revenge, and thoſe accumulated wrongs againſt a Prince of ſuch Honor and Virtue.</hi> But (page <hi>2d)</hi> he proceeds, and ſays, <hi>when I wrote the Popiſh Character, did not that ſad Juncture threaten the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a direful Revolution, and what I now mask under my private Reſentments and Revenge, was it not making my Court to a party whom I conſider'd as the Moneyd part of the Nation, and ready inclined to reward and ſuccor all thoſe who had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and probity. But now that the TIDE is turned, that all the Efforts of ZEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOUS PATRIOTS for ſettling the Peace, and procuring the HAPPINES of their Country have been diverted, and that an Inundation of TORISME ſeems to threaten the whole Land; is it not to be ſuſpected that my Recantation and Repentance are only to ſave my Bacon,</hi> &amp;c. And again, page 4. <hi>When WHIGGISM and PROTESTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISM began to be a barrener ſoil than</hi> Pernaſſus, <hi>when all Evidence and proceedings againſt Popery began to be diſcredited, and the Papists began to appear again in ſuch ſhoals, that the crafty Trimmers of the party thought it prudence no longer to oppoſe the Torrent, then Sir Politick</hi> Elkanah <hi>thought fit to wheel about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here do but mark the <hi>Cloven-foot</hi> of my Accuſer, and ſee how impudently <hi>Vice</hi> corrects <hi>Sin;</hi> For I deſire but any honeſt unprejudiced Reader to ſcan but theſe Lines, and find if they bear any other ſenſe, then that the very King is here <hi>maliciouſly</hi> and <hi>venomouſly</hi> accuſed for <hi>diverting</hi> the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of his Kingdoms <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> and that by his Conduct of late years he has <hi>obſtructed</hi> that <hi>Zeal,</hi> and thoſe very <hi>Patriots</hi> that were labouring to eſtabliſh them, and downright <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged</hi> and <hi>promoted</hi> that INUNDATION that no leſs than THREATENS the <hi>Land.</hi> And now as I am ſo over and over accuſed for ridiculing the Juſtice of the Nation, how much more viſibly does this Impudent Scribler arraign both Judge and Jurors, and by the <hi>Evidence againſt Popery being ſo diſcredited</hi> inſinuate that <hi>Wak man, Corker, Kerney,</hi> and the reſt acquitted by Law, had not <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and that the Teſtimonies of their Accuſers, though made up of nothing but <hi>malice, ſcandal, Combination</hi> and <hi>Trechery,</hi> was <hi>Oracle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Nay, he ſtrikes at the very <hi>Government</hi> it ſelf, and by the <hi>Barrenneſs of the Proteſtant Soil, and the Shoals and Torrents of Papiſts,</hi> would make the world believe that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>undermining,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> a ſetting up. Now what this nameleſs fellow is, that dares write this, I know not, but the Soul of a <hi>Ferguzon</hi> could have ſaid no more.

                  </p>
                  <p>And now to ſhew you that theſe two Authors, like the unclean Beaſts in the Ark, go paird, they are as well matcht in their principles as Satan could wiſh.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, the Remarker (page the <hi>6th.)</hi> tells you, <hi>That I was the Author of that damnable Lampoon call'd</hi> a Game at Cards, <hi>preſented inconſiderately by</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah Bows <hi>to Mr.</hi> Duboys, <hi>which brought him to the Pillory and Baniſhment: and no doubt 'twas the hard Fate of my Friend that frighted me into my Converſion.</hi>

                  <p>And yet this very Remarker with all the Bitterneſs and Gall that <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> can infuſe, brands and ſtigmatizes my begging of pardon for all my faults whatever, with no milder terms <hi>than a villanous Raſcally Recantation, a Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>But having ſtarted that unfortunate Fellow <hi>Bows</hi> his Caſe; I care not if I give the World the <hi>odd</hi> but <hi>true</hi> ſtory of his hard Fortune. The Man in the firſt place, was one of the moſt vehement Whiggs in his little capacity that perhaps was in <hi>England,</hi> and as little for <hi>Succeſſion</hi> or <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the <hi>Right Line,</hi> as the Brotherhood could deſire him; nay has as often and as devoutly paid his <hi>Orizons</hi> and <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> SO-HO-<hi>Wards,</hi> as any Man I know: Inſomuch that whatever his ſufferings have been in their Cauſe, maugre his particular Reſentments againſt Mr. <hi>Duboys,</hi> the whole party are ſtill his <hi>Demi-gods,</hi> (unleſs the NEW-MARKET EXPEDITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON when it ſhall reach his ears may convert him.) This poor Man having Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try enough to reach to a <hi>Sonnet,</hi> or an <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> and being likewiſe poſſibly one of the beſt Scribes in the Kingdom, in Gold, Silver, Vermillion Letters, with Flowers, Birds, Beaſts, and other ornamental flouriſhes of the Pen, fit to pleaſe Women; he got his Bread by preſenting Ladies and Perſons of Quality with gay Copies of Verſes in this kind. But one time above the reſt, (as he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways traffick in his own Manufacture) it happened he pickt up a Whiggiſh Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon, a little too rank as it fell out, of which poſſibly twenty Copies had been diſperſt without noiſe or danger at <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Dicks,</hi> and that quarter of the Town. Theſe (as thinking them acceptable) he ſent to the worthy Mr. <hi>Duboys,</hi> and a day or two after, went to ask if he had received them, in hopes of a gratuity of five or ten ſhillings for them. But inſtead of that, he was immediately ſeiz'd for a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> A new <hi>Meal-tub</hi> Plot was diſcover'd; Treaſonable POPISH Papers were <hi>ſhamm'd</hi> into Mr. <hi>Duboys</hi> his <hi>Hand,</hi> ſome ſay into his <hi>Sleeve,</hi> and others into his <hi>Pocket;</hi> and all (God wot) to <hi>betray</hi> him, and bring him into a <hi>Plot.</hi> Beſides a Copy or two of his own <hi>harmleſs Rhimes,</hi> beautified with the forementioned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and the Verſes Damnd unfortunately writ in <hi>Red Ink,</hi> deſign'd for ſome City preſent, were found about him: and thoſe were no ſooner ſpied, but all was <hi>confirm'd:</hi> The Conſpiracy was made as <hi>apparent</hi> as the <hi>Sun:</hi> He was an <hi>Emiſſary</hi> from the POPE, that is <hi>plain,</hi> for he had Papers found writ in BLOOD, and <hi>Contracts</hi> with the DEVIL.

                  <p>The poor Man uſed his utmoſt Endeavor to pacifye and convince his Accuſer both of his <hi>Innocence</hi> and his <hi>Principles:</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>Dudgeen</hi> was <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>All</hi> would not do. The Papers were <hi>Popiſh,</hi> the Meſſenger <hi>Popiſh,</hi> the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Plot Plot,</hi> nothing but <hi>Plot</hi> at the bottom of it; whilſt Truth and Senſe were either not <hi>underſtood</hi> or not <hi>believed.</hi> And tho he made a ſhift to get off at preſent by Bail, yet he was retaken again, ſtood thrice in the Pillory, and though his Papers deſerved all this, and worſe; yet ſee the Oddneſs of the Thing; to one half of the City he was himſelf <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>rank Whig;</hi> to the other, a notorious <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Jeſuit:</hi> in one place his Papers were <hi>Fanatick</hi> in another <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh;</hi> inſomuch that he came to his Wooden Caſement unpittyed by All Men, and ſtood the Battery of Rotten Eggs; and other Flying Artillery even from <hi>All</hi> Hands. Nay, the Delivery of his Lampoons came with ſuch a <hi>Plot Thunder-clap</hi> upon the Brethren, that it has <hi>addled</hi> their underſtandings ever ſince, and the <hi>rumbling</hi> of it is not out of their Heads yet. But alas, Popery and Jeſuites do all things; and poor little <hi>Joſhuah</hi> by the true blew Proteſtant <hi>Opticks,</hi> like a <hi>Flea</hi> in a <hi>Magnifying-glaſs,</hi> was inſtantly <hi>transform'd</hi> into that <hi>Huge, Black Popiſh</hi> Devil, as nothing more terrible: Nay, had this buſineſs happened in 79.

But to return from this Digreſſion, nothing gives my Antagoniſts ſo great a Diſguſt, as that my <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet</hi> Patron ſhould make ſome correction in the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor, and for amendment <hi>bid the Author ſpeak more favorably of Rebellion,</hi> to which ſays the Reflecter, <hi>how can Mr.</hi> Settle <hi>think to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and make the World believe that ever the Patron he mentions ſhould make ſuch a blunder in Politicks as to ſend this Worſhipful Author a Meſſage of this Nature, and that too to a Poet and a profeſsd one, People not much admired in this Age for Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, or Fidelity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That this very Patron did make this Correction, and in theſe very <hi>Words,</hi> the Friend I intruſted to carry it to him is ready to <hi>Attest,</hi> (tho indeed he did not then know the Author, for that I conceal'd till the Book was publiſht) and upon that very Correction of his, I alter'd the latter end of the Character and wrote all thoſe Paragraphs in it, againſt PASSIVE OBEDIENCE and in Juſtification of <hi>taking up Arms</hi> againſt a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> which when I had finiſht I ſent him the Copy again, and he approved of the Amendments. I know not why the Adorers of that great Man ſhould ſo extravagantly <hi>Deifye</hi> him, as to make him guilty of no one humane failing, not one <hi>Lapſus Linguae</hi> in ſo many Years of Gall and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs. Surely one bold Word or two, might now and then drop from ſo bold a Patriot, and ſo angry a ſtate Pilot. I remember a good Friend of mine. Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> Barriſter, the Tranſlator of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> told me that once upon diſcourſe between him and the Right Honorable <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> he asked the ſaid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peer, why he adviſed the King to ſhut up the Exchequer, to which the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Earl made Anſwer <hi>to make him Odious to his People.</hi> So that as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a bold Word has now and then fallen from the Lips of that true Proteſtant Oracle. Now, I hope my good Friend Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> has ſo much Honor and Honeſty as not to deny his own words: But if he wronged the Honorable Lord in this ſtory of him, it behoves him to do Juſtice to his Memory, and publickly own his Repentance for ſo black an Aſperſion againſt ſo great a Perſonage. I, but I am a very Impudent Fellow ſays the Remarker, for ſaving in my Preface that the Plot writ the Aſſociation, for (continues he) if I mean the pretended Aſſociation 'twas a Baſtard <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith, I'll not ſay much to that, but if 'twas a Baſtard 'twas ſo much the nearer of Complexion to the great Son of Thunder that was to head it. But ſays the Reflecter, <hi>Settle</hi> tells us in his Preface, that he now dares look Senſe and Quality in the Face, intimating at the ſame time that it is what the Whigs dare not: whereas 'tis well known, there be thoſe who are call'd Whigs, who dare noſe both Senſe and Quality, and defye the Courage as well as the Arts and Machinations of their Enemies. Now if this Fellow would make his words true, he might do himſelf and the Nation no ſmall kindneſs, nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their noſing of Quality, could he make them but Face <hi>Day-light,</hi> that WHIGGISM and TREASON might receive their Reward, and the <hi>Ungratefulleſt</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi> and moſt <hi>Unnatural</hi> of <hi>

                  <p>Which is ſo damnable a Falſhood, and ſo publickly known to be ſo too, that on the quite contrary I diſown'd and abjured the writing ſo much as one Syllable of it: and to vindicate my ſelf from the ſcandal of ſuch a Lampoon, at that time ſo unjuſtly and ſo univerſally laid at my Door, and ſo much to my diſreputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if to clear my ſelf by no leſs a Poteſtation then that <hi>I was the Son of a Whore if I wrote one word of it,</hi> when indeed I <hi>did not</hi> write one word of it, be calling a Mothers Honeſty into Queſtion, let the World Judge.</p>

This Man having a Book to preſent to one of his Patrons, he prevailed with his Book-ſeller to go with it, dawbing this Patron to him at a high rate, extolling his Wiſdom, Benignity of Temper, and Generoſity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whereupon the Book-ſeller trooped with the offering to the Lord; but coming back with Diſappointments in his Countenance, and telling Mr.</hi> Settle <hi>that he had delivered his Book, but that the Lord had return'd no other thanks than what conſiſted in words, he began to curſe and damn the Sordidneſs of his Patron, wiſhed he had been in Hell, when the thought came into his Head of making him that Oblation, Vomiting out all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations</hi> &amp;c. <hi>until the Book-ſeller to direct this Torrent of Rage, ſhewed him ſome few Guinneys, which his Patron had ſent him as a preſent: and then to ſee the wonderful Effect, that that Metal has upon Mr.</hi> Settles <hi>Intellectuals, he immediatly ſaw that good Lord again through quite different Opticks, and found in him a 1000 more fine Qualities then he had ever done before.</hi>

            <p>Juſt ſuch another piece of Forgery is this with the former; and to prove ſo: All the Books I ever wrote, except the Popiſh Character, were Printed by one Book-ſeller, who is ready to make Oath, that there is not one Syllable of Truth in all this ſtory, and that he never delivered any ſuch Book or Books for me, or ever received Guinneys or Guinney for me from any Patron or Lord whatever.</p>
            <p>But truly, of all Mankind I have the leſt Reaſon to admire or complain at this Uſage, when I conſider that nothing but Malice makes a Whig, and nothing but

            <p>There is one Pen more drawn againſt me, call'd a <hi>Letter to E. Settle;</hi> Printed by <hi>Nat.

He very much doubts whether thoſe Motives expreſt in my Preface were the true Incendiaries to ſo inveterate a Pen as mine; and believing that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſo eminently ſerviceable to thoſe falſe Patriots, that always make <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> the ſpecious pretences to mask the Blackeſt and Fouleſt Purpoſes, he ſeems to be very confident I muſt be truſted in their <hi>Intrigues</hi> and <hi>Cabals:</hi> and thereupon has put me a whole Roll of <hi>Quaraees</hi> to Anſwer. To which Book I can only make this ſhort Reply. In that Confeſſion made in my Preface, I have given the World the whole Truth of my Soul. And tho my unhappy Reſentments for having a Play re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the Dukes Theatre, may appear a very idle Provocation for ſo implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſpight and revenge as mine; yet as that Command was occaſionally the Ruine of my well being in the World, the Circumſtances of which are too tedious to recite, from that very Cauſe (tho never ſo unjuſt and unchriſtian a one) I drew in that Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Virulence againſt the Son of a King and a Martyr, the Greateſt of Heroes, and the beſt of Friends and Brothers. But as my ſoul, too much loaded <hi>already,</hi> has no <hi>farther</hi> Sins to anſwer for; I am ſo wholy uncapable of ſolving this Gentlemans <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> that <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> is all the Plea I can make, I being ſo far from a <hi>Confident, Caballer,</hi> or indeed Company-keeper with thoſe Antimonarchical <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevils,</hi> that I can ſafely Swear, I never ſo much as drank at the <hi>Kings-head Club;</hi> excepting on a publick Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Night: Perhaps the <hi>Voluntary Tribute</hi> I brought them made me eſteemd a <hi>Profitable Servant</hi> enough, without exacting any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Task</hi> from my Hands; or otherwiſe, they might be thoſe skillful Phyſiognomiſts that they could read Souls, and found me ſo uncapable even of a <hi>Thought</hi> againſt my <hi>King,</hi> that in <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> they made their Machinations againſt the Crown, thoſe <hi>Secrets</hi> that were to be laid out of my reach; for I declare in the preſence of God, I know no more by them, then that the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> and the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary <hi>Projections</hi> for Liberty and Religion were the utmoſt end they drove at. And if I have belyed my Conſcience in this Proteſtation, and am any wiſe Guilty of thoſe Crimes, that the Letter-writer ſuſpects, there is now that Juſtice wakened, that would ſoon o'retake me. For thanks be to Heaven, the Great <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> begins to be unfolded, and the detection of this laſt TRULY <hi>Damnable</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Plot, begins to ſet the <hi>Staggering World</hi> upright again: a Plot not diſcovered by the <hi>Rakings</hi> of <hi>Jails,</hi> and <hi>Scumm</hi> of Mankind; but by Clouds of Witneſſs of <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Quality:</hi> A Plot, not univerſally denyed with Vows, Oaths, and Imprecations even at <hi>Gibbets</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> but confeſt in <hi>Jails</hi> with Horror and Trembling. A Plot, that I hope will ſo fully reſtore thoſe Senſes that Deluſion and Frenzy have ſo long ſet a wandring, that Union and Loyalty ſhall ſo perfectly Flouriſh again, till the Hearts of his People and Parliaments ſo intirely return to the beſt of Men &amp; Kings, that they ſhall meet him with no leſs <hi>Careſſes</hi> and <hi>Endearments</hi> then thoſe at his Reſtoration.</p>
