            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:44031:3"/>
his Truth, even his Godhead and his Eternall Power</hi> by his Workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20</note> that such as respect him not, in the Creation of the World, and in the wayes of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may be without excuse: Now it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but that also our Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man should bee made sensible of his goodness, and partake of that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of life, which by his appointment the Creature can yeeld unto us, <hi>if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee may feel after him and find him therein.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.27</note> So that such as respect him not in his wayes of Nature, being careless to seek them out, do make themselves also incapable of the blessings of Nature through their ignorance and neglect of the good things which God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them thereby: <hi>for all things are Ours, things present and things to come</hi>; and <hi>Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is aswell as of that which is to come</hi>: for as by the act of Faith we are made capable of the good things of the life to come, because by the truth of God, as it is the Object of our Faith, they have a spirituall being and Subsistence in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:44031:3"/>
so by the act of Reason rightly ordered we are made partakers of the benefit of this life, because by the effect of Gods Wisedom and Power in Nature, as they are the Objects of our Reasonable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they have a bodily being and subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence in us: and as the Wisdom of God doth many wayes manifest it self, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Spirituall, but also in Outward and Bodily things, so there are many parts of Humane Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some wherof are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the Private life of a single man, some to the comforts and Publick Use of a Societie, and amongst all these parts of Learning, which relate to a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, I can conceive none more profitable in Nature, than that of Husbandry. For whether we reflect upon the first settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Plantation, to prosper it, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wealth of a Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is planted, to increase it, this is the Head spring of al the native Commerce &amp; Trading which may bee set afoot therein by any way whatsoever. Now to advance Husbandry either in the production and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of earthly benefits, or in the management thereof by way of Trading, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more usefull, than to have the knowledg of the Natural History of each Nation advanced &amp; perfected: For as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:44031:4"/>
that except the benefits which God by Nature hath bestowed upon each Country bee known, there can be no Industrie used towards the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Husbandry thereof; so except Husbandry be improved, the industrie of Trading, whereof a Nation is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, can neither be advanced or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upheld.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold body, and a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold life in man, which God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the one is Naturall, the other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, &amp; the Apostle tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.46.</note> 
               <hi>that the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall is not first, but the Naturall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is Spirituall</hi>; as the Bodies and lives of men are ordered by God, so we must conceive of the frames of their Societies, that the Naturall is before that which is Spirituall, &amp; that in Gods aime it is a preparatory thereunto; although in the use which men make thereof, this aime is not obtained: for seeing <hi>in the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the world by wisdome hath not known God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>therefore God is pleased by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way which to the World doth seem foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness, to manifest his Power and his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto salvation,</hi> namely <hi>by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel in the name of Iesus Christ, and him crucified</hi>; and although hitherto, since the death of Christ, the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:44031:4"/>
of wisdome hath not yet opened the conduit pipes of Natural Knowledge to cause the souls of men flow forth &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the life of God therein, by reason of the prevalencie of Sensuall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; of the want of due reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, in whom alone the perfect use of Nature is brought home to the glory of the Father, by the Spirit, yet when the time of <hi>the Restauration of all things, shall come from the presence of him, who will come shortly and will not tarry,</hi> then the works of the Devill, whereby he hath brought us, &amp; the whole Creation, under the bondage of Corruption, shall be destroied, &amp; when the Nature &amp; right use of the Creature by his meanes obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shall be revealed, then also the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and application of the Creature <hi>in the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God,</hi> shall be subjected unto Grace.</p>
            <p>These great and mighty Changes, which God is making in the Earth, do tend to break the yokes of Vanity, and to weaken the Power, which hath wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the same upon the necks of the Nations, these Changes seem to me to presage the neer approaches of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the advancement of the ways of Learning, whereby the Intellectuall
<pb facs="tcp:44031:5"/>
Cabinets of Nature are opened, and the effects therof discovered, more fully to us, than to former Ages, seem in like man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner to prepare a plainer Address unto the right use thereof for us than our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have had: which will be effectuall to the manifestation of Gods Wisdome, Power, and Goodness, when the great promises shall be accomplished, <hi>that the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:44031:7"/>
you will gain both credit and contentment, and that those shall no wayes be losers, who will bee at the charges of doing the same. For though I say it, the work is excellent in it's kind, as not only full of truth and certainty, but written with much judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, order, &amp; exactness; so as it is to be preferred before most Naturall Histories of particular Countries, and may well be equalled to the very best, for as much as there is done of it. For to make it a compleat Naturall History, there should be joyned to that which my Brother hath gone through, two Books more, the one of all kind of Plants, and the other of all sorts of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which also might have been expected of him if God had given him longer life. For he intended, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as he had published this part, to have fallen also to the rest, if he had found that he had not lost his labour on what was done already, &amp; that it had met with a gratefull acceptance abroad, such as might have incouraged him to take further paines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the perfecting of it: in which case he was resolved to have also joined a Fourth book to those other Three, concerning the Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their old Fashions, Lawes, and Customes; as likewise the great paines taken by the English, ever since the Conquest, for to civilize them, and to improve the Countrie. You say you wonder, &amp; others may justly concurre with you in that your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how a Countrie could bee so accurately described by one, who never was in it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Brother hath been in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he hath ended his dayes there, yet he had both begun and finished this First Book of his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall History of <hi>Ireland,</hi> some yeares before he went
<pb facs="tcp:44031:7"/>
thither, or had any thoughts of doing so: seeing that he begun to write that work in the beginning of the year of our Lord <hi>1645.</hi> and made an end of it long before the end of the same year! wheras he went not to <hi>Ireland</hi> untill the latter end of the year <hi>1649.</hi> &amp; dyed at <hi>Dublin</hi> within a very short while after he was arrived there, viz. on the <hi>9/19</hi>th of Ianuary <hi>16 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>0/49.</hi> Now to answer that difficulty moved by you, be pleased to know, that I being come from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of May <hi>1644.</hi> and having stayed there untill the latter end of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, great part of that conversation, which he and I had together during those six months, was spent in reasoning about <hi>Ireland,</hi> and about all manner of particulars concerning the Morall and Civill, but chiesly the Naturall History of the same: my Brother beeing very carefull to inform himself of me, about all things appertaining thereunto. For besides that his curiositie, which was very great for to enrich his mind with all manner of laudable knowledge, was of it self alone capable enough for to make him inquisitive in that kind; he was there-besides led thereto by his own interest, having ventured great part of his estate upon the eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lands there, according to the severall Acts made by the King and Parliament in that behalf. And having set down in writing what he had so heard of me, he conferred afterwards about the same with severall of those Gentlemen, whom the bloody combustions of <hi>Ireland</hi> had driven away thence, and made to resort to <hi>London</hi>; he beeing very well acquainted with them, especially with Sir <hi>William Parsons,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Parsons,</hi> which two having above all others a very perfect
<pb facs="tcp:44031:8"/>
insight into that land, &amp; into all matters' belonging to the same, were wonderfull well able to satisfie any of those Questions, which from time to time he propounded unto them, either about those things that he had already learned of me, or about such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of which hee had forgot to speak to me, or on which I had not been able fully to inform him. In this maner he brought that Work together, the which to accomplish yet further, he sent to me still as much as he had finished, desiring me to review it diligently, and to adde, put out, or alter, what I should see cause: wherein also, as in the first infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, I was not wanting to contribute what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was necessary, as far forth as my knowledge did reach unto, and according to those Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unto which I had very studiously and with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular delight applied my self during those eight yeares that I lived in that Iland: whereunto I had so much the more opportunity, because that as my constant abode was in <hi>Dublin,</hi> so I made very many journeys into the Countrie, &amp; by meanes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of saw great part of it, especially of the Provinces of <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Ulster,</hi> and by reason thereof also it would be an easie matter for me, to make-up those parts of this work, which are still wanting. Thus I beleeve to have fully taken away the forementioned Objection, and to have given you as perfect an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count about the grounds &amp; the manner of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Naturall History, as was expected by you. And having nothing else to trouble you with all at the present, I shall end these with my most hearty wishes, that notwithstanding any discouragements, or any want of incouragement, you would still goe
<pb facs="tcp:44031:8"/>
on in that most commendable purpose, of furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as much as in you lieth all manner of reall and profitable knowledge: the which indeed hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have done so largely on very many occasions, as must needs greatly redound to the generall good of Mankind, and make your memory precious to them in all future ages.</p>

                  <p>The Sea, which parteth Ireland from Great-Britain, being of a very unequall breadth, is more narrow in the North-end, less in the South-end, but broad in the midst, as farre as it washeth the the English coast, being the full length of the two Counties of Cumberland and Lancashire, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site against which are situated in Ireland the Counties of Down, Lowth, and Dublin. The Sea which is inclosed betwixt these Counties, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth in its middle the Ile of Man, is wel neer of an equall and uniform breadth every where, not beeing in any place much broader or much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, than it is betwixt the havens of Dublin &amp; Leverpoole, the distance betwixt which two is reckoned by the English Pilots to be of fortie leagues, or sixscore English miles. But Wales in two or three places commeth a great deal nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to Ireland, and in some as neer again. For Holy-head, being the most Westerly corner of the Northerliest part of Wales, called Anglesey, lyeth just half way between Dublin &amp; Lerpoole or Chester, being twenty Leagues, or three score miles, from Dublin, and ten or twelve houres sayl with a reasonable good wind; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is no greater, than what the eye may very

very well reach: for a man whose sight is but of an ordinary goodness, may at any time in clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> weather with ease discern the high and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous coast of Wales from the top of the Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin mountaines. And about the same distance, as is betwixt Dublin and Holy-head, is also betwixt St. Davis-head, a Promontory of Pembrookshire (which shire is situated in the most South-west part of Wales) and the Irish Promontory in the County of Wexford, which the Natives call Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne, and the English Sea-men Tuskard-point. Also the Promontory of Carnarvan in Wales, called Brachipult-point, and lying betwixt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-head and St. Davis, is well neer at the same distance from the next Irish shore, as either of those other Welsh Promontories. But between Brachipult-point and Saint Davis-head the Sea doth much inlarge it self (although nothing so much as betwixt Ireland and England) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great inlet on the coast of Wales, the which here retireth it self a great way back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: whereas to the contrary the Irish shore, which lyeth opposite to it, extendeth it self in an equall manner without any great Bayes or inlets.</p>
                  <p>As for the North part, where Ireland &amp; Scotland are neighbours, there this Sea groweth very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; insomuch as Galloway, a County in that part of Scotland, is distant with its most wester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shoare from the Ardes (a little country and demy-island so named in the most Northerlie part of the County of Down in Ireland) not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five Leagues; which space the open boats, wherein they ordinarily here doe pass from the one kingdome into the other, use to sail in three
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44031:11"/>
or four houres time: and Cantire, another Foreland on the West shore of Scotland, more to the North than Galloway, is neerer yet unto Ireland: so that in these two places the one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may perfectly bee seen and discerned out of the other at all times, whensoever it is no very dark gloomie weather.</p>

                  <p>The shape of this Iland is long-waies square, but not fully: for to say nothing of severall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Forelands, which run out a great way into the Sea, nor of divers great Bayes and Inlets, which the sea maketh here and there, in the three other parts of this Iland; the fourth part, called Munster, doth greatly alter that figure; for in lieu of stretching it self fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st from the North to the South, &amp; then from the South to the West, it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth altogether sloping from the North-east to the South-west; and there besides it stretcheth it self much further into the Sea with its Western shores, than any other part of Ireland on the same West-side.</p>
                  <p>As for the bigness thereof, questionless it is to be reckoned among the chief Ilands of the whole World; and of Europe the principalest of all, except only Great-Britain, the which is more than twice as big: for being as long again, as it is broad, it is at the narrowest (which is just in the middle, where Dublin is situated) no less than an hundred miles broad; seeing that Atlone, which lyeth just half way betwixt the two Seas, is fifty miles distant from Dublin; and in Vlster, where Ireland is at its broadest, it is in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ten, or twelve, and in some twenty miles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44031:11"/>
broader. In the length, if from the middle of the Northern coast one doe go directly Southward, one shall find it to be about two hundred miles. But if you shape your course more to the East, the length will be found less by some miles, because the cost of Munster runneth so sloping, as we have said before: and to the contrary, if one measure the length of Ireland more to the West, it will be found to bee a great deal more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles. And if the measure were taken not through the inland-parts, as now we have framed it, but all along the sea-shore, the length would amount to a great deal more than what now we have declared (as well on the East as on the West side) in regard of the inequality of the coast, and of the great Bayes and Fore-lands, which make it in most places very much run out to the seaward, or into the landward: for which same reason the circuit of the whole Iland, taken alongst the shoare, is by far greater, than otherwise the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of its length and breadth would seem to require. The Miles here mentioned must bee understood not of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon English ones, three wherof make one League, or Holland mile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of the Irish, the which are about one fifth part big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, so as five Irish miles doe amount to about six English.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> Division of Ireland into Provinces and Counties.</head>
                  <p>This Iland is divided into four principall parts, called Provinces, <hi>viz.</hi> Vlster, Leinster, Connaught, and Munster: of which the first and the last extend themselves from the one sea to the other, Vlster in the North, and Munster in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44031:12"/>
South. Leinster &amp; Connaught, lying betwixt those two forenamed Provinces, have the sea only on one side, Connaught on the West, and Leinster on the East. To these four most Writers and Records add a fifth, called Meath; but that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a part of Leinster, and ordinarily now is held to be such.</p>
                  <p>Each of these Provinces is again divided into divers Counties. Vlster hath eleven, whereof six on the sea-side, <hi>viz.</hi> Fermanagh, Doneghall <hi>alias</hi> Tirconnel, Colraine, Antrim, Down, Lowth; and five within the land, <hi>viz.</hi> Cavan, Monaghan, Armahg, Nether-Tirone, &amp; Upper-Tirone. Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster comprehendeth likewise eleven Counties, Dublin, Wickloe, and Wexford on the sea-side, East-Meath, and Catherlogh or Carlo within the land, but with a little nook reaching unto the sea; West-Meath, Kildare, Kilkenny, Kings-county, Queenes-county, and Longford altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within the land. Munster is divided into six Counties, two within the Land, <hi>viz.</hi> Tipperary and Limmerick; and the other four, Waterford, Cork, Desmond, and Kerry, situated on the sea-side, but stretching themselves a great way into the land. In Connaught there be six Counties, <hi>viz.</hi> Clare <hi>alias</hi> Tomond, Galloway, Majo, and Sleigo, situated on the Sea, and Roscomen, and Letcim within the land</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 5.</hi> Of the English Pale.</head>
                  <p>There is yet another division of Ireland, whereby the whole land is divided into two parts, The English Pale, and the Land of the meer Irish. The English Pale comprehendeth onlie four Counties, one whereof is in Vlster, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44031:12"/>
Louth, and the other three in Leinster, to wit Meath, Dublin, and Kildare: the originall of which division is this. The English at the first conquest, under the reign of Henry the second, having within a litle time conquered great part of Ireland, did afterwards, in the space of not very many yeares, make themselves masters of almost all the rest, having expelled the natives (called the Wild Irish, because that in all manner of wildness they may bee compared with the most barbarous nations of the earth) into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart woods and mountains. But afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falln at ods among themselves, and making severall great warres the one upon the other, the Irish thereby got the opportunitie to recover now this, and then that part of the land; whereby, and through the degenerating of a great many from time to time, who joining themselves with the Irish, took upon them their wild fashions and their language, the English in length of time came to bee so much weakened, that at last no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained to them of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, worth the speaking of, but the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the forenamed four Counties; to whom the name of Pale was given, because that the authority and government of the Kings of England, and the English Colonies or Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which before had been spread over the whole Land, now were reduced to so small a compass, and as it were impaled within the same. And although since the beginning of this present age, and since King <hi>Iames</hi> his comming to the Crown of England, the whole Iland was reduced under the obedience and government of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Lawes, and replenished with English and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44031:13"/>
Scotch Colonies; nevertheless the name of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Pale, which in the old signification was now out of season, remained in use, and is so still, even since this last bloody rebellion, wherein the inhabitants of almost all the Pale, although all of them of English descent, have conspired with the Native Irish, for to shake off the Government of the Crown of England, and utterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the Reformed Religion, with all the professors thereof, and quite to root them out of Ireland.</p>

                  <p>This Iland hath in it severall Cities, among which Dublin is the principall, beeing the chief City of the whole Commonwealth, the Residence of the Governour, the Counsell of State, all the Great Officers, the Exchequer, Iudges, and Courts of Iustice; beeing also adorned with an Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, the onely in all Ireland. It is situated in the Province of Leinster, about the middle of the length of Ireland (as already hath been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) not far from the Sea, an Inlet whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a harbour for this City; which harbour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none of the best of Ireland, (whereof in the next chapter but one shall bee spoken more at large) is neverthelesse frequented with more ships, and hath greater importation of all things, than any other Haven in the Kingdome; by reason that all sorts of commodities are much more readily &amp; in greater plenty vented here than any where else, what in the City it selfe, beeing great and populous, what into the country, for in the time of peace almost all Leinster and and Vlster were wont to furnish themselves from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44031:13"/>
Dublin of all kinds of provisions and necessaries, such as were brought in out of forrein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>Next to Dublin is Galloway, the head-citie of the Province of Connaught, to bee reckoned, as well for bigness and faireness, as for riches; for the streets are wide, and handsomely ordered, the houses for the most part built of free stone; and the inhabitants much addicted to trafick, doe greatly trade into other countries, especially into Spain, from whence they used to fetch great store of wines and other wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es every year.</p>
                  <p>In the third place commeth Waterford, situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the province of Munster; and in the fourth Limmerick, the head-city of the said Province, both towns of trafick, situated on goodly havens, and of reasonable bigness and handsomness.</p>
                  <p>Cork, in the Province of Munster, and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-derrie, in the Province of Vlster, are less than any of the formentioned, but otherwise handsome places, well built, &amp; very fitly situated for trafick and navigation, as standing upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Havens.</p>
                  <p>As for the rest of the Townes, Drogheda, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny, and Bandonbridge are passable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of some regard both for bigness and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness: But Colrain, Knockfergus, Belfast, Dundalk, Wexford, Youghall, and Kinsale are of small moment, the best of all these being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comparable to any of those fair Market-townes, which are to be found in almost all parts of England. And as for Cassel, Rosse, Lismore, Clonmell, and Kilmallock in Munster; Sleigo and Atlone in Connaught; Molingar, Trimme,

Kels, Navan, Aboy, Nace, Carlo, Arklo, and Wicklo in Leinster; Carlingford, Ardee, and Down in Vlster, all of them walled Townes, they are scarce worth the mentioning, because there are few Market Townes in England, even of the meanest, which are not as good or better, than the best of them all. We could give a more perfect relation of this particular: but because this serveth little to our purpose, and properly doth not concern the Naturall History, wee have thought it best to touch it but briefly.</p>

                  <p>THe Havens of <hi>Ireland</hi> are so many in number, and for the most part so fair and large, that in this particular hardly any land in the whole World may be compared with this, as will easily appear by the particular rehearsall thereof, which we are now to make, first of the best and chiefest in this Chapter, and of the others in the next. We shall begin with Waterford Haven, the which being situated on the confines of Leinster and Munster, runneth some seven or eight miles into the land, not winding or crooked, nor with any great nookes or inlets, but almost in a straight line, (extending in it self North and North by West) and in most parts of an equall breadth, all the way deep and clear, having no roks or sands, but onely two or three little ones, which lying not across nor in the midst, but by the sides,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44031:14"/>
may be shunned very easily. Without the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it is eleven and twelve fathoms deep, in the mouth seven and more, inwards six fathoms. Within the Easterly corner is a good road, in four or five fathoms; and on the other or Westerly side, five or six miles from the mouth, is another good road, very commodious as well for them who goe forth, as those that will sail upward to Waterford. Upon the East-side, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout halfe-way the length, lyeth a very strong Castle called Duncannon, which so commandeth this Harbour, as no ships can go up or down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of those in the Fort, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning extreme hazard.</p>
                  <p>This Haven in the end divideth it self into two armes, both a great deal inferiour to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall harbour in breath and depth, but yet such as are capable of ships of a good big port, especially the left, which runneth Westward to the City of Waterford, whereof this whole Haven beareth the Name, being situated some four or five miles from that division, and a little below the place where the river Shure falleth into this Harbour. The right arm being the mouth of the river Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and extending it self straight along, goeth up to Ross, (a Town in former times famous for trade) the which is much about the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from this division, as the division is from the mouth of the Harbour.</p>

                  <p>On the whole coast of Leinster there is not one fair large Harbour, so as the next good Haven from Waterford Northwards is that of Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; which two Harbours, in sayling straight
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44031:15"/>
along the coast, are above an hundred mils distant.</p>
                  <p>This Haven is some three or four miles long, and nigh of the same breath, being every where very deep, so as the biggest ships may come there to an anchor; and so environed with high land and mountaines on all sides, that the ships doe lie defended off all winds; so that this would bee one of the best havens of the world, if it were not for the difficultie and the danger of the entrance, the mouth being full of rocks, both blind ones and others, betwixt which the passages are very narrow: whereby it commeth that this Harbour is very little frequented by any great ships, the rather because there is no trafick at all, nor any good Town seated on this Haven. For the Town of Carlingford, whose name it beareth, is a very poor place, hardly worth the speaking of. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight miles from the mouth of the Harbour is the Nurie, a fine little Town, untill in this late bloody rebellion it was for the greatest part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by the Irish: by which Town passeth a little river, called the Nurie-water, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it self into the Harbour some four or five miles below the Nurie, is not portable but of very little barkes and boats, and that onely when the Tide is in.</p>

                  <p>About thirtie miles Northwards from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford-haven is the Haven of Strang-ford, the which in its entrance is almost as much encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with rocks of both kinds, as that of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford. It is some five or six miles long, and beareth North-westward, being the mouth of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44031:15"/>
a great Lough, called Loch Cone; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two or three miles broad in the most places, but some fifteen or sixteen long, doth ebb &amp; flow untill the utmost ends of it: so that there goeth a very strong tide in this Harbour, which makes the same the unsafer, especially in great stormes and high winds, for which there is no great defence here. On this Haven, and on the neighbouring Lough, there lyeth never a good Town, Strangford beeing more inconsiderable yet than Carlingford.</p>
                  <p>The next great Harbour upon this coast, and about twenty miles more to the North, is that of Knocfergus, being a great wide Bay, the which in its mouth, betwixt the Southern &amp; the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern point, is no less than ten or twelve miles broad, growing narrower by degrees, the farther it goeth into the land, the which it doth for the space of fifteen miles, as far as to the Town of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, where a little river called Lagon (not port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but of small boates) falleth into this Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. In this Bay is a reasonable good Road before the Town of Knockfergus (seated about nine miles within the land,) where it is good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring in three fathoms, and three and a halfe. On the North side of the Bay, somewhat neer the Sea, under a Castle called Mouse-hill, is a sand-bay, where it is good anchoring for all sorts of ships, aswell great as small ones, for the North and North-west winds: but bad riding for the South-west.</p>

                  <p>The three fore-mentioned Havens of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, Strangford, Knockfergus, are all in the Province of Vlster, on the East-side thereof. The said Province hath also three good Havens on its Northern coast, not very far distant the one from the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Sheep haven, Lough Suillie, and Lough foile. Every one of these is a Lough (which the very name of the second and third sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifieth) opening it self into the sea: of the which Sheeps haven and Lough Suillie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee fair large Harbours, as well as Lough foile, and that Ships may ride there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended off all winds, Lough Suillie beeing also of sufficient bigness to contain a thousand great vessels, yet are they very litle frequented, because there is not any trade nor trafick, nor any good town placed upon or neer them.</p>
                  <p>Lough foile is of a great bignes, at least twelve miles long, and in most places five or six miles broad, beeing almost every where of an equall breadth, except at the two ends, where it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth narrow, beeing of an Ovall figure. For at the mouth, betwixt Magilions point and Greencastle, it is hardly a mile and a half broad: and at the other end it is much narrower yet, running from thence with a long arm some miles into the countrie, beeing liker to a broad River, than to a Lough. Vpon this Arm, three or four miles from the great Lough, is the town of London-derrie, in a place where that Arm turneth and windeth it self in that manner, as it environeth the town on three sides. It is nothing big, consisting only of two long streets, the which cut one nother
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44031:16"/>
cross-wayes in the midst; but it is very handsome, the streets beeing broad and well paved, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses some stories high, &amp; built for the most of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, with a handsome Church, Market place, and Key: and is inclosed with a thick and very strong stone wall, being one of the principall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses of Ireland. It is but few yeares old, having been built up from the ground by a company of London Adventurers under the reign of King <hi>Iames.</hi> Before the mouth of this Lough lyeth a great sand, called the Touns (upon which it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth greatly, when the wind bloweth from the sea) but so as a fair broad and deep channell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth betwixt the said Sand and the West-side of the land, where there is at all times fourteen and fifteen fathoms of water, as in the mouth it self some eight or ten. Entring into the Lough, there are very great Sands on the left hand, from the one end to the other, which are some miles broad from off the land; and of the right hand are some little sands or shelves here, lying close to the land. Betwixt these runneth a broad channell in most parts three and four fathoms deep: and in that Arm, whereon London-derry standeth, it is deeper yet, in some places no less than ten or twelve, and before the Town four and five fathoms: so as this is one of the best and most commodious harbours of all the Land.</p>

                  <p>The Country of Tirconnell, the which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up the whole West-side of the Province of Ulster, runneth a great way into the Sea with its Southern part, on the South side of which Foreland there are two very Fair Havens, the one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44031:17"/>
not far from the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Kilbeg and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall-haven. Kilbeg is a fair round Bay, where the greatest ships that goe upon the seas, may at all times with their full lading enter and come to an anchor; being distant about twelve miles from Cape de Tellin, the outmost or most We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern point of that forenamed Foreland of Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connell. The entrance is very narrow, so as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them who are comming to it, there seemeth to be no opening there, untill they are very neer, but it is very clean, as well in the mouth, as in the Bay it self, and nothing that can hurt the ships either comming in or going forth, beeing entred, one may anchor where one will, in five, six, seven, eight fathomes, or more.</p>
                  <p>Three or four miles to the South from Kilbeg is a Cape, called St. Iohns point, and six or seaven miles Eastward from the said Cape is Dungal-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wide and deep enough, but in the entrance greatly incumbred with shelves, sands, &amp; rocks, so as great care &amp; circumspection is requisit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or goe forth safely. These two Havens have their names of villages seated on them, which are very small and no wayes considerable.</p>

all winds; although it be rather a Sound, than an inclosed Harbour: for the ships which are come into it, need not to goe forth the same way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but sailing on betwixt the Main and the Iland, may at the South end of the Ile come again to the open sea. These Havens are nothing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, beeing very seldome resorted unto by any great ships, except such as by tempests and foul weather, or some other accident, are necessitated to shelter themselves in the same.</p>
                  <p>But the famousest Port of this Province is that of Galloway, beeing a very great Bay, some miles broad, and many more long, having in the mouth three Iland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, (named the Iles of Aran) the which lye North and South by the side one of the other, there remaining three chanels for to come out of the sea into this Bay. One chanel runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Land and the Northern Iland, called therefore North-sound: the second between the the same Northern Iland and the middlemost; which channel, beeing the most usuall of the three, is commonly stiled St Gregories sound: and the third between the Southernmost Iland and the main, named South sound: the channel betwixt the Southern and the middlemost Iland not beeing passable by reason of the sands and shelves, wherefore the name of False-sound hath been given to it.</p>
                  <p>The whole North-side of this Bay is very foul with sands and rocks, so as one may not approach the shoar in a great way: at the end of which sand, and in the innermost part of the Bay, lyeth a litle Iland, called in English Mutton-Iland, and by the Irish Enis Kerrigh, which hath the same signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; at the East side whereof one may anchor

in five or six fathomes of water; but from thence Northwards untill the citty of Galloway, which is the space of two or three miles, none but litle vessels and barks can goe, the Citie standing not on the Bay itself, but on a broad water like a river, the which not farre above Galloway comming out of a great Lake, called Lough Corbes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it self into the Bay a litle above Mutton Ile.</p>

                  <p>The next great Haven on the West side of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the South of Galloway, is that of Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick, which Haven divideth the Province of Connaught from Munster, beeing of a huge length, no less than fifty miles: for so far it is from the mouth of the haven untill the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Limmerick, to whose walls great vessels may goe up, without meeting with any thing els in all that way, save a many little Iles, but not any f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At the other side of this Fore-land, and to the North-east from the Blaskes, is a fair and very large Bay called Dingle-bay, the which goeth very many miles into the land, having in it divers good Havens, one whereof, called Ventry, is four or five miles from the Sound of Blaskes East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and three or four miles further is Dingle-Icoush, before the mouth of which Harbour, and at the West-side of it, lyeth a rock, called the Crow, round about the which one may sail without danger, it being alwayes above water, but at spring tides, at which time the Sea doth overflow it.</p>

                  <p>Against the South-east corner of Dingle-bay lyeth a great Iland, called Valentia, betwixt which and the Main is a very fair and safe Road.

                  <p>Maire hath in the mouth some fifty or five-and-forty fathomes of water; entring in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there be six and twenty, twenty, and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; afterwards you come to ten, and to six, and in the innermost parts to three and two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomes; beeing throughout very clean, and free

In this Bay is Crook-haven, School-haven, and severall other great Havens, not only on the main land, but also in some of the Ilands, whereof there is a great number in this Bay. The most Easterly of all these Ilands is Baltimore, the which surpassing all the others in bigness, giveth its name unto the Bay.</p>

It is five and six fathoms deep on the sides, &amp; six and 7. in the midst. In the mouth of the Harbour, next to the East-side, lyeth a blind Rock; &amp; in the midst of it another Rock, which appeareth at low water. There is nothing els that can do hurt.

                  <p>The Haven of Kinsale is one of the famousest of all Ireland; ships may sail into it, keeping in the midst of the channell, without any danger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without or in the mouth of the Harbour, except a blind Rock close to the East point. Within the haven, on the West-side, lyeth a great shelf, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shooteth a great way off from the land, but leaving a very large passage along by the side of it, in which, as in all the rest of the Harbour, it is many fathomes deep. This Haven for some miles goeth in North-North-East, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turneth West-ward untill the Kay of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale, where ships may ride in eight or nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of water, being defended off all Winds.</p>
                  <p>Ten or twelve miles to the East of Kinsale is Cork-haven, the which goeth in North-North-East, being within large and wide, running a great way into the land: for the town of Cork, untill whose Kay this Haven is very clean and deep, is seated many miles from the Sea, and from the mouth of the Harbour.</p>

                  <p>AFter the description of the principal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of Ireland, we shall come to them of less moment, in which number we put all those, which either in their entrance, or within, have not water enough for the bigher sort of vessels; as likewise those, the which being deep enough, are but very little, and of a small pourprise; and in this description we shall observe the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as in the former, beginning with Wexford, and so going North-ward, then West, afterwards South-ward, and lastly East and North-East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, untill wee have gone about the whole Iland.</p>
                  <p>The Haven of Wexford runneth in West, and by North, and with her innermost part altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Northward. Just before this Haven lye two great shelves of Sands by the side one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which that on the South-side is called Hanemans-path, and the other North-grounds. There goeth a chanel betwixt Hanemans-path and the land on the South-side of the Haven, and another betwixt the North-side and the North-grounds; but this last hath but six feet of water at full flood, and in the other eight feet with the flood of ordinary tides, and ten at spring-tides. The chief chanel is that which goeth in betwixt the two Sands, being four and five fathom deep. Besides these Sands there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44031:21"/>
Shelf in the mouth of the Harbour it self; which kind of sandy-banks lying across in the mouth of Harbours and Rivers, are usually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bars</hi>; and the Havens which have them, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-havens</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With a high flood there is about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet of water.

With an ordinary tide you cannot go to the Key of Dublin with a Ship that draws five feet of water, but with a spring-tide you may go up with Ships that draw seven and eight feet. Those that go deeper cannot go nearer Dublin than the Rings-end, a place three miles distant from the Bar, and one from Dublin. This Haven almost all over falleth dry with the ebbe, as well below Rings-end as above it, so as you may go dry-foot round about the Ships which lye at an Anchor there, except in two
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44031:22"/>
places, one at the North-side, half way betwixt Dublin and the Bar, and the other at the South-side not far from it. In these two little Creeks (whereof the one is called the Pool of Clantarf, and the other Poolebeg) it never falleth dry, but the Ships which ride at an Anchor remain ever afloat; because at low water you have nine or ten feet of water there. This Haven, besides its shallownes, hath yet another great incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that the Ships have hardly any shelter there for any winds, not only such as come out of the sea, but also those which come off from the land, especially out of the South-west; so as with a great South-west storm the Ships run great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to be carried away from their Anchors, and driven into the sea; which more than once hath come to pass, and particularly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of November, <hi>Anno</hi> 1637, when in one night ten or twelve Barks had that misfortune befaln them, of the most part whereof never no news hath been heard since.</p>

                  <p>The Haven of Drogheda, or, as the word is pronounced in common use, Tredagh, is very troublesom to be got into, as having not only a Bar lying across before its mouth, over the which vessels cannot pass but at high water, but also very narrow in the mouth: This Haven not being an Arm or Bay of the sea, but onely a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which keepeth her own bigness untill the end, without receiving any notable enlargement of the sea about her mouth, as other Rivers use to do. Upon this Bar is as much water as upon that of Dublin; and the Ships which can pass
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44031:22"/>
the Bar, may go up to the Key of Tredagh; which Town is seated about two miles from the month of this River, which is called the Boine.</p>
                  <p>Sixteen miles to the North of Tredagh standeth Dundalk, where a wide open Bay (made by the giving back and retiring of the coast) growing narrow, and receiving a little River, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Dundalk is but a small Brook, maketh a kind of Haven, where never is much water, and with the ebbe may be passed over a foot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and because there is not any shelter for the windes comming from the sea, nor any usuall Trafique, this Road is very little fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A few miles on this side of Strongford, are the Havens of Dondrom and Arglas, the one not far from the other, both little, and not very deep, but safe: And a little way beyond the Northern point of the Bay of Knockfergus, is Oldfleet-haven, a Harbour of the same sort as those two last mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Port Belletree, six or seven miles to the West of Fair-foreland (the North-Easterliest point of Ireland) is as little as any of those three, less defended of the winds, and the ground sharp and foul.</p>
                  <p>Some miles further is the Haven of Colrain, called Band-haven, the which is nothing else but the mouth of the River Band, the which here falleth into the sea, keeping her own narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness untill the end, in the same manner as we said above of the Haven of Tredagh. This River
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44031:23"/>
passing through Lough Neaugh, the greatest Lake of all Ireland (the which receiving severall Rivers, hath no other out-let into the sea but the Band) carrieth a mighty deal of water, the which being inclosed in a narrow chanel, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it self into the sea with great violence: for which reason, and because of the narrowness of the mouth, this Haven is very hard to enter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving also but little depth, so as vessels which draw eight feet of water, must at least have three quarters of the flood before they can enter.</p>

                  <p>Upon the West coast of Ulster, about half way between Cape Tellin and Kilbeg, is Tellin-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a round Bay, with good sand ground, which will contain about thirty Ships: West, and South-West winds blow directly into it, but off all other winds one is there defended.</p>
                  <p>Two or three miles Eastwards from Kilbeg is Mackswins Bay, where a Ship may ride safe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cable and Anchor: but the entrance being every where beset with Rocks, it is dangerous to go into it.</p>
                  <p>Some miles to the South-West of Dungal-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is Balleshanon, being the mouth of that short River, by which Lough-Earn, one of the greatest Lakes of Ireland, dischargeth it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea; which River runneth just on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the two Provinces of Ulster and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, dividing the same; this having a Bar before it, by reason whereof no bigger vessels
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44031:23"/>
than of thirty or forty tuns can enter into it.</p>
                  <p>Slego and Endrigo are two little Harbours, situated near the one to the other, in the North part of Connaught, very much encumbred with Rocks and Sands in the entrance, but otherwise reasonably deep; for a Ship of two hundred Tunnes may come and ride before the Town of Slego.</p>
                  <p>About half way between Slego and Broad-haven is Moy, being the innermost of a great Bay, divided from the rest by a little Iland some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, the which lyeth cross in that manner, that onely one chanel remaineth, whereby to go out of the great Bay into the lesser, or the Haven, which chanel is twelve feet deep; but in the Haven it self, being nothing else but two little Creeks, divided asunder by some sands ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt them, it is about fifteen or sixteen feet deep; but in the little channel which passeth into the inmost creek, being nearest to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage Moy, there is but nine feet of water at full flood with an ordinary tide.</p>
                  <p>Some miles to the South-East of Sline-head, (a famous Cape in Connaught, and situated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half way the length of that Province) is Port Niffadoy, a reasonable good Harbour, but very dangerous to get into, the sea there round abouts being full of Rocks both blind ones and others.</p>

                  <p>About the middle way between Cork and Waterford is the Haven of Youghall, before the which lyeth a Bar, not to be passed but at high water.</p>
                  <p>Twelve miles Eastwards from Youghall, is Dungarvan, being a narrow Tide-haven, whose mouth is full of Rocks, many of which do not appear, and so more dangerous, and at low water it falleth dry, so as one must go into it at high flood, and pass amidst the Rocks.</p>

                  <p>To begin with those on the Main. From the point of Waterford to Carnarord, being the

In St Margarets bay, three miles from Carnarord it is good anckoring in five and six fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomes, sand ground. A litle further is the bay of Grenore, where you may anchor as neer the land as you will, in six, five, four, or three fathomes.</p>
                  <p>Some miles from Wexford to the point of Glasearick, from which place to the bay of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, being about fifty miles, the coast is full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, where it is very good anchoring, in good sand ground, especially to the North of Arkloe-head (in a fair sand bay every where in eight, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or five fathomes) and between Arkloe and Missen-head, being the space of six or seaven miles.</p>
                  <p>In the mouth of the Bay of Dublin, at this side of the Bar, is good anchoring, as well on the South side, before the Village Dalkee (which place is known by the name of Berton Road) as on the North-side, round about that great Cape, named the Head of Houth.</p>
                  <p>Between Strangford-haven and the Bay of Knockfergus are divers good Anchoring-places; but all that Coast is very foul with Rocks, and blind Rocks.

                  <p>In the Sound of Blaskets it is good Anchoring on the South-side of the point for Northern and Western, and on the North-side for the contrary windes.</p>

On the East-side of the lesser Iland is a good Road to come to an anchor in seven or eight fathoms, where ships may ride in safety for South-West, West, and North-West winds: and on the North-West-side of the bigger Iland ships may anchor in seven, eight, or nine fathoms, the Road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defended off South-South-East, and East-South-East winds. Close by the South point of Dublin-bay lyeth a small Iland, called Dalkee, betwixt which and the Main land pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a Sound seven, eight, and nine fathoms deep, in which you may anchor under the Iland.

This kind of Strand is in most parts of Fingall (being a portion of the Countie of Dublin Northwards towards Tredagh, and a good way beyond that, and els where. In other places ly no Downes or Sandy hills, nor any other heights, betwixt the Strand and the land, it being only defended from the overflowing of the Sea by an unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible rising<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>In other places the land is high and hilly on the sea-side; part whereof doth descend by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees towards the sea, having a Strand below; but elswhere the land is high and steep, being washed underneath by the deep sea, so as ships of a great burthen may sayl close by it; the which may be observed not onely in the Heads or Capes, the most part whereof are thus fashioned, but in many other places, &amp; in great extents of the coast. For as concerning the saying of <hi>Giraldus,</hi> that Ireland every where upon the coast is very low, <hi>Est per omnia sui latera a marináque littora terra valdè demissa,</hi> that is evidently repugnant to the truth. Some of these high Shoars are bare naked Rocks, covered with very little or no earth, so as scarce any thing groweth upon them but dry grass and heath; others are stony within, but have at the top a reasonable deep mould, and all over cloathed with good grass; some of them being so exceeding steep towards the Sea-side, that it is imposible for man or beast, being come to the further end, to go one step further, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling down and being lost. So as it hath happened, that cattle and sheep feeding in those places, when they were come to the top, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the grass, suddenly tumbled down, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head-long into the sea, or upon the hard sharp Rocks standing at the bottom.</p>

                  <p>The Heads or Capes of Ireland are in great number, and many of them very observable, to the great commodity of the Sea-faring men. In
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44031:27"/>
the South-Easterliest point of Ireland is the Cape of Greenore, five or six miles to the South of the Bay of Wexford, being not very high, but steep, and flat at the top: and three or four miles to the South-West from it is the point of Carnarord.</p>
                  <p>Betwixt Wexford and Dublin there bee five Heads: That of Glascarick, which the Dutch Mariners call the Blew-point, and the Steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, twelve miles to the North of the Bay of Wexford, being of no great height. That of Glaskermen or Arklo being we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>-near at the same distance from the Head of Glascarick, as that is from the Bar of Wexford. Missan head, some nine or ten miles further to the North. The Head of Wickloe, six miles beyond Missan-head, being steep and rocky, divided at the top into two little Hillocks. And the fifth and last of all, that of Bray, about fifteen miles beyond Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, and five or six miles to the South of the Bay of Dublin, being a great and high Cape, shooting a good way into the Sea, and so steep, that it is ten fathomes deep there close under the land.</p>
                  <p>On the North-side of Dublin-bay is the Head of Houth, a great high Mountain, three or four miles compass in the bottom, having the sea on all sides, except the West-side, where with a long narrow neck it is joyned to the land; which neck being low ground, one may from either side see the sea over it, so that afar off it seemeth as if it were an Iland. This Head may be seen a great way off at sea; for even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land one may very perfectly see it, not only upon the Key of Dublin, which is six miles
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44031:28"/>
from thence, but nine or ten miles further West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Upon all the coast from the Head of Houth to Dondrom, being the space of about threescore miles, is none considerable. But some miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Dondrom, and three or four miles at this side the Haven of Arglas, is St. Johns-point, a Head and Fore-land which shooteth a good way into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The next Head beyond St. Johns, is the point at the North-side of the Haven of Strangford, which the Dutch Mariners by a notable mistake call the point of Arglas.</p>
                  <p>All these Capes lye on the East-side of Ireland, whose utmost point Northward is the Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Fair-foreland.</p>

                  <p>About fifty miles to the West of Fair-foreland, and well near the middle of the North-coast, is the Head of Enyston, which with the land next adjoyning lyeth much more Northward, and runneth further out into the sea than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther land upon this coast, being of a great height, so as it may easily bee known by any that once have seen it.</p>
                  <p>Some forty miles more Westward beyond this Promontory lyeth the Cape which is known by the name of Horn-head, being a Hill with two hommocks at the top, in fashion somewhat like unto two horns, from whence it hath received its denomination.</p>

                  <p>Upon the West-side of the Irish coast are four principal Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Tellin-head, lying about thirty miles to the South-West of the Iles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, the which are situated over against the North-Westerlyest point of Ireland. Akil-head, some miles to the South of Broad-haven, being not on the Main, but in an Iland. Sline-head, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by the Sea-faring men is called Twelve-pence, because the land sheweth it self in twelve round hommocks, being situated well near in the middle of the West-coast: And Lupis-head, which is the Northern-point of the Haven of Limmerick.</p>
                  <p>As for the other Heads upon the same West-side, namely those three betwixt the Haven of Slego and Broad-haven, by the Irish Pilots call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Can-Moin, Can-Killaloy, and Can-Jores, (Can in Irish betokeneth a Head in all sorts of significations) Renilira and Clegan, between Akil-head, and Sline-head (which last the Irish call Can-Leme) Brain and Calew, situated to the South of the Bay of Galloway; and Can-Sanan, being the South-point of the Bay of Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick; those are less considerable.</p>

                  <p>Upon the South-West-side of Ireland, the principall Heads are Cape-Dorses (situated in an Iland of the same name, betwixt the two great Bays of Maire and Bantree) and Messan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, situated betwixt the Bayes of Bantree and Baltimore; being the same, in <hi>Camdens</hi> opinion, which <hi>Ptolomie</hi> calleth <hi>Notium,</hi> that is Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,

it being the most Southerly point of all Ireland.</p>
                  <p>Upon the South-East-side is the Head of Clare, standing in an Iland on the East-side of the Bay of Baltimore; and a great way from thence, the old Head of Kinsale, called Cape Velho by the Dutch Mariners; which Head, to those that come sayling along the land afar off, seemeth to be an Iland, being a point which shooteth a great way into the sea, whose utmost, or most Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end is very high and steep.</p>
                  <p>Upon the same side standeth the Head of Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, which runneth a great way into the sea from the land on both sides, and because of its height may be seen many miles off.</p>

                  <p>THe Sea which invironeth Ireland, is as free from Shelves, Sands, or Grounds, as any in all the world, not alone upon the other sides, where the same is wide and open, far distant from all other lands, but upon the East-side, where the same is inclosed betwixt Ireland and Great-Britain, in which whole space it hath not any other Sands than those situated along the coast between Dublin and Wexford. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are of a huge extent, but not turning and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44031:29"/>
winding as most part of the Grounds in other places, but in a streight line, North-North-East, &amp; South-South-West, being farthest from the land with their North-end; and as they go South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so they do come nearer to the land; and near the Tuskar, a Rock right against the point of Greenore, in which place they end, they are not much more than two miles distant from the land; whereas the distance betwixt the North-end, near the Iland Dalkee (which Iland, as before we have shewed, lyeth at the entrance of Dublin-bay, about threescore miles from the Tuskar) is above eight miles. They are all of a Stoney-ground, in some places but one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep, and a fathom and a half; but in the North-end two fathoms and a half, and three fathoms.</p>
                  <p>Betwixt these Grounds and the land lye two or three little Sands, besides those which lye in, and before the mouth of the Bay of Wexford: one betwixt the South-end and Greenore; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to the South of the Head of Glascarick, a good mile from the land, called Rush and Ram; and a third one mile to the South of Arcklo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, called Glaskermen, somewhat more than half a mile from the land, and about two miles long.</p>

                  <p>The Chanel betwixt the great Grounds and the land is very deep all over, so that the biggest vessels may pass through it from Dublin to Wexford, and from Wexford to Dublin, taking care only that they doe not come too neer the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44031:30"/>
Grounds, the which being very steep on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side (as they are also without, or on the East-side, where ships may not come neerer to them than in 24. and 25. fathoms, because that in twenty fathomes one is close by them) it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite not to goe further off from the land, than in seven or eight fathoms, in which depth ships may within a cabels length sail all along the coast, the which here every where is very clean, and free from all danger. And even between the land and the forenamed small Grounds, Glaskermen and Rush and Ram, the Sea is very clean and deep, so as most ships doe passe betwixt them and the land, and not about by the out side of them.</p>
                  <p>These Sands in four severall places are cut tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with fair broad and deep chanells, whereof the one is over against the Bay of Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; the other against Glascarick, beeing no less than fifteen or sixteen fathoms deep; the third right against Arckloe, in which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel it is about seven or eight fathoms deep; and the fourth is directly against Wickloe.</p>

                  <p>There are some blind Rock in this Sea, but lye for the most part close under the land, or neer some of the litle Ilands or high Rocks, so as they may easily be shunned, the rather, because most of them doe at low water appear either in part or altogether. To speak a litle of these in order: the Saltees, two litle Ilands situated half way between the Haven of Waterford and and the head of Carnarord of the which hath
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44031:30"/>
been spoken heretofore) have both at the North-side some blind Rocks; whereof those which ly neer the bigger and Southermost Iland, fall dry at low water. About three miles to the South of the same bigger Iland lyeth a blind Rock called Kinmore, of the bignes of a ship, at half ebbe it cometh above water, and is so steep, that with the side of a ship one may ly close against it, and have fourteen fathomes of water, so as without any danger one may sail very close by it. To the South-East of the fore named big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Iland doe also lye some blind Rocks, called the Frailes, the which may be seen at low water, and ships may passe through the midst of them. About half a mile from Blackrock (a noted Rock, whereof shall be spoken anon) lyeth a blind Rock, called the Barrell, of the which one must take heed very carefully. A little to the West of Carnarord lyeth a small Rocky foul, close under the land. Betwixt Carnarord and St Margarets Bay it is foul and Rocky, but the foul grounds doe not reach far into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>South-South-East from St Margarets Bay lyeth a blind Rock, called Caliogh, the which at low water falleth dry. From the point of Greenore a riffe of blind Rocks and Stones run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth almost the length of a mile into the Sea, the which at low water falleth dry a good way from the land. At the North-side of the Head of Arcklo lyeth a litle Stony row, the which is shunned very carefully by the ships, not daring to come neerer to it than in five fathoms of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>The like blind Rocks &amp; Rockie sands lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coast betwixt Tredagh and Dundalk, as also betwixt Dundalk and Carlingford, in both places close under the land: at both the points of the Havens of Carlingford &amp; Strangford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under St Iohns point, situated half way between those two Havens: on both sides of those two great Rocks, a litle way beyond Strangford Haven, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Southrock and Northrock: between the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Copland Iles and the land, at the South-point of the bay of Knockfergus: round about those great Rocks over against Oldfleet, called the nine maids: to the West of the little Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sheeps-Iland: betwixt Port Belletree and Skires Portrush, which Rocks are called the Chickens: half-way betwixt Lough-Suillie and Sheeps-Haven, a mile or two from the land, which Rocks the flood doth cover, but at ebbe they come above water; &amp; in severall other places upon the West-coast &amp; the South-coast the which it would be tedious all to particularise: wherfore we will conclude this rehearsall of the Blind Rocks with that which to the West of St Iohns point (a point situated three or four mile South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                  <p>There be also divers Rocks that alwayes stand above water, the which as they are dangerous in the dark night, and in misty weather, so at other times they are rather profitable than hurtful, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they serve the Sea-faring men for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and help them to discern the situation and distances of the coasts; wherefore also the most part of them have received peculiar and proper names. The principall of this whole number is the Tuskar, a great black smooth Rock, of fashion like unto a ship turned the upside downwards, but as big again, lying South-Eastwards from the point of Greenore the space of three miles. To the South West of the Tuskar a great way, and about a mile and a half from the bigger of the Saltees, is the Rock Kinbeg. To the North-East of the Saltees stand two Rocks not far the one from the other, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the one of its situation is called North-Rock, &amp; the Southermost The Tuns. To the East of these two, and about three miles from the point of Carnarord, lyeth Black-Rock, being clean of all sides, so as ships may freely sail round about it without any fear or danger.</p>
                  <p>A mile or two to the North of Lambry lyeth a great Rock called Rock Abill, about which ships may sail of all sides.</p>

                  <p>The common cause of the casting away of ships upon this sea, and upon the East-coast of Ireland, is this, that in the long dark Winter-nights

                  <p>What concerneth the Ebbing and Flowing in this sea, which invironeth Ireland: upon all the West-side it floweth against the land, and the Ebbe falleth back from it into the sea; the Flood from, and the Ebbe towards the West; for which reason very great Tides, as well of Ebbe as Flood go upon all this coast, not onely the open shoares, but in the bayes and inlets (even those which go a great way into the land, as the Haven of Limmerick) so as those, who have been at Galloway, do assure us, that it doth so mightily ebbe and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44031:34"/>
flow there, that at high-water great vessels may sayl over those Rocks, the which with the Ebbe come above water.</p>
                  <p>Upon the other side of Ireland it ebbeth and floweth along the land; for upon the North-side of Ireland the Ebbe and Flood falleth in the same manner as upon the West-side, flowing from, and ebbing towards the West. But upon the East-side, from Fair-Foreland unto Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, the Flood commeth from, and the Ebbe falleth to the North: As upon the rest of this East-side, to wit from Carlingford to Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rord, it floweth from the South, and ebbeth from the North. For although upon all this side the Flood runneth along the land, yet doth it not take its beginning from one and the same, but two contrary points; the which two floods comming the one out of the Main-sea in the North, and the other out of the Main-sea in the South, do meet and stop one another before the Haven of Carlingford.</p>
                  <p>From Tuskar and Carnarord as far as to the Head of Clare, being the whole South-East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast of Munster, the Flood falleth along the coast East-North-East, and the Ebbe West-South-West. But upon the rest of the coast of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, beyond the Head of Clare Westward, which coast lyeth West and by South, the Flood falleth East-ward, and the Ebbe to the West.</p>

                  <p>But it is much to be wondered, what the same do relate of the chanel, or entrance of the Haven of Wexford, to wit, that it ebbeth and floweth there three houres sooner than without in the open sea; so as when it is high water in the chanel of that Haven, and upon the bar of the same, the Flood doth still for half a Tide, or three hours after, strongly run by it to the North; whereby it cometh to pass that the end of Hane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans-path (a great Sand lying just before the Haven of VVexford) is cast up more and more to the North; and that the chanel which passeth by the North-side of that Sand, being the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Haven, is now more to the North than it hath been formerly. And as it floweth three houres longer in the open sea than upon the Bar and in the chanel of this Haven, in the like manner also, the Ebbe in the sea falleth to the South three houres after that it is low water in the same place, but not so strongly as the Flood.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44031:35"/>
Haven being nothing else but the mouth of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle River) the water is salt as well when the ebbe is at the lowest, as at the flowing and high-water: And that to the contrary in that Riveler, which at Arcklo dischargeth it self into the sea, the water keepeth its sweetness at all times (never receiving the mixture of any saltness) as well with the flood and high-water, as with the ebbe. But experience sheweth these things to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the truth; as also what he writeth of a Rock not far from Arcklo, at the one side wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he saith that it alwayes ebbeth, when it doth flow on the other; and to the contrary. Also that in Milford-haven (situated in the Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of Wales, in a manner over against Waterford) and upon the next coasts, it ebbeth and floweth at quite contrary times to what it doth at Dublin, and the coast thereabouts; so that it should begin to ebbe in Milford-haven, when in the Bay of Dublin it beginneth to flow, and to flow in Milford-haven when it beginneth to ebbe at Dublin: Which how untrue it is, all those can witnes, who having bin in both places, have had the curiosity to observe the times and houres, at what age of the Moon soever, wherein it doth begin to ebbe and to flow there.</p>

                  <p>As for the first, to wit Fountains and Springs, Ireland is very full of them every where, not only in the mountainous and hilly parts, but even in the flat and Champain countries: Which Springs for the most part are all of one and the same fashion, being like unto a small pit full of water up to the brim; at the lower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ide whereof the water doth run forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any noise or bubling. For that kind of Fountains which forcibly burst out of the side of a Rock, or spout their water on high, are very rarely to be found in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The water of these Well-springs is for the most part cool, clear, and pure; free from all strange smell and tast: in which properties nevertheless, and in the wholsomness of the water, the same differences are found, and for the same causes, as in other countries. For those which spring out of a gravelly or sandy ground are purer than those that spring out of earth or clay; those that rise out of a stony or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44031:36"/>
Rocky ground, cooler than any of the former; those that are exposed to the Sun, and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A few yeares since some Fountains have been discovered in Ireland, some of them not far from Dublin, and others in other parts, whose veines running through certain Minerals, and washing off the vertue of the same, yeeld a Medicinall water, apt to open the obstructions of mans body, and to cure other accidents thereof; which kind of Fountains are commonly called Spaes, a name borrowed of a certain village in the country of Liege, in which there is a Spring of that sort, absolutely the principallest, and the most effectuall of all those of the same kind, and therefore of very great renown in near and in far countries. Besides these Spaes there are also a great number of other Fountains throughout all the Land, called Holy-wels by the inhabitants, whose water not differing from that of other Wels, in smell, tast, or in any other sensible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, neverthelese is beleeved to be effectuall for the curing of severall diseases. But experience doth shew, that those vertues are not found in the Springs themselves, but onely in the vain imagination of the superstitious people; the which also having dedicated every one of those to some particular Saint, do expect the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vertue rather from the power of them, than from any naturall efficaciousness inherent in the water it self.</p>

                  <p>No country in the world is fuller of Brooks, than Ireland, where the same be numberless &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the parts of the land on all sides. They take their beginning three severall manner of waies. Some have their source of Fountains, the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> for the most part are very small, not only those who carry the water but of one spring (most of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are rather like unto a gutter, than a brook) but even those into which the water of severall fountains doth flow together. Others rise out of Bogs, the which besides their own universall wetness being full of springs, and by reason thereof gathering in them more water than they are able to drink in or contain, doe necessarily send out the same in convenient places, and so give a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning unto Rivelets and Brooks. The third sort take their beginning out of certain small Loughs, which brooks ordinarily are of a reasonable bignes, and farre surpasse the other two sorts; although there doe not want some, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this kind, which are very little. And there is very few of any of these kinds, who come to any notable bignes, as long as they continue to be solitary, and untill having received the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of severall other Brooks, doe thereby grow more considerable than they were in their first originall.</p>
                  <p>These Brooks, besids the great good they do the land in watering the same, &amp; besides the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity they afford of drenching the Cattle &amp; other Beasts; do also greatly serve the inhabitants for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother good use, to wit the grinding of their corn, wherunto the Windmils are very little used in Ireland, because they have the conveniency,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44031:38"/>
through the great number of Brooks, to erect watermills in every quarter where it is necessary: which bring a great profit to the owners, being kept and maintained with less cost and labour.</p>

                  <p>Of these dangerous Brooks there are two hard by Dublin, both running into the Haven some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a mile from the Citie, the one at the North-side thereof, a little below the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage Dromconran, which is seated upon the High-way from Dublin to Drogheda; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44031:39"/>
at the South-side, close by the Rings-end. This called Rafernam-water of the village by which it passeth two miles from the sea, and the same distance from Dublin, is far the worst of the two, as taking its beginning out of those great Mountains South-wards from Dublin, from whence after any great rain such abundance of water is descending to it, that the same, which at other times is of very little depth, groweth thereby so deep, and exceeding violent, that many persons have lost their lives therein; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others Mr. <hi>Iohn Vsher,</hi> Father to Sir <hi>William Vsher</hi> that now is, who was carryed by the current, no body being able to succour him, although many persons, and of his nearest friends, both afoot and horsback were by on both the sides. Since that time a stone bridge hath been built over that brook (as over Dromconran-water there hath been one from antient times) upon the way betwixt Dublin and Rings-end; which was hardly well accomplished, when the Brook in one of those furious risings quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered its chanel for a good way, so as it did not pass under the Bridge as before, but just before the foot of it, letting the same stand upon the dry land, and consequently making it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther useless: in which perverse course it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, untill perforce it was constrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to its old chanel, and to keep within the same. To go from Dublin to Rafernam, one passeth this River upon a woodden-bridge; the which although it be high and strong, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less hath severall times been quite broke, and carryed away through the violence of sudden floods; although at other times, and when that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44031:39"/>
Brook doth onely carry its ordinary water, a child of five yeares may easily and without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wade through it; and a tall man on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back riding underneath it, not being able to reach it; in the great floods the water many times riseth so high, as that it doth not onely touch, but floweth quite over the bridge.</p>

                  <p>The principallest of all is the Shanon, who taking his originall out of Lough-Allen, and in his course dividing the Province of Connaught from Leinster, and afterwards also from Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, passeth through two other great Loughs, to wit Lough-Ree, whereout she cometh just above Atlone (a mean Market-town, but adorned with a stately and strong Castle, the ordinary resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Presidents of Connaught) and Lough-Dergh, about half way betwixt Atlone and Limmerick, and a little below the said Town shee dischargeth her self again into another Lough, by far the biggest of all, the which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44031:40"/>
it self from Limmerick unto the sea, and above fifty miles long, it is held by the Irish as well as the English not for a Lough, but for the Shanon it self, and consequently called with that name; whereof hath been spoken in the second Chapter.</p>
                  <p>This River is wide and deep every where, so as she would be navigable in her whole length, not only with Boats of all sorts, but with reasonable big Ships, to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of them that inhabit near it, were it not for the impediment of a certain Rock, some six miles above Limmerick, the which standing across in the chanel, and the River with great violence falling down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards over it, all communication of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the upper and the lower parts of it is thereby absolutely hindred.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> Lord Wentworth, and afterwards Earl of Strafford, he that in in the beginning of this present Parliament was beheaded, having been Governour of Ireland many yeares, first in the quality of Lord Deputy, and afterwards of Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, had a design to take away that let, in causing of a new channel to be digged for a little way, whereby the River being made to alter her course, should have avoyded that Rock; and to that purpose sent certain skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men thither to view those parts, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to examine whether it were feasible, who made report that it might be done, and would not cost above seven or eight thousand pounds sterling, a sum not very considerable in comparison of the great profit which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44031:40"/>
afterwards would have been reaped from that work: Nevertheless it was never taken in hand, the intents of publick utility having been diverted and smothered by those of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit, as commonly it falleth out.</p>

                  <p>There are several other Rivers in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Connaught, but none of them is any waye comparable with the Shanon for length, bredth, or depth, and little to be said of them, but that the Suck, the which falleth into the Shanon a little way below Atlone, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallest of all.</p>
                  <p>The two chief Rivers of Munster are Sure and Broad-water, the City of Waterford be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing situated upon the first of those two, the which close by it dischargeth her self into that arm of the sea which is known by the name of Waterford-haven. The other passeth by Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and falleth into the sea by Youghall, where it maketh a Tide-haven. Next to those two is the River of Cork, and then that of Kinsale, the which is but of small moment, as also are the rest of the Rivers of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                  <p>In Leinster is the Nure or Oure, the Barrow, the Slane, the Liffie, and the Boine, besides some others of less moment.</p>
                  <p>The Oure and Barrow do mingle their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the Town of Ross, from whence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving past a little way together, they discharge themselves into the right arm of the Haven of Waterford, and so in a manner doe meet the

Sure, who falleth into the other arm: For which consideration these three Rivers were wont to be called the three Sisters, as <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> witnesseth. Both the Oure and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are portable many miles into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the Oure onely with little Boats, and with Cots (they call in Ireland Cots things like Boats, but very unshapely, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but square peeces of timber made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) but the Barrow with good big Boats.

                  <p>The Liffie is the Princess of the Irish-Rivers, not for her bigness (for not only the Shanon, but the Boine, Barrow, and severall others, do far surpass her therein) but because Dublin, the chief City of all Ireland, is seated upon her banks; a mile below which City, at a place called Rings-end, she loseth her self in a Bay of the Sea, which is called Dublin-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. With the help of the Flood, ships of fifty and threescore tuns can make a shift to come up to the Key of Dublin, but when the Tide is out, and at the lowest, the smallest boats find hardly water enough to go between Dublin and Rings-end, because the chanel being very broad there, the water spreadeth it self too much, and by reason thereof groweth very shallow. But in the City it self, where she is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed betwixt the Keys on both sides, and from the bridge of Dublin untill the bridge of Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manan, and a little further, being somewhat
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44031:41"/>
more than a mile (in which space she runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her own banks) great boates may goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her at any time. She would be navigable with boats some three or four miles further; but the Weres, made in her a little way above the bridge of Kilmanan, doe hinder that. This River ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her beginning in the mountaines lying to the South of Dublin, not above ten miles from it; but fetcheth such a compass (bending her coast first to the West, afterwards to the North, and lastly, for seven or eight miles, Eastward) that from her originall to her mouth is the space of no less than forty or fifty miles.</p>
                  <p>The Boine the River where-on Tredagh is seated, hath her beginning in Kings County, close by the originall of the Barrow, although the place where the Barrow falleth into the haven of Waterford, is above fourscore miles distant from the mouth of the Boine. This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is almost of an equall bigness in farre the greatest part of her course, and would be porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of good bigg boates very many miles into the land, if that were not hindred by the Weres.</p>

                  <p>The principall River in Vlster of those that fall directly into the Sea, is the Band, the which as in her mouth, she is incumbred with severall inconvenients, as wee have declared above in the third chapter, so she is portable but a few miles from the Sea, because of a certain Rock, the which running across the chanel from the one bank to the other, stoppeth all manner of passage, not only of bigger vessels and barks, but of the smallest boates, which dare not come
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44031:42"/>
neer the same Rock, because it being somewhat high, and the water from it falling downwards with great violence, it goeth for some space with a mighty current. This Rock or Cataract, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vulgarly the Salmon-leap (for a reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be declared) and the Fall, because of the falling down of the water, is not above four miles from the Sea, hindring all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the same and Lough Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augh, from the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> this Cataract is distant about three miles: whereas otherwise, if the passage of this River from the sea to the Lough were open, ships might by that meanes goe a great way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land, not only the whole length and breadth of Lough Neaugh (which every where is very deep, and navigable even for great ships) but even a good many miles farther (with good big boates) by meanes of some Rivers that fall into it, especially the Black-water, which is the principallest of them all. For the Band, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she giveth the name to the River going out of the Lough, is not comparable to the Black-water for breadth nor depth, beeing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a brook than a River, the which being very shallow at other times, doth rise so excessively upon the falling of much rain, that it is one of the most dangerous and terrible brookes of all Ireland, in the which therefore from time to time many men and horses have been drowned at the passing of it.</p>

                  <p>Besides that the navigable Rivers are but rare in Ireland, and that the most part of them are only portable of very small vessels and boats, not of any bigger ships or barks, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the former relation, there be very few rivers, who have not some impediment or other in them, whereby it commeth that they are not portable so farre, as otherwise they would be. These impediments are chiefly three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Cataracts, Weres, and Foards; whereof the last two doe only concern the lesser Rivers. The first, to wit the Cataracts, are incident to the greatest Rivers as well as to others, as may appear by what wee have said concerning them in the description of the Shanon and the Band; whereby also fully may be conceived the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44031:43"/>
manner and nature of the said Cataracts, so as it is needless here again to delineate them.</p>
                  <p>Such a Cataract or Fall there is found in the Liffie, seven miles from Dublin, and about a quarter of a mile above the village and Castle of Leslip, the description of which as holding it not improper for this place, wee shall here set down as it came to our hands from those who have observed it very exactly. The said River running there abouts along a narrow and deep valley, being hemmed in at both sides with high hils of a long continuance, hath a very Rockie chanel, and besides that the bottom is overspread in severall parts with great massie stones, there is in two or three places, at no great distance, a contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>all Rocky bulk reaching from one side to the other, leaving but one or two narrow passages, through which the stream runneth with a very strong current, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty noise, but the third and last bulk, like a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract hath the chanel close to it, a great deal lower (by far more than the other, at least by seven or eight feet) which is the cause that the stream doth not so much run swift here, or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with a current through narrow channels, as in the two first bulks, but as soon as it is got over the Rock it falleth steep down with great violence, the space of three or four paces in breadth; where as the remainder of the main chanel is altogether stopped by the said Rock. In winter and other very rainy seasons, when the water doth increase much, it passeth over all the said Rockes smoothly and without noise, where the same is exceding great, those times, when the Liffie runneth with a small streame.</p>

                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:44031:43"/>There is also a Cataract in a small tide Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the County of Cork in Munster, the which falleth into the innermost corner of the great bay Bantrie, and one in the Haven of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-shanon, which haven being in effect nothing els but the mouth of Lough-Earne, commonly is counted for a River, and called by the name of Trowis</p>

                  <p>Concerning the Foardes; it is to be observed, that not every where, where the high-wayes meet with great brooks or small Rivers, bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are found for to pass them, but that in very many places one is constrained to ride through the water it self, the which could not be done, if the Rivers kept themselves every where inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between their bancks; wherefore they are not only suffered in such places, to spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves abroad, but men help there to as much as they can, to make the water so much the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower and consequently the easier to be passed: whereby it commeth many times to pass, that a River which above and below the foard is deep enough to be portable of great boates, through the shallowness of the foards lying between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will bear none but of the very smallest; or where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the same would carry small boats is not portable at all; this in most places might easily be remedied, in raising of dikes or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall banks, where the naturall ones failing doe minister opportunitie unto the Rivers fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to spread themselves; and making bridges to pass over. Some Foards, do not greatly impair the chanel of the Rivers, but leave the same almost in her full depth, especially in the midst; but the same, as they are more incommodious for the traveller, so they are not very frequent, but in far less number than the others.</p>

These rows of stones doe not directly cross the River from the one side to the other, but doe go very much floaping, that the stream with less force may beat against them: and the same also doe stand but very little above the water, to the end that when the flouds come the water may find a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy passage over them, without which they would not be able to subsist against the force thereof, but easily be thrown down and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>Some Weres are set up, not so much for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of fish, as for Mils, and that the course of the water thereby being in part stopped in the main chanel, may be made to go into some little by-chanel, cut expresly for to conveigh the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>This sort of Loughs are found in severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the other Provinces, but nothing near so many as in Ulster.

                  <p>Many of these little Loughs have a little lland in the midst, which is both commodious and pleasant. Some wherein little llands doe float, not keeping long any certain place, but remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to and fro as the force of the wind doth drive them.</p>

And it would be no great error to take all those Loughs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that happeneth, (viz. Lough Cone, in the County of Down; Lough-Foile, in the County of Colrain; Lough-suille, in Tirconnell; and the Lough of Cork) rather for Inlets of the Sea than for Lakes, although the Inhabitants hold them all to be Loughs, and give them the name of Loughs: And in this number is also to be put that great Lough betwixt Limmerick and the sea, through which the Shanon dischargeth it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea; of the which we have already spoke once or twice heretofore.</p>

                  <p>Most of these great Loughs are very full of little Ilands, and above all Lough-Earne, in which the same are numberless. In Lough-Cone also there is so great a number, that those who inhabit about it, affirm them to bee two hundred and threescore. Lough-Ree, and Lough-Dirg are likewise very full of them: And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44031:46"/>
there is also a good many in Lough-Fingarrow, Lough-Larne, and Suille. But Lough-Foile is very free from them, and in the Lough of Cork there is not above one or two, as likewise in Lough-Neaugh, in which they lye near to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ides, leaving the midst altogether free.</p>
                  <p>Very few of these Ilands are inhabited or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the most part being plentifully cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very sweet Grass, serve for pastures to sheep and other cattle, the which doe thrive wonderfully well in them, and the same befalleth also in the middle sort of Loughs, amongst which likewise there be very few that have not some of these little Ilands in them.</p>
                  <p>In some few of these Ilands, especially of Lough-Earne and Lough-Ree, are some dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereunto persons who love solitariness were wont to retire themselves, and might live there with much contentment, as finding there not only privacy and quietness, with opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for studies and contemplations, but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides great delightfulness in the place it self, with variety of very sweet pastimes in fowling, fishing, planting, and gardening.

                  <p>One of these little Ilands situated in Lough-Dirg (one of the middle-sort of Loughs) hath been very famous, for the space of some ages, over almost all Christendome; because the world was made to beleeve, that there was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Purgatorie, into which whoso had the courage to goe, and remaine there the appointed time, did see and suffer very strange and terrible things: which perswasion having lasted untill our times, the matter hath been discovered with in these few yeares, and found to be a meer il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion. This discoverie was made during the goverment of Richard Boile, Earle of Cork, and Adam Lostus, Vicount of Elie, and Lord Chancellour of Ireland: which two being Lords Iustices of that Kingdome in the last yeares of King Iames, &amp; desirous to know the truth of the business, sent some persons of qualitie to the place, to inquire exactly into the truth of the whole matter. These did find, that that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and fearfull cave, descending down to the very Purgatorie and Hell, was nothing els but a little cell, digged or hewen out of the Rockie ground, without any windowes or holes, so as the doore beeing shut one could not see a jot within it; beeing of so little depth, that a tall man could but just stand upright in it, and of no greater capacity, than to contain six or seven persons. Now when that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son desirous to goe that Pilgrimage to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, was come into the Iland, the Friars,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44031:47"/>
some small number whereof made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant aboad there for that purpose, made him watch and fast excessively: whereby, and through the recounting of strange and horrible appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>antasmes, which he would meet withall in that subterranean pilgrimage, being well preepared, they did shut him up in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dark hole: and beeing drawn out again from thence after some houres, altogether astonished and in a maze, he would be a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came again to himself; and afterwards the poor man would tell wonderfull stories, as if in very deed he had gone a great way under the ground, and seen and suffered all those things, which his weak imagination, altogether corrupted by the concurrence and sequel of so many causes to weaken the braine, did figure unto him.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this delusion in future times, the said Lords Iustices caused the Friars to depart from thence, their dwelling quite to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and the hole or cell to be broke open, and altogether exposed to the open aire, in which state it hath lyen ever since: whereby that Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to Purgatory is quite come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and never hath bin undertaken since by any.</p>
                  <p>To beget the greater reputation to this sicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Purgatory, the people was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that St Patrick, by whome the Irish were converted to the Christian-faith about four hundred yeares after the nativity of Christ, had caused the same, and obtained it of God by his prayers, to convince the unbeleevers of of the immortality of the soul, and of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44031:48"/>
which after this life are prepared for the wicked persons; wherefore also they gave it the name of St Patricks Purgatorie. But it is very certain, that nothing of it was known in Ireland during the life of that holy person, nor in a huge while after, it having been devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some Ages after his death, when that the general darkness of the times ministred a great opportunity of such like inventions, to those kind of men that knew how to abuse the blind devotion of ignorant and superstitious people to their own profit and filthy lucre.</p>

                  <p>Before we make an end of this Chapter, we must say something of the wonderful proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which generally is ascribed to Lough-Neaugh, of turning Wood into Stone; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto some do adde, to double the wonder, that the Wood is turned not only into Stone, but into Iron; and that a branch or pole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stuck into the ground somewhere by the side, where it is not too deep, after a certain space of time one shall find that peece of the stick which stuck in the ground, turned into Iron, and the middle, as far as it was in the water, into Stone; the upper-end, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained above the water, keeping its former nature. But this part of the History I beleeve to be a Fable: For my Brother, who hath been several times in places not far distant from that Lough, and who of the English there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts inhabiting hath enquired this business with singular diligence, doth assure me, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44031:48"/>
he never could learn any such thing; but that the turning of Wood into Stone was by every one beleeved for certain, as having been tryed divers times by severall persons: saying more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to have understood of them, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath this vertue onely at the sides, and that not every where, but onely in some few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, especially about that part where the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Blackwater dischargeth her self into the Lough. He could never come to speak with any persons, who themselves had tryed this matter; but with severall, who affirmed, that to their knowledge it had certainly been done by others of their acquaintance. For further confirmation of this particular (which in it self is credible enough, seeing that in many parts of the world there are found waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that vertue) serveth, that here and there upon the borders of that Lough are found little stones of a pretty length, some of them round in their compass, others flat, or flattish, and some angulous, the which being looked on, as well near as from afar off, seem to be nothing else but Wood, and by every one are taken for such, untill one come to touch and handle them: for then by their coldness, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and weight, it appeareth that they are not Wood but Stone: Whereby it may probably be conjectured, that the same formerly having been Wood indeed, and so having kept their old shape and fashion, in length of time have been turned into a stony substance by the vertue of that water, wherinto they were fallen through the one accident or other.</p>

Fountain in the North-quarters of Ulster, the which in seven years space turneth into Stone the Wood cast into it: But seeing that no body now adayes knoweth of any such Well, and that with all my enquires I could never come to hear any news of it, I will beleeve, that <hi>Giraldus</hi> hath been mis-informed, and that they have told him that of a Well which was proper unto this Lough.</p>

are further to say upon this subject, wee think it necessary to forewarn our Reader, that we do use the word <hi>Hill</hi> in a narrower signification, than what is given to it in the ordinary use of speech. For whereas all, or most other Languages, both those which are now in vulgar use, and those which are only preserved in books, have two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall words for to signifie those observable heights which appear above the ground, calling the bigger sort by one name, and the lesser sort by another: The English language useth one and the same word for both, calling <hi>hils</hi> aswell the one as the other, without any other distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that sometimes the word <hi>small</hi> or <hi>great</hi> is added. Now because this word so indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used would cause some confusion in the matter we treat of, that hath made us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it to one of the sorts, and to call <hi>hils</hi> onely the lesser sort, called in Latin <hi>collis,</hi> in French <hi>colline,</hi> in Dutch <hi>heuvel,</hi> and in Irish <hi>knock.</hi> As for the other and bigger sort, whose name in the aforesayd four Languages is <hi>mons, mountain, berg, slew,</hi> we call them mountains: which word <hi>mountains,</hi> although it be good English, yet in common speech it is seldom made use of in that sense whereunto we apply it, but only to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Country wholly consisting of those great Hils, especially when the soyl thereof is lean and unfruitfull.</p>

                  <p>The difference betwixt Hils and Mountaines consisting in bigness, is of two sorts; for in the number of Mountains are counted not only those
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44031:50"/>
which lift up themselves very high into the air so as they may be seen many miles off, but also those, the which take up the more in length and breadth, what is wanting to them in height, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending slopinly by degrees.</p>
                  <p>The Mountainous parts of Ireland do for the most part consist of this second part of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, most of them in one quarter being much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the same height, so as sometimes one shall ride some houres together, through the Mountainous country, without meeting with any one Mountain that greatly excelleth in height above the rest: The which in particular may be observed in the Mountainous Country of the Fuse, betwixt Dundalk and Armagh; In that of Mourne, betwixt the Nurie and Dondrom (each of those two being above twelve miles long) In all that space which is betwixt Kelles, a walled-town in the County of Eastmeath, and Kilacollie, <hi>alias</hi> Bailiebor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, in the County of Cavan, vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten miles long, is almost nothing else but a continuance of hils of no great bigness, all very fruitfull land both Pasture and Arable. In the County of Westmeath, from Lough-Crevv to Lough-Sillon, and beyond it, as far as Ballaneach, vvhere M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>William Fleving</hi> had built a fair house and Farm ten yeares before the late detestable Massacre and bloody Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Irish. These hils are for the most part lovv and small, yet some of a good height and bigness; the ground lean, in many places very stony, in some rocky, not of any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Rock, but-by peecemeals here and there rising and appearing. Yet are these hils
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44031:50"/>
in severall places wet and moorish, aswell in the Rockie as other parts. These hills serve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for pasture of sheep. In the major part of the Mountainous country of Wickloe, the which beginning five miles to the South of Dublin, doth extend it self above fiftie miles in length; and in severall other parts.</p>
                  <p>It hath bin observed in many parts of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but chieflie in the county of Meath, and further North-ward, that upon the top of the great hills and mountaines, not onely at the side and foot of them, to this day the ground is uneven as if it had been plowed in former times. The inhabitants doe affirm, that their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being much given to tillage, contrarie to what they are now, used to turn all to plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Others say that it was done for want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, because the Champain was most every where beset and over spread with woods, which by degrees are destroyed by the warres. They say further, that in those times, in places where nothing now is to be seen, but great loggs of a vast extent, there were thick woods, which they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from hence, that now &amp; then trees are digged out there being for the most part some yards long, and some of a very great bignes and length.</p>

                  <p>As for those other mountains, the which with an excessive height rise up towards the Skies, they are not very common in Ireland; and yet some there be, which although not comparable with the Pyrenaei, lying between France and Spain, with the Alpes, which divide Italy from France and

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44031:51"/>
taken from the fashion and outward form of the land, commeth to be considered that which consisteth in the nature of the soil or ground; some parts of the countrie beeing fruitfull, and others barren.</p>
                  <p>The fertile soil is in some places a blackish earth, in others clay, and in many parts mixt of both together: as likewise there be sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the ground is mixt of earth and sand, sand and clay, gravell and clay, or earth; but the chalke-ground and red earth, which both are very plentifull and common in many parts of England, are no where to be found in Ireland.</p>
                  <p>These grounds differ among themselves in goodness and fatness, not only according to the different nature of the soil whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, but also according to the depth of the mold or uppermost good crust, &amp; the nature of the ground which lyeth next to it underneath: for the best and richest soil, if but half a foot or a foot deep, and if lying upon a stiffie clay or hard stone, is not so fertile, as a leaner soil of greater depth, and lying upon sand or gravell, through which the superfluous moisture may descend, and not standing still, as upon the clay or stone, make cold the roots of the grasse, of corn, and so hurt the whole.</p>
                  <p>There be indeed some countries in Ireland, where the ground underneath being nothing but stone, and the good mold upon it but very thin, it is nevertheless very fruitfull in corn, and bringeth sweet grass in great plenty, so as sheep &amp; other cattle do wonderful wel thrive there; which kind of land is very common in the County of Galloway, and in some other Counties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44031:52"/>
as also in sundry parts of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. But the reason thereof is in those parts, because the stone whereon the mould doth lye so thinly, is not Free-stone, or any such cold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, but Lime-stone, which doth so warm the ground, and giveth it so much strength, that what it wants in depth, is thereby largely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed.</p>

                  <p>Except in the case now by us declared, neither Corn nor Grass will grow kindly, where the ground, though otherwise good, is not deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as also where it hath a bad crust under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: From whence it commeth, that in many places, where the grass doth grow very thick and high, the same nevertheless is so unfit for the food of beasts, that cows and sheep will hardly touch it (especially if they have been kept in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pastures first) except that by extreme famine they be compelled thereto; and that by reason of the coarsness and sowerness of the grass, caused by the standing still of the water, the which through the unfitness of the neather crust, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a free passage downwards, maketh cold the good mold, and the crop and grass degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from its natural goodness.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason the land in many parts, where otherwise the soyl in it self would be fit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to produce good Wheat or Barley, will hardly bear any thing else but Oats, or Rye, and that none of the best: As in other parts, the fault is in the soyl it self, and by the leanness
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44031:52"/>
thereof it commeth, that nothing else but coarse grass, and the worst kinds of grains will grow there. And unto these causes may be joyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother yet, the overshaddowing of high and steep Mountains and Hills, whereby the sides thereof, and the lands lying close under them, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the free and seasonable access of the Sun-beams, and so wanting convenient warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, cannot afford to the things growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such good and well-concocted nourishment, as unto the producing of the best and richest sorts of grains and grass is requisite.</p>

                  <p>The aboundance and greatness of pastures in Ireland, doth appear by the numberless num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all sorts of cattle, especially of Kine and Sheep, wherewith this country in time of peace doth swarm on all sides, whereof in another place shall be spoken more at large: and the goodness of the same is hereby sufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, that all kind of cattle doth thrive here as well in Ireland, and give as good milk, butter, &amp; cheese (with good handling) as in any other country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44031:53"/>It is true, that the Irish kine, sheep, and horses, are of a very small size: but that that doth not come by reason of the nourishment and grass, but through other more hidden causes, may easily be demonstrated by the goodly beasts of the forenamed kind, that are brought thither out of England, the which not only in themselaes, but in all their breed, doe fully keep their first largenes and goodnes, without any the least diminution in any respect, so that before this last bloody rebellion the whole land, in all parts where the English did dwell, or had any thing to doe, was filled with as goodly beasts, both Cowes and Sheep, as any in England, Holland, or other the best coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Europe: the greatest part whereof hath been destroyed by those barbarians, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inhabitants of Ireland, who not content to have murthered or expelled their English neighbours (upon whom with an unheard of and treacherous cruelty they fell in the midst of a deep Peace, without any the least provocation) endeavoured quite to extinguish the memory of them, and of all the civility and good things by them introduced amongst that wild Nation; and consequently in most places they did not only demolish the houses built by the English, the Gardens and Enclosures made by them, the Orchards and Hedges by them planted, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed whole droves and flocks at once of English Cowes and Sheep, so as they were not able with all their unsatiable gluttony to devour the tenth part thereof, but let the rest lye rotting and stinking in the fields.</p>
                  <p>The goodness of the pastures in Ireland doth

further appear by this, that both Beef and Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton there, as well that of the small Irish, as that of the large English breed, in sweetness and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriness doth surpass the meat of England it self as (all those, who have tried that, must confess) although England in this particular doth surpass almost all the countries of the world.</p>

It is true, that as approved Authors assure us, in the Iland of Zealand, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the naturall richness of the ground is such, and so lasting, as it needeth not the succour of any artificial helps, but is very fruitfull, and aye preserveth its fertility, without putting the Husbandman to the labour and costs of dunging. That likewise there is some part in the Province of Munster in Ireland, where very credible person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> have assured me, of their own knowledge, that the land never needeth any dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so as the inhabitants thereof never trouble themselves to keep the dung of their beasts, but from time to time fling it into a River which runneth by them. But this happiness and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of soil as it is very rare over all the world, so in Ireland too, being confined to very narrow bounds, all the rest of the Kingdom is necessitated, for the ends aforesaid, to help and improve their Lands by dunging; the which they do severall manner of wayes.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Of Sheeps-dung.</head>
                  <p>The commonest sort of manuring the lands in Ireland, is that which is done with the dung of beasts, especially of Cows and Oxen, and also of Horses mixed with a great quantity of straw, and having lyen a long while to rot and incorporate well together: Whereof, as of a matter every where known and usuall, it is needless to speak further.</p>
                  <p>Onely thus much seemeth good to us not to pass over in silence, that if Sheep here, as in other countries, were housed and kept up in stables for any long time together, their excrements would make better dung, than that of any other four-footed creatures. For the land on which sheep have fed for two or three yeares together, or longer, is so greatly enriched thereby, that when it commeth to bee plowed, it bringeth a much fairer and plentifuller crop, than if from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it had been made Arable, and dunged after the ordinary manner. Wherefore also great Sheep-masters may set their land, where the sheep have been feeding some yeares together, as dear again by the Acre, than what at the first they could have got for it of any body.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore also it is an usuall thing in Ireland, as well as in England, to drive the sheep upon the Fallow, and to keep them there untill all the hearbs which may minister any food unto the Sheep be by them consumed; which doth the ground a great deal of good, and giveth it heart to bring afterwards the better increase. And the same also helpeth greatly for to make good grass grow upon the Arable, when the same is turned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44031:55"/>
into Pasture and Meddow; a thing ordinarily u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in sundry parts of Ireland, and many times necessary for to keep the lands in heart: For ground being plowed, and the Sheep driven thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as soon as any herbs grow upon it, they do not only consume the Thistles, and other useless herbs, but cause good grass to grow up in lieu thereof, and that speedily. For in all places where their dung lighteth, of the best and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sorts of grass do grow, and that within the first year, which otherwise would not have come in much longer time, and that nothing near so good generally.</p>

                  <p>There is a notable difference betwixt Sheeps-dung and that of other cattle, as in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and richness it self, so in the particular last mentioned by them. For that of Oxen and Cows is no wayes fit for dunging untill it is grown old, and hath lyen a soaking with straw a great while: Dayly experience shewing in Ireland, as in England and other countryes, that in those places of the pastures where the fresh Cow-dung falleth and remaineth, the grass the next year doth grow ranker and higher than in the rest of the same fields, but so sowre and unpleasing, that the beasts will not offer to touch it; so as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily you shall see these tufts of grass standing whole and undiminished in the midst of pastures, that every where else are eaten bare and to the very ground. The which as in part it may bee imputed to the quantity of the dung, the which being greater than the earth can well digest, and conveniently unite with it self, cannot be turned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44031:56"/>
into so good and sweet nourishment; so doth it also without doubt come in part through the very nature of the dung, the which of it self, and without a long preparation and alteration, is not so fit to nourish the ground, as that of sheep.</p>

                  <p>Pigeons-dung also is very convenient for the improvement of the ground; and I know some in Ireland, who having tryed that, have found a wonderfull deal of good in it, incomparably more than in that of any four-footed beasts, and of Sheep themselves. But the Pigeon-houses no where in Ireland being so big as to afford any considerable quantity, and never having heard of any body there who could dung more than an Acre or two with all the Pigeons-dung which had been gathering the space of a whole twelve-moneth, it cannot well be reckoned among the common sorts.</p>

                  <p>Besides the dung of Beasts there are usuall in Ireland, or were before this Rebellion, five or six other sorts for to Manure and Improve the ground, whereof some are as good as the dung consisting of the excrements of beasts, and others do far surpass it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One of these sorts is Ashes, and Mud another.</p>
                  <p>As for the first, I have understood of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had lived many years in Ireland, and all that while had exercised Husbandry, that they had used to gather all their Ashes of their hearths, bake-houses, and brew-houses, being Wood-ashes,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44031:56"/>
and to lay them of a heap somewhere in the open air, from whence at convenient times they would carry them upon their grounds, and there spread them in the same manner as other dung, but nothing near in so great a quantity; wherein they affirmed to have found as much and more good than in any dung of beasts.</p>
                  <p>And I know several other English, who living in Ireland, did use to take the scouring of their ditches, together with other Mud digged out of the Bogs, and having let it lye a good while a rotting in great heaps, did afterwards carry it upon their lands in lieu of dung: the which they found very good and usefull for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>These two sorts were never yet brought into common use, but onely practised by some few persons, especially that of the Ashes, although in other Countries they have been known long since; so as <hi>Pliny,</hi> who lived about fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, writeth in the ninth Chapter of the seventeenth Book of his Natural History, that in his time in that part of Italy which is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated between the Alpes and the River Po (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending those Countries which now are known by the names of Piemont and Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) Ashes were more used and commended for the manuring of the grounds, than the dung of beasts.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the burning of the Heath, and other dry herbs standing upon the ground, for to manure the land with the ashes thereof, that not properly belonging to this place, shall be spoke of more at large in some of the ensuing Chapters.</p>

                  <p>The English living in Queens-county in Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, having seen that in sundry parts of England and Wales, especially in Pembrookshire, Lime was used by the inhabitants for the manuring and inriching of their grounds, begun some years since to practise the same, and found themselves so well thereby, that in a short time the use thereof grew very common amongst them, so as many of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem ever after used no other kind of dung.</p>
                  <p>The manner of it was thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Having first plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their fields, they carryed the Lime on them, and layd it in many small heaps, leaving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient distance between, in the same manner as useth to be done with the dung of beasts; and having let them lye for some moneths, they plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land again to convey the Lime into the ground.</p>
                  <p>This made it so rich, that in a great while after nothing else needed to be done to it, but to let the land at a certain revolution of time lye Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, no other manuring at all being requisite for some yeares after: And all that while the land was very fruitfull, more than it could have been made with any ordinary dung, and very free of al sorts of bad herbs and weeds (especially for the first yeares) bringing Corn with much thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner huskes than that growing upon other lands.</p>
                  <p>They found that the Lime carryed upon the Land hot out of the Kiln, did more good in all the fore-mentioned particulars, than when they let it grow cold first. And this they could doe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44031:57"/>
very easily, because Lime-stone is very plentifull in that County, especially in the Town of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath, where there is a whole hill of that stone, of that bigness, that if all the adjacent Country did continually fetch it from thence for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named use, it would for ever hold out suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.</p>
                  <p>The Land thus manured and improved by Lime, shewed its fruitfulness not only in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing yeares, but even in the first, except the Lime had been layd on in undue proportion, and in greater quantity than was requisite; for in that case the Lime burnt the Corn, and the first years Crop was thereby spoyled.</p>
                  <p>In some places where the land was not cold and moyst enough to bee able to endure meer Lime, they mixed the Lime with earth digged out of pits, and let that stuff lye a mellowing in great heaps for some moneths together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carryed it on the land, and manured that therewith.</p>

other times they mingled dry lime with the corn, and afterwards besprinkled the whole heap with fair water through and through, for the same purpose, and hereby they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain the aforesaid end, of preserving the corn from the crowes, but had thereby a fairer and better crop, than ever before their land had produced.</p>

                  <p>MArle is a certain sort of fat and clayish stuff, being as the grease of the earth; it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44031:59"/>
hath from antient times on greatly used for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring of land both in France and England, as may appear out of <hi>Pliny</hi> in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Chapters of his seventeenth Book. The same also is stil very usual in sundry parts of England, being of an incomparable goodness: The which caused the English, who out of some of those places where Marle was used were come to live in Ireland, to make diligent search for it, and that with good success at last; it having been found out by them within these few years, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places; first in the Kings-county, not far from the Shanon, where being of a gray colour, it is digged out of the Bogs; And in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wexford, where the use of it was grown very common before this Rebellion, especially in the parts lying near the sea; where it stood them in very good steed, the land of it self being nothing fruitfull. For although the ground (for the most part) is a good black earth, yet the same being but one foot deep, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a crust of stiff yellow clay of half a foot, is thereby greatly impaired in its own goodness. In this depth of a foot and a half next under the clay, lyeth the Marle, the which reacheth so far downwards, that yet no where they are come to the bottom of it. It is of a blew colour, and very fat (which as in other ground, so in this, is chiefly perceived when it is wet) but brittle and dusty when it is dry.</p>

letting it lye several moneths ere they plow it again, that the Rain may equally divide and mixe it; the Sun, Moon, and Air mellow and incorporate it with the earth. One thousand Cart-loads of this goeth to one English Acre of ground; it being very chargeable, for even to those who dig it out of their own ground, so as they are at no other expences but the hire of the labourers, every Acre cometh to stand in three pounds sterling. But these great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences are sufficiently recompenced by the great fruitfulness which it causeth, being such, as may seem incredible; for the Marled-land, even the very first year, fully quitteth all the cost bestowed on it. There besides it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent once to Marle, whereas the ordinary dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be renewed oftentimes.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> The usage of the Marled-land, practised by them of the County of Wexford.</head>
                  <p>The good usage of the Marled-land, to keep it in heart for ever after, doth consist, in the opinion and practise of some, in letting it ly Fallow at convenient times, but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, commonly practised by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the County of Wexford, and counted the best by them, is, that having sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it five or six years together, with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sorts of Corn, to wit, Wheat and Barley (especially that sort which in some parts of England, and generally in Ireland, is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly called Bear, being a much richer Grain than the ordinary Barley) it being afterwards turned to Pasture, whereunto it is very fit,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44031:60"/>
forasmuch as it bringeth very sweet grass in great abundance: For the Marle is also used on Meddows at the first, with very good success, improving the same most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>If the Marled-land be thus used, and by turns kept under Corn, and Grass, it keeps its fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for ever; where to the contrary, if year after year it be sowed till the heart be drawn out, it's quite spoyled, so as afterwards it is not possible to bring it again to any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable condition by any kind of Dunging, or Marling. This would ordinarily be done in the space of ten yeares; for so long together the Marled-land may be sowed, and bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year a rich crop of the best Corn.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless this is not generall, but taketh place onely in the worser kind of ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where the land of it self is better and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there after Marling, Wheat and other Corn may be sowed, not only for ten yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but longer: For very credible persons have assured me, that some parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wexford having bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Province of Connaught (by what hath been discovered) is much more plentifull in Marle, than Leinster, as in other Counties, so in those of Roscoman, Slego, and Galloway, almost in every part of it. It is there of three
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44031:61"/>
several colours, some being white as chalk, other gray, and some black; but none blew, as that in the County of Wexford. It lyeth nothing deep under the upper-ground, or surface of the earth, commonly not above half a foot; but its own depth is so great, that never any body yet digged to the bottom of it.</p>
                  <p>The land which they intend to Marle in this Province, is commonly plowed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of May, and lying five or six weeks (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be sufficiently dryed and mellowed by the Sun and Wind) they harrow it, and then having brought the Marle upon it, five or six weeks after it is plowed again, and a third time about September: After which third plowing they sow it with Wheat or Barley, whereof they have a very rich crop the next year.</p>

                  <p>Land Marled in that manner as we have said, may be sowed ten or twelve yeares together; the first eight or nine-with Wheat, and Bear, or Barley, and the remaining three or four years with Oates, afterwards the land is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pasture, and having served some years in that kind, it may be Marled anew, and made as good for Corn as at the first.</p>
                  <p>For the observation of those of the County of Wexford, that land may not be Marled more than once, doth not take place in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, where it is an ordinary thing, having some space of years to make it again. I know
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44031:61"/>
some Gentlemen who have caused some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of land to be Marled thrice in the space of twenty yeares, and have found very good profit by it. But whether this be caused by the difference of the ground and Marle (appearing also hereby, that in Connaught they scarce lay the fourth part of the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Marle on the ground of what they doe in the County of Wexford) or by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness or want of experience of those of that County, I am not yet fully informed. But thus much is known as well in Connaught as other parts, that those who sow the Marled-land untill it can bear no more, and be quite out of heart, wil find it exceeding difficult, if not altogether impossible ever to amend or improve the same again by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>

                  <p>HAving spoke of the fruitfull lands of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it followeth that we treat of those which are neither fit for the bringing of Corn, or feeding of Cattle; some being such for want of good soyl, and others through super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moysture.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort are those places where the ground consisting of meer rock, sand, or earth,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44031:62"/>
naturally unfruitful hath no good mold at the top sufficient for Corn or Grass to root, and to draw convenient nourishment out of it, the ground being bare, or over-grown onely with Moss, Heath, Furze, Brakes, Thorns, Rushes, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The places whose ground is bare, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing frequent, nor of any great bigness in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and rather on the Sea-side than within the land. But the other are very common throughout the whole Kingdom, not only in the Mountains (many whereof do for the most part consist of nothing else) but also in the Hilly-quarters, the Plain-countries, and in many places of great extent, taking up some miles in length and breadth. Most of these Wasts in the Plain-countries and Valleys, as also some on the Mountains and Hils, are Moory and Boggy, fit for to dig Turf out, to the great commodity of the inhabitants, in places where other fuel is wanting. So that these parts of Land, although barren and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing no kind of thing for the food of man or beasts, may not be reckoned in the number of those which are altogether unprofitable, being of good use in the parts far distant from the Sea, where they can have no Sea-coales, and where Woods are wanting, nor well live. Some of these dry, or red Bogs, as commonly they are called (the first, in comparison of those whereof presently shall be spoken, the other, because the earth in them for the most part is reddish, and over-grown with Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44031:62"/>

                  <p>There are some dry Heaths in Ireland, for the most part on the mountains, and very few in the plain countries; to the contrary of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where, as well as in Netherland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and other countries, those Heaths on plain ground are very common in sundrie parts of the land, and many of them of a great extent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very many miles in compass; and where any such dry Heaths are in Ireland, the land for the most part is not altogether barren, but gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween and at the bottome of the heath; so as the heath being burnt (a thing much used in Ireland both by the English and Irish) the land bringeth reasonable good and sweet grass, fit for sheep to feed on; and with a little extraordinary labour and costs brought to bear corn.</p>
                  <p>Others of these Heaths are grassie, having the grass growing not all over among the heath, but in spaces by it self: as upon the Heath between the town of Kildare and the Liffie; which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous over all Ireland by the name of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogh of Kildare, being a hilly ground, at its highest neer the said town, from thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Liffie descending by degrees, about three miles long, and two or three broad, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into rowes, of heath and grass; which being of no great breadth, and many in number, doe ly by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The places barren through superfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, are bogs called by the Irish Moones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Ireland is full. There is three or four diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sorts of them; grassy, watery, muddy, and Hassocky, as appeareth more largely by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing description. But the English Irish have given the name of Bogs, not only to the wet, of which we are now to treat, but aswell to the turf moores of all sorts, not excepting the red bog, which in most places is firm enough to bear a man, or unshod nagge going over it, but is not for any great weight. But we shall in the following chapters speak in order of the four sorts of wet bggs, which above wee have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and afterwards in its due place treat of the turf and red moores, as occasion shall require.</p>

                  <p>The grassy Bogs are all over covered with grass, looking fair and pleasant, as if they were dry ground and goodly meadowes; whereby many, who not knowing the nature of those
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44031:63"/>
places, and because of the greeness suspecting no evill, goe into them to their great trouble, and many times to the extreme danger of their lives, for the earth being very spongy can bear no weight, but as well men as beast, assoon as they set foot on it doe sink to the ground, some knee deep, others to the wast, and many over head and ears: for all or most bogs in Ireland having underneath a hard and firm gravell are not of an equall depth, which in some is only of two or three feet, in others five, six or more, in somuch that those who fall into the deepest places of these bogs, can hardly escape, but for the most part doe perish, being pittifully smothered.</p>
                  <p>Some of these bogs, doe so dry up in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that they may be passed without danger; the which in particular falleth out in the great Mountaines in Munster in the county of Kerry, called Slew-Logher, upon which all kind of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doe grase the summer long being every where full of good and sweet grass, knee deep in most places; whereof not the tenth part being eaten (for if all the cattle of that Province were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thither and left all the summer upon the place it would hardly be consumed) the rest is spoyled when the wet weather cometh in, and stayeth the rain-water from descending; through which the ground rotteth in that manner, that all winter long it is unpassable for men and beasts.</p>
                  <p>But the deepest bogs are unpassable in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as well as in the winter, yet most of them have firm places, in narrow paths, &amp; in some lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger parcels; by the meanes whereof those, unto whom they are known, can cross them from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44031:64"/>
one side to another, where others who are not used to them doe not know in what part to set one step; in which nimble trick, called commonly treading of the Bogs, most Irish are very expert, as having been trained up in it from their infancy.</p>
                  <p>The firm places in passing, or but lightly shaking them, tremble for a great way, which hath given them the name of Shaking-Bogs; and where they are but of a small compass, Quagmires.</p>

                  <p>The Watery-bogs are likewise clothed with Grass, but the water doth not sink altogether into them, as into the former, but remaineth in part standing on the top (in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in some of the Grassie-bogs, and in all the low Pastures and Meddows of Holland) by reason whereof these Bogs are not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for every one at the first sight may easily discern them from the firm ground.</p>
                  <p>These two sorts are in many parts found apart, and in others mixt and interlaced; and likewise parcels both of the one and the other are found up and down in the Moory-heaths and Red-bogs.</p>
                  <p>Both these sorts, as well the watery as the Green-Bogs, yeeld for the most part very good Turf, much better than the Red-Bogs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more shall be spoken hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Miry-Bogs do consist of meer Mud and Mire, with very little or no grass upon them. These are commonly of a very small compass,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44031:64"/>

                  <p>Hassockie-bogs we call those, whose ground being miry and muddy is covered over with water a foot or two deep, in some places more, in others less; so as one would sooner take them for Loughs, were it not that they are very thick over-spread with little Tufts or Ilets, the which consisting of Reeds, Rushes, high sower Grass, and sometimes with little Shrubs, for the most part are very small, and have but a few feet in compass; some of them being of the bigness of a reasonable big cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. These little Ilets or Tufts being so many in number, and spread over all the Bog, there remaineth nothing between them but great Plashes of water (in regard whereof these Bogs might well be called Plashy-Bogs) in some places wider, in others narrower, so as from the one men may well step or leap to the other; that which those who are expert in it know how to do very nimble, and so to run from one part of the Bog to another: For the roots of the Rushes, Reeds, and other things grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on those Tufts, are so interwoven, that they can easily bear a man who lightly tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them, although they have very little earth, and are wondrous spungy; so as they, when the water being drained, the Bog is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round about, may easily be plucked from the ground.</p>
                  <p>The English inhabiting in Ireland have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44031:65"/>
given these Tufts the name of Hassocks, and this sort of Bogs, Hassocky-bogs: Of which Bogs Munster and other Provinces are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free, but most of them are found in Leinster, especially in Kings and Queens-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where also the othtr sorts of Bogs are very common; whereas otherwise Connaught is generally fuller of Bogs than any of the other Provinces.</p>

                  <p>VEry few of the Wet-bogs in Ireland are such by any naturall property, or primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive constitution, but through the superfluous moysture that in length of time hath been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered therein, whether it have its originall within the place it self, or be come thither from without. The first of these two cases taketh place in the most part of the Grassie-bogs, which ordinarily are occasioned by Springs; the which arising in great number out of some parcel of ground, and finding no issue, do by degrers soak through, and bring it to that rottenness and spunginess, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless is not a little increased through

the rain water comming to that of the Springs.</p>
                  <p>But the two other sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Waterie and Hassockie-bogs, are in some places caused by the rain-water onely, as in others through brooks and rivelets running into them, and in some through both together; whereunto many times also cometh the cause of the Grassi-bogs, to wit the store of Springs within the very ground: and all this in places, where or through the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of them, and by reason of their even plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or hollowness, or through some other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, the water hath no free passage away, but remaineth within them, and so by degrees turneth them into Bogs.</p>

                  <p>This being otherwise evident enough, may further be confirmed by the whole bodies of trees, which ordinarily are found by the turf-diggers very deep in the ground, as well of other trees, as of Hasels: likewise they meet sometimes with, the very Nuts themselves in great quantity, the which looking very fair and whole at the outside, as if they came but newly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>And it is worthie of observation, that trees, &amp; truncks of trees, are in this manner found not only in the Wet bogs, but even in the Heathy ones or Red bogs, as by name in that by the Shanon-side, wherof hath been spoken above: in which bog the turf diggers many times doe find whole Firr-trees deep in the ground; whether it be that those trees, being fallen, are by degrees sunk deeper and deeper (the earth of that Bog almost every where being very loose and spungy, as it is in all such Bogs) or that the earth in length of time bee grown over them.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44031:67"/>
deep grass, after the draining off the water, was very wonderfull; and all this without any other trouble or costs bestowed upon these Meddows, than that they dunged them the first year, to warm them the better, and the sooner, and more thoroughly to amend the remainders of that coldness and rawness contracted through that long and constant continuance of the water upon them; after which once dunging, afterwards for a good many yeares nothing else needed to be done to them.</p>

                  <p>This draining of the Bogs was performed in the manner following. On that side of the Bog, where the ground was somewhat sloaping, they cut a broad deep Trench, beginning it in the firm ground, and advancing it unto the entrance of the Bog, into which Trench the water would sink out of the next parts of the Bog in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and that many times so suddenly, as if a great sluce had been opened, so as the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were constrained to run out of it with all speed, lest the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some part of the Bog being by this meanes grown reasonable dry within a short space of time, opportunity thereby was ministred to advance the Trench further into the Bog; and so by little and little they went on with it untill at last they carryed it quite across the Bog, from the one side to the other: And having done this, they made a great many lesser Trenches out of the main one, on both sides of the same; the which bringing the water from all the parts of the Bog unto the main Trench, did
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44031:67"/>
in a little while empty the Bog of all its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moysture, and turn it into good and firm ground.</p>

                  <p>The Green or Grassie-bogs, the which having all their moysture and water inwardly, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wonderfully swelled and pust up, use by means of this draining to fall very much, and to grow a great deal lower, and that not only apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so that the ground which before the drayning was five or six feet high, commeth at last to be not above two or three feet high; but sometimes also suddenly, and within the space of four and twenty, or eight and forty houres; whereas or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily that useth to come to pass in greater length of time; and although the ground by falling in this manner, may seem thereby to have been subject to return to its former boggy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the least occasion; nevertheless there was no danger of that, as long as the Trenches were kept open, and thereby the passage kept free for the water, which from time to time would from all parts of the drayned Bog be sinking into them.

                  <p>AMongst the barren parts of Ireland the Woods must also be counted, according to the usuall division of the lands of that Kingdom, whereby reckoning for fruitfull onely the Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Arable-grounds, and Pastures, they count all the rest for barren, comprehending them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these three generall heads, Bogs, Barren-Mountains, and Woods. Which division as it is in the mouth of all them that have any insight into the matters of that Land, and do, or have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, so it is further confirmed by a number of Writings and Monuments, both of ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, and late ones, in the which it is very common and familiar: As for instance may appear by those several Acts, which since this last Rebellion of the Irish have been made by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England in the behalf of the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers who have layd out their monyes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquering of the revolted parts of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>For although the land which the Woods doe take up, is in it self very good in most places, and apt to bear both Corn and Grass plentifully (whereof more shall be sayd by and by) yet as long as the Woods remain standing, it is unfit not only to be made either Arable or Meddow (as in it self is most evident) but even for Pasture, by reason of the overmuch moysture, the roots of the trees staying the rain-water, so as it hath
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44031:68"/>
not the liberty to pass away readily, and their stems and branches hindering the free access of the Wind and Sun, whereunto cometh in many parts the grounds own wateriness, occasioned by Springs there arising, and by its situation apt for the gathering and keeping of water, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them for the most part so muddy and bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that cattle cannot conveniently feed in them.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Woods much diminished in Ireland since the first comming in of the English.</head>
                  <p>In antient times, and as long as the land was in the full possession of the Irish themselves, all Ireland was very full of Woods on every side, as evidently appeareth by the writings of <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> who came into Ireland upon the first Conquest, in the company of Henry the second, King of England, in the year of our Saviour a eleven hundred seventy and one. But the English having setled themselves in the land, did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees greatly diminish the Woods in all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they were masters, partly to deprive the Theeves and Rogues, who used to lurk in the Woods in great numbers, of their refuge and starting-holes, and partly to gain the greater scope of profitable lands. For the trees being cut down, the roots stubbed up, and the land used and tilled according to exigency, the Woods in most part of Ireland may be reduced not only to very good Pastures, but also to excellent Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Meddow.</p>
                  <p>Through these two causes it is come to pass in the space of many years, yea of some Ages, that a great part of the Woods, which the English
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44031:69"/>
found in Ireland at their first arrival there, are quite destroyed, so as nothing at all remaineth of them at this time.</p>

                  <p>And even since the subduing of the last great Rebellion of the Irish before this, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Earl of Tirone (overthrown in the last yeares of Queen Elizabeth by her Viceroy Sir Charles Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of Devonshire) and during this last Peace of about forty years (the longest that Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ever enjoyed, both before and since the comming in of the English) the remaining Woods have very much been diminished, and in sundry places quite destroyed, partly for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son last mentioned, and partly for the wood and timber it self, not for the ordinary uses of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and firing (the which ever having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, are not very considerable in regard of what now we speak of) but to make merchandise of, and for the making of Charcoal for the Iron-works. As for the first, I have not heard that great timber hath ever been used to be sent out of Ireland in any great quantity, nor in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of Traffick; but onely Pipe-staves, and the like, of which good store hath been used to be made, and sent out of the Land, even in former times, but never in that vast quantity, nor so constantly as of late years, and during the last Peace, wherein it was grown one of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merchandable commodities of the country, so as a mighty Trade was driven in them, and whole ship-loads sent into forrein countries
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44031:69"/>
yearly; which as it brought great profit to the proprietaries, so the felling of so many thousands of trees every year as were employed that way, did make a great destruction of the Woods in tract of time. As for the Charcoal, it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible what quantity thereof is consumed by one Iron-work in a year: and whereas there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Iron-work in Ireland before, there hath been a very great number of them erected since the last Peace in sundry parts of every Province; the which to furnish constantly with Charcoales, it was necessary from time to time to fell an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of trees, all the lopings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals being not sufficient for it in the least man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                  <p>Through the aforesayd causes Ireland hath been made so bare of Woods in many parts, that the inhabitants do not onely want wood for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (being therefore constrained to make shift with turf, or sea-coal, where they are not too far from the sea) but even timber for building, so as they are necessitated to fetch it a good way off, to their great charges, especially in places where it must be brought by land: And in some parts you many travell whole dayes long without seeing any woods or trees except a few about Gentlemens houses; as namely from Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and from places that are some miles further to the South of it, to Tredagh, Dundalk, the Nurie, and as far as Dremore; in which whole extent of land, being above threescore miles, one doth not come near any woods worth the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44031:70"/>
speaking of, and in some parts thereof you shall not see so much as one tree in many miles. For the great Woods which the Maps doe represent unto us upon the Mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Dundalk and the Nury, are quite vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, there being nothing left of them these many years since, but one only tree, standing close by the highway, at the very top of one of the Mountains, so as it may be seen a great way off, and therefore serveth travellers for a mark.</p>

                  <p>Yet notwithstanding the great destruction of the Woods in Ireland, occasioned by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd causes, there are still sundry great Woods remaining, and that not onely in the other Provinces, but even in Leinster it self.

                  <p>In Ulster there be great Forrests in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Donegall, and in the North-part of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone, in the Country called Glankankin. Also in the County of Fermanagh, along Lough-Earne; in the County of Antrim; and in the North-part of the County of Down; in the two Countries called Killulta and Kilwarlin; besides severall other lesser Woods in sundry parts of that Province.

                  <p>THe Old-English in Ireland, that is, those who are come in from the time of the first Conquest, untill the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, have been so plagued with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44031:71"/>
Wars from time to time, one while intestine among themselves, and another while with the Irish, that they could scarce ever find the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of seeking for Mines, and searching out the Metals hidden in the bowels of the Earth. And the Irish themselves, as being one of the most barbarous Nations of the whole earth, have at all times been so far from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out any, that even in these last years, and since the English have begun to discover some, none of them all, great nor small, at any time hath applyed himself to that business, or in the least manner furthered it.</p>
                  <p>So that all the Mines which to this day are found out in Ireland, have been discovered (at least as for to make any use of them) by the New-English, that is, such as are come in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and since the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Severall whereof having begun to give their minds to it during the last Peace, have in a few years found out a great many Iron-Mines in sundry parts of the Kingdom, and also some of Lead and Silver; which greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the opinion of many knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who hold that the Mountains of Ireland are full of Metals, and that if the same indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and diligence had been used by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that Country in former Ages, as there hath been since the beginning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, many more Mines might have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, not only of the same Minerals as have been found out hitherto, but of others also, and perhaps even of Gold it self.</p>

                  <p>I beleeve many will think it very unlikely, that there should be any Gold-mines in Ireland; but a credible person hath given me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that one of his acquaintance had severall times assured him, that out of a certain rivelet in the County of nether-Tirone, called Miola (the which rising in the Mountains Slew-galen, and passing by the village Maharry, falleth into the North-west corner of Lough-Neaugh, close by the place where the River Band commeth out of it) hee had gathered about one dram of pure gold; concluding thereby, that in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Mountains rich Gold-mines doe lye hidden.</p>
                  <p>For it is an ordinary thing for rivers, which take their originall in gold-bearing mountains, to carry Gold mixt with their sand; the which may bee confirmed by many instances, and to say nothing of severall Rivers of that kind, mentioned by <hi>Staabo, Pliny,</hi> &amp; other old Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Historians, nor of Pactolus and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Lydia, and Tagus in Spain, whereof all the old Poets are full; it is certain, that in our very times severall rivers in Germanie, as the Elbe, Schwarts, Sala, and others, doe carrie gold, and have it mixed with their sands; out of the which by the industry of man it is collected.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> Three sorts of Iron-mines in Ireland: and first of the first sort, Bog-mine.</head>
                  <p>But to let alone uncertain conjectures, and to content our selves with the Mines that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discovered, we will in order speak of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44031:72"/>
them, and begin with the Iron-mines. Of them there are three sorts in Ireland, for in some places the Oar of the Iron is drawn out of Moores and Bogs, in others it is hewen out of Rocks, and in others it is digged out of Mountains: of which three sorts the first is called Bog-mine, the other Rock-mine, and the third with severall names White-mine, Pin-mine, and Shel-mine.</p>
                  <p>The first sort, as wee have said, and as the name it self doth shew, is found in low and boggie places, out of the which it is raised with very little charge, as lying not deep at all, commonly on the superficies of the earth, and about a foot in thickness. This Oar is very rich of metall, and that very good and tough, nevertheless in the melting it must be mingled with some of the Mine or Oar of some of the other sorts: for else it is too harsh, and keeping the furnace too hot, it melteth too suddenly, and stoppeth the mouth of the furnace, or, to use the workmens own expression choaketh the furnace. Whilest this Oar is new, it is of a yellowish colour, and the substance of it somewhat like unto clay, but if you let it lye any long time in the open air, it groweth not only very dry, as the clay u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to doe, but moldereth and dissolveth of it self, and falleth quite to dust or sand, and that of a blackish or black-brown colour.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> Of the second sort of Iron-mine, called Rock-mine.</head>
                  <p>The second sort, that which is taken out of Rocks, being a hard and meer stony substance, of a dark and rustie colour, doth not lye scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in severall places, but is a piece of the very rock, of the which it is hewen: which Rock being
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44031:72"/>
covered over with earth, is within equallie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where of the same substance; so as the whole Rock, and every parcell thereof, is Oar of Iron. This Mine, as well as the former, is raised with little trouble, for the Iron-rock being full of joints, is with pick-axes easily divided and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into pieces of what bigness one will: which by reason of the same joints, whereof they are full every where, may easily be broke into other lesser pieces; as that is necessary, before they be put into the furnace.</p>
                  <p>This Mine or Oar is not altogether so rich as the Bog-mine, and yeeldeth very brittle Iron, hardly fit for any thing else, but to make plow-shares of it (from whence the name of colt-share Iron is given unto it) and therefore is seldom melted alone, but mixed with the first or the third sort.</p>
                  <p>Of this kind hitherto there hath but two Mines been discovered in Ireland, the one in Munster, neer the town of Tallo, by the Earl of Cork his Iron works; the other in Leinster, in Kings county, in a place called Desert land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one Serjeant Major Piggot, which rock is of so great a compass, that before this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion it furnished divers great Iron-works, and could have furnished many more, without any notable diminution; seeing the deepest pits that had been yet made in it, were not above two yards deep. The land, under which this rock ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is very good and fruitfull, as much as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther land thereabouts, the mold being generallie two feet and two and a half, and in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces three feet deep.</p>

                  <p>The third sort of Iron-mine is digged out of the mountains, in severall parts of the Kingdome; in Vlster, in the County of Fermanagh, upon Lough Earne; in the County of Cavan, in a place called Douballie, in a drie mountain; and in the County of Nether-Tirone, by the side of the rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Lishan, not farre from Lough Neaugh; at the foot of the mountains Slew-galen men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by us upon an other occasion, in the beginning at this Chapter: in Leinster<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Kings-countie, hard by Mountmelick; and in Queens-countie, two miles from Mountrath: in Connaught; in Tomound or the County of Clare, six miles from Limmerick; in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Roscomen, by the side of Lough Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; and in the County of Letrim, on the East-side of the said Lough, where the mountains are so full of this metall, that thereof it hath got in Irish the name of <hi>Slew Neren,</hi> that is, Mountains of Iron: and in the Province of Munster also in sundry places.</p>
                  <p>This sort is of a whitish or gray colour, like that of ashes; and one needs not take much pains for to find it out, for the mountaines which doe contain it within themselves, doe commonly shew it of their own accord, so as one may see the veins thereof at the very outside in the sides of the mohntains, beeing not very broad, but of great length, and commonly divers in one place, five or six ridges the one above the other, with ridges of earth between them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:44031:73"/>These Veins or Ridges are vulgarly called Pins, from whence the Mine hath the name of Pin-mine; being also called White-mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its whitish colour; and Shel-mine, for the following reason: for this stuff or Oar being neither loose or soft as earth or clay, neither firm and hard as stone, is of a middle substance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, somewhat like unto Slate, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of shels or scales, the which do lye one upon another, and may be separated and taken asunder very easily, without any great force or trouble. This stuff is digged out of the ground in lumps of the bigness of a mans head, bigger, or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Vein assordeth opportunitie. Within every one of these lumps, when the Mine is very rich and of the best sort (for all the Oar of this kind is not of equall goodness, some yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and better Iron than other) lyeth a small Kernell, which hath the name of Hony-comb given to it, because it is full of little holes, in the same manner as that substance whereof it borroweth its appellation.</p>
                  <p>The Iron comming of this Oar is not brittle, as that of the Rock-mine, but tough, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places as good as any Spanish Iron.</p>

                  <p>In imitation of these have also been erected divers Iron-works in sundry parts of the sea-coast of Ulster and Munster, by persons, who having no Mines upon or near their own Lands, had the Oare brought unto them by sea out of England; the which they found better cheap than if they had caused it to be fetched by land from some of the Mines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the land.

                  <p>THe fashion of the Iron-works, of whose erection we have spoke in the end of the foregoing Chapter, is such as followeth. At the end of a great Barn standeth a huge Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, being of the height of a pike and a half, or more, and four-square in figure, but after the manner of a Mault-kiln, that is, narrow below, and by degrees growing wider towards the top, so as the compass of the mouth or the top is of many fathoms. This mouth is not covered, but open all over; so that the flame, when the furnace is kindled, rising through the same without any hindrance, may be seen a great way off in the night, and in the midst of the darkness maketh a terrible shew to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who do not know what it is.</p>
                  <p>These Ovens are not kindled with wood, nor with sea-coal, but meerly vvith char-coal, whereof therefore they consume a huge quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: For the Furnace being once kindled, is never suffered to go out, but is continually kept a burning from the one end of the year to the other: And the proportion of the coals
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44031:75"/>
to the Oare is very great: For the Mine would not melt without an exceeding hot fire; the which that it may be the more quick and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it is continually blown day and night without ceasing by two vast pair of bellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the which resting upon main peeces of timber, and with their pipes placed into one of the sides of the Furnace, are perpetually kept in action by the meanes of a great wheel, which being driven about by a little brook or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-course, maketh them rise and fall by turns, so that whilst the one pair of bellows doth swell and fill it self with wind, the other doth blow the same forth into the Furnace.</p>

                  <p>There is another and lesser sort of Iron-works, much different from the former: For instead of a Furnace they use a Hearth therein, altogether of the fashion of a Smiths Hearth, whereon the Oare being layd in a great heap, it is covered over with abundance of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, the which being kindled, is continually blown by Bellows that are moved by Wheeles and Water-courses, in the same manner as in the other Works.</p>
                  <p>These Works, commonly called Bloome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are in use, or were so before this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in sundry places of the North-parts of Ulster.</p>
                  <p>Besides these two sorts of Works, where the Iron-mine is melted, there is a third sort,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44031:75"/>
where the Iron after the first melting is ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered out into Bars, of which we shall have occasion to speak more in the latter end of this present Chapter.</p>
                  <p>There were also in some parts of Ireland yet another kind of Iron-works, differing from all the former, where the Iron was cast into Ordnance, Pots, small round Furnaces, and other things; of which Works M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>In the erecting of these Works men seek to make them as near to the Mine as may be, to get the more profit by them: for the greater the distance is, the greater are the charges in having the Oare brought from the Mine to the Furnace, especially where all must be carried by land, the which doth fall out so in far the most places.</p>
                  <p>But many times one is necessitated to make the Works a good way further from the Mine, than otherwise one would, because of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courses, the which being of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in the well-settling of a Work, and absolutely necessary (the wheels being all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by water) those places must be made choice
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44031:76"/>
of, where one may have the conveniency of Water-courses. And besides all this, regard must be had to the nearness of the Woods, partly by reason of the Timber, a great deal whereof is necessary for the erecting of one of these Workes, and chiefly for the Charcoales sake, of which a vast quantity continually is requisite, as before we have shewed.</p>

                  <p>It is to be observed, that although there be Wood enough upon ones land, and that not very far from the Mine, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of Water-courses, so as the water needeth not to be brought from very far off, nevertheless the charge is very great, both of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and stocking one of the Iron-works, and of maintaining it and keeping it afoot, and that by reason of the great number of Workmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Labourers of severall sorts, which thereunto is requisite; a list of whose names and offices here followeth: Wood-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who fell the timber; Sawyers, to saw the timber; Carpenters, Smiths, Masons, and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-makers, to erect the Iron-works, with all the appurtenances thereof, and to repair them from time to time; Water-leaders, or Water-course-keepers, to steer the Water-courses, and to look to them constantly; Basket-makers, to make baskets for to carry the Oare and other materials; Boat-men, and Boat-wrights to make the Boats, and to go in them; Diggers, who work in the Mine, and dig the same; Carriers, who carry the Oare from the Mine; Colliers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44031:76"/>
who make the Char-coal; corders, who bring the Char-coal to the work; fillers, whose work it is from time to time to put the Mine and the coales into the furnace; keepers of the furnace, who look to the main work, rake out the ashes and cinders, and let out the molten metall at convenient times; finers, who look to the works where the Iron is hammered; hammerers, whose work it is to see the Iron hammered out: besides severall other labourers, who having no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular task, must help to put their hand to every thing: of all which sorts of men Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> the elder, that zealous and famous Warriour in this present warre against the Irish Rebells (wherein having done many memorable exploits, he lost his life in the first year thereof) did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually keep at work some five-and-twenty or six-and-twenty hundred, at his Iron-works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three in number.

                  <p>To speak somewhat more particularlie both of the charges and the profits of these Iron-works, we shal instance the matter in one of the works of the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> namely that which he had in the Lordship of Mountrath, in Queens-county. At that work the Tun (that is twenty hundred weight) of Rock-mine at the furnace head came
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44031:77"/>
in all to stand in five shillings six pence sterling, and the Tun of White-mine, which hee had brought him from a place two miles further off in seven shillings. These two were mixed in that proportion, that to one part of Rock-mine were taken two parts of White-mine: for if more of the Rock-mine had bin taken, the Iron would not have bin so good, and too brittle; and being thus mixed, they yeelded one third part of Iron: that is to say, of two Tuns of White-mine, and one of Rock-mine, being mingled and melted together, they had one Tun of good I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, such as is called Merchants-Iron, being not of the first, but second melting, and hammered out into barres, and consequently fit for all kinds of use</p>
                  <p>This Iron he sent down the river Oure (by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called the Nure) to Rosse and Waterford in that kind of Irish boates which are called Cots in that countrie, being made of one piece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: which kind of ill-favoured boats (mentioned also by us above) are very common throughout all Ireland, both for to pass rivers in, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goods from one place to another; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon shallow waters, such as the aforenamed River is in the greatest part of its course, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the great Rivers and Loughs.</p>
                  <p>At Waterford the Iron was put aboard of ships going for London, where it was sold for six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, otherwhiles for seventeen pounds stering, and sometimes for seventeen and a half; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it did not stand Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> in more than betwixt tenne and eleven pounds sterling, all charges reckoned, as well of digging, melting, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as of carrying, boat-hire, and freight, even

                  <p>In most of the other places did a Tun of the Iron-mine or Oar come to stand in five, five and a half, and six shillings sterling at the furnace head; and it was an ordinary thing, as well where they used White-wine, as where they mixed Rock-mine with it, to have a Tun of good Iron out of three tuns of Oar: in some places, where the Mine was richer, they would have a Tun of Iron out of only two Tuns and a half of Oar. Nevertheless few of them gained more or as much as Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> because they had not the same conveniencie of transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: And he himselfe did not gain so much by his Iron works in Connaught, as by that neer Mountrath, although the Mines there afforded a richer Oar, and that the Tun thereof did cost him but three shillings at the furnace, because that Lough-Allen, whereunto the same Mines and Works are contiguons, gave him the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of carrying the Oar by water from the Mine unto the Work, and that in boates of forty tuns.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of Cork whose Iron-works being seated in Munster, afforded unto him very good opportunitie of sending his Iron out of the land by shipping, did in this particular surpass all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so as he hath gained great treasures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and knowing persons, who have had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular insight into his affaires, doe assure me, that he hath profited above one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds clear gain by his said Iron-works.</p>

                  <p>The manner of melting the Iron, usuall in Ireland, is thus. The furnace is not filled to the top, but some space is left emptie; and to put new stuff into it they doe not stay untill the former be quite consumed, but only untill it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what descended, and then they cast into it some charges or basketfuls of Coales, and at the top of them the same quantity of Mine: and thus they doe from time to time, so as the furnace is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in one and the same estate; where is to be observed, that in most furnaces they adde unto the Oar and Coales some quantity of Iron-cinders, and in others of Lime-stone, whereby the melting of the Iron is greatly furthered, and the furnace made to work more mildly.</p>
                  <p>Within the barn, at the bottome of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, stand constantly two men, one of each side, the which with long iron hooks, through holes left for the purpose, doe every quarter of an hour draw out the unburnt coales, ashes, and cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which cinders are great lumps of a firm sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but brittle, of a blackish colour, shining, but not transparent; being nothing else but the remainder of the Iron-oar, after that the Iron which was contained in it, is melted out on't</p>
                  <p>The Iron it self descendeth to the lowest part of the furnace, called the Hearth; the which being filled, (so that, if one stayed longer, the Iron would begin to swim over through the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said holes) they unstop the Hearth, and open the mouth thereof (or the Timpas the Arts-men call it) taking away a little door, of fashion like unto that of a bakers oven, wherewith the same
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44031:78"/>
was shut up very close. The floor of the barn hath a mold of sand upon it, where-in, before they open the furnace, a furrow is made, of sufficient breadth and depth, through the whole length of the barn, from the bottom of the furnace until the barns door: into which furrow, as soon as the furnace is opened, the molten Iron runneth very suddenly and forcibly, being to look on like unto a stream or current of fire. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a long time hot, but doth presently loose its liquidness and redness, turning into a hard and stiff mass, which mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Masses or Sowes of Iron are not alwaies of one and the same weight and bigness, but there is them of all sizes, from one hundred weight untill thirtie hundred: which difference doth chiefly depend on the different bigness of the furnace and hearth, and partly on the will and discretion of the workmaster or founder, and according as he either stayeth untill the hearth be full, or letteth out the Iron sooner; but ordinarily they doe not use to cast, or to open the hearth, under less than twelve houres, nor to stay much longer than four-and-twenty.</p>
                  <p>And here is to be observed, that even in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of the same biguess, yea in the self-same fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, the same quantity of Iron is not alwaies cast in the same space of time: but that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both according to the nature of the Oar, and according to the different seasons of the year. For within the same compasse of time you shall cast a greater quantitie of Iron out of

The first two having been discovered but a few years before this present Rebellion, were through several impediments never taken in hand yet; wherefore we shall speak only of the third.</p>
                  <p>This Mine standeth in the County of Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary, in the Barony of Upper-Ormond, in the Parish of Kilmore, upon the Lands of one <hi>Iohn Mac-Dermot O-kennedy,</hi> not far from the Castle of Downallie, twelve miles from Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick, and threescore from Dublin. The land where the Mine is, is mountainous and barren; but the bottoms, and the lands adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are very good for Pasture, and partly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; of each whereof the Miners had part, to the value of twenty pounds sterling <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>

It was found out not above forty years agoe, but understood at the first onely as a Lead-mine, and accordingly given notice of to <hi>Donogh</hi> Earl of Thomond, then Lord President of Munster, who made use of some of the Lead for to cover the house which he then was building at Bunrattie: But afterwards it hath been found, that with the Lead of this Mine there was mixed some Silver.</p>

                  <p>The Veins of this Mine did commonly rise within three or four spits of the superficies, and they digged deeper as those Veines went, digging open pits very far into the ground, many fathoms deep, yea Castle-deep; the pits not being steep, but of that fashion as people might go in and out with Wheel-barrows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely way used by them for to carry out the Mine or Oare. The water did seldom much offend them; for when either by the falling of much rain, or by the discovering of some Spring or Water-source, they found themselves annoyed by it, they did by Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its carry it away to a brook adjoyning, the Mountain being so situate, as that might be done easily.</p>
                  <p>This Mine yeelds two different sorts of Oare; of which the one, and that the most in quantitie, is of a reddish colour, hard, and glistering; the other is like a Marle, somthing

                  <p>The Oar yeelded one with another three pound weight of Silver out of each Tun, but a great quantity of Lead, so as that was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the best profit to the Farmer.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Lead and Silver the Mine produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced also some Quicksilver, but not any Alome, Vitriol, or Antimony, that I could hear of.</p>

                  <p>The silver of this Mine was very fine, so as the Farmers sold it at Dublin for five shillings two pence sterling the ounce; as for the Lead, that they sold on the place for eleven pounds sterling the Tun, and for twelve pounds at the city of Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick. The King had the sixt part of the silver for his share, and the tenth part of the Lead, the rest remaining to the farmers, whose clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit was estimated to be worth two thousand pounds sterling yearly.</p>

                  <p>I have not heard that any of the Miners hath been stifled in this Mine, a thing ordinary enough in other countries: the reason whereof I conceive to be, because the work was done in wide and open pits, wherein the like noxious vapours can neither be so easily engendred, and when they arise find a free passage into the open air, to the contrary of those close and narrow vaults usuall in the most part of other Mines.</p>
                  <p>For else that the Earth of Ireland is subject, as well as that of other countries, to breed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous damps within her self, is undoubted, as evidently it appeared in the year sixteen hundred

thirty seven, by this following accident.</p>
                  <p>A Maulter living in the suburbs of Dublin in St Francis-street caused a Well to be digged three yards deep, which yeelding but little water, and that not very sweet nor clear, resolved to have it made deeper; and injoyned a servant of his, to work at it at spare times, which he doing, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving digged a yard and half lower, the water of it begun the 24 of August to bubble up in a strange manner, making great noise; which having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two dayes, without any notable increase, hardly comming half-way the knees; he went down again into the Well, to digge there accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his custome. But having wrought but a little while, and being taken with a sudden gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness in his head, and faintness at his heart, made hast to get out, and being revived, returned to fetch away his spade and other instruments; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the bottom he fell into a deadly sown, which being s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en by those that were present, one of them went down to help him up; unto whom the same accident happened. All the spectators being greatly astonished, and their tumult ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn-on a great concourse of people, the place were the Well was being an open yard, looking into the main street; a certaine man, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to town, and casually passing by that way, not affrighted by the example of those two, had the courage to goe down to fetch the former out, but with as ill success as they themselves. The wonder and amazement being hereby increased among the people, there was nevertheless a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher (a bold robustuous man) who having drunk somewhat liberally, would notwithstanding these sad accidents goe in, which at the first not being
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44031:82"/>
suffered, and he continuing in his resolution, was at last permitted on condition that he let a strong cord be tyed about his wast to pull him out, if he found himself ill; the which to signifie he was to hold up his right hand. But being come to the bottome, and suddenly taken with a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faintness, that he had neither time nor power to give the appointed sign, falling from the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and being haled out with all possible speed, found to be in a deep trance, but with perfect signes of life: wherefore being carried to his own house, put into his bed, and care taken of him, it was nevertheless 24 houres before he came to himself.</p>
                  <p>The dead bodies being drawn out of the Well it was filled with earth by order of the Magistrat of the said City.</p>

                  <p>The like accidents have at severall times been seen in other Countries, whereof wee could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege many instances, but passing by all other we shall make mention of one lately befaln here at London. Without Aldesgate, there is a little court called Carpenters-yard, in the midst of which there stood a Pump; the water whereof not being good for to dress meat, was used by the neighbours only for the washing and cleaning of their houses, and the like. But in length of time being grown so thick and muddy that no use could be made out, it was resolved that the Well, whereout the Pump drew its water, should be made clean, to which purpose the Pump being taken down, in the latter end of Iuly <hi>anno</hi> sixteen hundred fourtie four, a laborer was let down
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44031:82"/>
with a cord into the Well, being little and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to take out the mud by pailes full, which assoon as he came to the bottome presently fell stark dead. Those that had let him down, seeing this, and suspecting nothing else, but that a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain faintness had overcome him, let down ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see what he ayled, and to bring him out. But he sped no better than the first, which when the people perceived, no more went into the Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill three or four houres after, in which mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-space of time a great Iron pan or plate, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up with burning charcoal, had been let down into the Well, and severall times as the fire did slaken, renewed, that through the heat thereof that mortiferous vapour might bee overcome and dispersed, the which accordingly fell out; so that the person aferwards went down to fetch away the dead bodies, got no hurt at all. A great covered or vaulted gutter, whereby the ordures of the streets are under ground conveyed into the City ditch, passeth under the yard where-in the said Well, (dammed up since this sad accident) did stand; so as it may bee probably beleeved that that deadly infection of the air within the same Well had partly been caused through the neerness of the same sewer.</p>

                  <p>HAving in the precedent Chapters treated of the Metals and Minerals, which are found in Ireland, we shall now go on to speak of severall other substances, raised out of the ground there, of a less noble nature, but nevertheless profitable and serving for severall good uses.</p>
                  <p>To begin with Free-stone, there is two sorts of it, the one being gray or ash-coloured, and the other blew; which both for the most part ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the uppermost parts of the ground, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with very little earth, are raised with small labour and charge, whereas in most other countries it is as much labour to digge Free-stone as the metalls themselves, The blew Free-stone is not very abundant, and as little in request, as unfit for great buildings; it lying for the most part in small unshapely peeces; and when they are bigger commonly broke in the raising and hewing, partly through the unskilfullness of the workmen there, and chiefly because they are exceeding hard, and cannot well endure the Iron. The gray free-stone which is found very abundantly in most parts of the land is of a contrary nature; and may easily be cut out into stones of all bigness or fashion, wherefore also this sort hath been used by the English, to all the Churches, Castles, and Edifices, which since the Conquest have been builded by them; For the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44031:83"/>
Irish themselves, never had the skill nor industry to erect any considerable buildings of Free-stone, Brick, or other the like materials, their dwellings being very poor and contemptible cottages. True it is, that the English at their first comming found several Maritine-townes in Ireland with stone-walls and houses, the Churches also, not onely in those, but in many other Towns being of the same. But built by strangers, who being come out of the Northern parts of Germany, and other neighbouring Countries, had setled themselves there, inhabiting severall parts of the Sea-coasts, some Ages before the English-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; which people called themselves Oast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, or Easterlings; all those Countries of the which they were come being situated to the East of Ireland.</p>

                  <p>Besides the Free-stone, which is almost in every part of the land, there is Marble found in many places of severall sorts; one is red, straked with white and other colours, such as with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar name is called Porphyre; other black, very curiously straked with white, and some all of one colour.</p>

                  <p>In sundry parts of Ireland Slate is found in great abundance, and that nothing deep within the ground, just in the same manner as the Free-stone, so as it may be raised with little charge and labour; wherefore at all times it hath been much used by the English inhabitants for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of their houses and other buildings. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless some years since in places near the sea, especially at Dublin, that kind of Holland Tiles, which by them are called <hi>Pannen</hi> begun to be used generally, the Merchants causing them to be brought in from thence in great abundance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Ireland they had neither convenient stuff to make them of, nor work-men skilfull in that business: although the common Tiles usual in many parts of England and other Countries, were made and used in several places within the land.</p>
                  <p>Besides these there was another kind of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in use, both for Churches and houses, to wit, a certain sort of woodden Tiles, vulgarly called Shingles; the which are thight enough at the first, but do not many yeares continue so, it being necessary to change them often: which thing properly not appertaining to this Chapter, we nevertheless for affinities sake have thought not amiss here to mention.</p>
                  <p>Some yeares ago another kind of Slate hath been discovered in Ireland, which for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours-sake is called Black-slate, being of a blackish colour, which is come into great esteem, not so
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44031:85"/>
much for the ordinary use of covering houses, for which they are no better than common Slate, but because it hath been found by experience, very good and medicinall against severall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, especially to stay all kind of bleeding, and to hinder that after falls and bruises the blood do not congeal within the body.</p>

                  <p>The Trees and Woods having been so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in Ireland, as heretofore we have shewed, and consequently wood for firing being very dear in great part of the land, the inhabitants are necessitated to make use of other fuel, <hi>viz.</hi> of Turf, and of Sea-coals. Of the Turf we shall speak in the next Chapter. As for Sea-coals, they are the ordinary firing in Dublin &amp; in other places lying near the sea, where the same in time of peace are brought in out of England, Wales, and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in great abundance, and therefore reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cheap; which is the reason, that the less care hath been taken to find out Coal-mines in Ireland it self, whereas otherwise it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of persons knowing in these matters, that if diligent search were made for them, in sundry parts of the land good Coal-mines would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This opinion is the more probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that already one Coal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mine hath bin found out in Ireland, a few yeares since, by meer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and without having been sought for. The Mine is in the Province of Leinster, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Carlo, seven miles from Idof, in the same hill where the Iron-mine was of Mr. <hi>Christopher Wandsworth,</hi> of whom hath been spoken above. In that Iron-mine, after that for a great while

they had drawn Iron-oar out of it, and that by degrees they were gone deeper, at last in lieu of Oar they met with Sea-coal, so as ever since all the people dwelling in those parts have used it for their firing, finding it very cheap; for the load of an Irish-car, drawn by one Garron, did stand them, besides the charges of bringing it, in nine pence only, three pence to the digger, and six pence to the owner.</p>
                  <p>There be Coals enough in this Mine for to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a whole Country; nevertheless there is no use made of them further than among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring inhabitants; because the Mine being si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated far from Rivers, the transportation is too chargeable by land.</p>
                  <p>These Coals are very heavy, and burn with little flame, but lye like Char-coal, and continue so the space of seven or eight hours, casting a very great and violent heat.</p>

                  <p>It is the observation of women, that the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen which is dryed by a fire made of this last sort of Turf, getteth a foul colour, be it never so white washed and bleeched, and groweth yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish in that manner as that it can hardly be got out again.</p>

                  <p>The first sort of Turf costeth but little paines in the making; for being digged, and having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:44031:86"/>But black Turf cannot be made without more trouble. First they mark out convenient places; for onely those are fit for it to which some paths do lead, and which in themselves are not too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and too deep, but have a firm &amp; sandy ground underneath, within the space of four or five feet, or thereabouts. Having found out such a place, if it be too watery, they make some trenches, into which the water descending out of that part of the Bog wherein they intend to work, may by them be carried to some place fit for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; to the end that the Bog being thereby grown somewhat dryer and firmer, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bear the Labourers without s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nking too deep into it. Then they fall to the business, dividing it so among the Labourers, that one part of them do dig out the earth, or rather the mud (for all the earth whereof this Turf is made, is thin and muddy) and by spade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On that dry place where the mud is poured forth, sit certain women upon their knees, who mold the mud, using no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to it but their hands; between the which taking a part of it, they press them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that manner, that their hands meeting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,

the turf is fashioned flat and broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, growing narrower towards the top; which being done, the Turf is let lye upon the ground the space of a week or more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the weather is, and being reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well dryed, it is piled up in little heaps, leaving every where empty spaces between, that the air and the wind passing through them, they may dry the sooner.</p>

                  <p>Ireland is so full of Bogs, that every man almost hath Bog enough upon his own land to make Turf for his family and for all his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; so that the Turf doth cost most men no more than the hire of the Labourers who are employed about it. Those that begun early in the year, whilst the Labourers had but little employment, gave ordinarily, besides meat and drink, three pence sterling a day to every man, and two pence to every woman; four pence a day being the ordinary price, and when it was was at the dearest, five pence. Twenty men made in two or three dayes as much Turf as was sufficient for the whole years firing of a great family; of which number five men did dig and cast up the mud, five wrought it and filled it into the trays, and ten were busied in drawing the trays to the place where the Turf was molded by the women; who went so nimbly to work with it, that onely two of them were sufficient to keep twenty men at work.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> Of the Lime, and the manner of making it of Lime-stone.</head>
                  <p>All the Lime in Ireland is made not of the shels of all sorts of shel-fish, as in Holland, and some other Countries, but onely of stone; and the gray Free-stone, whereof we have spoken in the precedent Chapter, is very fit for it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when it is not newly come out of the Quarrie, but taken off old buildings. But a peculiar sort of stone properly called Lime-stone, is best for it. This stone is of a gray co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, tending to a dark blew, which being broke, a white dust out of it doth fly abroad; and it is very common throughout all Ireland, but especially in the Provinces of Munster and Connaught, lying not deep within the ground, but very near to the surface of it, and in many places above ground.</p>
                  <p>The manner of burning it into Lime, usual over all Ireland, is this; In the side of some little height they make a great pit, round or square according as conveniencie is offered; of that bignes as may hold forty or fifty barrels, &amp; of that fashion that being many feet wide at the top, it doth by degrees grow narrower towards the bottom, in the same manner as the Furnaces of the Iron-works. The inside of this pit they line round about with a wall built of Lime and Stone, at whose outside near the bottom a hole or door is left, by which to take out the ashes; and above that an iron-grate is laid, which cometh close to the wall round about: Upon this they lay a lay of Lime-stone (being first knockt asunder with a great Iron

Upon that they lay another of Lime-stone, and so by turns, untill the whole Kiln be filled, ever observing that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most lay be of wood, turf, or comb, and not of Lime-stone: which being done, the Kiln is set afire until all be burnt.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 5.</hi> Another manner of burning Lime used in Ireland.</head>
                  <p>There is another manner of burning Lime used in Ireland, in Kilns built altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground, and incomparably bigger than the others, insomuch as to the quantity of three hundred Barrels of Lime at once is made in them. In these Kilns they burn whole stones, without breaking them into peeces as the others, and that onely with wood (turf or comb not being fit for it) whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a huge deal, it being necessary from time to time to put new wood into them, to which end three or four men day and night do stand by the Kiln to keep the fire from decaying or slackning.</p>
                  <p>These (called French-kilns, because the us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:44031:88"/>Now albeit that in these kilnes a very great quantity of Lime is made at a time, nevertheless it hath been found by experience, that they are much more unprofitable than the others, because they consume much more firing in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through the continuall renewing of the fire, and require the constant labour of severall men all the while they are burning, which commonly is the space of three dayes and nights. For these reasons was the use of these kilnes, which never had been very generall in Ireland, more and more left off in these last yeares, and the others almost only made use of; in the which the Lime came to stand them, who burnt it, in no more then four pence the barrell at the most, all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences being reckoned; &amp; but three to them who had the best conveniences.</p>

                  <p>In every part of Ireland there is found a kind of clay very fit for to make bricks, and all sorts of Potters-ware, although the Irish never had the wit or industrie to make use of it for either of these two ends; yea they have ever been so farre from making any earthen vessels, that even the use thereof hath been very rare amongst them, and to the most part unknown, not only before the comming in of the English, but also since, yea even untill these very last times; although a great number of English Potters in severall parts of the land had set up their trade, so as all kind of earthen ware was very common, and to be had at very easie rates.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Brick, they have been little used in Ireland even among the English themselves for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44031:89"/>
a great while; but of late years they begun to be very common, as well in the countrie, as in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, especially Dublin, where all the new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (the which not only in handsomness, but also in number, doe surpass the old) are all made of Brick. But that which is made in Ireland, for the most part is not so good, as that of other Countries, not so much for any unfitness in the clay it self, as for want of handling and preparing it aright; as may easily be conceived by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing description of the manner they use to make it.</p>

                  <p>They dig a great square pit, taking away all the uppermost earth, untill they come to a good clay (which commonly lyeth one or two spits deep) This they digge up throughout the whole pit, and having broke it very small with the spade, they doe by degrees powre a great deal of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongst it, working and labouring it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the spade and their feet, till the whole mass become uniform, firm and tough like stiff dough; the which then in wheel bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes is carried out of the pit to a place where certain long tables are set up, to each of which tables is allotted one man, one woman, &amp; one boy. The woman taketh up the clay by handfulls, from the heap lying upon the ground, and reacheth it unto the man, who thrusteth it into a little wodden form without bottom, strawing now and then some sand upon the table, that the clay may not stick to it: and so having given them their due fashion, the boy doth carry them from thence
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44031:89"/>
to a place, where he layeth them all upon the ground, not under any covert, but in the open air. After they have lyen some dayes, and are somewhat dryed, they are piled up in small heaps, twenty or thirty in a heap, making the heapes transparent in the same manner, as we have shewed above of the Turf, Some dayes after those little piles are made into greater, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feet long, and five or six feet high, but not above two feet, or two and a half broad (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the layes transparent, with some empty space between brick and brick, even so as in the small piles) the which at the top are covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with straw, laying upon the straw broad green sods, to keep off the rain. Having lyen so untill they be quite dry, they make great ovens or Kilnes of them, filling them within with the same, strawing betwixt them of that small sort of Sea-caol, whereof wee have spoke heretofore, called Comb or Coome, and having covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the kiln with the same clay, whereof the bricks are made, the thickness of two hand-broads or there-abouts, they set it afire with wood underneath, and continue the fire untill not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the bricks piled within the Kiln, but all the walls quite through, and at the out-side as well as at the in-side, be perfectly burnt, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into good brick: wherein oftentimes, through the unskilfulness or neglect of those who make &amp; fill these Kilns, and of those that govern the fire, there is great loss, and that two manner of ways. For sometimes great part of the Bricks is found not to be sufficiently nor uniformly burnt; and on the other side it falleth out oftentimes, that great quantities are reduced into one, beeing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44031:90"/>
burnt, or half-burnt into great unshapely masses or lumps, which are good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>They do commonly burn in those Kilns two or three hundred thousand Bricks at a time; the which for the most part, all charges being reckoned, come to stand betwixt six and eight shillings sterling the thousand.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the climate of Ireland is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Northerly, the Land extending it self from the beginning of the one and fiftieth degree of Latitude, until the end of the five and fiftieth, nevertheless is the Air there very temperate, and nothing subject to violent Colds (not onely in Munster, Leinster, and Connaught, but even in the most Northern-part, to wit the Province of Ulster) much less than any other Land lying in the same height or latitude, yea than many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of a much more Southerly-climate.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the Cold-weather doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begin here somewhat soon, namely in the beginning of October, and sometimes in the middle or latter end of September, continuing ordinarily the space of five or six moneths, until the midst or latter end of March, and sometimes also good part of April; during which whole space of time all such persons as are chilly and cold of nature, and do sit still much, can hardly be any long while without a fire.</p>
                  <p>But again on the other side, it is very seldom violently cold there, and freezeth but little: there are commonly three or four Frosts in one Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but they are very short, seldom lasting longer than three or four days together, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44031:91"/>
at their very worst nothing near so violent as in most other Countries; so that some all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long hardly come near a fire once in a day; and that not only in the ordinary cold weather, but even whilst it is a freezing.</p>
                  <p>Yea many times the cold is so slack even in the midst of the Winter-moneths, that by walking onely, or doing some other moderate exercise, you shall find your self as warm, and the Air as sweet and pleasant, as if it were in the moneth of May.</p>
                  <p>There hath been some Winters, wherein it hath frozen ten or twelve dayes together, so as the Liffie, and other the like Rivers were quite frozen, and might be gone upon by men and beasts: But those are altogether extraordinary, and do come very seldom, hardly once in the space of ten or twelve years.</p>
                  <p>But how mild they ordinarily be, and how little subject to excessive cold, may appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that all kind of beasts and cattle, as cows, horses, and sheep, do there all Winter long remain abroad, and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For that season being once past, you have very little dry weather the rest of the Autumn, and during all Winter.

And it is to be observed, that ordinarily it raineth in Ireland much more by day than by night; and that many times when it doth rain two or three dayes together, the nights between are very clear and fair; the which also many times falleth out in other foul weather, and when all day long the Skie is overcast with Clouds and Mists.</p>

                  <p>So that the Irish-air is greatly defectuous in this part, and too much subject to wet and rainy weather; wherein if it were of somewhat a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temperature, and as free from too much wet, as it is from excessive cold, it would be one of the sweetest and pleasantest in the whole world, and very few Countries could be named, that might be compared with Ireland for agreeable temperateness. And although it is unlikely, that any revolution of times will produce any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable alteration in this (the which indeed in some other Countries hath caused wonderfull changes) because that those who many Ages ago have written of this Iland, doe witness the self same things of it in this particular, as wee doe find in our time: There is nevertheless great probability that this defect may in part be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the industry of men, if the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once inhabited throughout by a civill Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, care were taken every where to diminish and take away the superfluous and excessive wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the ground, in all the watery and boggy places, whereby this too great moystness of the Air is greatly increased, and partly also occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siond</p>
                  <p>This opinion is not grounded upon some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain speculation, but upon assured experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for severall knowing and credible persons

But there is as much Dew there, as in other Countries that are a great deal hotter and dryer. Onely thus much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth shew in Ireland (and it may be as well in other Countries, whereof I have not yet informed my self) that when it is towards any great rain, little or no Dew doth fall; so as in those times going forth early in the morning into the green fields, you will finde them altogether dry, and that even in that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherein the Dew in Ireland, as in other neighbouring Countries, useth to fall more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, than in any other time of the year, to wit in the moneths of May and June: This is a certain sign to the inhabitants, that great rain is to fall suddenly; and commonly after such a dry and dewless night it useth to rain two or three days together. But the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rain doth not hinder the Dew in that manner, as that which is imminent; and it is found ordinarily, that in a clear night follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rainy day (the which is very ordinary, as we have sayd in the preceding Chapter) the Dew commeth down as liberally as if it had not rained the day before.</p>

                  <p>The English women, and Gentlewomen in Ireland, as in England, did use in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Summer to gather good store of Dew, to keep it by them all the year after for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44031:94"/>
several good uses both of physick and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, wherein by experience they have learnt it to be very available. Their manner of collecting and keeping it was this. In the moneth of May especially, and also in part of the moneth of June, they would go forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning, and before Sun-rising, into a green field, and there either with their hands strike off the Dew from the tops of the herbs into a dish, or else throwing clean lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen clothes upon the ground, take off the Dew from the herbs into them, and afterwards wring it out into dishes; and thus they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their work untill they have got a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Dew according to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That which is gotten from the grass will serve, but they chuse rather to have it from the green corn, especially Wheat, if they can have the conveniency to do so, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that this Dew hath more vertues, and is better for all purposes, than that which hath been collected from the grass or other herbs. The Dew thus gathered they put into a glass bottle, and so set it in a place where it may have the warm Sun-shine all day long, keeping it there all the Summer; after some dayes rest some dregs and dirt will settle to the bottom; the which when they perceive, they pour off all the clear Dew into another vessel, and fling away those setlings. This they doe often, because the Dew doth not purge it self perfectly in a few dayes, but by degrees, so as new dregs (severed from the purer parts by the working of the Dew, helped on by the Sun-beams) do settle again; of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44031:95"/>
which as often as those good women see any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table quantity, they st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We have shewed how much Ireland is subject to Rain, and so it is likewise to dark weather, and overcasting of the air even when it raineth not, which continueth sometimes many dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, especially in Winter-time.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Fogs &amp; Mists, Ireland is no more troubled with them than other regions, especially in the plain countrie, for in the mountaines they are much more frequent, so that oftentimes they are covered with them for a great way, the space of some houres together, when at the same time there is none in the neighbouring plain countrie; and in the high mountaines it commeth many times to pass that in a fair day the top thereof for a long time together is covered over with a thick Mist, when not only the adjacent country, but even the lower part of those mountains doe njoy a clear Sun-shine. And sometimes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth the tops as well as the lower parts beeing free from them, the middle parts are quite covered there-with: as my brother in his travels hath many times observed in severall parts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon those high mountaines between Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalke and Carlingford, as well in the midst of the summer, as at other times of the year.</p>
                  <p>And in many places it is found by experience
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44031:95"/>
that the like Fogs upon the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines is a fore-runner of rain in the next conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: whereof all those who have lived any time at Dublin, may have good knowledge. For seldom a mist appeareth upon the top of the Wickloe-mountains, situated some five or six miles to the South of Dublin, or of the head of both, without beeing followed with rain at Dublin and the adjacent parts within 24. houres: wherein is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that a Fog quite covering those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all over is not so sure a signe of Rain, as when it is only upon the top: and that those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Mists upon the mountains are often seen without any following Rain, the which very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never happeneth in the others.</p>
                  <p>There be two sorts of Mists or Fogs in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: the one is uniform and constant, quite filling the air of all sides, whereby all manner of prospect is taken away, and continuing after the same fashion, untill it vanish by degrees, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ascending up into the Air, or falling to the ground; whereofhere, as in other countries, the first is commonly followed with Rain, and the second with fair weather</p>
                  <p>In the other sort are great parcells or flakes of foggie vapours scattered up and down the Air, with clear spaces betwixt: the which flakes doe not keep one place, but fly to and fro, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are driven by the wind, and that sometimes very swiftly; this kind of Fog doth arise not only upon the seaside, but also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the land, and upon the mountaines: often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning into a generall mist.</p>

                  <p>With Winds it is in this countrie almost as with Rain, Ireland not only having its share in them, as other countries, but being very much subject to them, more than most other parts of the world.

                  <p>And it is worth the observation, that not only storm-winds, but others also, do in Ireland much seldomer blow out of the East, than out of the West, especiall in the winter; so that commonly there is no need of a wind to be wafted over into England: where to the contrary, those, who out of England will come over into Ireland, very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily are constrained to wait two or three weeks, and sometimes five or six weeks, yea it hath faln out so more than once, that in two whole months, and longer, there hath not been somuch East-wind, as to carry ships out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland into Ireland: notable instances whereof the History of the first conquest of Ireland, and that of the Lord Mountjoy, subbuer of Tirone's rebellion, doth afford.</p>
                  <p>But in the Summer-time, and chiefly in the Spring, and in the months of March, Aprill, and May, one is not so much subject to that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, as in the other times of the year.</p>

                  <p>Irelands Healthfullness doth further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by this particular, that severall diseases, very common in other countries, are here very rare, and partly altogether unknown. For the Scurvy, an evill so generall in all other North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly countries consining upon the Sea, is untill this day utterly unknown in Ireland.</p>
                  <p>So is the Quartan Ague, the which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in England, and in severall parts of it doth very much reign at all times.</p>
                  <p>As for the Tertian Ague, it was heretofore as litle known in Ireland as the Quartan: but some yeares since, I know not through what secret change, it hath found access into this Iland, so that at this time some are taken with it, but nothing neer so ordinarily as in other Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Plague, which so often and so cruelly infecteth England, to say nothing of remotes countries, is wonderfull rare in Ireland, and hardly seen once in an age.</p>

                  <p>It is observable concerning the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned particular, that this privilege, of being free from severall Diseases, doth not consist in any peculiar quality of the bodies of men, but proceedeth from some hidden property of the Land and the Air it self. This is made manifest two manner of wayes, first, in that strangers comming into Ireland, doe partake of this same exemption; and as long as they continue there, are as free of those evills, from which that climat is exempt, as the Irish themselves. Secondly, in that the natives, born and brought up in Ireland, comming into other countries, are found to be subject unto those diseases as well as other people, and I have known severall of them, who being come hither into England, have fallen into the Quartan Ague, and have as long and as badly been troubled with it, as ordinarily any Englishman useth to be.</p>
                  <p>And credible persons have affirmed unto me the same of Scotland, namely that the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague never having been seen there, the Scotchmen nevertheless in other countries are as obnoxious to it, as people of any other Nation.</p>

                  <p>AS Ireland is subject to most diseases in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other Countries, so there are some, whereunto it is peculiarly obnoxious, being at
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44031:99"/>
all times so rife there, that they may justly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Irelands <hi>Endemii Morbi</hi> or reigning Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, as indeed they are generally reputed for such.</p>
                  <p>Of this number is a certain sort of Malignant Feavers, vulgarly in Ireland called Irish Agues, because that at all times they are so common in Ireland, as well among the Inhabitants and the Natives, as among those who are newly come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from other countries. This Feaver common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with a great pain in the head a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44031:100"/>

                  <p>The Loosness doth also greatly reign in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as well among those of the countrie as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Strangers, wherfore the English inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have given it the name of The country-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. Many are a great while troubled with it, and yet get no other harm: and those that betimes doe make use of good medicines, are without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great difficulty cured of it. But they that let the Loosness take its course, do commonly after some dayes get the bleeding with it, whereby the disease doth not only grow much more troublesome and painfull, but a great deal harde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That this disease, as also the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feavers, are so rife in Ireland, doth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come through the peculiar disposition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive wetness of the Air; but partly also through the errours which people do commit in eating and drinking, and other particulars: as manifestly doth appear by that a very great number, not only of the Natives, but also of the Strangers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
