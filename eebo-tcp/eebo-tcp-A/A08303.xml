            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A motiue to the prayer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Od the high guide of all godly attempts, &amp; the
beholder of all the deuises of man, requireth of
all men obedience to his will, &amp; prayer for his
ayde, without which, mans endeuours are but
as seed sowen on the sand, and as a foundation
laid vpon the waters. And therfore such as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
so high &amp; weightie a businesse as the businesse of warre,
must found it on the feare of God &amp; wade in it vnder his power
in prayer for his presence and ayde. For so did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> against
the king of <hi>Ashur, 2. King. 19.</hi> and preuailed, and <hi>Jehosophat</hi>
beeing endaungered with enemies, 2. <hi>Cron.</hi> 18. 31. prayed and
was preserued. God no doubt is so well pleased with this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of prayer, zealously and faithfully performed, as hee is
wonne so to regard the causes of his children, that although
they haue deserued the foyle by their sinnes, hee will yet giue
them the victorie in his mercies. The Israelites preuailed while
<hi>Moyses</hi> praied, and fell before the enemie when he was mute.
In many places it appeareth how needfull a thing prayer is, not
onely of them that are in the daunger of the battell, but of such
also as are secure at home in their houses, who if they neglect
the cause of God and their countrie, God will holde them not
onely vnprofitable droanes, but reprobates: and will giue them
the dregges of their neighbours daungers to drinke, and will
not affoord them the least shelter of his defending power in
their deepest perils. For if he in generall termes commaund vs
to pray at all times one for another: as <hi>Jam. 5. 16.</hi> much more
in the time of daunger and warre, especially for the cause of
Gods annoynted, and state of our countrie, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. 2. Let
no man therefore thinke that it conscerneth not him to praye
for the good of such as the Prince hath appoynted, for
the restauration of the peace of Gods Church, and quiet of our
Realme, by the suppressing of the violence, and quenching of
the furie of that bloudie <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and his rebellious adherents in
<hi>Ireland:</hi> for God is a iealous God, and holdeth no man guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
that maketh no conscience of his brothers daungers. And
such is the regard which hee hath of his owne glorie and his
<pb facs="tcp:3555:4"/>
prouidence for the preseruation of his children, that hee will
not admit any attempt, bee it in our owne eyes neuer so law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to bee taken in hande without him, without whome all
things and meanes are vaine. Our owne power, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and counsell, and multitudes of men, and munition,
and money, and what else soeuer wee vse for defending our
selues, or offending the enemie, are all as cloudes in the ayre
of our owne vaine conceites, that will vanish with the winde
of his displeasure, without any deawe of good successe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
our countrie. To pray for them that fight for vs, is the least
dutie, and an easie seruice: yet it preuaileth much if it be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.
And if we seeme colde in that, wherin can we be zealous
for our countrie? if carelesse of it, how can we say we loue our
owne liues, libertie, lands, wiues, or children? when all these
are subiect also to suddaine subuertion, without God that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
them vnto vs, &amp; vs in himselfe. Therefore as God hath
his eye of mercy fixed on his destressed people, to deliuer them,
and his eye of iudgement vpon the rebellious to confound
them: So let euery man make this generall cause his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
case. And for the preuenting of future perill, beare a part
with them that in our behalfes are employed in this seruice
abroad: let vs pray for them at home, while they encounter the
enemie abroad: Let vs I say, pray for them, that God will pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
them, and that we may prosper by their blessed successe.</p>

Maiestie &amp; glory, the absolute worker
of all things euen as thou wilt; Be
pleased in mercie to bee present with
thy seruantes, whome thou hast ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to goe forth against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the peace of thy childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in the
Realme of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And as thou art a

all the actons of men good and euill, shewing thy selfe a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
God, euen towards thine enemies, suffering them to
fill vp a great measure of outrage, violence, and bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou take vp the sword of reuenge against them: and
yet at the length, when in their owne conceites they seeme
most strong, and not to be vanquished, euen then thou liftest
vp thy deuouring sword, and consumest them. So deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be thou pleased to be a guide, a guard and a buckler vnto
thy seruant, whom thou hast chosen to go against that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
enemy <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who thirsting for and shedding the bloud,
of many of thy people, endeuoureth all rebellions mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,
to cast off the yoake of obedience both to thy word,
and to shine annoynted, to the great perill of thy Church,
which by his outragious wickednesse, standeth in daunger
of greater troubles, which violence of his (good father) and
the daungers by him and his adherents complotted, cannot
be stopped or preuented by man without thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3555:5"/>
S√©e therefore and beholde their mallice, and let thy powre
weaken their powre, who else will boast themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
th√©e,and saye their owne powre hath gotten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the victorie, and that by their owne pollicies, they are
become Lordes of thine heritage. Oh take part therefore
with thy seruants, and suppresse these rebels: then shall thy
praise be encreased, thy mercie and powre shall be s√©ene, and
thy name shall be for euer glorified. And though (deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
our sinnes doe make vs vnworthie of this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
yet for thine owne names sake deale mercifullie, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
good successe vnto their proc√©edings, that in thy name
haue vndertaken this worke of reducing that Realme to
Christian obedience. And the more the enemie s√©emeth to
swell eyther in furie or pride: weaken him so much the more
oh Lorde, and giue him sorrowe for his vaine hope. Let
nothing that he taketh in hand against thy people preuaile,
but let it appeare by his fall, how thou laughest his vaine
attempts to scorne. And let him know good father, that he
striueth against th√©e and against thine appointed in vaine.
Manifest thine anger against his deuises, by frustrating his
desires. Breake his enterprises, and bring his inuentions
as coales enkindled vpon his owne pate. Let him eyther

him and his companies a Father to comfort them, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to conduct them, and their God to preserue them. Let
their armies marche vnder the shelter of thy wings, make
strong their armes to the battell, and teach their fingers to
fight. Frame their hearts to feare thee, and not to faint at
their enemies power, giue them thy light to follow th√©e,
and let them euer be preserued by th√©e, let nothing necessarie
be wanting vnto them, but blesse them in all things. Giue
them wisdome from aboue, wherein they may vse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

and endeuour more effectually to plant thy sacred
