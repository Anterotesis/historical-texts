            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>I Remember your last Words at parting were, <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel; and God give his holy Spirit to instruct you.</hi> Which have run much in my Mind: For if the <hi>holy Spirit instruct us,</hi> what need is there of an Infallible Church? I hope those were not only words of course with you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
                     <p>No; but I meant that the <hi>holy Spirit should instruct you</hi> about the Authority of the Church.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Was this indeed your meaning? Then you would have me believe the Church Infallible, because the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> which is <hi>Infallible</hi> will instruct me about it, if I seek his Directions.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>But then I have no Reason to believe it; for the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> after my seeking <hi>his Instructions,</hi> teaches me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And if the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> is Infallible which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it teaches, then I am <hi>infallibly sure</hi> there is no such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> in what you call the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Come, come; you make too much of a sudden Expression at parting; I pray let us return to our main business, which is to shew, that there is <hi>the same Ground from Scripture, Reason, and Tradition, to believe Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100628:3"/>
                        <hi>as there is to believe the Trinity.</hi> And this I affirm again, after reading the <hi>Answers</hi> to the former <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;</hi> and I now come somewhat better prepared to make it out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>So you had need. And I hope I shall be able not only to defend the contrary, but to make it evident to you, that there is a mighty difference in these two Doctrines, as to <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Tradition.</hi> But I pray keep close to the Point: for I hate impertinent trifling in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of such Consequence.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I must confess, I over-shot my self a little in the former Dialogue, when I offer'd to prove the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity unreasonable and absurd:</hi> For no Church can make such a Doctrine, which is unreasonable and absurd in it self, not to be so to me; No Church can make <hi>three and one to be the same, if they be repugnant in themselves.</hi> But my meaning was, that Mens Disputes about these things will never be ended, till they submit to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>And then they may believe <hi>three, or three hundred Persons</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as the Church pleases. Is that your meaning?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No. But I said <hi>to my Carnal Reason</hi> it would appear so; but not to my Reason as under the Conduct of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Then an <hi>Infallible Guide</hi> can make <hi>three hundred to be but three;</hi> which is a notable trick of Infallibility.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No; I tell you I meant only that we are not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Carnal Reason,</hi> but the <hi>Church's Authority, i. e.</hi> we are not to search into Mysteries above Reason, but only believe what the Church delivers. And I intend now to argue the Point somewhat closely with you. Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there are any Mysteries in the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine above Reason, or not? If not, you must reject the <hi>Trinity;</hi> if you do, then you have no ground for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100628:3"/>
                        <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> because it is above Reason.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>You clearly mistake us; and I perceive were very little acquainted with our Doctrine: for we do not reject any Doctrine concerning God, meerly because it is above our Reason, when it is otherwise clearly proved from Scripture. For then we own our selves bound to submit in matters of Divine Revelation concerning an Infinite Being, though they be above our Capacity to comprehend them. But in matters of a <hi>finite Nature,</hi> which are far more easie for us to conceive, and which depend upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Sense, we may justly reject any Doctrine which overthrows that Evidence, and is not barely <hi>above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> but <hi>repugnant</hi> to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not well understand you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>So I believe; but I will endeavour to help your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding a little. And I pray consider these things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is a great difference in our Conceptions of <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite</hi> Beings. For, whatsoever is <hi>Infinite,</hi> is thereby owned to be above our Comprehension, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would not be Infinite. The Attributes of God which are essential to him, as his Wisdom, Goodness and Power, must be understood by us, so far as to form a true Notion of that Being which is Infinite; but then the <hi>Infinity</hi> of these Attributes is above our reach. And so his <hi>Infinite Duration,</hi> which we call <hi>Eternity;</hi> his Infinite Presence which we call his <hi>Immensity;</hi> the <hi>Infinite Extent</hi> of his <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as to future Contingencies; all these must be confessed to be <hi>Mysteries,</hi> not above our Reason, but above our Capacity. For we have great Reason to own them, but we have not Faculties to comprehend them. We cannot believe a God, unless we hold him to be Infinite in all Perfections: and if he be Infinite, he must be incomprehensible; so that Religion must be overthrown, if something incomprehensible be not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as to finite Beings, so far as they run into what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100628:4"/>
we call <hi>Infinite,</hi> they are so far out of our reach; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the insuperable Difficulties about the Infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility of Quantity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we have certain Notions of some things in the visible World; both that they are, and that they have some Attributes essential to them. We daily converse with things visible and corporeal; and if we do not conceive something true and certain in our Minds about them, we live in a Dream and have only Phantasms and Illusions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us. If we are certain that there are real Bodies, and not meer Appearances, there must be some certain way of conveying such Impressions to our Minds, from whence they may conclude, this is a Horse, and this a Man, and this is Flesh, and this Blood, and this is Wood, and this Stone; otherwise all certainty is gone, and we must turn meer Scepticks.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in examining the sense of Scripture we may make use of those certain Notions of visible things which God and Nature have planted in us; otherwise we are not dealt with as Reasonable Creatures. And therefore we must use those Faculties God hath given us, in reading and comparing Scriptures, and examining the sense that is offered by such Notions which are agreeable to the nature of things. As for instance, the Scripture frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributes <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> to the <hi>Almighty:</hi> must we presently believe God to have an Human Shape because of this? No; we compare these with the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Attributes of God, and from thence see a necessity of interpreting these Expressions in a Sense agreeable to the Divine Nature. So if other Expressions of <hi>Scripture</hi> seem to affirm that of a <hi>Body</hi> which is inconsistent with the Nature of it; as, that it is not visible, or may be in many Places at once, there is some Reason for me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them in a Sense agreeable to the Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Body.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100628:4"/>
4. There is a difference between our not apprehending the manner how a thing is, and the apprehending the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the thing it self. And this is the meaning of the distinction of Things <hi>above our Reason,</hi> and <hi>contrary to our Reason.</hi> If the Question be, how the same indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Nature can be communicated to three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? We may justly answer, we cannot apprehend the manner of it, no more than we can the <hi>Divine Immensity,</hi> or an <hi>Infinite Amplitude</hi> without <hi>Extension.</hi> But if any go about to prove there is an impossibility in the thing, he must prove that the Divine Nature can communicate it self no otherwise than a finite individual Nature can: For all acknowledg the same common Nature may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to three Persons, and so the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie rests on this single Point as to Reason; whether the Divine Nature and Persons are to be judged and measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as Human Nature and Persons are. And in this, I think we have the advantage in point of Reason of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-trinitarians</hi> themselves, although they pretend never so much to it.</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir, the Method is very natural; <hi>for in Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above Reason, the safest way is to trust Tradition. And none can give so good account of that as the Church.</hi>

                     <p>Take your own way: but I perceive <hi>Tradition</hi> with you is <hi>the Sense of the present Church;</hi> which is as hard to conceive, as that a <hi>Nunc stans</hi> should be an eternal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>

                     <p>As to comparing <hi>Tradition,</hi> I say, <hi>that the Mystery of the Trinity was questioned in the very Infancy of the Church, and the Arians prevail'd much against it in the beginning of the fourth Age; but Transubstantiation lay unquestion'd and quiet for a long time; and when it came into debate, there was no such opposition as that of</hi> Arius, <hi>to call in question the Authority of its Tradition; the Church received it unanimously, and in that Sense continued till rash Reason attempted to fathom the unlimited Miracles and Mysteries of God.</hi>

                     <p>I stand amazed at the boldness of this Assertion: But I find your present Writers are very little vers'd in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;</hi> which makes them offer things concerning the Ancient Church, especially as to <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which those who had been modest and learned, would have been ashamed of.</p>

                     <p>My Argument is, <hi>That the Doctrine of the Trinity met with far more Opposition than Transubstantiation did.</hi>

                     <p>Good Reason for it, because it was never heard of then.

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>That is your great Mistake; for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was very well known, but they did not happen to speak so much of it, because it was not opposed.</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I did not say, they did not speak of it, but not so much, or not <hi>half so express; because it is not customary for Men to argue unquestionable Truths.</hi>

And this I now prove, not from any slight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable Authors, but from some of the greatest Men in the Church in their time. I begin with St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> whose Epistle to <hi>Coesarius</hi> is at last brought to light by a learned Person of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; who makes no question of the Sincerity of it, and faith, <hi>The Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation which only he could find entire, was about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old;</hi> but he hath so confirm'd it by the <hi>Greek Fragments</hi> of it, quoted by Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, that there can be no suspicion left concerning it.</p>

                     <p>I say, it is impossible he should. For all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was about <hi>the Substance,</hi> and not about <hi>the Qualities,</hi> as appears by that very Epistle; for those <hi>Hereticks</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Christ had all the <hi>Properties</hi> of a Body left still; they do not deny that Christ could suffer, but they said, the Properties of a Body after the Union belonged to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> the Human Nature being swallowed up by the Union.

                     <p>I will deal freely with you by declaring, that not St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> only, but many others of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> did own the Bread after Consecration to be made the <hi>real Body of Christ;</hi> but not in your Sense, by changing <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> into that Body of Christ which is in Heaven; but by a <hi>Mystical Union,</hi> caused by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby the Bread becomes <hi>the Body of Christ,</hi> as that was which was conceived in the Womb of the Blessed Virgin. But this is quite another thing from <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> owns, that after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, <hi>The Bread and Wine are the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi>

                     <p>Do you then in earnest give up the Fathers as <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants</hi> to us; but retain them as <hi>Believers</hi> to your selves? But <hi>how should we know their Faith but by their Works?</hi>

                     <p>I perceive you have a mind to be pleasant; but my meaning was, that in <hi>Disputes</hi> Men may easily over-shoot themselves, and use ineffectual Arguments.</p>

                     <p>But is it possible to suppose they should draw Arguments from something against the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> As for instance; Suppose now we are disputing about <hi>Tran substantiation,</hi> you should bring an Argument from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100628:9"/>
                        <hi>Human Nature of Christ,</hi> and say, That as in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union the Substance is changed, and nothing but the Accidents remain; so it is in the Elements upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. Do you think I should not presently deny your Example, and say, your very Supposition is <hi>Heretical?</hi> So no doubt would the <hi>Eutychians</hi> have done in case the Faith of the Church had then been, that the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Elements was changed after <hi>Consecration.</hi> And the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> were the most sottish Disputants in the World, if they had not brought the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to prove their <hi>Heresy.</hi>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Methink you are very long upon this Argument; when shall we have done at this rate?</p>

                     <p>I take this for your best Answer; and so I proceed to a second <hi>Argument,</hi> which I am sure will not hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and that is from <hi>the natural and unsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Properties of Christ's Body;</hi> which are utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> And the force of the Argument in general lies in this, That the Fathers did attribute such things to the Body of Christ, which render it uncapable of being present in such a manner in the Sacrament as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> supposes. And no Men who understand themselves, will assert that at one time, which they must be bound to deny at another; but they will be sure to make an Exception or Limitation, which may reconcile both together. As if you should say, <hi>That the Body of Christ cannot be in more places than one at once, upon the Doctrine of St.</hi> Thomas; ye would presently add, with regard to the Sacrament, i. e. <hi>not in regard of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Presence, but in a Sacramental it may:</hi> So, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had an Opinion like yours as to the Body of Christ, they would have a Reserve, or Exception, as to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it appears by their Writings, that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute such <hi>Properties</hi> in general to the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, as overthrow any such Presence, without Exceptions or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100628:10"/>
Limitations. But that is not all: For I shall now prove,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they do attribute <hi>Circumscription</hi> to <hi>Christ's Body in Heaven,</hi> so as to exclude the possibility of its being upon Earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they deny any such thing, as <hi>the supernatural Existence of a Body after the manner of a Spirit.</hi>

                     <p>As soon as you please.

                     <p>No such matter. For I think the Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Finite and Infinite Being are incommunicable to each other, and I look on <hi>Ubiquity</hi> as one of them.</p>

                     <p>What then makes the <hi>same Impression</hi> on our Senses when the <hi>Substance</hi> is gone, as when it was there? Is there a perpetual Miracle to deceive our Senses? But it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to maintain <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as it is defined in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without <hi>Accidents:</hi> They may hold some other Doctrine in the place of it, but they cannot hold that. And that other Doctrine will be as impossible to be understood. For if once we suppose the Body of Christ to be in the Sacrament, in place of the <hi>Substance of the Bread,</hi> which appears to our Senses to be Bread still: Then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there be <hi>no Accidents,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> must make the same Impression on our <hi>Senses,</hi> which the <hi>Substance</hi> of Bread doth, which is so horrible an Absurdity, that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> of <hi>Accidents</hi> cannot imply any greater than it. So that the New <hi>Transubstantiators</hi> had as good return to the Old <hi>Mumpsimus</hi> of <hi>Accidents.</hi>

                     <p>No: I have something farther to say about it, which is, that the Fathers do not only assert, <hi>That Accidents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without their Subject,</hi> but they confute <hi>Hereticks</hi> on that Supposition; which shew'd their assurance of the Truth of it.</p>

                     <p>Not as to <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> for <hi>he believes more of his Senses than we do: for his Eyes tell him there is the Colour of Bread, and he assents to them; his Tongue, that it has the Taste of Bread, and he agrees to it: and so for his Smelling and Feeling:</hi> But then he hath a notable fetch in his Conclusion: viz. <hi>That his Ears tell him from the Words spoken by Christ himself, that it is the Body of Christ, and he believes these too. Is not here one Sense more than you believe? And yet you would persuade the World, that we do not believe our Senses.</hi>

                     <p>This is admirable Stuff; but it must be tenderly dealt with. For I pray what doth he mean when he saith, <hi>he believes from Christ's own Words, that it is the Body of Christ?</hi> What is this <hi>It?</hi> Is it the <hi>Accidents</hi> he speaks of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Are those <hi>Accidents</hi> then <hi>the Body of Christ?</hi> Is it the <hi>Substance of Bread?</hi> But <hi>that is not discerned by the Senses,</hi> he saith: and if it were, will he say, that the Substance of Bread is the Body of Christ? If neither of these, then his believing <hi>It is the Body of Christ,</hi> signifies nothing; for there can be no sense of <hi>it.</hi>

                     <p>You mistake him; for he saith, <hi>We are to believe our Senses, where they are not indisposed, and no Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation intervenes,</hi> which we believe there doth in this Case; and therefore, unless the Fathers speak of the Sacrament, we have no reason to regard their Testimonies in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                     <p>No such matter. It is the proper and genuine Sense of their Words; as will appear from hence.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) They assert the very same, as to the <hi>Chrism</hi> and <hi>Baptism,</hi> which they do as to the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>

                     <p n="2">(2.)

                     <p>The contrary hath been so plainly proved in a late excellent Discourse of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that I wonder none of your Party have yet undertaken to answer it; but they write on, as if no such Treatise had appear'd: I shall therefore wave all the Proofs that are there produced, till some tolerable Answer be given to them.</p>

                     <p>I have some Reason for it. Let us first agree what we mean by it. Do you mean the same which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth by it, in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Let us first see what that is. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares, <hi>That the same Body of Christ, which is in Heaven, is really, truly and substantially present in the Eucharist after Consecration, under the Species of Bread and Wine.</hi> And the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> saith, <hi>It is the very Body which was born of the Virgin, and sits at the right hand of God.</hi> (2.) <hi>That the Bread and Wine after Consecration, lose their proper Substances, and are changed into that very Substance of the Body of Christ.</hi> And an <hi>Anathema</hi> is denounced against those who affirm the contrary. Now if you please, proceed to your Proofs.</p>

                     <p>The Persons <hi>Ignatius</hi> speaks of, were such as denied Christ to have <hi>any true Body,</hi> and therefore did forbear the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> because it was said to be <hi>his Body.</hi> And in what ever Sense it were taken, it still supposed that which they denied, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had a true Body: For, if it were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively understood, it was as contrary to their Doctrine, as if it were literally. For a <hi>Figure</hi> must relate to a <hi>real Body,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> argued in this Case. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the <note place="margin">Tertull. c. Marcion. l. 4, c. 40.</note> same <hi>Epistle,</hi> mentions the trial Christ made of his true Body, by the Senses of his Disciples, <hi>Take hold of me, and handle me, and see, for I am no incorporeal Doemon; and immediately they touched him, and were convinced.</hi> Which happen'd but a few days after Christ had said, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gave a Rule for judging a true Body, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or spiritual Substance; <hi>A Spirit hath not Flesh and</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100628:18"/>
                        <hi>Bones, as ye see me have.</hi> Therefore it is very improbable that <hi>Ignatius</hi> so soon after, should assert that Christ's true and real Body was in the Eucharist, where it could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seen nor felt: For then he must overthrow the force of his former Argument. And to what purpose did Christ say, <hi>That a Spirit had not Flesh and Bones, as they saw him to have;</hi> if a Body of Christ might be so much after the <hi>manner of a Spirit,</hi> as tho it had Flesh and Bones, yet they could not possibly be discerned? But after all, suppose <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth speak of the Substance of Christ's Flesh, as present in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> yet he saith not a word of the <hi>changing of the Substance</hi> of the Bread into the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christ's Body;</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Apol. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Jesus Christ our Redeemer being made Man, had both Flesh and Blood for our Salvation; so also, we are taught that this Food, by which our Blood and Flesh are by a change nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being consecrated by the Power of the Word, is the Flesh and Blood of Jesus Christ incarnate:</hi> What say you to this?</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>I desire you to consider these things. (1.) That <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> doth not say, That the Bread and Wine are by Consecration changed into the <hi>Individual Flesh and Blood, in which Christ was Incarnate;</hi> but that, <hi>as by the Power of the Word, Christ once had a Body in the Womb of the Virgin; so by the Power of the same Word, upon Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Bread and Wine do become the Flesh and Blood of Christ Incarnate;</hi> so that he must mean a <hi>parallel,</hi> and not the <hi>same Individual Body,</hi> i. e. that as the <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> became the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> by the <hi>Power of the Holy Spirit;</hi> so the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> after Consecration, makes the Elements
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100628:19"/>
to become the Flesh and Blood of Christ, not by an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Union,</hi> but by <hi>Divine Influence,</hi> as <hi>the Church is the Body of Christ.</hi> And this was the true Notion of the Ancient Church, as to this matter, and the expressions in the <hi>Greek Liturgies</hi> to this day confirm the same. (2.) He doth not in the least imply that the <hi>Elements</hi> by this change do lose their <hi>Substance;</hi> for he mentions <hi>the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Bodies by it;</hi> but he affirms, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Substance remain, yet the <hi>Divine Spirit of Christ, by its Operation, doth make them become his Body.</hi> For we must observe, that he attributes <hi>the Body in the Womb,</hi> and <hi>on the Altar,</hi> to the same <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Divine Word.</hi> For he did not think <hi>Hypostatical Union</hi> necessary, to make the Elements become <hi>the Body of Christ,</hi> but a <hi>Divine Energy</hi> was sufficient, as the <hi>Bodies</hi> assumed by <hi>Angels</hi> are their <hi>Bodies,</hi> tho there be no such <hi>vital Union,</hi> as there is between the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body of a Man.</hi>

                     <p>I will give you a plain Argument against it; for he saith, <hi>Our Bodies are nourished by the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> Do you think that <hi>Irenoeus</hi> believed the <hi>substance of Christ's Body</hi> was turned into the <hi>substance of our Bodies,</hi> in order to their nourishment? No; he explained himself just before in the same place; <hi>De Calice qui est Sanguis ejus, nutritur; &amp; de pane qui est Corpus ejus; augetur:</hi> So that he attributes <hi>the nourishment</hi> to <hi>the Bread and Wine;</hi> and therefore must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>the substance</hi> of them to remain, since it is impossible a <hi>substantial nourishment</hi> should be made by meer <hi>Accidents.</hi> And withal, observe, he saith expresly, <hi>That the Bread</hi> is <hi>the Body of Christ;</hi> which your best Writers (such as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, Suarez</hi> and <hi>Vasquez)</hi> say, <hi>is inconsistent with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>

                     <p>You need not to recite more; for I yield that St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> delighted in the highest flights of his Eloquence, on this Subject, in his <hi>Homilies;</hi> and he tells for what Reason, to excite the Reverence and Devotion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But yet himself doth afford us a sufficient Key to these expressions, if we attend to these things concerning his manner of speaking:</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That he affirms those things which no side can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be literally understood. As when he so often speaks of <hi>our seeing and touching Christ upon the Altar,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation: For Christ is utterly invisible on the Altar, even by Divine Power,</hi> saith <hi>Suarez.

                        <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> was a Man of Fancy, and he shewed it in that <hi>Catechetical Discourse:</hi> However, <hi>Fronto Ducoeus</hi> thought it <hi>a notable place to prove Transubstantiation,</hi> which I wonder at, if he attended to the Design of it; which was to shew, that as our Bodies, by eating, became subject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, so by eating they become capable of Immortality; and this he saith, <hi>Must be by receiving an immortal Body into our B dies, such as the Body of Christ was:</hi> But then, saith he, <hi>how could that body, which is to remain whole in it self, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to all the faithful over the whole Earth?</hi> He answers, by saying, <hi>That our Bodies do consist of Bread and Wine, which are their proper Nourishment; and Christ's Body being like ours, that was so too; which by the Uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

He goes on therefore, <hi>so I believe the sanctified Bread, by the power of the Word of God, to be changed into the Body of God the Word.</hi> Not into that <hi>Individual Body,</hi> but after the same <hi>manner,</hi> by a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or <hi>God the Word</hi> in it; and that this was his meaning, doth evidently appear by what follows. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Body, viz.</hi> to which, he was <hi>Incarnate, was sanctified by the Inhabitation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, dwelling in the Flesh; therefore, as the Bread was then changed into a Divine Dignity in the Body, so it is now; and the Bread is changed into the Body of the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>he was truly Incarnate; and that we are to judg of this; not by carnal Reason, but by the Words of Christ,</hi> who said, <hi>My Flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed.</hi>

                     <p>I do not deny this to be <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Sense. But yet this proves nothing like to <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> For it amounts to no more than a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body of Christ in the Sacrament; and you can make no Argument from hence, unless you can prove that the Body of Christ cannot be present, unless the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> be destroy'd, which is more than can be done, or than <hi>Hilary</hi> imagined. All that he aimed at, was to prove a <hi>real Union</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and his People, <hi>That Christ was in them more than by meer consent;</hi> and to prove this, he lays hold of those words of our Saviour, <hi>My Flesh is meat indeed,</hi> &amp;c. But the substantial Change of the Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body, signifies nothing to his purpose; and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> never so much as mentions <hi>Hilary</hi> in his proofs of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but only for the <hi>real Presence.</hi> But I must add something more, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Hilary</hi> was one of the <hi>first</hi> who drew any Argument from the <hi>literal Sense of John</hi> 6. I do not say, who did by way of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> apply them to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which others might do before him. But yet, there are some of the eldest Fathers, who do wholly exclude a literal Sense, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> look'd on it, <hi>As an Absurdity</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tertul de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur. carn. c. 37. Orig. hom. 7. in Levit.</note> 
                        <hi>that Christ should be thought truly to give his Flesh to eat.

                     <p>I answer, several things for clearing of his meaning. (1.) That St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth parallel <hi>the Change</hi> in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> with that in <hi>Baptism;</hi> and to prove <hi>Regeneration therein,</hi> he argues from the <hi>miraculous Conception of Christ in the Womb of the Virgin;</hi> but in Baptism no body supposes <note place="margin">C. 3.</note> the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> to be taken away; and therefore it cannot hold as to the other, from the <hi>Supernatural Change;</hi> which may be only with respect to such a <hi>Divine Influence,</hi> which it had not before Consecration. (2.) He doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely talk obscurely and mystically about this matter, as the Fathers were wont to do to those, who were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to these <hi>Mysteries.</hi> Sometimes one would think he meant that the Elements are changed into <hi>Christ's Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Body born of the Virgin:</hi> and yet presently after, he distinguishes between the <hi>true Flesh of Christ, which was crucified and buried, and the Sacrament of his Flesh.</hi> If this were the same, what need any distinction? And that this <hi>Sacramentum Carnis,</hi> is meant of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is plain by what follows; for he cites Christ's words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> (3.) He best explains his own meaning, when he saith, not long after, <hi>That the body of Christ in the Sacrament, is a Spiritual body, or a body produced by the Divine Spirit;</hi> and so he parallels it with <hi>that spiritual Food, which the</hi> Israelites <hi>did eat in the Wilderness:</hi> And no man will say, that the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Manna</hi> was then lost. And since your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors make the same St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to have written the Book <hi>De Sacramentis,</hi> there is a notable passage therein, which helps to explain this; for there he saith expresly, <hi>Non iste</hi>

                        <hi>passes into the Body, but the Bread of Eternal Life, which strengthens the Substance of our Soul.</hi> Where he not only calls it <hi>Bread</hi> after <hi>Consecration,</hi> which goes to <hi>our Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but he distinguishes it from <hi>the Bread of Eternal Life, which supports the Soul,</hi> which must be understood of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> and not of any <hi>Bodily Substance.</hi>

                     <p>Not one. And I hope this gives an incomparable Advantage to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in point of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> above <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> when I have not only proved, that the greatest of the Fathers expresly denied it, but that there is not one in the whole number who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. For altho there were some difference in the way of explaining how the Eucharist was the Body and Blood of Christ; yet not one of them hitherto produced, doth give any countenance to your Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declared to have been <hi>the constant belief of the Church in all Ages;</hi> which is so far from being true, that there is as little ground to believe that, as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it self. And so much as to this Debate, concerning the comparing the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> in point of <hi>Tradition;</hi> if you have any thing to say further, as to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> I shall be ready to give you Satisfaction the next Opportunity.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>I Hope you are now at Leisure to proceed with your parallel between the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Transubstantiation, as to Scripture and Reason.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and am resolved to make good all that I have said, as to both those.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>And if you do, I will yield the Cause.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I begin with <hi>Scripture.</hi> And the whole Dispute as to both, depends on this: Whether the Scripture is to be understood Literally or Figuratively. If Literally, then Transubstantiation stands upon equal terms with the Trinity; if Figuratively, then the Trinity can no more be proved from Scripture, than Transubstantiation.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>As tho there might not be Reason for a <hi>figurative Sense</hi> in one place, and a <hi>literal</hi> in another.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>It seems then, you resolve it into Reason.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>And I pray, into what would you resolve it? Into no Reason?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Into the Authority of the Church.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Without any Reason?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No: There may be Reason for that Authority, but not for the thing which I believe upon it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you believe the Doctrine of the Trinity, meerly, because the Church tells you it is the literal Sense of Scripture which you are to follow. But suppose a Man sees no Reason for this Authority of your Church; (as for my part, I do not) have you no Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince such a one that he ought to believe the Trinity?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Not I. For I think Men are bound to believe as the Church Teaches them, and for that Reason.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>What is it, I pray, to believe?</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>To believe, is to give our Assent to what God reveals.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>And hath God revealed the Doctrine of the Trinity to the Church in this Age?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No; it was revealed long ago.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>But whence come you to know that the Church is to give the Sense of the Scriptures? Is it from the Scripture, or not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>From the Scripture doubtless, or else we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon the Churches Testimony.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>But suppose the Question be, about the Sense of these places which relate to the Churches Authority, how can a Man come to the certain Sense of them?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100628:28"/>
the sense of Scripture from the Authority of the Church, and the Authority of the Church from the sense of Scripture.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you not say so in plain terms?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Give me leave to answer for my self. I say in the case of the Churches Authority, I believe the Sense of Scripture without relying on the Churches Authority.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>And why not as well in any other? Why not as to the Trinity, which to my understanding, is much plainer there, than the Churches Authority?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>That is strange: Is not the Church often spoken of in Scripture? <hi>Tell the Church. Upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>But we are not about the Word <hi>Church,</hi> which is no doubt there, but the Infallible Authority of the Church; and whether that be more clear in the Scripture than the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I see you have a mind to change your Discourse, and to run off from the Trinity to the Churches Authority in Matters of Faith; which is a beaten Subject.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Your Church doth not tell you so; and therefore you may upon your own grounds be deceived; and I assure you that you are so; for I intended only to shew you, that for Points of Faith we must examine and compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our selves, and our Faith must rest on Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein contained.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you think the Trinity can be proved from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Or else I should never believe it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>But those places of Scripture you go upon, may bear a <hi>figurative Sense,</hi> as John 10. 30. <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> and 1 John 5. 7. <hi>And those three are one;</hi> and if they do so, you can never prove the Trinity from them.</p>

                     <p>Do not you see already? <hi>viz.</hi> that God cannot be supposed to allow Divine Worship to be given to Christ, if he were a mere Creature; and therefore since such Divine Worship is required by the Christian Doctrine, it follows, that those expressions which speak of his being <hi>One with the Father,</hi> cannot be <hi>figuratively</hi> understood.</p>

                        <hi>Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever,</hi> Revel. 4. 13. <hi>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in earth, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 2. 9. If it were Gods great design, by the Christian Doctrine, to restore in the world a due sense of the infinite distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his Creatures; could any thing be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it, than in the same Doctrine to advance a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a participation of the same Divine Honour with himself? So that in plain truth, the Idolatry of the world lay only in a bad choice of the Creatures they were to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and not in giving proper Divine Worship to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for that Christianity it self not only allows, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, on supposition that Christ were God merely by Office, and was originally a Creature, as we are. But I pray observe the force of the Apostles Argument, speaking of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Idolatry; he saith it lay in this, <hi>That they did service unto them, which by Nature are no Gods,</hi> Gal. 4. 8.</p>

                     <p>You know, I must now personate the <hi>Anti-Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;</hi> and he answers, That <hi>by Nature</hi> no more is implied, than <hi>truly and really,</hi> i. e.

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you make it lawful by the Gospel to believe Christ to be a mere Creature, and at the same time to give him Divine Worship, which supposes him not to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and so you must believe him to be a Creature, and not to be a Creature, at the same time.</p>

                     <p>From your own words; for you say, proper Divine Worship lies in a due esteem of God in our minds, as the first Cause and last End, and in actions agreeable thereto; then to give Divine Worship to God, we must believe him to be above all Creatures as to his Nature and Being; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100628:31"/>
to give Christ Divine Worship, must imply our believing him not to be a Creature, and to be a Creature at the same time.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>Then the Sin of <hi>Gentile-</hi>Idolatry lay only in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Divine Worship to a Creature without Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which lessens it to that degree, as to make Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship and Idolatry the same; and to blame the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, for making such a dreadful Sin of it, and disswading Christians so much from returning to the Practice of it: <note place="margin">
                           <p>Rom. 1. 21, 23, 24.</p>
                           <p>1 Cor. 10. 7, 14.</p>
                           <p>1 Joh. 5. 21.</p>
                        </note> For they had the priviledg of giving Divine Worship to a Creature by Gods command, which others were damned for doing without a command; which makes the Christian Religion not to appear so reasonable, as the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> contend it is. But here are four foul mistakes in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> which they are guilty of. (1.) In making the Sin of Idolatry so Arbitrary a thing; which depends not on the Nature of the Object which is worshipped, but on the will and Pleasure of God. (2.) In making the <hi>Gentiles</hi> guilty of a great Sin, meerly in wanting a Divine command, which was out of their Power. (3.) In making the Christian Religion to set up the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a Creature, when its design was to root out Idolatry. (4.) In making a Fictitious God, or a Creature to be advanced to the Throne of God. Which I think is far more contradictious to Reason, than a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the same Nature. For nothing can be more absurd than to make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100628:31"/>
that to be God, which wants all the essential Attributes and Perfections of God; as every Creature must do: Such as Self-Existence, Eternity, Independency, Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, Omnipotency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What a Contradiction is it, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a weak, impotent, depending, confined, created God? And such every Creature must be in its Nature, or else it is no Creature. I do not at all wonder to find the <hi>Socinians</hi> after this, to lessen the natural knowledg of God, and his infinite Perfections, both as to Power and Knowledg; for it was their concernment to bring the Notion of God as low as possible, that a Creature might be in the nearer Capacity of being made God. But those who consider and know what God is, and what he must be, if he be God, will find far greater difficulty in making Man to be God, than in believing God to be made Man. For This implies no greater difficulty, than meerly as to our Conception, how an infinite Being can be so united to a finite, as to become one Person; which implies no repugnancy, but only some thing above our Capacity to comprehend. And we confess our selves puzled in the manner of conceiving how a finite Spitit, which can pass through a Body, can be so united to it, as to make a Man by that Union; yet we all acknowledg the Truth of this. But to suppose a Creature capable of being made God, is to overthrow the essential difference between God and his Creatures, and the infinite Distance between them. Which is of very pernicious Consequence, as to the great ends of the Christian Religion, which were to reform the World, and to restore the Distinction between God and his Creatures; which by the prevalency of Idolatry was almost lost in the World: The Supreme God being hardly discerned in such a croud of created and fictitious Gods. And this very Argument is enough to turn my Stomack against <hi>Socinianism</hi> or <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi>

                        <hi>It is said, Joh.</hi> 10. 30. I and my Father are one; <hi>now it is highly unreasonable to interpret these words literally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those which follow.</hi>

                     <p>How doth that appear? For <hi>v.</hi> 31. it is said, <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>took up stones to stone him:</hi> Which shews, that they look'd on him as speaking Blasphemy. But what Blasphemy was it for Christ to declare an Unity of Consent between him and his Father; which in Truth is nothing, but doing his Father's Will? Therefore it is plain that the <hi>Jews</hi> did apprehend more in those Words of our Saviour. And they explain themselves, <hi>v.</hi> 33. what they understood by them, <hi>Because that thou being a Man, makest thy self God.</hi> Which shews that they thought not an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Consent,</hi> but of <hi>Nature,</hi> was meant.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>But Christ's answer shews, that he speaks only of a <hi>God by Office,</hi> and not <hi>by Nature,</hi> v. 34. <hi>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, I said ye are Gods?</hi>

                     <p>I pray go on, and see how Christ argues, v. 35, 36. <hi>If he called them Gods, unto whom the Word of God came,</hi>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100628:32"/>
                        <hi>and the Scripture cannot be broken; say ye of him, whom the Father hath sent into the World, Thou blasphemest, because I said I am the Son of God?</hi>

                     <p>This only shews that Christ had greater Reason to be called <hi>God,</hi> but not that he was so by Nature.</p>

                     <p>I pray go on still, v. 37, 38. <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, tho ye believe not me, believe the Works, that ye may know and believe that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in me, and I in him.</hi>

                     <p>Is it not said elsewhere, <hi>That he that keepeth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dwelleth in him, and he in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. Would you hence infer an Unity of Nature between Christ and Believers?</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not lay the weight on the Phrase, but as it is the Conclusion of the Dispute between Christ and the <hi>Jews.</hi> And it ought to be observed, that this was the end of the third Conference between Christ and the <hi>Jews</hi> upon this Argument. The first was <hi>John</hi> 5. and then from Christ's saying, <hi>The Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> v. 17. the <hi>Jews</hi> infer'd v. 18. <hi>That he made himself equal with God.</hi> In the second Conference, <hi>John</hi> 8. he said, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> v. 58. <hi>And then the</hi> Jews <hi>took up stones to cast at him.</hi> After this followed this third Conference, <hi>John.</hi> 10. and this runs again into the same point, <hi>That he being a Man, made himself God.</hi> And these Conferences were all publick, in or near the Temple, and this last was in <hi>Solomons Porch, John</hi> 10. 23. a Place of great resort, and near the place where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> sate, who were the Judges in the Case of Blasphemy. Now the force of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from hence, lies in these things:</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That Christ certainly knew, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did think by his Discourse, <hi>That he made himself equal with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100628:33"/>
2. That if it were not true, it was notorious Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and so esteemed by the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That such a mistake ought to have been presently corrected, and in the plainest manner; as we find it was done by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when the men of <hi>Lystra</hi> said, <hi>The Gods are come down to us in the likeness of men;</hi> for he ran in present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them, and said, <hi>We are men of like passions with you,</hi> Acts 14. 11, 15. It is impossible for me to think, that if Christ had known himself to be a meer man, he would have suffered the <hi>Jews</hi> to have run away with such a mistake as this, without giving them the clearest and plainest infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; whereas in all his Answers he vindicates himself, and endeavours rather to fasten those Impressions upon them, as appears by this conclusion of the last Conference, <hi>That ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> Doth this look like correcting a dangerous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in the <hi>Jews?</hi> And is it not rather a justification of that sense, which they took his words in? And in the first Conference, <hi>John</hi> 5. Our Saviour is so far from doing as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, that he challenges Divine Honour as due to himself, <hi>That all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> v. 23. From whence it follows, that Christ must be charged as one, who being a meer man, did affect Divine Honour; or else, that being <hi>God</hi> as well as Man, he looked on it as justly due to him. I pray tell me what sense do your Friends the <hi>Socinians</hi> make of those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 7. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no Reputation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>The sense they give, is this, that he did not make a shew or Ostentation of his own Greatness, but studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concealed it, and therein shewed his great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>But is there any Greatness like that of <hi>Divine Honour?</hi> and yet this he challenged to himself.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>But he knew what the Father designed him for, and so spake those things by way of Prediction.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>He knew no Creature could deserve Divine Worship, and he deliver'd that as part of his own Doctrine; and therefore those Words, where he is said, <hi>to make himself equal with God,</hi> must be understood of <hi>Nature,</hi> and not of <hi>Office.</hi>

                     <p>But St. <hi>John</hi> 17. 22. saith, that Christ prayed to his Father, for his Disciples, <hi>That they may be one, as we are one;</hi> and that is not by Unity of Nature.</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant it. But our Saviour there speaks of a true, but a lower kind of Unity; or else the <hi>Socinians</hi> must think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer as capable of Divine Honour, as Christ himself, if they take those Words strictly, <hi>That they may be one, as we are one.</hi>

                     <p>Who doubts but there are other sorts of Unities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that of Nature? But, doth this prove that there is no Unity of Nature between the Father and the Son? If we have no better Arguments against Transubstantiation, we will give over disputing.</p>

                     <p>I know you have other Arguments for the Trinity, but they prove as little without the Authority of the Church; as <hi>from those places where Christ is called God,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>And I think the Argument from those places, very good and strong, especially from <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. and it seems directly contrary to the whole design of Scripture to call any one <hi>God over all, Blessed for evermore,</hi> as Christ is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. but he that is God by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce.</hi>

                     <p>How do you prove that <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. relates to any thing beyond <hi>the beginning of the Gospel, and that Christ the Word, was before</hi> John <hi>the Baptists Preaching?</hi>

                     <p>I desire any one to read the Text impartially, and he will find the <hi>Socinian</hi> sense to be unnatural, forced, obscure and jejune, proving a thing of no moment at that time; but the Sense we give, to be strong, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, consistent, and of very great Consequence at that time, when the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> denied the Divinity of Christ. The Sentences are short, the Words lofty and significant, the manner of beginning unusual; so that any one would expect some great and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter to be said in these few Verses; but what a frustration were this, if after all, they intended no more, than that altho <hi>John Baptist</hi> preached in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick before <hi>Christ,</hi> yet that Christ was in being before that? Which is a Sense so mean, so remote from the occasion of his Writing, as it is deliver'd by the Ancients, that nothing but a miserable necessity could make Men of Wit and Subtilty to put such a Sense upon St. <hi>John</hi>'s Words.</p>

                     <p>The first place is a proof for the Divinity of Christ; for the Words are; <hi>But unto the Son,</hi> he saith, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, in the next verse, it is said with respect to his Office, <hi>Therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> &amp;c. But we do not deny that Christ was anointed as Mediator, and in that respect, God was his God; but doth this prove that he that is Mediator, cannot have a Divine Nature in Conjunction with the Human?</p>
                     <p>The second Place, I suppose, is mistaken, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. not 4. and 5. but 6 verse, <hi>But unto us, there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> And this is one of the strongest holds of the <hi>Socinians.</hi> But two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations will take off the seeming force of it.</p>

(1.) That the Apostle in his disputes with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Idolaters, concerning whom he speaks, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. doth utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny any Divinity in the Beings they worshipped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of God, when he saith, <hi>An Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</hi> He knew very well that they worshipped many, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>As there be Gods many, and Lords many among them; but unto us</hi> (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) <hi>there is but one God, and one Lord:</hi> i. e. we have but one Supreme God, to whom we give Divine Worship; and instead of the multitude of <hi>Mediators,</hi> we have but <hi>one Mediator;</hi> and so his design is in opposition to their <hi>many Gods,</hi> to assert the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> (not so as to exclude a distinction of Persons, but thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude other Gods as the proper Object of Worship), and the <hi>Unity</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> in opposition to their <hi>many Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) That if this place excludes Christ from the Unity of Nature with God, it doth exclude him from being the Object of Divine Worship; for it saith, <hi>That there is no other God, but One;</hi> therefore no Creature can be made God: <hi>And to us there is but One God, the Father;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son cannot be God. If therefore the name <hi>Lord</hi> be taken in opposition to <hi>God,</hi> then Christ cannot be <hi>God</hi> in any sense; for we must have but <hi>One God:</hi> but the plain meaning of the Apostle was, That by <hi>one Lord</hi> he meant <hi>one Mediator,</hi> by whom alone we have, in this new frame of things by the Gospel, access unto God the Father.</p>
                     <p>The third place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27, 28. speaks plainly of Christs Kingdom, as Mediator.</p>
                     <p>The fourth place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. where Christ speaks seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times of <hi>my God,</hi> proves no more than his words on the Cross, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me:</hi> For surely Christ might own a particular Relation to God, and Interest in him, as he was in human Nature, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Divine Nature in him.</p>

                     <p>The Son there spoken of, was Christ, as endued with a human Soul, when he was upon earth; which could not understand a secret so much out of the reach of mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, without immediate Revelation. But it was not necessary by virtue of the Union of both Natures, that the Divine Nature should communicate to the human Soul of Christ all Divine Mysteries: but as the human Body was notwithstanding subject to Passions and Infirmities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to it, so the human Soul might continue ignorant of the Day of Judgment in this state; both to let us know how great that secret is, and that Christ had the proper capacity of a human Soul, which could not extend to such things without Divine Revelation.</p>

                     <p>There is one Argument more, which seems to prove Christs Divinity, and doth not; <hi>viz. The making of all things visible and invisible, being attributed to him,</hi> John 1. 3. Heb. 1. 10. Col. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>

                     <p>Now I confess this doth more than seem to me to be a very strong Argument; and that for this Reason, the Apostle saith, <hi>The invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. Was this Argument of the Apostle good or not?</p>

                     <p>Then if <hi>the making of all things</hi> be attributed to Christ, he must be true God; but this is plain in the New Testament, in which the making of all things is as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to the Son, as it is to the Father; <hi>All things</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100628:36"/>
saith St. <hi>John, were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made,</hi> John 1. 3. <hi>For by him were all things created,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, and for him,</hi> Col. 1. 16. <hi>Thou, Lord, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hast laid the Foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands,</hi> Heb. 1. 10. Now compare these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with those wherein the Creation is attributed to the Father, <hi>The world</hi> is said <hi>to be made by bim,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. <hi>That he hath created all things,</hi> Rev. 4. 11. <hi>That of him, and for him, and to him, are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 36. And let any impartial mind discern the difference. Therefore we have as much Reason from Scripture to believe Christ to be God, as we have from the Creation of things to believe a God.</p>

                     <p>But you do not take notice of the different expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Scripture, concerning the Father and the Son; <hi>All things are said to be of the Father, and by the Son,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>And that the Father created all things by Jesus Christ,</hi> Eph. 3. 9. which proves no more, than that the Son was Gods Instrument in the Creation.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1.) Where the new Creation is spoken of, some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are added, which limit the sense to it, as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We are created in Christ Jesus unto good works that we shoul walk in them.</hi> Eph. 2. 10. VVho could possibly understand this of the old Creation? And so, <hi>If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. But in the other places the same Expressions are used, which are attributed to the old Creation, without limitation from circumstances, or from the Context and occasion of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There are some things said to be created by <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> which cannot relate to the new Creation; for <hi>by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, or principalities or Powers.</hi> Col. 1. 16. How are these created by Preaching the Gospel, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the proper means of it, which are the Doctrine of the remission of Sins upon Repentance, and the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sanctifiing Grace of God?</p>

                        <hi>and express for Transubstantiation, but learned and acute Men may doubt whether it can be drawn from it, setting aside the Churches Declaration.</hi> But neither <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> nor any one who attends to the force of the former Proofs of the Divinity of Christ, can say, that any <hi>reasonable Man</hi> can doubt of it; and that he must at last resolve all into the Church's Authority.</p>

                     <p>For the first, it seems very absurd, that there should be three Persons really distinct, whereof every one is God, and yet there should not be three Gods; for nothing is more contradictions than to make three not to be three, or three to be but one.</p>

                     <p>I hope now you will give me leave to make an Answer to your Difficulty, as distinct as possible. We do not say, that three Persons are but one Person, or that one Nature is three Natures; but that there are three Persons in one Nature. If therefore one Individual Nature be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100628:39"/>
communicable to three Persons, there is no appearance of Absurdity in this Doctrine. And on the other side, it will be impossible there should be three Gods, where there is one and the same Individual Nature; for three Gods must have three several Divine Natures, since it is the Divine Essence which makes a God. But to make this more plain, Do you make any difference between <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person?</hi>

                     <p>I will begin with <hi>Person.</hi> Which Name was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally taken among the <hi>Romans</hi> from some remarkable distinction of one from another; either by some outward appearance, as a Vizard or Habit, or some particular Quality or Disposition. And from hence it came to be applied to those inward Properties, whereby one Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being is distinguished from another; and from those Properties, to the Person who had them. Thus <hi>Person</hi> is used even by <hi>Tully</hi> himself, at least twenty times in his Books of Rhetorick: and the old Civil Law speaks of <hi>Personal Rights</hi> and <hi>Personal Actions.</hi> So that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, such as <hi>Valla,</hi> and others, had no cause to find fault with <hi>Boethius,</hi> for applying the Notion of a <hi>Person,</hi> to an <hi>intelligent Being subsisting by it self,</hi> (and so the Soul is no Person in Men, but the Man consisting of Soul and Body) <hi>having some incommunicable Properties belonging to him.</hi> Therefore I cannot but wonder at the niceness of some late Men, who would have the Names of <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi> to be laid aside; since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess <hi>Boëthius</hi> his definition of a Person to be true enough; but they say, <hi>it belongs to the Creatures, and not to God, for it would make three Gods.</hi> Which is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, without proving it, that the Divine Nature can
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100628:40"/>
communicate it self after no other manner than a created Nature can.</p>
                     <p>This is now to be more strictly enquired into. And it is very well observed by <hi>Boëthius, de Trin. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um pluralitatis alteritas est: That Diversity is the Reason of Plurality:</hi> And therefore in the Trinity, so far as they are different, they are three, <hi>i. e.</hi> in regard of <hi>Personal Properties and Relations;</hi> but so far as they agree, they are but O N E, that is, as to the Divine Nature.</p>
                     <p>It is very true, that according to Arithmetick, <hi>Three cannot be One, nor One Three;</hi> but we must distinguish between the bare Numeration, and the Things numbred. The repetition of <hi>three Units,</hi> certainly makes three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Numbers; but it doth not make <hi>three Persons</hi> to be <hi>three Natures.</hi> And therefore as to the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we must go from the bare <hi>Numbers</hi> to consider their <hi>Nature.</hi> Where-ever there is a real distinction, we may multiply the Number, tho the Subject be but One. As suppose we say the Soul hath three Faculties, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Will and Memory; we may, without the least absurdity say, <hi>there are Three and One;</hi> and those three not confounded with each other, and yet there is but One Soul.</p>

                     <p>But the <hi>Socinians</hi> object, that there is a difference between <hi>three Properties,</hi> and <hi>three distinct Persons;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a <hi>Person is an Individual Being;</hi> and so three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be three Individual Beings; and therefore as there is but one Divine Being, there can be but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

                     <p>This is the main strength of the Cause; to which I answer, That altho a <hi>Person</hi> be an Individual Being, yet it implies two Things in it; (1.) Something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others of the same Nature; as three Men have one and the same Nature, tho they be three Persons. (2.) Something peculiar and incommunicate to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100628:40"/>
so that <hi>John</hi> cannot be <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Peter, James.</hi>

                     <p>But what is it which makes one not to be the other, when they have the same common Nature?</p>

                     <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                     <p>You ask a hard Question, <hi>viz.</hi> about the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Individuation;</hi> but if it be so hard to resolve it, as to created Beings, there is certainly far less Reason for us to be unsatisfied, if it appear difficult to clear the Difference of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> in an infinite Being. Yet all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are agreed in the Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the same Nature, and a real Distinction of Persons among Men, tho they cannot tell what that is which discriminates the Humane Nature in <hi>John,</hi> from the same Humane Nature in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James.</hi> And it is observable, that as Beings arise in Perfection above each other, it is still so much harder to assign that which is called the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Individuation.</hi> In gross and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Beings we can discern a number of Accidents, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Modes and Properties, which distinguish them from each other; but it is much harder to assign it in Spiritual and Intellectual Beings, whose Natures and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences lie not so open to our Understandings. If so be then it appears more difficult in an infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Being, what Cause have we to wonder at it?</p>
                     <p>But we must always make a difference between what we have reason to believe, and what we have a power to conceive. Altho we have all the Reason in the World to believe that there is a God, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Being Infinite in all Perfections; yet we must yield that his Essential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are above our comprehension.</p>
                     <p>As for Instance;</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) We must believe God to be Eternal, or we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe him to be God. For, if he once were not, it is impossible he should ever be. And therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude necessary Existence to be an Essential Attribute of the Divine Nature. But then, how to conceive that a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100628:41"/>
Being should be from it self, is at least as hard, as how one and the same Individual Nature should be communicated to three distinct Persons; nay, it is somewhat harder, since we see something like this in other Beings; but we can see no manner of Resemblance of a thing that hath its Being wholly from it self.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) We must allow God to be <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> or else we must suppose him so confined and limited to a certain place, as to be excluded from any other; and if he can Act in all Places, he must either be present in them, or his Power must be larger than his Being, which is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; but after this, we have not a Power to conceive how a Being should be present in the whole World, and not to be extended; and if it be extended, how it should be uncapable of being divided into Parts; which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly repugnant to the Divine Nature. I therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these two Instances, to let the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> see, that what they object in Point of Reason as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility of the Mystery of the Trinity, will in consequence overthrow the Divine Nature. But as there is the highest Reason to believe there is a God, tho we cannot comprehend his Perfections; so there may be great Reason to believe the Doctrine of the Trinity, tho we cannot comprehend the manner of it.</p>

                     <p>It is a good step to our believing it, to make it plain, that the Difficulty of our Conception ought not to hinder our Faith. And I have made some advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the explication of it, by shewing, that since Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are agreed about the difference between <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> the whole Difficulty comes to this, that the same common Nature in Mankind makes three Persons; but that it is the same Individual Nature in all the Persons of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100628:41"/>
And now let us consider the Infinite Perfection and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Divine Nature; and we shall think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable that it should be so bounded as to the manner of its Communication, as the Nature of Man is. Every Individual Man hath not only Individual Properties, but an Individual Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> the common Nature of Man, limited by some unaccountable Principle, that doth make him different from all other Men having the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with himself. The Difficulty then doth not lie in a <hi>Community</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and a <hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> for that is granted among Men, but in <hi>the Unity of Nature</hi> with the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>Persons.</hi> And supposing the Divine Nature to be infinite in its Perfection, I do not see how it is capable of being bounded, as the common Nature of Man in Individuals is; and if it be not capable of being bounded and limited, it must diffuse it self into all the Persons in the same individual manner; and so this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is not repugnant to <hi>Reason.</hi>

                     <p>I doubt that; but at present we are upon the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian Creed.</hi> And I desire but one Principle to clear it, which follows from what is said already, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is affirmed of the Divine Nature, as such, must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all three Persons; but whatever is affirmed of the several Persons, as such, must be peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Now this is a clear Principle of Reason, and hath no appearance of absurdity in it. And from hence the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi> will easily be cleared. For <hi>Eternity, Incomprehensibility, Omnipotency,</hi> belonging to the Divine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100628:42"/>
Nature, as such, we ought to say, <hi>That they are not three Eternals, three Incomprehensibles, three Almighties, but One Eternal, One Incomprehensible, One Almighty.</hi> Because the Attributes belonging to the Persons, by reason of the Divine Nature, and the Attributes being really the same with it, the Nature is the proper Subject of them; which being but One, we are not to distinguish them as to <hi>Essential Attributes,</hi> but only as to <hi>Personal Relations</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi>

                     <p>This seems the hardest Expression in the whole Creed; but it is to be interpreted by the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it: Which is, that the <hi>Essential Attributes</hi> are not to be distinguished, though the <hi>Persons</hi> be. And so <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> is not taken as a <hi>Personal Attribute,</hi> but as <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;</hi> and so they are not <hi>three Eternals,</hi> but <hi>one Eternal.</hi> And the great Design of the Creed was, to shew, that the Christian Church did not believe such a Trinity as consisted of <hi>three Persons, unequal</hi> and different in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Duration.</hi>

                     <p>This is off from our Business. But to let you see I will not avoid the Difficulties you offer, I will give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer even to this. The meaning is not, that every one is damned who doth not conceive aright of the Difference of Nature and Person in the Trinity, or of the Essential and Personal Attributes; but that those who set up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to it the worship of a meer Creature as God, or the worship of more Gods than one, or who wilfully reject this Article of the Christian Faith, when it is duly proposed to them, are guilty of a damning Sin. For even the disbelief of Christianity it self, is not supposed to be the Cause of Mens Damnation, but where the Doctrine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100628:42"/>
of the Gospel hath been proposed in a way of Credibility. If when this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is proposed to Mens Minds, they will not consider it, nor weigh the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both sides impartially, but with scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt reject it, and endeavour to bring reproach upon Christianity for the sake of it, and disturb the Peace of the Church about it; such cannot be said to receive or <hi>believe it faithfully,</hi> and by such Sins they do run the hazard of <hi>perishing everlastingly.</hi>

                     <p>I see you have a mind to smooth every thing relating to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> I wish you would do the same about <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> But yet you have not answer'd the other great Difficulty in Point of Reason, <hi>viz. That those things which agree or disagree in a third, must agree or disagree one with the other.</hi> And therefore if the Father be God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God; then the Father must be Son and Holy Ghost, and the Son and Holy Ghost must be the Father. If not, then they are really the same, and really distinct; the same as to Essence, distinct as to Persons; and so they are the same, and not the same, which is a Contradiction.</p>

                     <p>And now I think you have drawn out the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Spirits of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> to make the Doctrine of <hi>the Trinity</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> parallel, because you say, it implies a Contradiction; which is the nearest Parallel you have yet offered at. But this terrible Argument is grounded on the same Supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Divine Essence is no more capable of communicating it self to three distinct Persons, than any created Being is. The Reason of that Axiom being, that created Things, by reason of their finite Nature, cannot diffuse or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themselves to more than one; and therefore those which agree in a Third, must agree together; but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it possible that the same finite Nature could extend it self to several Individuals, it would be presently answered,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100628:43"/>
the <hi>Axiom</hi> did hold only, where they did adequately and reciprocally agree, and not where they did agree only in Essence, but differ'd in the manner of Subsistence. For where a different manner of Subsistence is supposed possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the same Individual Nature, the Agreement in that cannot take away that Difference which is consistent with it; which we attribute to the unlimitedness and perfection of the Divine Nature.</p>

                     <p>But you can bring no other Instance but the thing in Question; and therefore this is a <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> or taking that for granted which is in Dispute.</p>

                     <p>I do not think it to be so, where the Reason is assigned from the peculiar Properties of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to which there can be no parallel. And I think it very unreasonable in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to send us to created Beings for the Rules and Measures of our Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Being acknowledged to be Infinite.</p>

                     <p>Are not the Divine Persons Infinite, as well as the Divine Nature? and therefore as created Persons do take in the whole Nature, so infinite Persons will do the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature.</p>

                     <p>No question, but the <hi>Persons</hi> are infinite in regard of the <hi>Nature</hi> which is so; but if an infinite Nature be communicable to more Persons than One, every such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot appropriate the whole Nature to it self.</p>

                     <p>If the difference be on the account of Infinity, then there must be an infinite number of Persons in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence.</p>

                     <p>I answer, that infiniteness of Number is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and as to the number of Persons, we follow not our own Conjectures, nor the Authority of the Church; but <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> which hath assured us, that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> and yet <hi>there are three that are one.</hi> Which depends not meerly on the place of St. <hi>John,</hi> but the Form of Baptism is remarkable to this purpose, which joyns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                        <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost;</hi> without any other distinction besides that of Order and Relation. And it is against the fundamental design of Christianity, to joyn any Created Beings together with God in so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn an Act of Religion. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Benediction: <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.

                     <p>You have taken a great deal of pains to clear the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> from any absurdity in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> why should you not do as much now as to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation?</hi>

                     <p>In plain truth, because I cannot; for here lies a vast difference between them. In the <hi>Trinity</hi> we consider'd an <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> to which no bounds can be set without destroying its Nature; but in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a true finite Body, which hath its natural bounds and limits to one certain Place, and yet you will and must suppose this Body to be equally present in many thousand distant Places at the same time; which implies so great a Repugnancy to the very Nature of a Body, that I can by no means give my Assent to it.</p>

                     <p>Alas! Is this it which chokes your Reason, so that you cannot swallow the Doctrine of the Church in this matter?</p>
                     <p>You do not consider, that tho we allow nothing <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> it self; yet we suppose an <hi>Infinite Power</hi> to be imploy'd about it: and an Infinite Power may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce things above our Comprehensions, about Bodies in themselves finite.</p>

                     <p>This is the utmost your Cause will bear; but I pray tell me, Is there any such thing as a Repugnancy in the Nature of things or not? <hi>i. e.</hi> Are there not some

                     <p>Hold a little; a Body must have Dimensions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, but it is not necessary it should have those Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions where-ever it is present.

                     <p>Will you make the Power of God to change the Essential Properties of things, while the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves remain in their true Nature? You may as well say, that naturally Man is a Reasonable Creature; but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power he may be a true Man, and yet want the Faculty of Reasoning: That naturally two and two make four, but God can make two and two to be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a supernatural manner, so as that four shall not result from them; that tho, naturally speaking, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washing a Wall makes it look white, yet by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power, there may be the presence of all things which make a Wall white, yet it shall not do so; just so it is to make a Body present, and yet to have no Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a Body. Is there any real difference between the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100628:44"/>
Nature of a Body and Spirit? Wherein lies it? Is it not as repugnant for a Body to be after the manner of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as for a Body and Spirit to be the same?</p>

                     <p>All this proceeds upon not considering the difference between the <hi>Essential Extension</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> and that which is <hi>quantitative, and hath relation to Place.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Essential Extension</hi> of a Body without <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> is Non-sense, and a Contradiction.

                     <p>Then being extended and divisible, are the natural and essential Properties of a Body. And therefore, to suppose a Body not to be extended and divisible, is to suppose it not to be a Body, which is a plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

                     <p>By <hi>Relation to Place,</hi> I mean, when the Parts of a Body answer to the Parts of a Place: but by <hi>Intrinsecal Quantity,</hi> I mean, that there is the real order and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts in the Body it self, but it doth not fill up the Place.</p>

                     <p>Then why may not the greatest Body be within the least? Why may not an Elephant be caught in a Mouse-trap, and a Rhinoceros be put into a Snuff-box? For either there is a Repugnancy in the Nature of the thing, for a greater Body to be within a less, or there is not; if not, then these mentioned Instances are possible; if there be, then the supposition of Divine Power can give no relief, unless you suppose, that God can do things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in themselves, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he can do things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done. But I pray tell me, if the very Body of Christ be by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the Wafer, with all its Parts in their due order, then the Head must be distant from the Feet, and all other <hi>Organs</hi> in their proper places; but this cannot possibly be supposed, where there is no measure of distance as <hi>Place</hi> is, and the whole Body is in a point.</p>

                     <p>Then it is impossible there should be any distance; without which it is impossible there should be the order of Parts in a Human Body. Thus, there is a Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the very supposition of Christ's Body being in the Wafer, tho there were but one single Wafer; but when to this we add, that it is equally thus present in thousands of Wafers at what distance of Place soever, the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

do increase and multiply so fast upon us, that it is hardly possible to imagin any thing concerning a Body, which doth imply more than this doth.

                     <p>It is strange neither <hi>Bellarmin</hi> nor you should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the difference. For the reason why a Body must be divided from it self, being in several places, is, because it is finite; and there being no Penetration of Dimensions in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100628:46"/>
Bodies, the interposing of other Bodies must needs divide the same Body in distant places; but the Reason why the same Divine Nature may be in several Persons, is, because it is Infinite; and therefore nothing can bound or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it.</p>

                     <p>You have talked much of Contradictions; Is there any greater about Transubstantiation, than that of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation</hi> of the Son in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> for, if it be not <hi>proper Generation,</hi> then you cannot infer from it, that <hi>the Son is of the same Substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> if it be, then it must be a proceeding from not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to being, and so <hi>an Eternal Generation</hi> is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

                     <p>It is a Rule in common Reason, That all Attributes must be understood according to the Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And therefore, if the Subject here spoken of, be of such a Nature, as to be uncapable of proceeding from <hi>not being to being,</hi> then whatever is affirmed of it, must be so understood, as not to destroy its Nature. The Term of Generation alone is not, it may be, sufficient to prove the Son Co-essential with the Father, because it might have been used improperly and metaphorically. But when from the Scripture, it otherwise appears that the Son of God being <hi>the Word, was in the beginning with God, and was God,</hi> John 1. 1. and we soon after find him called <hi>the only begotten of the Father,</hi> Ver. 14. and <hi>the only begotten Son,</hi> Ver. 18. we have reason to infer from hence his <hi>Eternal Generation.</hi> Which must not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in such a mean sense as is agreeable to Creatures, but as it is consistent with the Essential Attributes of God, of which necessary Existence is one. So that by Eternal Generation, no more can be meant, than such an Emanation of the Son from the Father, as doth suppose them to have the same Nature and Co-existence: which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100628:46"/>
is best represented by the Rays of the Sun coming from the Fountain of Light, if they were permanent, and not successive.</p>

                     <p>What say you then to the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it not more wonderful,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> observes, <hi>that there should be one Hypostasis in two Natures, than one Body in two Places? since the Union is greater between the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis and the Natures, than between the Body and the Places it is in; the one being intrinsecal and substantial, the other extrinsecal and accidental. And that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis is the same with the Divine Nature, and yet is most closely united with the Human Nature, which is so different from the Divine; so that it is incomprehensible by us, how in that Union the Natures are not confounded, or the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis divided.</hi>

Have I not hitherto owned, that there must be something incomprehensible by us, in what relates to the Divine Nature? And it is the less wonder it is so in the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> wherein an Union is implied between an Infinite and Finite Nature; when the Union of the Soul and Body, though both Finite, is above our Comprehension, though we our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of Souls and Bodies so united? But what Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is it, if we are not able to explain this, that then we must admit that the same Body may be not meerly in two, but in ten thousand places at the the same time? <hi>i. e.</hi> If we cannot explain the <hi>Hypostatical Union,</hi> then all manner of Absurdities must go down with us, that relate to things of a very different Nature from it.</p>

                        <hi>That there should be but one Hypostasis in two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that in the Union the Natures should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, nor the Hypostasis divided.</hi>

                     <p>All these Difficulties arise from the sense of the word <hi>Hypostasis.</hi> Which originally signifies <hi>a Real Being,</hi> and not such which depends only on Fancy and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from thence its signification was enlarged, not only to <hi>things real,</hi> (in opposition to meer Appearances, and Creatures of the Mind) but to such a thing <hi>which did subsist of it self,</hi> and had not its subsistence in another, as Accidents had. So that an <hi>Hypostasis</hi> was <hi>a real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which had subsistence in it self.</hi> But such are of two kinds, as the Greek Fathers observe. (1.) Such as are real Substances in themselves, but yet are capable of being joined with another, to make up a Person; thus the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> have two different <hi>Hypostases,</hi> and make up but <hi>one Person</hi> of a Man. (2.) It is taken, for a <hi>compleat individual Subsistence, which is not joined with any other as a Part;</hi> and so <hi>Hypostasis</hi> is the same with <hi>a Person,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>a compleat, intelligent, individual Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis.</hi> And in this sense there can be but one <hi>Hypostasis</hi> in Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> one Person, tho there be two Natures.</p>

                     <p>But our Divines say, that the Humane Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Union hath no <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> it being swallowed up by the Divine.</p>

                     <p>I know they do; but if they mean that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, after the Union, loses that <hi>subsistence</hi> which is proper to the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> it is impossible for them to avoid the <hi>Eutychian Heresy,</hi> condemned by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> but if they mean no more than that there is <hi>a true Nature,</hi> but no Person, save only that which results from both Natures; they then agree with the Sense of the Church, which condemned the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For as much as the Heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> differ'd in themselves, they were both built on the same Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that there could be no true Nature, but there must be a Person; and that two Natures could not make one Person.

                     <p>It seems then, the whole Business wherein the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils were so warmly concerned, was only to make an <hi>Ecclesiastical Dictionary,</hi> and to appoint what words are to be used, and what not.
