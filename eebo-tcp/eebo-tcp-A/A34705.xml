            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>William Carſtares</hi> being Examin'd upon Oath, conform to the Condeſcention given in by him, and on the Terms therein-mention'd, Depones, That about <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December 1682. James Stuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultneſs,</hi> wrote a Letter to him from <hi>Holland,</hi> importing, that if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of Money could be procur'd from <hi>England,</hi> that ſomething of importance might be done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> The which Letter, the Deponent had an inclination to inform <hi>Shepard</hi> in <hi>Abb-Church-lane,</hi> Merchant in <hi>London</hi> of; but before he would do it, he wrote to Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> above-nam'd, to know from him if he might do it; and Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> having conſented, he Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſaid Letter to Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent that he would Communicate the Contents of it to ſome perſons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but did at that time name no body, as the Deponent thinks: Some time thereafter, Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent, that he had Communicate the Contents of the Letter above-named, to Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and that Colonel <hi>Danvers</hi> was preſent, and told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> was averſe from imploying the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> or medling with him, judging him a man too much affected to the Royal Family, and inclin'd to the preſent Church-Government; yet Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> being put upon it by the Deponent, ſtill urg'd, that one might be ſent to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> but as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told him, he was ſuſpected upon the account of his urging ſo much; yet afterwards he preſs'd, without the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents knowledge, that the Deponent being to go to <hi>Holland</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, might have ſome Commiſſion to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> which he having inform'd the Deponent of, the Deponent told him, that he himſelf would not be concern'd, but if they would ſend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would introduce him; but nothing of this was done: upon which the Deponent went over, without any Commiſſion from any body, to <hi>Holland,</hi> never meeting with <hi>James Stuart</hi> above-named: He was introduced to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> with whom he had never before convers'd; and did there diſcourſe what had paſt betwixt Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> and him; and particularly, about remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Money to the ſaid Earl from <hi>England;</hi> of which, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> had written to the Deponent, namely of 30000 pounds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99770:2"/>
               <hi>Sterling;</hi> and of the raiſing of 1000 Horſe and Dragoons; and the ſecuring the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as a matter of the greateſt importance: The method of doing this was propos'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, to be one hour, or thereby, after the relieving of the Guards: But the Earl did not reliſh this propoſition, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and that the Caſtles would fall of conſequence, after the work abroad was done. <hi>James Stuart</hi> was of the Deponents Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for ſeizing the Caſtle; becauſe it would ſecure <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Magazines and Arms. As to the 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, my Lord <hi>Argite</hi> was of Opinion, that without them nothing was to be done; and that if that number were rais'd in <hi>England</hi> to the ſaid Earl, he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; and that there being ſo few Horſe and Dragoons to meet them, he judg'd he might get the Countrey without trouble, having ſuch a ſtanding Body for their Friends to Rendezvouze to; and the ſaid Earl ſaid he could ſhew the Deponent the convenient places for Landing, if he underſtood; and as the Deponent remembers, where the Ships could attend. The Deponent remembers not the Names of the places. The Deponent ſpoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs,</hi> but cannot be poſitive that he nam'd the Affair to him, but found him ſhy: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> told him, he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the Earl of <hi>Lowdoun</hi> being a man of good Reaſon and diſoblig'd, would have great influence upon the Countrey, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the Deponent to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> with whom the Deponent had ſome acquaintance before, and had brought over a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> but the Deponent had not then communicate any thing to the ſaid <hi>Holms. James Stuart</hi> laid down a way of correſpondence by Cyphers and falſe Names, and ſent them over to <hi>Holms,</hi> and the Deponent, for their uſe (which Cyphers and Names are now in the hands of His Majeſty's Officers, as the Deponent ſuppoſes,) and did deſire the Deponent earneſtly to propoſe the 30000 pound <hi>Sterling</hi> above-named to the Party in <hi>England,</hi> and did not propoſe any leſs; for as the Earl told the Deponent, he had particularly calculate the Expence for Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>James Stuart</hi> ſaid, that if ſome leſs could be had, the Earl would content himſelf, if better might not be, but the Earl always ſaid that there was nothing to be done without the body of Horſe and Dragoons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland,</hi> thô he had ſeveral Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no ſatisfactory account, till ſome time after the Deponent parted from the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and was making for a Ship at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to tranſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>England. James Stuart</hi> wrote to him that there was hopes of the Money. The next day after the Deponent came to <hi>England,</hi> he met with Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> who with Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> and <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> was at <hi>London</hi> before he came over; and depones, That be knows not the account of their coming, more than for the perfecting the Tranſaction about <hi>Carolina:</hi> and having acquainted Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> with the Earls demands of the 30000 pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, Sir <hi>John</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> to whom the Deponent propoſed the Affair, but being an abſolute Stranger to the Deponent, had no return from him at that time; but afterwards having met him accidently at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> houſe, where he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had come to ſpeak to <hi>Shepard</hi> about the Money abovenamed, as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent. The Deponent (when they were done ſpeaking) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99770:2"/>
to ſpeak to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did, and having reiterate the former Propoſition for the 30000 pound <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and the 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> told the Deponent, they could not get ſo much raiſed at the time, but if they had 10000 pound to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would ſoon be brought to more; but as for the 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, he could ſay nothing at the preſent, for that behoved to be concerted upon the Borders. The Deponent made the ſame propoſal to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who was much concerned in the Affair, and zealous for the promoting of it. This Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> before, as the Deponent remembers in a Converſation with the Deponent in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> or the Street ſomewhere thereabout, ſaid, that for the ſaving of innocent Blood, it would be neceſſary to cut off a few, inſinuating the King and Duke, but cannot be poſitive whether he named them or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which the Deponent ſaid, that's work for our wild People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Conſcience does not ſerve me for ſuch things; after which the Deponent had never any particular diſcourſe with <hi>Ferguſon</hi> as to that matter; but as to the other Affair, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told the Deponent that he was doing what he could to get it effectuate, as particularly that he ſpoke to one Major <hi>Wildman</hi> who is not of the Deponent his acquaintance. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> blamed always <hi>Sidney,</hi> as driving deſigns of his own. The Deponent met twice or thrice with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jerviſwood,</hi> Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Ceſsnocks, Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Langſhaw,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> where they diſcourſed of Money to be ſent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> in order to the carrying on the Affair, and tho he cannot be poſitive the Affair was named, yet it was underſtood by himſelf, and as he conceives by all preſent, to be for riſing in Arms, for rectifying the Government. Commiſſary <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two <hi>Ceſsnocks</hi> were againſt medling with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe they judged them men that would talk, and would not do, but were more inclined to do ſomething by themſelves, if it could be done. The Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the Deponent cannot ſay he was poſitive in any thing, but was moſt inclined to have the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which no particular method was laid down. <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> the Deponent, and Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> were for taking the Money; at one of theſe Meetings it was reſolved, that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk of the Juſtice Court, ſhould be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to deſire their Friends to hinder the Country from Riſing, or taking raſh Reſolutions upon the account of the Council, till they ſhould ſee how matters went in <hi>England.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charges of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Meeting, and was directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> who ſent back word, that it would not be found ſo eaſie a matter to get the Gentrie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in a Letter to Commiſſar <hi>Monro, Polwart</hi> wrote that the Countrey was readier to concur than they had imagined, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpoſe. The Deponent, as above-ſaid, having brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to ſerve himſelf and Major <hi>Holms:</hi> he remembers not that ever he had an exact Copy of it, but that ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other keeped it, and ſo it chanced to be in his cuſtody when a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> came to Major, <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that he would join with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and follow his Meaſures, or obey his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: this Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> thought fit to communicate to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and for the Underſtanding of it was brought to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99770:3"/>
Deponent, and he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> who as the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent was informed, was to give it and the Letter to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and he to ſhew it to the Duke of <hi>Manmouth;</hi> but what was done in it the Deponent knows not. The Deponent heard the Deſign of Killing the King and Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſome were full upon it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was ſent by thoſe in <hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> on the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that he does not know <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> nor any more of that matter, not being concerned in it. <hi>Shepard</hi> named young <hi>Hamden</hi> frequently as concerned in theſe Matters.</p>

The Deponent ſaw Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumſay,</hi> lurking after the Plot broke out, before the Proclamation having gone to <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> in the back of <hi>Biſhop gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> at ſome new Building, whether he was directed by <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> who was deſirous to know how things went. <hi>Rumſay</hi> was not of the Deponent his acquaintance before, but they knew as little of the matter as the Deponent. This is what the Deponent remembers, and if any thing come to his Memory, he is to deliver it in betwixt and the firſt of <hi>October;</hi> And this is the Truth, as he ſhall Anſwer to God.</p>
