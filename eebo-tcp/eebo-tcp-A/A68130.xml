            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He is seldome ouerseene with credulity; for knowing the falsenesse of the world, he hath learn'd to trust himselfe alwaies; others so farre, as he may not be dammaged by their disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He seeks his quietnesse in secrecy, and is wont both to hide himselfe in retirednesse, and his tongue in himselfe. He loues to be gessed at, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and to see the world vnseen; and when hee is forced into the light, shewes by his actions that his obscuritie was neither from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3779:12"/>
affectation nor weaknesse. His purposes are neither so variable as may argue inconstancy; nor obstinately vnchangeable, but framed according to his after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits, or the strength of new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. He is both an apt scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and an excellent master; for both euerie thing hee sees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes him, and his minde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with plentifull obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can giue the best precepts. His free discourse runnes backe to the ages past, and recouers euents out of memory, and then preuenteth Tyme in flying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to future things; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one with the other can giue a verdict well-neere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall: wherein his conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3779:12"/>
are better than anothers iudgements. His passions are so many good seruants, which stand in a diligent attendance ready to be commanded by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by religion; and if at any time forgetting their duty they be mis-carried to rebell, hee can first conceale their mutiny; then suppresse it. In all his iust and worthy designes he is neuer at a losse, but hath so proiected all his courses, that a second begins where the first failed; and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth strength from that which succeeded not. There be wrongs which he will not see; neither doth he alwayes looke that way which hee meaneth; nor take notice of his secret smarts, when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3779:13"/>
they come from great ones. In good turnes he loues not to owe more than he must; in euill to owe and not pay. Iust censures hee deserues not, for hee liues without the compasse of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie; vniust he contemneth, and had rather suffer false infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to die alone, than lay hands vpon it in an open violence. He confineth himselfe in the circle of his own affaires, and lists not to thrust his finger into a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fire. He stands like a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnmoued, while the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of his estate is drawen aboue, beneath, about him. Finally, his wit hath cost him much, and he can both keepe, and value, and imploy it. He is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3779:13"/>
his owne Lawyer; the treasurie of knowledge, the oracle of counsell; blinde in no mans cause, best-sighted in his owne.</p>

wrongs him, and giues aduantage to the subtle, when he rather pities their faithlesnes, than repents of his credulitie: he hath but one heart, and that lies open to sight; and were it not for discretion, hee neuer thinks ought, whereof he would auoid a witnesse: his word is his parchment, and his yea his oath, which he will not violate for feare, or for losse. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of following euents may cause him to blame his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, can neuer cause him to eat his promise: neither sayth he, <hi>This I saw not</hi>; but <hi>This I sayd.</hi> When he is made his friends Executour, hee defrayes debts, payes legacies, and scorneth to

All his dealings are square, &amp; aboue the boord: he bewrayes the fault of what he selles, and restores the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene gaine of a false reckoning. He esteemes a bribe venomous, tho it come guilded ouer with the colour of gratuitie. His cheeks are neuer stained with the blushes of recantation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his tongue falter to make good a lie with the secret glosses of double or reserued senses; and when his name is traduced, his innocencie beares him out with courage: then, lo, hee goes on the plaine way of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3779:16"/>
truth, and will either triumph in his integritie, or suffer with it. His conscience ouer-rules his prouidence: so as in all things, good or ill, he respects the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the actions, not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell. If he see what he must do, let God see what shall follow. He neuer loadeth himselfe with burdens aboue his strength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his will; and once bound, what he can he will do; neither doth he will but what he can do. His eare is the Sanctuary of his absent friends name, of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent friends secret; neither of them can mis-carry in his trust. Hee remembers the wrongs of his youth, and repayes them with that vsury which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

would not take. He would rather want than borow, and begge than not pay: his faire conditions are without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and hee loues actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue words. Finally, hee hates falshood worse than death: he is a faithfull client of truth; no mans enemie; and, it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Whether more another mans friend, or his owne; and if there were no heauen, yet he would be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>

Heerin he exceeds all others, that to him nothing is impossible, nothing difficult, whether to beare, or vndertake.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3779:18"/>
He walkes euery day with his Maker, and talkes with him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, and liues euer in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and sees all earthly things beneath him: when he goes in, to conuerse with God, he weares not his owne clothes, but takes them still out of the rich Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe of his Redeemer, and then dare boldly prease in, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a blessing. The celestiall spirits do not scorne his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea his seruice.

The shield that he euer beares before him, can neither be missed, nor pierced: if his hand be wounded, yet his heart is safe: he is often tripped, seldome foiled; and if somtimes foiled, neuer vanquished. Hee hath white hands, and a cleane soule, fit to lodge God in, all the roomes wherof are set apart for his Holinesse: Iniquitie hath oft called at the doore, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued entertainment, but with a repulse: or if sin of force will be his tenant; his lord hee can not.

If torments stand betwixt him and Christ, if death, he contemnes them; and if his owne parents lie in his way to God, his holy carelesnesse makes them his footsteps.

thinks himselfe in his naturall element, when he is shrowded within his owne walles. Hee is euer iealous ouer himselfe, and still suspecteth that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers applaud. There is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obiect of beneficence, for what hee receiues, hee ascribes meerly to the bountie of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; nothing to merit.

His bosome is his friends closet, where he may safely lay vp his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, his doubts, his cares, and looke how he leaues, so he findes them; saue for some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of seasonable counsell for redresse. If some vnhappy sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion shall either disioint his affection, or breake it, it soone knits againe, and growes the stronger by that stresse. He is so sensible of anothers iniuries, that when his friend is stricken hee cries out, and equally smarteth vntouched, as one affected not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3779:32"/>
sympathy, but with a reall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of paine: and in what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe may be preuented he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposeth his aid, and offers to redeeme his friend with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; no houre can be vnseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, no businesse difficult, nor paine grieuous in condition of his ease: and what either doth or suffereth, he neither cares nor desires to haue knowen; lest he should seem to look for thanks. If hee can therefore steale the performance of a good office vnseene, the conscience of his faithfulnesse heerein is so much sweeter as it is more secret. In fauours done his memorie is fraile, in benefits receiued eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: hee scorneth either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3779:33"/>
recompence, or not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it. He is the comfort of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, the guide of difficulties, the ioy of life, the treasure of earth; and no other than a good Angell clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in flesh.</p>

                  <p>HE stands not vpon what he borrowed of his Ancestours, but thinks he must worke out his owne honor: and if he can not reach the vertue of them that gaue him outward glory by inheritance, he is more abashed of his impotencie, than transported with a great name. Greatnesse doth not make him scornfull and imperious, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the fixed starres, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3779:34"/>
higher he is, the lesse he desires to seeme. Neither cares he so much for pompe and frothie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, as for the solid truth of Noblenesse. Courtesie and sweet affabilitie can be no more seuered from him, than life from his soule; not out of a base and seruile popularitie, and desire of ambitious insinuation; but of a natiue gentlenesse of dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and true value of himselfe. His hand is open and bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet not so, as that he should rather respect his glorie, than his estate; wherein his wisdome can distinguish betwixt parasites and friends, betwixt changing of fauors and expending them. He scorneth to make his height
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3779:34"/>
a priuilege of loosenesse, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts his titles vaine, if hee be inferior to others in goodnesse: and thinks hee should be more strict, the more eminent he is; because hee is more obserued, and now his offences are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exemplar. There is no vertue that hee holds vnfit for ornament, for vse; nor any vice which he condemnes not as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and a fit companion of basenesse; and whereof he doth not more hate the blemish, than affect the pleasure. He so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as one that knowes igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can neither purchase ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor wield it; and that knowledge must both guide and grace him. His exercises are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3779:35"/>
from his childhood ingenuous, manly, decent, and such as tend still to wit, valor, actiuitie: and if (as seldome) he descend to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of chance, his games shall neuer make him either pale with feare, or hote with desire of gaine. Hee doth not so vse his followers, as if he thought they were made for nothing but his seruitude; whose felicitie were onlie to bee commanded and please: wearing them to the backe, and then either finding or framing excuses to discard them emptie; but vpon all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities lets them feele the sweetnesse of their owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceablenesse and his bountie. Silence in officious seruice is the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3779:35"/>
best Oratorie to plead for his respect: all diligence is but lent to him, none lost. His wealth stands in receiuing, his honour in giuing: hee cares not either how many holde of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or to how few hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden: and if hee haue cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fauours, he hates either to vpbraid them to his enemie, or to challenge restitution. None can be more pitifull to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, or more prone to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; and then most, where is least meanes to solicit, least pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of requitall. He is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addressed to warre &amp; peace; and knowes not more how to command others, than how to be his countries seruant in both.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3779:36"/>
He is more carefull to giue true honor to his Maker, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ciuill honour from men. Hee knowes that this seruice is free and noble, and euer loaded with sincere glorie; and how vaine it is to hunt after applause from the world, till he be sure of him that moldeth all hearts, and powreth contempt on Princes; and shortly, so demeanes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as one that accounts the bodie of Nobilitie to consist in Blood, the soule in the eminence of Vertue.</p>

who comes first speeds well, but whose cause is best.

bribe in his closet, or a letter on the bench, or the whispering and winks of a great neighbour are answered with an angry and courageous repulse. Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, reuenge, recompense stand on both sides the bench, but he scornes to turne his eye towards them; looking only right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at Equitie, which stands full before him. His sentence is euer deliberate and guided with ripe wisdome, yet his hand is slower than his tongue; but when he is vrged by occasion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doome or execution, he shewes how much hee hateth mercifull iniustice: neither can his resolution or act be reuersed with partiall importunitie. His

forhead is rugged and seuere, able to discountenance villanie, yet his words are more awfull than his brow, and his hand than his wordes.

In whose si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3779:44"/>
face are written the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Religion, which his tongue &amp; gestures pronounce, but his hands recant. That hath a cleane face and garment, with a soule soule; whose mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies his heart, and his fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his mouth. Walking early vp into the Citie, he turnes into the great Church, and salutes one of the pillars on one knee, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping that God which at home hee cares not for; while his eye is fixed on some win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, on some passenger, and his heart knowes not whither his lips go.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3779:44"/>
At Church hee will euer sit where hee may bee seene best, and in the midst of the Sermon pulles out his Tables in haste, as if he feared to leese that note; when hee writes either his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten errand, or nothing: then he turnes his bible with a noise, to seeke an omitted quotation; and folds the lease, as if hee had found it; and askes aloud the name of the Preacher, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it, whom hee publikelie salutes, thanks, praises, inuites, entertaines with tedious good counsell, with good discourse, if it had come from an honester mouth. Hee can commaund teares, when hee speaks of his youth, indeed because it is past,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3779:45"/>
not because it was sinfull: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is now better, but the times are worse. All other sinnes hee reckons vp with detestation, while hee loues and hides his darling in his bosome. All his speech returnes to himselfe, and euery occurrent drawes in a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his owne praise. When he should giue, he looks about him, and sayes WHO SEES ME? No almes, no prayers fall from him without a witnesse; belike lest God should denie, that hee hath receiued them: and when hee hath done (lest the world should not know it) his owne mouth is his trumpet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame it. With the superfluitie of his vsurie, hee builds an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3779:45"/>
and harbors them whom his extortion hath spoiled; so while hee makes many beggers, he keeps some. Hee turneth all Gnats into Camels, and cares not to vndoe the world for a circumstance. Flesh on a Friday is more abomination to him than his neighbours bed: Hee abhorres more not to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the name of Iesus, than to sweare by the name of God. When a Rimer reads his Poeme to him, he begges a Copie, and perswades the Presse; there is nothing that hee dislikes in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that in absence hee cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures not. He comes to the sicke bed of his stepmother, &amp; weeps, when hee secretly feares her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3779:46"/>
He greets his friend in the street with so cleere a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, so fast a closure, that the other thinks hee reades his heart in his face; and shakes hands with an indefinite inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>When will you come?</hi> and when his backe is turned, ioyes that he is so well rid of a guest: yet if that guest visit him vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee counterfeits a smiling welcome, and excuses his chere, when closely he frownes on his wife for too much. He shewes well, and sayes well; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is the worst thing he hath. In briefe, hee is the strangers saint, the neighbors disease, the blotte of goodnesse; a rotten sticke in a darke night, a poppie

No Post can passe him without a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rather than he will leese the newes, he rides backe with him to appose him of tidings; and then to the next man hee meets, hee supplies the wants of his hasty intelligence, and makes vp a perfect tale; wherewith he so haunteth the patient auditor that after many excuses, hee is faine to indure rather the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his maners in running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than the tediousnesse of an impertinent discourse. His speech is oft broken off with a succession of long parentheses,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3779:48"/>
which he euer vowes to fill vp ere the conclusion, and perhaps would effect it, if the others eare were as vnweariable as his tongue. If hee see but two men talke and reade a letter in the street, hee runnes to them, and asks if he may not be partner of that secret relation; and if they denie it, hee offers to tell, since hee may not heare, woonders: and then falles vpon the report of the Scotish Mine, or of the great fish taken vp at Linne, or of the freezing of the Thames; and after many thanks and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions is hardly intreated si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Hee vndertakes as much as he performes little: this man will thrust himselfe forward to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3779:49"/>
be the guide of the way hee knowes not; and calles at his neighbors window, &amp; asks why his seruants are not at worke. The Market hath no commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which hee prizeth not, and which the next table shall not heare recited. His tongue like the taile of Sampsons foxes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries fire-brand, and is enough to set the whole field of the world on a flame. Himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes table-talke of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at anothers boord; to whom he beares the first newes, and adiures him to conceale the reporter: whose cholericke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer he returnes to his first host, inlarged with a second edition: so, as it vses to be done in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3779:49"/>
fight of vnwilling mastiues, hee claps ech on the side apart, and prouokes them to an eager con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. There can no Act passe without his Comment, which is euer far-fetch't, rash, suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, delatorie. His eares are long, and his eyes quicke, but most of all to imperfections, which as he easily sees, so he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases with intermedling. Hee harbours another mans seruant, and amiddes his entertainment asks what fare is vsuall at home, what houres are kept, what talke passeth their meales, what his masters disposition is, what his gouernment, what his guests? And when hee hath by curious inquiries extracted all the iuice

and spirit of hoped intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, turnes him off whence he came, and works on a new. Hee hates constancie as an ear-then dulnesse, vnfit for men of spirit: and loues to change his worke and his place; neither yet can hee bee so soone wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of any place, as euerie place is wearie of him; for as hee sets himselfe on worke, so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pay him with hatred; and looke how manie maisters hee hath, so manie enemies: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it possible that anie should not hate him, but who know him not.

Euery darke groaue and pictured wall strikes him with an awfull but carnall deuotion. Olde wiues and Starres are his counsellers; his night-spell is his guard, and charmes his Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

He knowes not why, but his custome is to goe a little about, and to leaue the crosse stil on the right hand. One euent is enough to make a rule; out of these rules he concludes fashions proper to himselfe; and nothing can turne him out of his owne course. If he haue done his taske hee is safe, it matters not with what affection. Finally, if God would let him be the caruer of his owne obedience, hee could not haue a better subiect, as he is he can not haue a worse.</p>

conscience. Custome of sinne hath wrought this senslesnesse, which now hath beene so long entertained that it pleades pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and knowes not to be altered. This is no sudden euill: we are borne sinfull, but haue made our selues prophane; through manie degrees wee climbe to this height of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. At first hee sinned, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not; now hee sinneth, and knoweth not. Appetite is his lord, and reason his seruant, and religion his drudge. Sense is the rule of his beleefe; and if pietie may be an aduantage, he can at once counterfeit and deride it. When ought succeedeth to him hee sacrifices to his nets, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3779:55"/>
thanks either his fortune or his wit; and will rather make a false God, than acknowledge the true: if contrary, he cries out of destiny, &amp; blames him to whom hee will not bee beholden. His conscience would faine speake with him, but he will not heare it; sets the day, but hee disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points it; and when it cries loud for audience, hee drownes the noise with good fellowship. He neuer names God but in his oathes; neuer thinks of him but in extremity; &amp; then he knowes not how to thinke of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he beginnes but then. He quarrels for the hard conditions of his pleasure, for his future damnation; and from himselfe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3779:56"/>
layes all the fault vpon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and from his decree fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth excuses of his wickednesse. The ineuitable necessity of Gods counsell makes him desperately carelesse: so with good food he poisons himselfe. Goodnesse is his Minstrell; neither is anie mirth so cordiall to him as his sport with Gods fooles. Euerie vertue hath his slander, and his iest to laugh it out of fashion: euery vice his colour. His vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allest theme is the boast of his yoong sinnes, which he can still ioy in, tho he can not commit; and (if it may bee) his speech makes him woorse than hee is. Hee can not thinke of death with patience, without terrour,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3779:56"/>
which he therefore feares worse than hell, because this he is sure of, the other hee but doubts of. Hee comes to Church as to the Theater, sauing that not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, for companie, for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, for recreation, perhaps for sleepe; or to feed his eyes or his eares: as for his soule hee cares no more than if hee had none. He loues none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and that not enough to seeke his true good; neither cares hee on whom hee treads, that he may rise. His life is full of licence, and his practise of outrage. He is hated of God as much as hee hateth goodnesse, and differs little from a diuell, but that he hath a body.</p>

GOD will not take his times when to raine, when to shine.

The multitude of his changed purposes brings with it forgetfulnesse; and not of others more than of himselfe. He sayes, sweares, renounces, because what hee promised hee meant not long enough to make an impression. Heerin alone he is good for a Common-wealth, that hee sets manie on worke, with building, ruining, altering; and makes more businesse than Time it selfe; neither is hee a greater enemie to thrift, than to idlenesse.

His speeches are full of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3779:65"/>
wondring Interiections; and all his titles are superlatiue, &amp; both of them seldome euer but in presence. His base minde is well matched with a mercenarie tongue, which is a willing slaue to another mans eare; neither regardeth hee how true, but how pleasing. His Art is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but delightfull cozenage, whose rules are smoothing and garded with periurie; whose scope is to make men fooles, in teaching them to ouer-value themselues; and to tickle his friends to death. This man is a Porter of all good tales, and mends them in the carriage: One of Fames best friends, and his owne; that helps to furnish

her with those rumors, that may aduantage himselfe. Conscience hath no greater aduersarie; for when shee is about to play her iust part, of accusation; he stops her mouth with good termes, and well-neere strangleth her with shifts.

his friend hee sweares to him, that no manels is looked at; no man talked of; and that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee vouchsafes to looke on &amp; nod to, is graced enough: That he knoweth not his owne woorth, lest hee should be too happie; and when he tells what others say in his praise, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts himselfe modestlie, and dares not speake the rest: so his concealement is more insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than his speech. He hangs vpon the lips which hee admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as if they could let fall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but oracles, and finds oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to cite some approoued sentence vnder the name he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth; and when ought is nobly spoken, both his hands
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3779:66"/>
are little enough to blesse him. Sometimes euen in absence hee extolleth his patron, where hee may presume of safe conueiance to his cares; and in presence so whispereth his commendation, to a common friend, that it may not be vnheard where he meant it. He hath salues for euery sore, to hide them, not to heale them; complexion for euery face: Sin hath not any more artificiall broker or more impudent band. There is no vice, that hath not from him his colour, his allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and his best seruice is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to further guiltinesse, or smother it.

Honesty to him is nice singularitie, repentance super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious melancholie, grauitie dulnesse, and all vertue an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent conceit of the base-minded.

hath found a reason to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize it. He had rather freeze than fetch wood, and chuses ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to steale than worke; to begge than take paines to steale, and in many things to want than begge. Hee is so loth to leaue his neighbors fire, that he is faine to walke home in the darke; and if he be not lookt to, weares out the night in the chimney-corner; or if not that, lies downe in his clothes to saue two labors. He eats, and prayes himselfe asleepe; and dreames of no other torment but worke.

Like a true Chymist hee turnes euerie thing into siluer, both what hee should eat, and what he should weare; and that hee keepes to looke on, not to vse. When hee returnes from his field, he asks, not without much rage, what became of the loose crust in his cup-boord, and who hath rioted amongst his leekes?

He breeds of Money to the third generation; neither hath it sooner any being, than he sets it to beget more. In all things hee affects secrecie and proprietie: hee grudgeth his neighbor the water of his well: and next to stealing hee hates borrowing. In his short and vnquiet sleepes hee dreames of theeues, &amp; runnes to the doore, and names more men than he

A small hope giues him heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst great difficulties, and drawes on new expense, new seruilitie; perswading him (like foolish boyes) to shoot away a second shaft, that he may finde the first. He yeeldeth, and now secure of the issue, applauds him selfe in that honour, which hee still affecteth, still misseth; and for the last of all trials, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bribe for a troublesome preferment, than returne void

of a title. But now when hee finds himselfe desperately cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and at once spoiled both of aduancement and hope, both of fruition and possibilitie, all his desire is turned into rage, his thirst is now onely of reuenge; his tongue sounds of nothing but detraction &amp; slander: Now the place he sought for is base, his riuall vnworthie, his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie iniurious, officers corrupt, Court infectious; and how well is he that may be his owne man, his owne master; that may liue safely in a meane distance, at pleasure, free from staruing, free from burning. But if his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes speed well; ere hee bee warme in that seat, his minde is

What he hath is but a degree to what he would haue: now he scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what hee formerly aspired to; his successe doth not giue him so much contentment, as prouocation; neither can he be at rest, so long as he hath one, either to ouerlook, or to match, or to emulate him. When his Countrey-friend comes to visit him, hee carries him vp to the awfull presence; and now in his sight crouding neerer to the Chaire of State, desires to bee lookt on, desires to be spoken to, by the greatest, and studies how to offer an occasion, lest hee should seeme vnknowen, vnregarded; and if any gesture

His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is neuer but shamefully vnthankfull; for vnlesse he haue all, he hath nothing. It must be a large draught, whereof he will not say, that those few droppes do not slake, but inflame him: so still hee thinks himselfe the worse for small fauours.

His submission is ambitious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, his religion, politike insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation; no action is safe from a iealous construction. When hee receiues an ill report of him
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3779:94"/>
whom hee emulates; hee saith, <hi>Fame is partiall, and is wont to blanch mischiefs</hi>; and pleaseth himselfe with hope to finde it worse; and if Ill-will haue dispersed any more spightful narration, hee layes holde on that, against all witnesses; and brocheth that rumor for trust, because worst: and when he sees him perfectly miserable, he can at once pitie him, and reioyce. What him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe can not doe, others shall not: he hath gained well, if hee haue hindred the successe of what he would haue done, and could not. He conceales his best skill, not so as it may not be knowen that he knowes it, but so as it may not be learned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3779:94"/>
he would haue the world misse him. He attained to a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne medicine by the secret legacie of a dying Empericke, whereof he will leaue no heire, lest the praise should be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Finally, he is an enemie to Gods fauors, if they fall beside himselfe; The best nurse of ill Fame; A man of the worst diet; for he consumes himselfe, and delights in pining; A thorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge couered with nettles; A peeuish interpreter of good things, and no other then a leane and pale carcase quickened with a feend.</p>
