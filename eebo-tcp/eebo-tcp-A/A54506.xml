         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough it be a very cuſtomary thing, many times, for no other reaſon, but to ſhew a man's ſpecial acquaintance, to make all Addreſſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſome great Duke or other, yet I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined that common Road, as well knowing, that if there be no intrinſick value in the matter addrest for, the greateſt Prince is no more able to protect from Cenſure than the Mayor of <hi>Quinborough;</hi> yet, as if there was ſome Spell in the point too, I am not aſhamed of my choice; for there was a time within the Ken of many now living, when there was never a Duke in <hi>England,</hi> and no complaining in our Streets, yet then there was a Mayor of <hi>Quinborough;</hi> and that time may happen again, without Natures inverſion, yet then the Mayor of <hi>Quinbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97291:3"/>
will bear as conſiderable a Figure in the Government as ever. I ſhall now take upon me to ſay ſomething, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly has not occurred to your reading, of Corporations, they being as ſo many Idols, adored by many in the Nation, they are all alike in their Original Conſtitution, ſmall ones dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from great ones, as little Devils do from the higher Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of capacity to do hurt; and are all like ſo many Commonwealths in a Monarchy, being abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Crown, as to bearing Places and Offices of Truſt in all their ſeveral and reſpective Diſtricts; for though all Offices, Civil and Military, determine at the Death or Demiſe of the King, yet your Worſhips adminiſtrative Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juriſdiction, with all your Clan, continues without the leaſt receſs or interruption; neither is it in the power of any Prince, according to the common Diſpenſations of Royal Will and Pleaſure, to alter the meaneſt Officer amongſt you: What induced the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to thoſe Acts of Grace at firſt, I ſhall not take upon me to offer at; I will onely tell you, that they are like the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> of the Empire, and if they had the ſame ſtrength, as may be gueſs'd from what happened of late years, would be as unmanageable; for if the Crown had as many independent Regalities, except for a little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage when they liſt, it would be then counted natural to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves by a common League in their Immunities, to which Corporations would in no mean methods contribute: But ſince the providence of the Crown has provided better for our Peace, it's the moſt prudent for them all to mind their Trade, the thing for which they were firſt imbodied, and leave the conduct of State-affairs to them, whom God and the Law has intruſted to that Noble end.</p>
            <p>Now to induce all you little Commonwealths thus to your duty, I ſhall preſs an argument from Gratitude: You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that by the Act of Regulation, which was binding even to your Immortal Power, the Commiſſioners which were
<pb facs="tcp:97291:3"/>
of the Kings nomination, had power to put out <hi>ſans</hi> number or reaſon, the reſpective members that conſtituted a Corporation, and no penalty upon their not putting others into their places, what would have followed upon the disfranchiſement of all the members, which was abſolutely in the Commiſſioners pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? even a diſſolution of that Body, and by conſequence a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of all their Lands to the Crown; I do not ſee what could have hindred ſuch a deſign, had it not fallen out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Prince who is above all the temptations of tricks: Then the Loyal City of <hi>Coventry</hi> had loſt nigh <hi>3000 per annum,</hi> which had been but juſt for their abetting the late Rebellion; as likewiſe the good Towns of <hi>Leiceſter, Nottingham, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> &amp;c. might have been reckoned with for their eſpecial zeal in the precious Cauſe; and which had been more conſiderable, the ſuperintendency of publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had been put into the Juſtices of the Peace, which are all alterable, as it is fit all other offices to be at pleaſure; and truly if ſuch a thing had happened, you would have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied, for your ways are not like others, your Diſpenſations ſavour too much of Partiality, none can have common right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, eſpecially in your remote and poorer Corporations, where a Sack of Malt, or a Buſhel of Wheat, ſhall throw a Miſt before the Magiſtracy; and if any of you get a truſt, you decide the controverſie, if any happen, as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> did that betwixt two petty Princes, who determined all for himſelf: to adjuſt this, Ile tell your worſhip a ſtory, the great Devil had been out about in the world upon the affairs of his calling, and as he thought, had made one ſure and conſiderable ſet; ſo he return'd home, and met a little <hi>Mephoſtophilus</hi> of the black Society going out, and told him he might ſtay a little at ſuch a place, for there lay an Uſurer irrecoverably ſick, that could not ſcape his clutches for he was endowed with all the villanies of a miſerable <hi>Carl,</hi> as Whore and Bawd both, take unreaſonable brokage for his own money, never miſt
<pb facs="tcp:97291:4"/>
taking all extremities upon forfeitures, without reſpect either to Age or Sex, never paid any poor man any due, though never ſo dearly earn'd, &amp;c. In fine, he had the Conſcience of a Pawn-broker, or a Catchpole Serjeant: The little Devil was much pleaſed at the proſpect of his eaſie imploy, but he found at his return the account wrong ſtated, and miſt of his prize accordingly; which the great Devil enquiring about the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of at his return, with no ſmall wonder was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that a Divine had been with him, ſome hours before he died, and had over-ruled him to give all his Eſtate to charitable uſes, and ſo he was ſlipt up to Heaven. who has he made Truſtee? ſaid the great Devil; a Mayor, and twelve Aldermen, ſays the little one: well enough, quoth the great one, we'll have all them. Though this be but a Story, yet there's a Moral in the tail of it, for I could give ſeveral inſtances where Corporations have performed their truſts at ſuch a rate, as will entitle them to a journey into thoſe Low Countries; and to ſay truth, the Fox-furr'd Magiſtracy do not generally diſtinguiſh betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, right and rightly, ſo much talked on by <hi>Tully,</hi> or <hi>Seneca;</hi> but by whether, or both, or neither, is not much material to you or me, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very tender of doing right againſt a Member of their own, which they call a ſtanding by, or adjuſting their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>But now your worſhip may ſay this is a Satyr upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and therefore, when I addreſt to you for Patronage, <hi>I took a wrong sow by the ear.</hi> I muſt and will ſubmit all things to your better judgment, but give me leave to add ſomething, that may not be unuſeful in the circumſtance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affairs, from the male adminiſtration inſeparably annext to Bodies Politique, (where as the Biſhop of <hi>Quinque Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae</hi> complains deſervedly of the packt Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> votes are numbred and not weighed) and very unlikely to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. I am afraid the Eaſt India and African Companies

practiſe doth not at all make againſt what I ſhall offer, whoſe methods ſo are uneaſie to thoſe unfortunate men, that have any concern amongſt them without great purſes, that the greateſt Extortioner or flee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Flint in nature, would ſingly be aſhamed on, yet in the croud every thing paſſes for Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Now leaſt your worſhip ſhould have your Spouſes longing to know what I would be at, I tell you that all Societies of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated together, though by the ſtricteſt tyes of religion, and Juſtice are to be poſtponed to the Government of a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: you'l ſay then how ſhall we be ſafe in our concerns, if one man be the ſole Judge of good and evil? I grant, where a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical power is exerciſed, as it is almoſt in all Monarchies but here, the Subject is intirely in the Princes power, but that being a thing ſo extravagant and contrary to the Law, it were impious to fear it, conſidering the benignity of our Prince: But what I ſay now is by way of compariſon, that a Deſpotical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nay, and under the greateſt Tyrant in nature, is to be preferred before any ſort of incorporated power; for the Tyrant may reform as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> did; however he muſt die, and his Succeſſor may make amends for his extravagancies: The wicked <hi>Achaz</hi> was ſucceeded by the good <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> whereas an incorporated power, called by what name you will, never did amend, and which is the inſufferable plague of it, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
            <p>If now the greateſt Tyranny of a Single Perſon be to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the government of many, how religiouſly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence and juſtice to our ſelves ought we to <hi>acquieſce</hi> under our preſent condition, the happineſs of which I ſhall neither trouble you nor my ſelf to enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>You may ſay now all this is foreign to the matter in hand; if ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot much deny it, but only I being the firſt that made this kind of addreſs to your <hi>Worſhip,</hi> I do the boldlier take upon me the part of a Libertine, in the way of it, as being unwilling to tye my ſelf up to any form ſoever, we muſt now ſay ſomewhat of the diſcourſe, pretended to be anſwered, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97291:5"/>
               <hi>The Dialogue betwixt</hi> Cit <hi>and</hi> Bumkin, it hath a great vogue <note rend="inter">

But now Authors vary, whether this great craracter was figurative or no, to incline to the affirmative, there is an Advertiſement ſubjoyned, how <hi>a Gentleman may live by his fingers ends, ſcribble thread-bare extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies two and forty times over, and each time anſwer them himſelf, and ſo</hi> (for want of another Adverſary) reply, rejoyn, ſurrejoyn all alone <hi>toties quoties</hi> as his pinching neceſſities ſhall require, written originally in that Babyloniſh language by <hi>Quevedo</hi>'s Ghoſt, tranſlated by <hi>Don Splutterado</hi> Knight of the craving Fob.</p>
            <p>But it is now fit that I ſhould give your worſhip a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my undertaking; the chief thing induced me to it, was the juſt diſdain I had, that ſuch a <hi>Pigmy</hi> ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque ſo boldly, and by ſo opprobrious names, ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable orders of men as he brings under that name, of which there is ſome account given in the following Colloquy. Now if his friends object, that the language is too tart upon him, let them conſider his own methods of uſing others, but he may be more excuſable for it than his Opponent, conſidering the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy of <hi>Newgate,</hi> which though, as be ſays, is famous for breeding politick men, yet for polite and ſoft language it,s not inferiour to the Nunnery of <hi>Billings-gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may object Sir, if you pleaſe too, why no ſooner? when ſome Authors write Books as faſt as Jugers ſpue Ribands: but you may ſee by that your Worſhips Oratour does not write for daily bread, whatever others do.</p>

               <hi>Maſquerade, in Skeldry;</hi> which by the Authors favour, I think a great friend to the Author of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> by his liſting <hi>Dick</hi> and <hi>Tom,</hi> the pretended anſwer to that Diſcourſe, amongſt thoſe Pamphlets he calls ſeditious; and therefore I muſt animadvert a little upon the thing it ſelf, as likewiſe upon that method: As to the thing or print it ſelf, it is ſufficiently libellous and ſcandalous, for it is not ſo much a dumb narrative of what's paſt, as a Scheme of what he would intimate is at preſent deſigned: That it is not a narrative of what's paſt I offer this, the things are ſo miſtimed, for he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays all the Rabble of Sects, upon a conſult joyntly petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; <hi>J.

Naylor</hi> (who ſuffered his puniſhment by order of a number of men called a Parliament in the Protectorate of <hi>Oliver)</hi> were not ſo much as heard of, when <hi>John the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was Chairman; nay the Independents themſelves were not lookt upon as conſiderable at that time, tho' afterwards they ſupplanted their elder Brother, &amp; at ſuch a rate that the time wherein he layes his hopeful harmony for petitions, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians had as little power perhaps as they have now: But to make your Worſhip the better able to underſtand my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon his Plate, I muſt give you a ſhort deſcription of it, firſt he ſets the Presbyterian in a chair in a ridiculous dreſs, aſſiſted by all the rabble of Sects, as <hi>Adamites, Ranters,</hi> and what not, as Counſellors, then he brings the petitioners, which are only Swaſh and the Elders maid, the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quaker &amp; the Mare petitioning againſt Biſhops, Service-Book, Popiſh Lords and evil Counſellours, and thanks given them by the Presbyterians, which <hi>by the way</hi> is a great want of Charity in him, for tho' thoſe of kind petitions was only the reſult of minds that deſired nothing but matter for quarrel, yet none of the four are like our articles of faith neceſſary to ſalvation, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:97291:6"/>
might if the Government had thought fit, have been altered at pleaſure, without breach, either of Gods Law or mans, therefore t oſe Petitioners ought not in common good manners, tho, they deſerved a very ſevere <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primam,</hi> to be ſo ranked; for thoſe kind of Beſt alitie were never charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the well natured Author would intimate ought to be upon the decryed Party.</p>
            <p>But obſerve it all along, he is a Gentleman of ſingular manners as well as diſcretion, to bring in the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bridegroom petitioning againſt Popiſh Lords, when there is now an Act of State to that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to take away all Legiſlative power from them, as if that ſolemn Act which has been gratiouſly granted at the petition of three Eſtates, was to be run into ridicule by every Buffoon at pleaſure, but, I ſuppoſe, he ſtands Candidate to ſucceed his friend <hi>B. H.</hi> in his late Eminency.</p>
            <p>But now to go on with the deſcription, he makes all theſe petitions to be addreſſed to the Presbyter, and thanks returned to the Petitioners. On the right hand aloft he ſets a Cabal of Raskals, as it were in a conſult, oppoſite on the left hand he ſets little Alderman <hi>Iſaac Pennington,</hi> &amp; the Pope, under them the Capital letters of Solemn League and Covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, according to his uſual ſcurrilous way, a piece of Holy Writ, <hi>Jer. 60. 5.</hi> which he ſcoffingly would ſeem to apply to that wicked Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Covenant. On the right hand below a company of ill looks Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kals with banners, having Alderman <hi>Gourney, Strafford,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> chained amongſt 'em, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Bible, and Councils, &amp;c. underfoot, under all the head of the late King of bleſſed memory. On the left, oppoſite to it, a great ear'd Knave ſpewing of Canons and Common Prayer, &amp;c. his head ſupported by a plump Harlot. Nigh a little Table in the middle of all a little Raſcally fellow for Secretary beſet with pot and pipe, and Monkey by him as Aſſiſtant, with a great many other gim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracks not worth mentioning, but I onely obſerve that the exciſe is by its Companions as the <hi>Directory Ordinance</hi> ranked amongſt thoſe wicked grievances. I wonder why it ſhould for ſure the Animal doth not think, that ever that duty will be taken <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
A very excellent argument for the ſitting of that Court but ſuitable enough I ſuppoſe, to his deſign, but he might do well to diſcover ſuch a contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if he know it for elſe miſpriſon of Treaſon muſt be his lot; if he know nothing, but only out of his ſingular good nature &amp; piety gueſſes at things,

            <p>As now I have ſaid ſomewhat of his witty and elaborate piece, ſo I'le ſay a little of that way of libelling, it is a libel as much as writing, &amp; as much puniſhable, but yet, I think, a man may ſafely put a caſe of that nature, as thus, Admit a Painter draw <hi>Oliver</hi> newly eſtabliſhed in the Protectorate, environed with all his Myrmidons, all publick officers &amp; foreign Miniſters addreſſing to him, the area of the Cut beſtrowed with all the remarques of a ruined State, as a Crown and Scepter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the holy Bible, Acts of Parlia, all thrown about a great Church orethrown, the <hi>3</hi> Eſtates, the loyal Gentry and Nobility looking through priſon grates, &amp;c. and at the lower end of all a little dapper fellow with a Chamlet Cloak over his ſhoulder to cover a baſe Viol, making his honours like a mannerly School-Boy, &amp; telling one of the Pages of honour, that he deſires to make an humble oblation of Muſick to congratulate his ſerene Highneſs's aſſumption of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as well as to chear and refreſh his mighty ſpirits, as an argument that he had quit that unfortunate ſide, as might appear by a label out of his mouth, ſome unlucky body would gueſs a certain Gentleman that lives in the high way to the <hi>Paddington</hi> Tree, to be meant by it: Admit again a Painter to draw a pretty well tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Gentleman ſet in his ſcribling laboratory in a thinking po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and a doughty man of war flouriſhing an ireful ſapling over his manly ſhoulders, which put him into ſuch a poſture, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> was in when he was ready to be piſs himſelf in the ſtorm,</p>

And to ſay truth, the Gentleman had in his youthful days as many remedies againſt banging himſelf for love, as <hi>Lukeners</hi> lane, the Old Cherry-Garden, or Madam <hi>Bear</hi> her Damoſels (a Lady as famous in her Generation for thoſe intrigues, as either Mother <hi>Gifford</hi> or <hi>Betty Buley</hi> of late and happy memory) could afford. I ſay, and it like your worſhip, ſome would ſay it was knaviſhly meant.</p>
            <p>But leſt you or ſome wiſer Reader ſhould object at the impropriety of making a Piper ſometimes talk like a Scholar, it cannot be worſe than to make a Bumpkin a Politician, a Canting Knave, and yet ſo ignorant in Religion as to talk of the Ten Tables.

ſuch a lie, and ſo circumſtantiated, for I aſſure you lie is no Sophiſter, witneſs his indiſcretions to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy, and his ſlight ſpeaking of them, which muſt be imputed to his Education, being bred a Fanatick, then turn'd Papiſt, now that's laid aſide, he may be the ſame again, ſo I conclude him governed by Truth then, becauſe now governed by a thing like Conſcience, but had he been a man of thoſe Intrigues, florid Parts, as the learned Author of <hi>Cit and Bumpkin,</hi> ſo well able to invent and poliſh a Tale, with prophane ſwearing and other proper Circumſtances, as he has ſhewn himſelf all along to be in that Diſcourſe, I ſhould have no more believ'd the Plot from the Doctors ſingle Teſtimony, than I believe the method of getting hands have been as he would inſinuate.</p>

               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Truly you muſt give him a grain of Allowance, for he was in <hi>New-gate</hi> priſon before the Kings Return, and now begins to be uneaſie by loſs of his Place, by the Freedom of Trade, which has been coſtly enough to ſome, and ſome other things in the World that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to him, which makes him very paſſionate at any thing like Fanaticiſm, which he takes every thing to be that does abſolutely <hi>quadrate</hi> with his own <hi>Capricio.</hi> I muſt ſpeak Truth though I be his Couſin.</p>

               <p>You put me in mind of a Story when Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> came out of the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> to exerciſe his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Office in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, he behaved himſelf very extravagantly to ſome Gentlemen, that came to wait on him in his Viſitation, which when one of his Servants would have excuſed by his late coming out of Priſon, a Gentleman replied, he is lately come out of the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> and now he is fit to go to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but there is a Friend of mine one <hi>J.

not moped, as he ſayes in his printed Paper, if he would repair thither, he might be accommodated, and this poor Nation at quiet, for his Diſtemper is far from any thing like mopiſhneſs, being ſo Mercurial a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as he is known to be, and therefore, as my Author ſayes, very curable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>There is no dealing with you, you are ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon my Couſin, we'll call our old cauſe over again, I'm ready to do as I ſaid, defend that Dialogue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>So you ſay; but heark you, Captain, you may be a man of ſenſe for all that, do you not think it a very flagitious thing for a little unknown Fellow, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the States, Orders, and Diviſions of men, both Lords, Citizens, and Commons of <hi>England</hi> under the opprobrious names of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin?</hi> names ſo reproachful, that the meaneſt Spirit in <hi>England</hi> would make a repartee with a Cudgel in Anſwer to either of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>He meant only the ſeditious part of them, I ſuppoſe, that is, them that were for petitioning, which was purſued with great Zeal by all ſort of Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>From whence you moſt logically conclude, it was a ſeditious contrivance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, marry do I.</p>

               <p>Not ſo faſt, good Captain, there is no Law againſt it, and where no Law, no Tranſgreſſion, yet that ſhameleſs Author would inſinuate a diſpoſition of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion from it: Otherwiſe he would not treat the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners at that ſcurrilous rate as he does all along, and truly, Captain, (for I do not love to ſwear nor talk pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, as that Author makes his <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin</hi> do very often,) had not his Majeſty declared his diſlike againſt it, as not ſuitable to his Royal Will and Pleaſure,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97291:10"/>
which modeſt men out of good manners would not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Petition had been ſubſcribed, as generally as ever any was; for notwithſtanding all his malicious charges againſt it, it was not <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> not ill in it ſelf, but as it was circumſtanced with the Kings Will to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>But what ſay you to all the Phanaticks ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially joyning in it, may not that beget a ſuſpicion juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was ſomething intended that might be <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in ſe,</hi> ill in it ſelf?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all, doth not the Scripture tell you that the Phariſees were great Sophiſticators of the old Law, confounding it by unwritten Traditions? yet they are not blamed, neither is the Doctrine of the Reſurrection diſparaged, for their ſtout aſſertion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay well, then I ſee that a Phanatick may ſometimes be in the right, as well as the wicked Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, or the Papiſts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Who doubts it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you are, though not for the defence of Petitioning, yet for the defence of the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, what ſay you to the <hi>twitting the King with his Coronation Oath, that Delinquents may be brought to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and then the Parliament was to ſit as long as they pleaſed?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it an unjuſt charge, as to the main; for though poſſibly ſome might be ſo indiſcreet as to name that Oath, not with that due reſpects to his Majeſty, yet I'm confident none was ever ſo impudent as to demand, in terms, the bringing Delinquents to Puniſhment, being that was ſo notorious a 1641 term, as muſt diſpleaſe all men that are not of thoſe Principles; but poſſibly there might be ſomething of trying the Lords in the Tower, which might give the Proteſtantiſh Author occaſion of that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97291:11"/>
flouriſh, as if their Caſe was parallel to thoſe worthy Lords and Gentlemen, then called Delinquents, than which nothing can be more vilely inſinuated; but as to his laſt charge, that the Parliament was to ſit as long as they pleaſed, I'm ſure it is ſo notoriouſly falſe, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a man of a bold front could have ſaid it, I wiſh he had been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Subject to their Laws when he ſaid it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee why ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>They have a Law there, as I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called the Statute of <hi>Leaſing,</hi> that if any man by prepenſe falſe ſuggeſtion or inſinuation accuſe a Lord, ſo as he may be capitally queſtioned, it is capital in the Accuſer; if that Law was on force here, my little Fellow would be collered; for can any thing be more malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than to accuſe a Body of men of attempting a thing which cannot be acted without the greateſt Treaſon imaginable, as that of perpetuating a Parliament, for that's the Engliſh of ſitting as long as they pleaſe, meant by the ingenious Author?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>He but tells you, that a Countrey Juſtice ſaid ſo ſomewhere upon the Bench, and ſo they are not his words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>A Writer of Dramatique or Dialogue is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer always for what he makes the Perſons ſpeak, which might be the occaſion of that Statute for the puniſhment of prophane Swearing by Players of Interludes, which our Author is not free from, it may be that quality made him nameleſs, for fear ſome croſs-grain'd Cur of the Bench ſhould have levied the twelve pence's upon him. But this muſt be wholly an Artifice to blacken the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for no Juſtice in the Countrey, nor <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though many of them are far from Conjurers, could ever be ſo fond to aſſert a thing ſo wholly and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97291:11"/>
in every parcel an untruth: but there may be ſtrange Children now, as there were in <hi>David's</hi> time, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity, from whom the Prophet prayed deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you are a ſtrange man to expect literal truths from a man that writes in my Friends myſtical way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Heark you, Captain, if your Friend in his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way had abuſed me in particular, as he has almoſt the whole Nation in general, I would in down-right terms have broken his Head, whenſoever I had met him, and in the mean time, have cudgell'd you, noble Captain, till you had diſcovered his name, though I be but a Piper, Call me <hi>Bumpkin?</hi> I would have him know, and you too, that I'm the 22d. Piper of my Family, licenſed by the Heirs of <hi>Dutton,</hi> now Lord <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> a faculty ſaved to that Family by two Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; ſo we are no Rogues, like your South Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fidlers, Captain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
               <p>You are very hot, cooler language would do as well, for hot words do no buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well; but what ſay you to that detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage, that it would be never the worſe <note rend="inter">Pag. 6.</note>if they, <hi>viz.</hi> the men of Eſtates, <hi>were out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at Court; for an honeſt revenge, ye know, goes a great way with a tender Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Very well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>How can any thing be more baſe than this? to deſire that the men of Eſtates ſhould be out of Favour at Court, becauſe it would prompt them to revenge, as he very Chriſtianly inſinuates, the conſequence of which muſt be a War, as he muſt hope; but I wonder he ſhould, when he is a man of known modeſty before an Enemy, if he be the man I gueſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he is a publick ſpirited man, and ſo hopes a War as the only expedient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97291:12"/>
to ſet aſide all Petitioning for the Future: for to ſay truth, there will be nothing left upon ſuch ſucceſs as he propoſes to petition for; but if there be no better conduct than his, there may be a miſtake in meaſures: our laſt War was occaſioned from ſuch raſcally Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, to preſs both ſides to extremities, and foment all differences into the bargain too, as I have been told; but I hope to ſee a thouſand ſuch raſcally Pickthanks hanged, before any thing of that happen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
               <p>But is not my Couſin very witty, when he ſays it is a bleſſing to have neither Friend nor Money, and yet to deſign to be taken priſoner, as the way to both, and makes it out very prettily?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Yes faith he is; but why the pox doth he not <note rend="inter">Pag. 7.</note>purſue his own methods to Preferment, take a Gaol? for on my Conſcience, he cannot crack of either; for how he ſhould have Friends that hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole Nation I ſee not, neither how he ſhould abound in Money; for Lands he has none I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Then you think <hi>Tom</hi> a Gaol is the fitteſt place for my Couſin?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Ay truly do I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>But do you not like his brave Deſcription of the benefits of a Priſon, and the Rogueries of thoſe that ply there to that purpoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Truly like the reſt; for from the converſe of <hi>Newgate</hi>-birds, he concludes all the intrigues of the World to be managed at the ſame Religious Rule, and then makes his <hi>Cit.</hi> an Officer of Addreſs, as one may call him; but he keeps his Office no where that I can find out but in your Couſin <hi>Crackbrain's</hi> Noddle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>But what think you of the diſcovery of a new Plot, in caſe the Petition had gone on; of five Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97291:12"/>
more, if the Parliament had met? one againſt the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> another for the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till they had gone through with what they had to do, a third for taking away Biſhops Votes, a fourth for the remove of Evil Counſellors, a fifth for putting the <hi>Militia</hi> into ſafe hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Your Couſin might do well to produce the Draught of ſuch Petitions, or at leaſt, name ſome-body beſides his <hi>Bumpkin</hi> that had ſeen ſome ſuch thing, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways he is to be taken for a Make-bate and a Lyar; and truly we have reaſon to acquieſce under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our Gracious Prince that cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſuch ſycophantly Knaves to do any thing but what becomes him: But your Couſin ſhews himſelf a good man upon all occaſions, by ranging all thoſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, as if to Petition for the Tryal of the Lords, was equally criminal with the reſt, can any thing more reflect upon the Honour of the King, Parliament, and whole Nation, than to inſinuate, which muſt be a neceſſary conſequence of ſo marſhalling the Petitions, that a Petition againſt the Lords, impeached by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for High-Treaſon, when a Court is in being that can only take Cognizance of their Affairs, is to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt Miſdemeanours of the higheſt Nature; if this do not proceed from a Deſign, which I think is not very Proteſtantiſh, of running the Plot into <hi>Sham,</hi> I am miſtaken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>But heark you, Minſtrel, does not my Couſin go on bravely, when he tells us what dangerous <note rend="inter">Pag. 10.</note>Rogues the Citizens are, and what deſigns they have ſtill on foot, to diſtract, if not ſubvert the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by contriving new Methods of petitioning, and telling us, that thoſe <hi>Heads will find Hands if there ſhould be occaſion?</hi> On my Conſcience he is a notable man.</p>

               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>So he is, and a bold one too, I think, to aſperſe by intimation ſo conſiderable a body of Men, as the City of <hi>London,</hi> with contrivances againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only to ſhew his wit, without the leaſt ground imaginable as I can ſee: I tell you, if it was in <hi>France,</hi> as fond as he is of that Government, they would anger him, for he would without doubt be put to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a diſcovery might be made of ſuch grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in agitation; and if it proved all a Staff of his own, as I dare ſwear this is, then I believe he would be broke upon the Wheel, for endeavouring to bring the King into a jealouſie of his good City of <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in his ſcoffing way; but I muſt tell both him and you, in anſwer to his frequent running that expreſſion, <hi>Of the People of the Lord into ridicule;</hi> though I am as far from believing that thoſe pretenders are ſuch, yet God hath a People that he will vindicate one day to the Confuſion of Faces of all them <hi>that ſit in the Seat of the ſcornful.</hi>

               <p>But has he not mauld the <hi>Predeſtinarians</hi> with their Doctrine of neceſſity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>He is too ſhallow for that; he hath a little droll'd upon the conſequence of the Opinion: but I tell you, Capt. what I heard a <hi>Black-ſmith</hi> over a Pot of Ale ſay the other day, that every futurity, or thing to come, was certain in it ſelf, whether it ſhould happen or not, and that cannot be denied, Captain.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>If ſo, what room then for free Agency, when it's impoſſible to remove a certainty: But as I heard a Divine ſay once, no created underſtanding can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the difference betwixt Gods certain foreſight

and predeſtinating, ſo I leave it; and I'm ſure he would not have medled with it, but that he could fix ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of reproach upon the party, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, meeting with ſome bad practices of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical men; but yet as generally as it is now decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it hath been otherways; for they that know any thing, know that moſt of the Biſhops, and generally the Inferiour Clergy were of that Opinion, and yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holy and pious men in their Generations, for all his ſcoffs that he fixes upon that opinion by inference; for none was ever yet ſo impudent to aſſert in terms what he makes his <hi>Cit</hi> to do, and truly I do believe he is of the <hi>Cit's</hi> Opinion, that a thing may be ſin in one which is not in another; for lying, though <note rend="inter">Pag. 13.</note>it be a ſin in moſt men, is not ſo in him, as he thinks, he otherways would not have ſo much uſed it.</p>

               <p>He begins with comparing <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> a thing now that is <hi>trite</hi> and thred-bare; there is a Book called <hi>Lyſimachus Nicanor</hi> that has done it more to the purpoſe, writ near forty years agone, but yet in his rails upon the later, he ſpeaks Ironically of the Plot (when he calls the Jeſuits the <hi>Heads of it upon the King,</hi> &amp;c.) as a man muſt needs conclude that reads the whole diſcourſe, eſpecially if that Author had any intelligence or correſpondence with the Author of the Further Diſcovery dedicated to Dr. <hi>Titus Oates;</hi> and that flouriſh might have been as decently ſaved; beſides his Pen too much reſembles a Cleaver, cuts only one way, as a man may eaſily obſerve by his conſtant pinching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that party for the 1641. buſineſs, a thing that none of them has the face now publickly to juſtifie, and his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> accompanied with the murder of nigh a million of Proteſtants, without the leaſt Reflection, though that Villany be yet juſtified, or at leaſt not owned to be ſo by that Party, as it was at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97291:14"/>
firſt abetted by the Pope; and then after all, as if he would make himſelf compleatly wicked, he ſcandalizes the Proteſtant Religion, which the late King of bleſſed Memory own'd that he fought for, as may be ſeen yet by his Declarations, and the Inſcription upon his Coyns, ſtampt at the beginning of the late Rebellion; for by that is meant, as he makes his Citizen ſay, the Religion of the Diſſenters from the Church; a diſtinction that the late bleſſed Martyr would not have thanked him for.</p>

               <p>Then he goes on with teaching a method of Villany, which he would call diſcovering, to inflame the Nation, and widen the Breaches betwixt the King and his People; for why elſe ſhould he, amongſt other things, lay ſuch a ſtreſs upon the Kings being one of the three Eſtates, and make ſuch damn'd inferences, a thing decried by all ſober men, becauſe declared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Preambles of ſeveral Acts of Parliament? and yet the good King in a Meſſage to the two Houſes own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three Eſtates, when the Biſhops were by Act remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which by conſequence he muſt be one, but that may be look'd upon, conſidering the novelty of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to be a lapſe in the Secretary, and ſo no weight to be laid upon it. I refer you to the Declaration bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date from <hi>York, June</hi> 13. 1642. Then he falls upon the light and fooliſh antick Geſtures of the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers, with their fond Metaphors not worth anſwering, becauſe none ſo fooliſh as to adjuſt them; then he goes on, as if the Plot was only a Blind to enrage People, and that there was a real Deſign to deſtroy the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and all the Sons of the Church, by the name of the Papiſts in Maſquerade, and get all the places of profit to themſelves.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Truman</hi> ſpeaks truly of the Papiſts, but not all that a true Son of the Church might have ſaid, he ſays in anſwer to the Charge, that the Papiſts Loyalty was in their own defence, being in a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to that ſide, that it was better, if ſo, than fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the King, and further that no man drew his ſword in the oppoſite cauſe, <hi>but known Separatiſts,</hi> and <hi>that not one Separatiſt ſtruck in the Kings quarrel,</hi> he might have added, if he had though fit, that after the King was outed, not one Papiſt ever entred into a Plot for his Reſtitution, but the whole truth was not his buſineſs, whereas the Schiſmaticks, as he boldly enough calls ſome ſort of men, aſſerted the Kings Cauſe in the loweſt Ebb: and that ſo bravely both by outward force, and other leſs viſible endeavours, that the Kings Reſtitution muſt be aſcribed to them, as to the ſecond cauſe, which made ſome amends for their former devitation, I tell thee <hi>Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain,</hi> had the King had no better friends than the Papiſts,

               <p>When God gives over Kings to be wholly led by their ſenſual appetites, and to lay aſide all manner of Juſtice, he often ſuffers the People to be ſo too, for the world is rather governed by example than Precept. There are many ſad examples of that kind, as of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the cruel of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſtabb'd to death by his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Brother. <hi>Winceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> once impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and when he had by miracle recovered his Eſtate, grew ſo barbarouſly cruel to all ranks of men, that upon Citizens of <hi>Prague</hi> roſe as one man againſt him, upon which news, being in the Caſtle, he fell into a fit of an Apoplexy, and died ſuddenly. <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was depoſed by his Unkle <hi>Frederick.</hi> And of later years Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the Great Turk, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97291:17"/>
was for his outragious luſts and other extravagancies, depoſed and ſtrangled in the <hi>Seragilo.</hi> There is a living example of that kind, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſet aſide and impriſoned by his Brother, who now injoys as the reward of his fact both his Brothers wife and Kingdom, and yet not ſo much as a Sword, or Pen manag'd in his behalf; by theſe examples, though it cannot be denied, but it is the Subjects duty to ſuffer patiently, and like the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> Legion, ſuffer themſelves to be cut in pieces, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to reſiſt, as Mr. <hi>Truman</hi> well obſerved; yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thoſe Caſes is often ſo ſtrong, that there is no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it.</p>

               <p>I perceive then, that your opinion is, that it is ſafer for Princes to keep within due moderation, as to their adminiſtration, than to do otherwiſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have ſo much right on their ſides, even as to this world; for if a Nation ſhould lie under ſuch unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py circumſtances, as to have the Prince and People at difference, the Divines of the Popular, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would from Texts of Scripture, whether miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or no, not material, offer <hi>Pillows</hi> to both parties, as is well obſerved in an excellent Paſſage out of <hi>Denhams Sophy, Page</hi> 44.</p>
