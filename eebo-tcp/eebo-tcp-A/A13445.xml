            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are two especiall Causes that haue moued me most boldly to thrust these rude lines into the world: the first is my hearty affection to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the cause you vndertake, (which I beleeue God and his best seruants do affect:) and the other is my loue and seruice which I owe to your worthy selfe in particular, for many vndeserued friendships which I haue receiued from you, and many of your noble friends for your sake. Ingratitude is a Diuell, so farre worse then all the diuels, that if it should craue harbor
<pb facs="tcp:11731:3"/>
of me, in the likenesse of an Angell of light,yet I would neuer be perswaded to entertaine it. My thankfull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your goodnesse towards mee is my prayers and best wishes, which shall euer be a poore requitall towards you, not forgetting my thanks in the behalfe of all the worthy Ladies and others of that Angelicall sex that are maried and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in London, whose chast honours you (as became a true Knight) defended, when an audacious Frenchman most slanderously did (without exception) swear there was not one honest woman dwelling within the boundes of this populous City, but that they had all generally abused the bed of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: then did your noble selfe inforce the pestiferous pesant to swallow his odious calumny, and in humility to confesse there were fifty thousand or a greater number that neuer had wronged their husbands in that vnlawfull act. I haue made bold to speake of this matter here, because the abuse was so generall, &amp; your quarrell so honorable, which I think vnfit to be buried in silence or forgetfulnesse: howsoeuer, I craue you pardon and worthy acceptance, whilst I most obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiously remaine</p>
