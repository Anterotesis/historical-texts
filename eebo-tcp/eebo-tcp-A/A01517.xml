            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hyles I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled</hi> in Translation, and collection of my <hi>Droomme of Doomes daye:</hi> and was busyed in sorting of the same (for I gathered the whole out of sundry Pamphlets:) I chaunced at passage, to espye one shorte Epistle, written against Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse. And though the rest of such Treatises, as I founde in the same Coppie, dyd carrye none expresse name of theyr seuerall Aucthours: yet this Epystle was therein entytuled: <hi>An Admonition of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> the Bishoppe, for the eschewing of Droonkennesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Epistle, both for the credite of the Aucthour, and for the tytles sake I thought good to peruse: fynding the
<pb facs="tcp:6018:5"/>
same compendious, and eloquent, as the same Aucthour dyd commonlye wryte.</p>
            <p>But when I had throughly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and therewithall had some consideration of the huge enormyties, and shames which daylie followe that sinne: yea, when I had fullye aduised mée, howe commonly it is nowe a dayes exercised amongste vs: and how slylie it stealeth into this Realme through continuall custome of chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and banquetting: I thought it shoulde not be vnprofitable, nor any way vnpleasaunt (vnlesse it be to such as can not abyde to heare of vertue, for feare least they might be ashamed of theyr vyce) to adde some Aucthory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and examples for the more speedy extyrpation of this monstrous plant, lately crepte into the pleasaunt Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes of Englande.</p>
            <p>And surely it is time (yea more then tyme) that we shoulde foresée, and learne to auoyde, those Bermaydes of myschiefe, which pype so pleasantly
<pb facs="tcp:6018:5"/>
in euery Potte, that men be thereby allured to sayle into the Ilandes of all euyll. And there (being iustly depry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Gods grace,) are transfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into most ougly shapes of brute Beastes.</p>
            <p>And least I séeme ouer sodainly to leape into my matter, and ouer rashly to rayle before good proofe of reproofe, let mée set downe this for my generall proposition, <hi>That all Droonkardes are Beastes:</hi> yea, let mée not shrinke to affyrme that not onely, all common Droonkardes are Beasts, but euen the wysest councellour, the grauest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, the cooningest Artificer, the skylfullest wryter, and the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all sortes and Estates, if they chance at any time to bée infected, and contamynate with this Beastly vice, shall be (in that dooing) very Beastes also.</p>
            <p>Mary, as there are on earth sundrye sortes of Beastes, so séemeth it that this Sorceresse <hi>(Drinke)</hi> doth also in her transformed Crewes, obserue a
<pb facs="tcp:6018:6"/>
wonderfull varyetie: For some men delyghting in her onely for pleasure, and good fellowship (as they terme it) doo no furder exceede then into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine iocunde myrth, and dallyaunce: and yet therein also they chaunce most commonly to geue no small cause of offence. Then, this sorte of Droon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, I can best compare vnto Apes, whose péeuishe propertie, is to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghted with euerie fonde toye, and tryfle: and whose busie nature can sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer be exercysed, without hurt or dommage.</p>
            <p>Another sort of men, stepping a foote further, doo fall vnto brawlyng and quarrellyng: not vnlyke to the Beares and Boares of the For rest, whose chiefe delyght consisteth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycular combat with theyr owne kind.</p>
            <p>Another sort (of a more mallicious nature) wyll lye in wayte (in theyr droonkennesse) to entrap their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with some disceypt. And such I accoumpt (for all theyr cunning) trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed into Foxes, and wyly Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What shoulde I speake of the
<pb facs="tcp:6018:6"/>
Lecherous Droonkarde, who (lyke a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Goate) wyll spare neyther Sex, Age, Kyndred, nor companion, in the fylthy heate of his lewde concupyscence. Or of the prowde Droonkarde, whiche (Peacocklike) doth iet in euery stréete: Neyther ashamed to shew his vyle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytie, nor yet neuer abashed, tyll hée fall downe in the channel, as the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks pride is abated when hée looketh towardes his féete.</p>
            <p>To conclude, they are all eyther boggishly dronke, and then lye vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and belching with great griefe, and greater offence, or else they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Asses, and sluggishly consume in sleepe, that Golden tyme which is lent vs to vse and bestowe to the honour of God, and for our owne auayle.</p>
            <p>So that (as I sayde) I dare take in hande to defende this proposition, that <hi>All Droonkards are Beastes.</hi> And since God hath made none other so notable difference betwéene Man and Beast, as that he hath endewed the one, and depriued the other of reason and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
<pb facs="tcp:6018:7"/>
I thought méete both to translate the foresayde Epistle, and also somewhat of my selfe, to wryte as an Inuectyue, against this so perryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a Théefe, which so robbeth and despoyleth men of the most precious Iewell and treasure which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth vpon them. And to beginne with the Epistle of S. Augustine, the wordes thereof are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ALthough, my deerly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi> I hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you through the grace of Christ, wyll feare Droonkennesse, as you feare the pit of Hell: and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you wyl drinke no more then is conuenient, but also that you wyll not compell or allure any other to drinke more then wyll suffise: yet shall you take in good part this councell of mine, because it can not be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
<pb facs="tcp:6018:7"/>
but that some will be ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and are not able to keepe them selues sober. But you which doo alwayes banquette soberlie, and temperately, take not this as spoken to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche: for it is necessarie that we do sometimes rebuke dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes.</p>
            <p>Then whereas (welbeloued brethren) Droonkennesse is a great euyll, and an odious sin vnto God: yet is it so growen in vse, with many menne through the whole world: that with such as wyll not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, it is now taken to be no great sinne: so that they mocke and scoffe in their banquettes, at suche as can not beare many Cuppes, and are not ashamed to bynde men by an enuious
<pb facs="tcp:6018:8"/>
knotte of friendship that they shall drinke more then beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

For what greater imperfection can we alledge in the most brute and sauage Beasts, then to follow sensuall appetyte, vnto al vaine apparaunce of delyghtes?

thervnto kindle and prouooke them.

And now to touch our purpose more perticularly: Beasts are satisfied with drinking once or twise a day at ordinary and accustomed howres, but men are not ashamed to syt bybbing, quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and tossing of pottes, whole daies and nyghtes: So that a iust accoumpt of their lyues being called, they maye seeme ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borne to do none other thing, or else to

haue so guilty mispent their time, that the most brute and senceles Beastes, are able to accuse them of sundry huge enormities.</p>
            <p>By these and sundry other reasons, I thought not impertynent to name this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable vice of droonkennesse, the <hi>Circe</hi> or <hi>Medea,</hi> which Metamorphoseth, &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmeth men into most ougly and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous shapes &amp; proporcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: wherof I haue brought foorth some examples out of holy scriptures, and others some out of the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Aucthors, which wrote the factes and gouernmentes of the famous <hi>Romaines.</hi>

            <p>But now if we consider our own age (yea our owne Nation) the verye chiefe cause which made me prefume to adde this smal treatise, vnto the Epistle of S. <hi>Angustine,</hi> we shal find by too true experience, that we doo so much exceede al those that haue gone before vs, that if they might seeme as men transfourmed into Beasts, we shal rather appeare as Beasts mishapen &amp; chaunged into Deuyls. And in this accusation, I doo not onely summon the <hi>Germaines</hi> (who of auncient tyme haue beene the continuall Wardens of the Droonkards fraternitye and corporation,) but I would also cyte to
<pb facs="tcp:6018:19"/>
appeare our newfangled Englyshe men, which thinke skorne to leaue any newe fashion (so that it be euyll) vntryed or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>followed. For now a dayes what Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, what Artificer, nay, what botcher, or boongler, in any occupation, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to enuite his friende to dynner, or supper, vnlesse he doo his best, to geue him a Cap of <hi>Magis</hi> (as they terme it) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile both the Coffer of their store, and the treasure of theyr soule, with counterfeyts names to cloake their beastly inuentions: Wherin I note the vyce so much the more daungerous, since they cannot denye, that they are dayly therof both admonished and reproued by sundyr learned &amp; godly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Preachers: who painfully and zealously doo exhort them from this Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Carowsing, and tossing of Pots.</p>
            <p>But what amendment followeth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs? surely I tremble to wryte it, and it greeueth mee sufficiently to thinke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in steede of reformation, they scoffe and taunt amongst them selues, in theyr banquets, saying: <hi>Friendes we are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Quasse, or to Carowse, and therfore let vs vse none other drynking but a harty

But it were folly to stand so much vpon these meane personages, who for lacke of wytte or good education, maye easily be enclyned to thinges vndecent.</p>
            <p>I woulde (for God) that our gentrie, and

old English Habergeone, and of a <hi>Turkie</hi> bonnet, a Copentank for <hi>Caiphas:</hi> In lyke manner we were woont (in tymes past) to contempne and condempne the <hi>Almaines</hi> and other of the low Countreyes, for theyr beastly drinking and quassing. But nowe a dayes (although we vse it not dayly lyke them, for it séemes that they are naturally enclyned vnto that vyce) yet, when we doo make banquets and merymentes; as wée terme them, we surpasse them very farre: and small difference is founde betwirt vs and them, but only that they (by a custome. rooted amongst them, &amp; become next Cose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to nature as beforesayd) doo dayly wallow in a grosse maner of beastlines, &amp; we think to cloake the filthinesse therof by amore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable solemnitye, &amp; by the cleanly tytle of curtesie. The <hi>Almaines</hi> with their smal Kenish wine are contented: or rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faile a cup of Béere may entreate them to stoupe: But we must haue March beere, dooble dooble Béere, Dagger ale, Bragget, Renish wine, White wine, French wine, Gascoyne wine, Sack, Hollocke, Canaria wine, <hi>Vino greco: Vinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amabile,</hi> &amp; al the wines that may be gotten: Yea wine of it selfe is
<pb facs="tcp:6018:21"/>
not sufficient, but Suger, Limons, &amp; su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry sortes of Spices, must be drowned therin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to minister mater vnto our vaine delights &amp; to beguile our selues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baite which dronkennesse doth therein lay for vs. And all this must be couered with the cleanlye name of curtesy, &amp; friendly entertainment.</p>
            <p>But geue mee leaue (O <hi>Droonkards</hi>) to aske you this question, if by this curtesy, &amp; friendly entertainement of yours, a friend which is constrayned thus to pledge you, doo chance to surfeyte, &amp; to fal thereby into such distemper, that he dye thereof: what kind of curtesie shall we then accoumpt it? or what friendship can be found in such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? yea, if he escape surfeyting or daunger of death, (which is seldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded in them that vse drinking vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably) yet if his former good fame &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyte be thereby so much touched, that his grauest friends take iust occasion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, &amp; to withdrawe theyr good wyls from him: shall hee not haue iust cause to condempne this curtesy as cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfayt, and curse this feyned friendship? At the least, though his worldly friendes wynke, and temporall death forbeare him a whyle, let
<pb facs="tcp:6018:21"/>
him yet not thinke to escape the iust iudge ment of God, who punisheth the abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of iniquitie, vnto the third &amp; fowrth generation. And in these thrée poynts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially haue I considred the enormity of this sinne: For that it weakeneth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungerth mans body dayly, it impayreth his credite openly, and woundeth his soule secréetly. So that for mine owne perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinion, I could wyshe that (<hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> lyke) we dyd altogether banishe from our banquets, the common curtesy of drinking one to another at all: not that I would see me thereby to condempne it (of it selfe) if it be but temperately vsed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I finde that the pleasauntnesse of the drinke, and the infirmity of our nature doo beget one draught vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with curtesie, we ende with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and beastlynesse. And well wrote hée which sayd, that the first Cuppe quenched thyrst, the seconde enduced myrth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysing in hart, the thyrd voluptuosnesse, the fowrth droonkennesse, the fifth wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, the syxt contenciousnesse, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth furiousnesse, the eyght sluggishnesse, and the nynth, extremitie of sycknesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6018:22"/>But with vs, nyne dranghts: yea, nyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene draughts: nay, somtime nine &amp; twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty doo not suffice. And whereas the Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gaue no further warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then for the second draught, and séemed to thinke that (passing further then that) concupiscence straight waies crept in, we ar not abashed to breake their boundes, &amp; make concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense but a tryfling fault in comparison of our beastly excesse. For fyrst to speake of sicknesse and infyrmities, what knoweth be which taketh the Cup in hand to drink vnto another, whether he haue asmuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght to pledge, as he hath to drinke vnto him? or whether the constitution of his body, wyll so well awaye with excessiue drynking, as his owne wyll? then must it follow, that if the Pledger be not of lyke disposition, the Bryncher is guyltie of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring vnto sinne: And if he were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly disposed as hée, yet at the least hee must bee guyltie in styrring him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce thereof: In lyke manner, if the Pledger bée inwardlie sicke, or haue some infyrmitie, whereby too much drinke (or drynking, when nature doeth not desyre it) doo empayre his health, and shorten
<pb facs="tcp:6018:22"/>
his lyfe, then doeth the Bryncher séeme to bee guyltie of his death: Yea, though he bée of a lustye dysposition and constitution of body, (considering the sundrie sicknesses which growe vppon surfeytes) the Bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher doth at the least, put a naked Sworde in a mad mannes hande: and is culpable both of his owne transgression, and of his fellowes faulte: this is then one braunche of this droonken curtesie.</p>
            <p>But to speake of empayring the credite both of himselfe, and his companion, what greater shame can bée shewed, then to weaken reason and vnderstanding, which are the pryncipall gyftes that we receyue of God? to lee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the power, to guyde or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne our handes? feete? tongue? and other members, whiche are lent vs of God, to serue him with honour? to bleare our eyes? puffe vp our face? and to cast our heayre? whiche are the ornamentes of nature, to bée vsed vnto the glorye of our creatour? to buylde a kingdome for lust and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence? to chase vertue from our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? to bewraye secréetes? to become our enemies iesting stocke, and our friendes cause of lamentation? to ronne headlong
<pb facs="tcp:6018:23"/>
into euery peryll, to begyn lyke Apes, &amp; to ende lyke Asses? to geue occasion of strife lyke wrathfull Boares, and to yéelde vnto the slaughter lyke weaklings and Calues? To conclude, I knowe nothing that maye more impayre mans credite, then of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soule to become a brute &amp; senceles Beast: and this is the second braunche of this curtesie &amp; friendship which we vse in drynking and Duassing: Nowe finally to proue that it woundeth mans soule, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, in that almighty God hath aswell by his Prophets, as also by his Apostles, so often and so manifoldly reproued &amp; forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the same. And we must fyrmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that whosoeuer doth wyttingly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the counsels or commandements of almighty God, conteined in his holy word, doth manifestly wound and hurt his own soule: in that he doth aggreuate his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal imperfections, &amp; render himselfe more and more culpable of Gods iudgementes. For the Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> in his fowrth Chap. hath these words: <hi>VVo be vnto them that ryse vp early to folow droonkennesse:</hi> now this word <hi>(VVo)</hi> in the holy Scriptures is commonly taken for a gréeuous curse and
<pb facs="tcp:6018:23"/>
threatning: but the Prophet doth procéede more plainly, saying: <hi>In their feastes are Harps and Lutes, Tabrets, Pipes, &amp; vvine: but they regard not the Lord, and consider not the operatiou of his handes: therefore commeth my folke vnto captiuity, because they haue none vnderstanding: their glory is famished with hunger, aud their multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (or plentye) dried vp with thyrst: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gapeth hell</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and openeth hir mouth maruailous wyde, that their glory, multitude, and wealth, with such as reioyce therein, may descend into it:</hi> And againe in his. xxviii. Chapt. speaking of the prowde Potestates, he sayth: <hi>VVo bee vnto the crowne of pryde, euen vnto the droonken people of Ephraim, whose great pompe is as a flowre, &amp;c.</hi> And speaking against false Iudges and Teachers, he sayth: <hi>They are out of the way, by reason of wine, yea, farre out of the waye, through strong drinke.</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbs hath su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry passages against this lothsome vyce: as in the. xx. Chap. he sayeth. <hi>VVine maketh a man scorneful, and strong drinke causeth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vnquiet: who so delighteth therin shall not be wyse.</hi> And in the. xxxi. Cha. he
<pb facs="tcp:6018:24"/>
sayth: <hi>O Lamuel, it is not for Kings, it is not for Kings (I saye) to drinke vvine, nor Princes strong drinke: least they by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forgette the Lawe, and peruert the iudgement of all poore mennes chyldren:</hi> The Prophete <hi>Amos</hi> in the sixt Chapter, reprouing the Princes of Israell, for wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in vayne delyghtes, reckeneth on the abhomination of a Droonkard, in these words: <hi>They drinke wine in Bowles</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>and annoynt them selues with chiefe oyntmennts, but no man is sorie for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
               </hi> Micheas also in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Chapter, taunting and reproouing the chyldishnesse, and ignoraunce of the people, sayth: <hi>If a man lye falsely: saying, I wyll prophesie to thee of vvine, and strong drinke, that were a meete Prophet for this people.</hi> And the Prophete Abacuc in his seconde Chapter, seemeth to ioyne the prowde man and the Droonkard together, where he sayeth: <hi>Yea in deede the prowde man, is as hee that transgresseth by vvine, therefore shall he not endure: because hee hath enlarged his desyre as the hell, and is as death:</hi> And in the end of the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:6018:24"/>
he sayeth: <hi>VVoo bee vnto him that geueth his neyghbour drinke: thou ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thy rage, and makest him droonken also, that thou mayst see theyr priuities: thou arte fylled with shame, for glorie: drinke thou also, and bee made naked, the Cuppe of the Lordes right hande, shall be turned vnto thee, and shamefull spewing shalbe for thy glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude this proposition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I myght héere alledge, very many other textes of holy Scriptures, which doo expressedly reproue this lothsome abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I thinke it sufficient to recyte the wordes of <hi>Paule,</hi> in the sixt Chapter of his fyrst Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where (amongste sundrye other vyces) hée pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth playne sentence against Droon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes, saying: <hi>That they shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte the kingdome of God:</hi> And in his fyfth Chapter to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> hée repeateth (in manner) the selfe same wordes. This is then the thyrde branche of the fruites which grow by this beastly vyce, euen the wrath of God, and losse of the heauenly habitation.</p>
            <p>Nowe if these aucthorities, examples,
<pb facs="tcp:6018:25"/>
counsels, and commandements, séeme not sufficient to terrifye vs from falling into this swynish and filthye abhomination. I can doo no more. but praye vnto God, that some better learned, and more eloquent then I, maye (by assistance of his holy spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) be made able to set downe such whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lessons for the auoyding thereof, that the excesse and custome of the same, maye generallye throughout all Christendome, and especially héere in England, be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And the plagues and punishmentes by him threatened and pronounced (by his clemency and mercy) may be withdrawne and remytted: So that in all cleanesse and purenesse of hart, we maye praise his name: To whome with the Sonne and the holy Ghost, bée all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, power and glory, nowe and for euer. So bée it.</p>
