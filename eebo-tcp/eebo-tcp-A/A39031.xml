         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE is not any Thing that
can Recommend Vertue to the
World, with ſo much Force
and Advantage, as the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of thoſe that eminently Practiſe it.
<pb facs="tcp:61440:3"/>
Vertue is like Beauty in this, That it
has Peculiar and Nameleſs Charms, in
the Living Original, which no Art can
poſſibly repreſent in the Draughts or
Deſcriptions of it.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the great Unhappineſs of the
World, that theſe Excellent Examples
are ſeldom very Numerous: And none
but thoſe who live within the Sphere of
their Converſe, can have the Benefit of
their Influence: And, which is yet a
greater Diſadvantage, perhaps ſeveral
of theſe, like your Ladiſhip, do Love
and Chuſe Retirement. In which caſe
they can be ſeen but by Few.</p>
            <p>All that we can do then for the Reſt
of the World, towards the making them
in Love with Vertue, and the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to Court and ſeek it, lies in
theſe following Things. We muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them with as exact a Draught and
Picture of this Beauty as we can, in
the clear and diſtinct Explications of
Vertue. We muſt add to this, the moſt
fitting and advantageous Dreſs, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it the becoming Illuſtrations and
<pb facs="tcp:61440:3"/>
deſerved Praiſes. And it may further
conduce to our Purpoſe, to draw alſo,
and ſet near the Former, the deform'd
Characters of the oppoſite Vices;
which, like a Black-a-more by a Fair
Lady, will ſet off the Beauty to more
Advantage.</p>
            <p>Thus much, I preſume, is tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
perform'd in the following Book,
which is greatly Ambitious to obtain
the Honour of Your Ladiſhip's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there is but one Thing
remaining, that can be ſerviceable to our
Purpoſe: But 'tis that which ſeems as
Neceſſary and Conducing as all the Reſt
that we can do. And that is to aſſure
the World, That the Excellent Draught,
or Picture we have made, is the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and Character of ſome Real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who rather Excels, than falls ſhort
of the Repreſentation. Without this,
the Skill of the Repreſenter may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
but the Thing repreſented can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
when it is not known, that there
is any ſuch Thing really in Being; and
<pb facs="tcp:61440:4"/>
ſo the Deſign of the Labour would be
loſt, and the End fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>When we propoſe a Perſon, in whom
thoſe Excellent Characters of Vertue
may all be found, and that with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
then we make it known, that the
Precepts and Rules preſcrib'd, are not
Notions but Practice; they are not only
what ought to be done, but what is
done; they are not invented, but are
raiſed fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Obſervation. When we
can mention an Excellent Example, we
confute that Prejudice which deters the
Cowardly and Mean Spirits, from the
Purſuit of Vertue; who repreſent it to
themſelves, as too ſtrict in the Rules of
it, as a Thing in Imagination only,
and as too difficult, or even impoſſible
to be put in Practice: And we do that
which will inſpire the more Generous
Souls, with a Spirit of Emulation; and
kindle, in all ſuch, a brave Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to imitate and equal, if they can,
what is ſo Excellent and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61440:4"/>
It is for this, Madam, that I have
made ſo bold, as to ſet Your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Name to the Front of this Book.
'Tis well known of Your Ladiſhip,
by all that have the Honour and the
Happineſs of Your Acquaintance, that
the beſt Characters here are no more
the Deſcription of an Excellent Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
than they are Characters of You.
And they will all bear with me this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to Your Worth, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſoever this Deſcription comes ſhort
of the Subject, it might be perfectly
compleated by one that were able to
compleat Your Excellent Character.
To the Inſtances of particular Vertues
in the Body of the Book, I had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to add an Univerſal One.</p>
            <p>This Apology, Madam, I ought to
make for my Interrupting Your better
Employment; for venturing to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
thoſe Vertues to the World, which
Your Ladiſhip does ſeek to Conceal;
and for aſcribing thoſe Praiſes, which
You are as unwilling as deſerving to
receive. I hope You will be pleaſed
<pb facs="tcp:61440:5"/>

Honour and Advantage of Your Sex

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>To the Female Sex,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Preſent you here with a Piece of Morality,
wherein you have the Characters of Vertues
and Vices; drawn, indeed, with deſign to
Recommend the One Sort, and to Expoſe the Other:
Yet I think it is done with Sincerity too, and that
there needs no more but to repreſent theſe Things
truly for both thoſe Purpoſes. The Book, I am
ſure, would moſt effectually recommend its ſelf to
you, if you would take the Pains to Read and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it well; and compare what it ſays, with the
Common Practice of the World. This is the beſt
Way to know fully how <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful and Important to you
thoſe Intimations are, which are here preſented.
But ſince this cannot be known without ſuch an uſe
of it, and eſpecially thoſe who have moſt need of
theſe Inſtructions, will be apt to neglect them, I
think fit to ſay ſome few Things to Recommend the
Reading of it.</p>
            <p>It is deſign'd and directed to ſerve the Honour
and Happineſs of the Female Sex, who are perhaps
the larger Half of Mankind; and who doubtleſs
are, or may be, as Important, at leaſt, as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:61440:6"/>
I cannot chuſe but think, that the Glory and
Worth, and Happineſs of any Nation depends as
much upon them, as upon the Men. And, perhaps,
others will be of my Mind, if it be conſider'd; That
we are born of them; that we commonly derive
from them what we are in our Nature, more than
from the other Parent: So far as this does depend
upon the frame of the Body, which is not a little, it
is form'd in the Womb. We are beholden to our
Mothers Vertue and good Diſpoſition, and wiſe
ordering of her ſelf for our natural Inclinations to
any Vertue, for the Calmneſs of our Temper, for
the Brightneſs of our Wit, for the Regularity of our
Conſtitutions, and for the Strength of our Bodies.
And on the contrary, from their Exorbitant Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we are diſpoſed to great Paſſions; and from
their ungovern'd Appetites, their Intemperance and
other Vices, we often derive the Strength of Vitious
Inclinations, a crazy Conſtitution, and a weak
Body? But further will their Influence upon the
World appear, if we conſider that Invincible, and
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Law of Nature, which inclines the other
Sex to love and ſeek their Converſation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>From hence it muſt needs follow, That their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Men, may be commonly as great as
they will. Their Example will effectually lead us;
we cannot chuſe but put on ſome Conformity to thoſe
whom we love: Their Perſwaſions and Inſtigations
will powerfully provoke and excite us; their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and Applauſe is a great Encouragement, and
their Condemnation or Diſlike, neceſſarily weakens
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:61440:6"/>
and diſpirits our Endeavours. Do not theſe things
appear in the Experience of all Ages? Could <hi>Adam</hi>
himſelf long keep his Innocence, when <hi>Eve</hi> had eaten
the forbidden Fruit, and added to that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of him to do the ſame? Was not the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Saul</hi> mov'd to a mortal Envy againſt <hi>David,</hi>
becauſe the Women in their Songs and Applauſes,
had preferr'd the lucky Youth before the practis'd
Warriour? Did not the Idolatrous Wives ſo far
prevail with <hi>Solomon,</hi> as to draw that wiſe Prince
into the abſurd Sin of Idolatry? Do not Hiſtories
ſhow us that they have been able to perſwade, even,
the greateſt Men to what they would? That they
have by their Inſtigation overturn'd Kingdoms,
confounded Commonwealths, laid Cities deſolate,
and brought to paſs the greateſt Revolutions and
Confuſions? And that on the other ſide, they have
ſometimes been the Springs and firſt Movers of the
Braveſt Actions? Have they not ſaved many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Contributed greatly many times to the
Strength and Proſperity of Commonwealths? Some
of theſe Things may be ſeen in the following Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We may ſee it common in the World, that the other
Sex are often but the Tools and Slaves to their
Vices; or the Inſtruments and Servants of their
Vertues: And indeed, that they take Delight in
being ſo; that 'tis uſually their greateſt Joy and
Pleaſure, and the moſt ſenſible part in the Reward
of their Hazards and Labours, to have pleaſed
this Sex in what they have done; to have promoted
the Honour and Intereſt, or to have gain'd the
Praiſe and Favour of the Woman that is loved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61440:7"/>
Theſe Things are not ſaid to Impute to them
all the Vice and Folly of the World; but to ſhow,
from the Influence which they can have in it, How
neceſſary and Important it is, that they be brought
up in Learning and Vertue, and have their Minds
well furniſh'd and govern'd by theſe Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They have contributed no more towards
Vice, than towards Vertue. What harm that Sex
did to the World in <hi>Eve,</hi> they have made us a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
amends for in the Bleſſed Virgin. What harm
ſoever they do to the preſent Age, and whatever their
ſhare may be in the Vices and Follies of it, this we
may juſtly blame the Men for; who take upon them
to govern all Things, and condemn the Women to
ſuch an Education, as can render them but very
little uſeful, and leaves them apt to be only miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
and hurtful to the World. Certainly
there cannot poſſibly be a greater over-ſight, than
to baniſh them to thoſe little, trivial and uſeleſs Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
which uſually take up their precious Time
of Leaſure, and a ſingle Life. To confine them
to the Molding up of Wax, when they ſhould be
forming of their Minds, by the Laws of Vertue
and Wiſdom: To learn the adjuſting of their
Cloaths, rather than of their Words and Actions.
If theſe Employments keep them out of the way of
ſuch Temptations as would corrupt them; yet what
good do they put into them? If they keep them
from Vice, what Vertue do they form in their
Minds? The Truth is, they cannot hinder the
growth of Vice and Folly, from the Seeds of them
that are in our corrupted Nature. Theſe will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61440:7"/>
and get Strength in them, by the Exerciſe of
their own Thoughts. Ill deſires will be ſtirring,
if they are kept from evil Actions: And they may
be corrupted by their own untaught and ungovern'd
Diſcourſes with each other.</p>
            <p>There is no Oppoſition to Vice and Folly made by
this Sort of Education; and then it muſt needs
grow if it be not check'd and kill'd: yea it rather
ſerves to cheriſh and promote it. They are bred
in a great concern and care abeut their Bodies,
and in a neglect of their Minds; they are taught to
ſtrive to recommend themſelves to the World without
any real worth, and meerly by the Ornament and
diſpoſal of the Outſide. What meaſure of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
are they taught, by making the Image of a
Fair Woman, with but one Garment on, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing
a Black-a-moor? Their Muſick joyn'd with
ſuch Songs, as have for their common Subjects ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fond Love, or obſcene Intimations, or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Flatteries of their Sex; what does it
but cheriſh Vanity and Pride, and feed and excite
fooliſh and ſhameful Deſires? And what Vertue
are they taught, what uſeful Knowledge are they
poſſeſs'd with, by this Education? What Vertue
do they learn by the Management of the Needle?
How little may they underſtand of Fortitude, or
poſſeſs of it, for all the Forming of a Broad-ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Image in Wax, and the ſetting it by a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar?
Or what degrees of Charity does it put into
them, and what Rules of Exerciſing it are taught
them, by their learning to make up the Image of a
Woman, with Three naked Children about her?
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61440:8"/>
What do they learn of the Nature and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of
Fruits and Plants, while they learn to imitate them
in their Shape and Colour? Might not the Wit
that can excel in theſe Curious and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs
Trifles, be taught more important Things? Why
might they not learn Phyſick and Chirurgery, as
well as Cookery; to ſave as well as to deſtroy Men
pleaſantly? That which is a Vice rather than an
Accompliſhment, as commonly practiſed; why are
they not as ſoon taught the wholeſomeneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſomeneſs
of Meats and Drinks, as what is
Pleaſant and Grateful to the Palate? Why have
they not Lectures of Morality read to them in their
Schools, and the Miſtreſſes ſhowing them the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of the Precepts of Vertue?
Why may not they learn Languages as well as we?
Whenever they ſet well about it, they commonly
do it better than we can. And if they were taught
the Art of Reaſoning, and the Art of Speaking; if
their Minds were well furniſhed with Philoſophy and
Divinity; if they were plentifully endowed with
uſeful Knowledge and refined Vertue, we ſhould
not think one Language, nor hardly one Tongue
enough for them. Their chief Time for Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is ſpent without Improvement, and all they learn
in it is not any thing that they can ever be the wiſer,
or the better, or the happier for. Their Education is
not directed, nor deſign'd to teach them how Odious
a Thing Vice is; how ſhameful and contemptible
Ignorance, and how Glorious and Lovely a Thing
it is to be Vertuous. We have reformed our Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,
the Schools of our Women, from Popery and
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:61440:8"/>
Superſtition, but not from Pride and Vanity; nor
have made them, as we ſhould do, the Schools
of Vertue, and Religion, and uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>See here the Ground and Reaſon of all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Diſparagements of that Sex. Hence are
we ſo often vexed or tainted with their Vices and
Follies: This is the fundamental Occaſion of all
the juſt Complaints that are made againſt them.
And moſt unjuſty are they uſed, while they are
bred to be of no uſe, and then are deſpiſed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo: and while there is no care taken to poſſeſs
them with Vertue, and Religion, and Learning,
and then they are railed at for Ignorance, Folly
and Vice. To this Cauſe muſt all their Emptineſs
and Impertinence be imputed; hence 'tis they are
no more uſeful to the World. To this alſo, we
muſt impute all their Vices, the ill Influence they
have among Men, and all the Miſchief they
do.</p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee how Important it is to the
World, and how much for the Intereſt of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sex, that the Women be bred to uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Vertue. And thus I have follow'd the
Common Cuſtom, in giving the Preference to the
Men, and ſpeaking firſt of their Intereſt in this
Matter.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now apply my ſelf directly to the Women
themſelves, and endeavour to make it appear to
them, how Important and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful it is to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to be Learned and Vertuous. Something
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:61440:9"/>
is ſaid of Learning in the following Book, and
therefore I ſhall ſay the leſs here; and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Vertues are recommended, and therefore I
ſhall only inſiſt upon ſome General Commendations
of it.</p>
            <p>Let me intreat you then, to conſider the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and the Advantage of Knowledge. This
is, like Light, Chearing and Delightful to the
Mind; and Ignorance, like Darkneſs, is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and Sad. Knowledge enlarges the Soul,
Ignorance contracts it. The former is the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Beauty of the Soul, and adds Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
to it, as Poliſhing does to a Jewel, the latter
ſullies, and dims, and makes it ugly. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
elevates the Mind, Ignorance depreſſes it:
Knowledge tends to refine it from the Dregs of
Senſuality, Ignorance leaves it polluted. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
improves its Powers, encreaſes its Liberty
and Freedom, and releaſes its Activity from
the Shackles that Ignorance lays upon it. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is weak and poor, Knowledge is rich and
Strong. Enough cannot be ſaid in Praiſe of this
ineſtimable Thing.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, are Moral and Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
moſt to be valued; theſe do eſpecially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and adorn, and will make you acceptable
to God and the World, and eaſie and happy in
your ſelves. The Rules of Pious and Vertuous
Living, are the certain Rules of Happineſs. The
making of us Vertuous and Good, is the greateſt
Bleſſing, and the higheſt Benefit that can poſſibly
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:61440:9"/>
be conferr'd upon us. Thoſe are moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Ignorant of the Natures, both of Vertue and
Vice, that imagine there can be a greater Good
than the One, or a greater Evil than the Other;
that we can be Happy and Vicious, or miſerable
and excellently Vertuous. Vertue and Wiſdom
tame the Appetites, and guide them Safely and
Honourably. They Compoſe and Calm the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and quiet the Mind. Vertue ſets the Soul
in Order, which is Beautiful and Pleaſant; it
teaches every Faculty and Power in us its right
Place and Office, makes it know its Bounds and
do its Duty: Vice Diſorders and Confounds all.
Vertue is the Health, Vice the Sickneſs of the
Soul; and as the Health of the Body improves
and maintains its Beauty and Strength, ſo does
Vertue for the Soul; and Vice, on the contrary,
Weakens, Deforms, and gives it Pain ànd Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Vertue is Serene and Calm, Vice is Stormy
and Tempeſtuous: The Vertuous Woman may
live without Fear or Diſtruſt, in Tranquility and
Repoſe. She has no cauſe to bluſh in Company, nor
to tremble when ſhe is alone. She can enjoy the
Preſent Time with Quietneſs and Peace; has
neither Shame nor Remorſe for what is paſt; and
none but fair and joyful Hopes for what is to
come. The moſt laſting and moſt taſteful Pleaſure
attends it: Pleaſure, that no Man can take from
her; ſuch Delight as does not Torment with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
nor make her Sick with Diſguſt; that
does not depend as thoſe of the World do on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:61440:10"/>
Circumſtances, whereof if any one be
wanting, they are Odious or Inſipid. Vertue and
Wiſdom are the only Things that can fit you for
all Conditions, to adorn them and be happy in
them. They direct to the moſt Honourable and
comfortable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe both of a Good and Bad For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
both of a Married and a Single State.</p>
            <p>Theſe (believe me) are the moſt powerful,
and the moſt laſting Charms. Theſe will gain
you true Admirers and ſincere Servants, while
outward Beauty and Ornament, procure only
fiegned Ones: And will hold the Hearts they
win faſter than the fading Advantages of an
outſide. Inclination may make a Man Court and
Seek you, it may be enough to be a Woman for
this, eſpecially if to that there be added Beauty
and the Invincible Charms of a good Fortune;
but theſe cannot beget a true and laſting love.
Without Wiſdom, and Vertue, and Knowledge.
The Servant is no ſooner better acquainted, but it
may be Folly and Vice diſtaſte him, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
are at an End. If Intereſt engage him
ſtill, then he proceeds to make up the propoſed
Bargain; and there is a Marriage without
Love, which is an Hell upon Earth. Beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe Things, though it be Charming at the
firſt Sight, yet it can ſecure none but the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt fooliſh Part of Mankind; and in
them it kindles no more than a brutiſh Deſire,
which turns into Diſtaſte very commonly, as ſoon
as it is gratified. Their mighty Admiration falls into
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:61440:10"/>
Contempt; and one may ſee the fine and pretty
thing ſitting alone, for all him, while the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Lover is hugging a Bottle perhaps and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Glaſs inſtead of her, and any thing is able to
draw or detain him from her Company. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Vertue would make you worthy of that
Love-which Nature inclines us to preſent you, and
would make your Society always pleaſant and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
deſirable, and that to the beſt and wiſeſt of
Men.</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall advantage to you, that as Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Vertue are the moſt charming things and
will give you the greateſt power you can have over
the other Sex; ſo they will direct you to judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Men, and to place your Favours and Affections
there where they are beſt deſerv'd, where they will be
beſt requited, where it will be moſt for your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Happineſs to place them. As theſe will
inable you to know and diſcern which are the beſt
and wiſeſt of them, ſo they will diſpoſe you to
value ſuch Men moſt, and to prefer them. When
guided by theſe you will not be caught with fine
Cloaths or a ſpruce Mien; you will not fall in
love with a Man for his boaſting of and commending
himſelf, nor for his addreſſing blaſphemous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
to you, you will not judge of his worth
by the former trick, nor of his love by the latter.
You will not think to be happy and be at the mercy
of a fool, or expect that he will uſe you well
who has not one Vertue to direct or diſpoſe him to
do ſo. Nor will you think that an abundance of
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:61440:11"/>
Wealth is ſufficient alone to make you happy. And
let me add, That your Conſtant preference of the
beſt and wiſeſt Men would be one of the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
means to reform the Age. It would ſoon
make Vertue and Wiſdom more generally ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among Men, when it ſhould appear that theſe
were abſolutely neceſſary to the recommending them
to your Favour and Eſteem; and this alſo would
return to your advantage, ſince by this Influence
upon the World it would come to paſs, that you
could not want a proportionable number of fit
and worthy Objects of your Affections and Choice.
To your great advantage it would be, to ſtir up
in the Men an Ambition to be well accompliſht too;
to make them aſham'd of Ignorance and Vice
by your Example; and you your ſelves would be
the more happy in Brothers, Husbands, and
Children.</p>
            <p>And the Women of our Age have perhaps greater
advantage than ever their Anceſtours had for the
Improvement of their Minds; at leaſt ſo far as
the Reading of Good Books can contribute towards
this. When you have a great many of the beſt
Books in the World either wrote in your own
Language or Tranſlated into it. Tranſlation is a
mighty Favour to you. It brings the Wiſdom of
the Ancients to you unveil'd, and inables you
to ſtudy and learn it without the previous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
fatigue of Learning Languages. We
have lately ſeen ſome of the choiceſt Hiſtories and
beſt Pieces of uſeful Philoſophy that <hi>Greece</hi> or
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:61440:11"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> could boaſt of, Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
And ſtill this Work of Tranſlating goes on, and
will eſpecially do ſo if it has the Encouragement
and Favour of your Sex: And I would hope to
ſee our own Language as Learned as any other in
the World. And why may we not ſee the coſtly
uſeleſs Trifles that fill the Cloſets of our Ladies
thrown out, and Excellent and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Books ſet
up there in their ſtead. You have almoſt nothing
elſe to do but to ſtudy all the time that you live
ſingle, and are at liberty from Affairs of the
World. To be ſure there is nothing you can do ſo
much to your advantage as to entertain and employ
your ſelves much with Good Books. I need not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to you <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Hierocles,</hi> or <hi>Livy</hi>
or <hi>Seneca,</hi> or the Excellent <hi>Antoninus,</hi> lately
Tranſlated, with the Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> a Philoſopher of your own
Sex, at this time Famous for her Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Nor ſhall I mention any more, ſince they
may be met with at every Bookſellers: And it is
chiefly my preſent Buſineſs to Recommend the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Book.</p>
            <p>Here, then, you have the Characters of the
Vertues and Vices very faithfully and truly drawn.
Whereby you may learn to diſtinguiſh the one from
the other; and may avoid that common and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Error of miſtakeing Vertue for Vice,
and Vice for Vertue. Vice is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly Name, and
that which almoſt all abhor ſhould be imputed to
them; and Vertue is generally in the Notion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:61440:12"/>
and eſteemed, and therefore almoſt all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Vertue in general. But when we come to
the reproof of particular Vices, and to charge
them upon thoſe that are Guilty; and ſo when we
come to inſiſt upon particular Vertues and to urge
the Practice of them: Then the World boggles and
heſitates; or it may be is angry and oppoſes. Then
the beloved Vice will not be believed to be a Vice,
and it ſhall be accounted ill nature or moroſeneſs
or a particular ſpite that calls it ſo: And the Vertue
that we want, and do not care to put in practice,
will not be allow'd to be a Vertue, but ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
againſt. The one will be defended under a
ſoft and ſpecious name, and the other rejected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a bad one. Thus do many Perſons often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves to their diſparagement and ſhame
and miſery. While they cannot diſcern aright in
this matter, they perhaps ſhun the moſt Honourable
Vertues, and embrace the moſt ſhameful Vices.
They will refuſe what is good, and betake themſelves
to what is hurtful. They will be aſham'd of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and boaſt of their Vices. Further, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are apt for themſelves to find out this way to
evade the Arguments for Vertue, and the Reproofs
of Vice; ſo they will endeavour to influence others
after the ſame manner. They that are Vicious
naturally deſire to have others like themſelves, that
their better practice may not condemn or diſparage
them, that others may fall into the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
which they have brought themſelves to
by their wickedneſs, and ſo may not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:61440:12"/>
or deſpiſe them, or that they may accompliſh
upon thoſe who are yet afraid of Vice, ſome baſe
and ſhameful deſign. To theſe Purpoſes they
endeavour much the confounding of all things, and
eſpecially of the natural and common ſigns of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Vices in the Soul: Theſe they would fain
have not regarded, nor believed to be the Marks
and Symptoms of any ſuch things. Highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
it is then to be poſſeſt with a clear and diſtinct
knowledge of theſe things.</p>
            <p>And here you have Vertue repreſented in her
true Beauty and Luſtre, and the ugly Mask the
frightful Vizor which ſpiteful Sinners put upon her
is taken off. You may ſee her in all her Charms, as
far as they can be repreſented in a Deſcription or
Picture of her: which I confeſs cannot have the
advantages of the Life, in a ſublime Example,
but yet may be ſufficient to beget in us ſome Love
and Admiration of the Beauty. And here you have
alſo Vice repreſented in its true Colours, and all
her Deformity ſhown, as far as was conſiſtent
with Modeſty and Diſcretion: and the Paint and
Diſguiſe which the Vicious Wit of the World puts
upon her is alſo removed. Here are Motives to
Vertue, and juſt Diſſwaſives from Vice, propoſed.
The Means of practiſing and improving in the one,
and of abſtaining from, and mortifying the other.
You have the Subjects treated on, ſuch as are of
common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Concern, ſuch as relate to every
one: The Vertues ſuch as all may reach, and the
Vices ſuch as all are expoſed to. You have all
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:61440:13"/>
the Diſcourſe plain and eaſie: Free from the crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
terms of the Schools. You have a Philoſopher
not dictating after the rudeneſs of an Academy,
but complementing and inſinuating his wholſome
Counſels in the ſtile and manner of a Courtier.
And if thàt will recommend the Book, further I
muſt tell you, That the moſt of it was written by
a very Eminent Perſon in a Neighbour Nation,
who had the Honour to be a Counſellour and
Preacher in Ordinary to the King that then Reigned
there.</p>
            <p>Here you have an Excellent Anatomy as it were
of the Soul, a view of the Inſides of Mankind,
ſo that you may ſee the ſecret Motions, Workings,
and Effects of all ſorts of Paſſions and Humours.
Here you may learn the World then without mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it, which is the ſafeſt way and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt
of doing this: For thus you will not be in
danger of being corrupted or vexed with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
and folly of it while you are learning it,
which things in Converſe you will be conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to. This Book, like a Mariners Chart, ſhows
the Rocks and Shelves of Vice whereon unwary and
untaught Souls are wont to make Shipwrack of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
perhaps of Health, of Fortune and Eſtate.
And it ſhows the Safe and the Honourable Roads of
Vertue. And is it not a very Important and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
thing to be taught theſe Matters before we
launch into the World? Without this we ſhall be in
danger of learning the Shelves in this dangerous
Sea, by running aground there, and the Rocks, by
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:61440:13"/>
ſplitting upon them. Without a previous Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Inſtruction about what we are to avoid
and what to chuſe, we ſhall learn the World only
to imitate it, we ſhall learn and comply, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be as like it as we can; we ſhall be led
away with the Error of the Wicked, and follow a
Multitude to do Evil. We are naturally prone to
imitate what we ſee done by others, and more prone
to imitate Evil than Good; and we ſhall commonly
meet with more Ill Examples than Good ones. By
conſequence we ſhall be in greater likelihood of
learning and following Vice than Vertue, if we are
not fenced againſt it by Good Inſtruction before we
venture into the World.</p>
            <p>Let me add, 'Tis of very great Importance to
you to be as early as is poſſible acquainted with theſe
things; to learn betimes the Knowledge and Practice
of Vertue. For as much as Habits of Good or Ill
are continually growing in us; but eſpecially in our
young and tender Years. Our Actions in thoſe
Years are as it were the Seeds or Foundations of
future Habits: which we contract when we are
young, and are not able to leave when we are
old. But if we cannot rightly diſcern Good from
Evil, we ſhall become accuſtomed to do Evil before
we know what it is. And if once we are arrived as
this, it will be a matter of as much difficulty to cure
our ſelves, as it were for the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> to change
his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots. This encreaſes
the difficulty of convincing us of our Faults. We
ſhall be loth to own that we have been in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
This will engage us to juſtifie our Faults ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:61440:14"/>
than acknowledge them, that we may let our
ſelves go on without ſhame or remorſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
if we are convinced of a Fault, after that
difficulty is over, there is more remaining, and 'tis
yet a very large task to conquer and forſake it, when
'tis become as it were a ſecond nature. It is eaſie
to correct and form young and tender Inclinations
to Evil. But when ſeveral Years are gone over
them, and they are become confirm'd Habits, they
are then not eaſily ſubdued. We muſt then know
Vertue and Vice betimes, and know them in their
leaſt beginnings and loweſt degrees that we may
practice the one, and abſtain from the other.</p>
            <p>And 'tis neceſſary that we begin betimes to
practice Vertue and to reſiſt and avoid Vice, that we
may be inured and accuſtomed to do ſo. Then
will it be eaſie to be Vertuous all our Days, and we
muſt put a Violence and Conſtraint upon our ſelves
if we would comply with the Solicitations of any
Vice. Whereas without this we ſhall fall into that
unhappy State that it will be eaſie to us only to
be Vicious, and we muſt put a Conſtraint upon our
ſelves when we are to do that which would become
us, and would be for our Intereſt or our Honour.
Beſides 'tis our Wiſdom and Happineſs to have as
little occaſion for repentance as is poſſible, and
therefore to begin a Courſe of Vertue betimes. And
'tis our Honour to have attain'd a great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
degree of Vertue; but the ſooner we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to endeavour this, the more likely we are to
attain it. Vertue in youth ſettles a good Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and confirms Health in the ſtrong Bodies,
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:61440:14"/>
and ſupports a tender and weak Conſtitution which
Vice would quickly deſtroy. Vertue in youth makes
the beſt Proviſion of Worldly Enjoyments and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Thoughts for Old Age. It defers the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of Old Age, and makes that commonly
the freer from the things that are uſually grievous
to it. To Young Perſons then, I would particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of this Book for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of Vertue among them.</p>
            <p>To conclude: The Women have here an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Mirrour wherein they may ſee themſelves and
all the World, they may diſcover whatever Spots
or Deformities are upon themſelves or others. This
is a Glaſs that will certainly ſhow you what does
beſt become and moſt adorn you. Dreſt by this,
you muſt needs like your ſelves, and may do ſo
with good reaſon, and without flattering your
ſelves: and you would alſo approve your ſelves to
God and the Holy Angels, and to the beſt and
wiſeſt among Mankind.</p>
            <p>I muſt only deſire you to take notice of this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That I do not apply the great Character I have
given of this Book to what you now ſee of it, but
to the whole; that which is here is at moſt but half
worthy of it, for it is but half the intended deſign.
The other half is actually under Hand, and I hope
will be ſpeedily preſented to you; And then I doubt
not but it will appear worthy of your Eſteem, and of
my Recommendation; and Highly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
your Honour and Happineſs, the end for
which it is deſigned.</p>

            <head>Of READING;
With ſome Remarks upon that of
this Book.</head>
            <p>THERE IS NOT any thing more
true than that Reading, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and Contemplation, are three
of the moſt uſeful and moſt charming emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the world. By Reading we enjoy
the Dead, by Converſation the Living, and
by Contemplation our Selves. Reading en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches
the Memory, Converſation poliſhes the
Wit, and Contemplation improves the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But among theſe noble Occupations of
the Soul, if we would determine which is
the moſt important; it muſt be confeſſed that
Reading furniſhes both the other: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that our Contemplation would be of no
advantage, and our Converſation without
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to the Ladies of greateſt
Wit, as well as to thoſe of the meaneſt; in
that it gives to the former much the greater
Luſtre, as it mends the Imperfections and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61440:17"/>
of the latter. It renders theſe tolerable
and makes them admirable. And to ſay the
truth, Reading ſhews us many things which
our own reaſoning could never diſcover; it
adds ſolidity to our thoughts, and a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſweetneſs to our diſcourſe: It finiſhes
and compleats that which Nature has but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſtrange that we ſhould receive ſo
great advantage from this, ſince the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
in the world have ow'd their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to Reading join'd with Judicious Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and the one is as the Father, the other a
Mother to the ſineſt Thoughts. And becauſe
neither of theſe ſeparately can produce any
thing of perfection, it is eaſie to comprehend
why they who have no love for Books can
ſpeak nothing but what is trivial, and their
converſation is no better than a perſecution
of their company.</p>
            <p>That a good Wit may ſet off its ſelf well
enough without any thing of Study, as they
ſay a good Face needs no Ornaments, is what
I cannot, without diſſimulation, allow. But on
the contrary it muſt be ſaid that as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
which have greateſt heat, have need of
moſt food to keep the body in good plight
and maintain life; ſo the brighteſt Wits have
moſt need of reading, to acquire thereby po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs
and fulneſs; and eſpecially to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
that vigour which cannot ſucceed but by
chance when it is altogether alone. It is then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61440:17"/>
in this incomparable School they muſt learn
what is excellent, to entertain the company
that is good, and to be a remedy againſt the
bad. Here the Ladies muſt receive antidotes
againſt the perſecutions of thoſe whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is all Idle and Impertinent. It is Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that renders Converſation moſt grateful,
and Solitude leaſt tedious.</p>
            <p>There are others nevertheleſs of another
opinion, and ſuch as think that 'tis ſufficient,
for learning the beſt things in the world, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the converſation of good Wits, without
putting ones ſelf to the trouble of turning
over Books. But tho I grant that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of Worthy Perſons is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and may as a living School influence us
moſt powerfully while we ſee the rule and
an excellent example together: Yet it ſeems
to me that they who content themſelves with
the company of thoſe that Know much, might
become more compleat by reading their works.
It is my Opinion, that if Converſation gives
readineſs, Reading affords abundance; that
the former diſtributes only what this latter
acquires, and is liberal of the riches which
reading heaps together. Moreover, ſince
men take more pains about what they write,
than what they ſpeak, and no man employs
ſo much care in that which is to endure but
for a moment, as in that which is to endure
for ever: It muſt be own'd that we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expect to find excellent things in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61440:18"/>
Writings of great Perſons than in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
for while they let nothing paſs in
their Books that is not finiſht, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but many things imperfect will ſlip from
them in diſcourſe and converſation.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there needs no more but an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
voice, or with ſome a great noiſe, a ſweet
accent, or a good grace to charm thoſe that
hear: But there is nothing to abuſe or impoſe
upon them that read. It is much more eaſie
to deceive the Ear than the Eye. Diſcourſes
paſs on with but a ſuperficial notice taken of
them; and hardly have we the leiſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their defects: But Writings remain ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
expoſed to the Cenſures of thoſe that
judge, and the faults of them are never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd.
Herein there lies, as I think, a very
good reaſon for the reading of good Books
that the great Wits have in them left us their
beſt performances; and they have employ'd
their watchings and ſtudies, more to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
than Speaking well.</p>
            <p>However, if it be neceſſary for the proof of
this to join Experience with Reaſon, what
can any deſire for the Ornament of the Mind,
that may not be met with in Books? We
may find there Inſtructions of every make,
we may ſee Vertue under every ſort of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
We may there diſcover Truth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
repreſentation of it we can deſire; we
may ſee her with all her ſtrength among the
Philoſophers; with all her purity among the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61440:18"/>
Hiſtorians, and with all her beauty, poſtures, and
ſine diſguiſes in the Orators and Poets. And
from this ſo agreeable variety it is poſſible
for all ſorts of humours and conditions to
find content and inſtruction. It is here that
Truth is not diſorder'd by Paſſions; that ſhe
ſpeaks without fear as well as without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
and dreads not to enter the Palaces,
nor even the Preſence of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon too is Reading extreamly
requiſite to the Ladies; for ſince they want
Mute Inſtructors as well as Princes, and as
well Beauty as Royalty does not ſo eaſily
find Teachers as Flatters; It is neceſſary
that for the apprehending their defects they
ſhould learn ſometimes, from the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Dead, <hi>That</hi> which the Living dare
not ſay to them. It is in Books alone that
they can remark the imperfections of their
minds, as in their Mirrors they diſcern thoſe
of their Faces. It is there they will find
Judges that cannot be corrupted either by
their Love or Hatred. It is there that the
moſt fair, as well as the leaſt ſo, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated, having to do with Arbitrators
that uſe the Eyes they have, only to put a
difference between Vertue and Vice.</p>
            <p>BUT HOWEVER, ſince all Books
are not excellent, and there are many which
truly deſerve to be brought to no light but
by the fire; the printing of which ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61440:19"/>
rather have been hindred than the reading
them: It muſt be acknowledged that there
is no leſs difficulty in chooſing good Books
to employ us when we are alone, than to
chooſe good Wits for our entertainment in
company. So that if any find they muſt not
rely upon themſelves in this matter for the
making of a good choice, they ought at
leaſt to follow the counſel of the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and moſt vertuous, for fear that in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they may happen to infect the Mind or
debauch the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear in this place to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the tyranny of certain Wits, who
form among themſelves a kind of Cabal for
the cenſure of all things; and think the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of their Cabal muſt be firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
before a thing can deſerve to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by others. As the value of Money
derives it ſelf from the Ordinance of the
Prince, ſo muſt the value of Books and the
purity of Language depend upon the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Imaginary Kings. It is not
poſſible to avoid their ſharp cenſure if we
do not ſubmit to their Judgment; both the
Uſe and the Approbation are at their diſpoſe:
the credit they give is neceſſary to ſucceſs,
and there is no glory but what they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.
And although the moſt able perſons
diſappoint this ſmall traffick and theſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
intreagues, there are nevertheleſs ſome
weaker ſpirits that commit themſelves to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61440:19"/>
their Conduct. And by this miſtake it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
comes to paſs that very good Books are
not reliſhed at firſt while theſe petty Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors
decry them, and hinder their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
from being known. They perſwade
themſelves that when they have found great
fault with the writings of others, we ſhall
read none but theirs, and that the Ladies will
abide by their ſentiments as an Infallible
Rule. But as at laſt Innocence will appear
in ſpight of all accuſations, and Merit will
ſhine in deſiance of envy; ſo the reputation
which is checkt a while by their malice will
ſpread it ſelf the more gloriouſly; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will make it appear, that we ought
not to follow the advice of thoſe who ſpeak
not of Books according to truth, nor even
according to their own inward opinion of
them, but only according to ſome intereſt
and deſign which they have propos'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The Ladies ought to determine in
this matter, That they muſt not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the Judgments of others, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to renounce their own, and that there
is no colour or appearance of reaſon for
relying entirely upon ſo bad Conductors as
theſe.</p>
            <p>But I do not intend hereby to put upon
them the trouble of reading all Books, or
that they ſhould affect to read a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them: On the contrary I eſteem this
as unprofitable as troubleſome, and that in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61440:20"/>
reading divers Books we ſhould do as they
who viſit ſeveral Countries, where they paſs
on without ſtaying; for after they have ſeen
and traverſt a great many, they chuſe one
at leaſt where they fix their abode. Why
ſhould we ſeek in many Books what may be
found in one alone? As if the Sun had need
of the aſſiſtance of the Stars towards the
making of Day, or that glorious Luminary
had not light enough of his own to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the World.</p>
            <p>It is not a multitude that wiſe men chuſe;
and one ſingle Book, if it be very good,
may be as ſerviceable as a Library. I find
to this purpoſe an admirable Sentence in
St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who writing to <hi>Furia</hi> to perſwade
her to forſake all other reading and apply
her ſelf wholly to the ſtudy of the Sacred
Scriptures, ſays thus, <q rend="margQuotes">As you would ſell
many Jewels for the purchaſe of one which
ſhould have the beauty and worth of all
the other in it ſelf; ſo you ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all ſorts of Books beſides, and confine
your ſelf to that one wherein you may
find all that is neceſſary either to pleaſe
or inſtruct you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed to read but few Books, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be ſuch as are uſeful and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
will not diminiſh our advantage but
reſine it; we ſhall not be the leſs rich in
improvement, but ſhall be leſs perplext and
confounded. On the other ſide, As they who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61440:20"/>
eat inceſſantly, contract but a maſs of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
ſo they that read too much are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
incommoded by the confuſion of their
own thoughts and diſcourſes. And as exceſs
of food weakens the natural heat of the
body, ſo an exceſs of reading at length dims
the light and abates the vigour of the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is not then, at all neceſſary to read a
multitude of Books, but to read only thoſe
that are good, and, above all, to avoid the
deſire of thoſe with which we cannot become
acquainted without the danger of becoming
vicious. It is neceſſary that in this place
I encounter two grand Errors; and that I
attack too much fear on the one hand, and
next too much confidence in this matter on
the other: For there are ſome perſons who
ſcruple to read the Books of the Heathens
that yet allow themſelves to uſe Romances.
There are thoſe that make Conſcience of
abſtaining from the Books of the Ancient
Poets and Philoſophers, tho they be full of
moſt excellent Precepts; and are afraid even
of Vertue it ſelf if it comes from the
Schools of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Socrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT NOT TO diſſemble; Their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
proceeds from their ignorance; and they
fear, as the Holy Spirit ſpeaks, where there
is no cauſe of fear. For if God himſelf
commanded the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to borrow the goods
of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that they might afterwards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61440:21"/>
be conſecrated to the ſervice of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
why may not we take the good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
that are in Heathen Authors, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
we do it with a deſign to employ them
to the glory of God and the inſtruction of
our Conſciences? As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they
took along with them the Treaſures of the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> left their Idols; ſo when we take
the Knowledge of the Heathens, we do not
alſo for the ſake of that take their Errors
and Idolatry. What danger can there be
in raviſhing this Divine Wealth from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Poſſeſſors, to make uſe of it to ſome
better purpoſe? And ſince the Church of
God has admitted the Infidels themſelves to
Baptiſm, why may we not render their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
alſo and their Hiſtories Chriſtian? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when we find in them moſt excellent
examples to form our manners by, and
good rules for the direction of our Lives.
If we do meet with ſome things there that
are bad, we muſt do by their Books as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did by the Captive Women whom
they married, whoſe Nails they firſt pared
and ſhaved off their Hair. I mean that in
reading theſe Ancient Authors we ſhould
retrench what is ſuperfluous, and whatever
contradicts our belief. But I, all this while
am in the wrong when I ſpeak thus of the
Ancients, for we do not derive any thing
from the Heathens when we take whatever
is excellent and good in their Books. This
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61440:21"/>
is the very wealth which they have ſtolen
from our Fathers; this is that ſublime Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
of <hi>Egypt</hi> which they tranſported to
<hi>Athens.</hi> Whatever their Poets or their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters
have of good in them, they drain'd
our Prophets for it: This is the Learning
of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> too, tho they have given
it another form, and veil'd it under certain
Riddles, that they might the better conceal
their Theft.</p>
            <p>So then we ſteal not from the Heathens
what we take from them, but only recover
what is our own. And ſo far is it from a
fault to do this, that on the contrary, It is
no leſs meritorious to draw theſe excellent
inſtructions from their Books, than to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Innocent Captives from the hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
But now as for the reading of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
we muſt needs ſpeak of that after
a very different manner; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them that is not extreamly bad and
extreamly dangerous, and That mingled with
what is agreeable and pleaſing; but in the
other there is excellent morality alloy'd with
ſomewhat ſuperfluous. There is indeed
ſome appearance of Ill in the Writings
of the Ancients, and there is nothing but
an empty appearance of good in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
which are read, inſomuch that if we
take away the Mask, and pierce the Shell of
the one and the other, we ſhall find nothing
but Vice in theſe laſt mentioned, and nothing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61440:22"/>
but Vertue in the other. We ought not to
abandon the Ancients for ſo little evil as is
in them, nor eſpouſe the Romances for ſo
little good as is in them: It is ſufficient to
retrench and pare the one ſort, but the other
are to be entirely thrown away.</p>
            <p>IT MAY BE this my Opinion of them
may be diſpleaſing to ſome, to whom a Lie
appears more beautiful than Truth; and who
can take no delight, but in that which is
unprofitable, and think the time cannot be
well paſſed away unleſs it be loſt. Why (ſay
they) is the Reading of Romances forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
when the Uſe of the Poets is allow'd?
And what pretence can there be to believe
that Fictions are more dangerous in Proſe
than in Verſe? What neceſſity is there, that
for trivial Conſiderations we ſhould deprive
our ſelves of the ſweeteſt Pleaſures of Life?
And what greater contentment can a man
contrive for himſelf, than to read in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
ſo many different ſucceſſes, where we
find our Paſſions ſtill in motion according to
the Adventures that are preſented? Yea, and
tho we know very well that the Objects
which affect us, never had a being in the
world and never will, yet we ſuffer our
ſelves very often to entertain a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for feigned miſeries, and diſſolve
into tears for imaginary Shepherds. They
add further, we ought not to throw away
any Books becauſe there is ſomething of Ill
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61440:22"/>
in them; as it is not reaſonable to reſolve
never to go to Sea becauſe there are Shelves
and Sands there, or becauſe the art of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is not infallibly ſucceſsful, as appears
in that there are ſome that yearly ſuffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck
either by misfortune or by ignorance.
It is not at all juſt to abandon that which
is good, becauſe it is ſometimes mingled with
bad. Prudence teaches to ſeparate the Vice
from the Vertue, rather than to ſhun both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
otherwiſe we muſt pluck out our
Eyes that we may not abuſe our looks, and
never venture to ſtir leſt we ſhould happen
to fall.</p>
            <p>Beſides, why is it forbidden to Romances
to preſent us with Lives of them that never
were, any more than to Painters to draw
Imaginary perſons, or to paint according to
their own fancy a piece of Groteſque? Why
may not the one ſort be permitted to divert
the mind, by their Writings, as well as the
other to refreſh the Eye with their Pictures?
Why is the Pen in this caſe to be accounted,
more culpable than the Pencil, and may we
not deſcribe in words what we may by
Pictures?</p>
            <p>AND TO SAY truth, that we may
anſwer to this Apology for Romances, I do
not at all doubt that if any one of them could
be found that were entirely honeſt, it were
not Injuſtice to defend the reading of it. And
provided one could find in them any good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61440:23"/>
without danger of corrupting
the mind, there would be no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of them, any more than of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
that innocently paſs the time, and
refreſh us after the fatigue of Study or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But when I think of the very ill things
which the moſt of Romances are fill'd with,
when I conſider how many minds are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
with theſe poiſonous Books, I ſhould
account my ſelf very guilty if I did not ſhew
the ſnares to thoſe who apprehend no danger,
and declare open war with theſe corrupters
of innocence.</p>
            <p>And in truth, to examine this matter
throughly, what ſatisfaction can any ſeek
in Romances which may not be found in
Hiſtory? May we not ſee there the ſuceſſes,
the adventures, and the Events that are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
pleaſant or ſufficiently tragick, as well
of Love as Fortune, to move, or inſtruct, or
divert? Can there be any thing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
than to ſee the Birth, and the ruine of
Empires and Monarchies, and to know in
a little time that which was ſeveral long Ages
in paſſing? Is not this a very commendable
way to ſhorten the time when it ſeems too
long, and even to bring back again that which
was paſt? When we find there refreſhment
againſt wearineſs and remembrance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
oblivion. What can be ſaid to prove
that we cannot divert without corrupting
our ſelves, or that the mind cannot be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61440:23"/>
pleaſed unleſs we bring the conſcience in
danger?</p>
            <p>But if I grant that ſometimes there are
good Inſtructions to be found in Romances:
Yet what engagement are we under to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our courſe of life to an imaginary
Repreſentation; or how ſhall we bring
our ſelves to imitate examples which we
know to be falſe? Do we miſs of excellent
Patterns in Hiſtory, or do we need Painted
and feigned Stars to ſerve us in the ſtead of
thoſe that adorn the Sky? This is a very
great Errour: And if Bees are not able to
gather Honey from Flowers in a Picture, as
little is it poſſible to us to receive advantage
from a Hiſtory which we know was invented
to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I may grant too that there is ſome pleaſure
in the reading of Romances: But is there
not often an agreeable reliſh in the food that
is poiſon'd? We muſt abandon that which
pleaſes, to avoid that which would hurt, and
renounce a great pleaſure to avoid a little
danger. Otherwiſe, to propoſe to our ſelves
the ſeparating what ſeems to be good in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
from what is truly evil there; or to
take pleaſure in the relations without being
defiled with the uncleanneſs which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
under a diſguiſe, and which throws out
a thouſand Hooks with the pleaſant Lines to
catch the fancy of the Reader; this were to
throw ones ſelf into a conflagration that we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61440:24"/>
might reſcue ſomething from the flames that
is of little worth or importance: It were
to propoſe to our ſelves the ſeparating of
Wine from the Poiſon, as we drink, after
we had mingled them together. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſince we may find divertiſement joyn'd
with inſtruction in a Hiſtory, why ſhould we
ſeparate the profitable from the pleaſant
which we may enjoy together? To entertain
the mind as well as to preſerve the body
there is no need that we ſeparate the pleaſure
of the Palate from the uſefulneſs of the Food;
ſince reading as well as eating ought to
ſtrengthen at the ſame time that it pleaſes.</p>
            <p>It is not only ſuperfluous and needleſs to
read theſe Books, but extreamly dangerous
too: And how much pains ſoever we take
to defend our ſelves from infection, yet we
take it. The miſchief enters inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Soul with the pleaſing words, and
under the charms of thoſe adventures that
affect us. Whatever Wit a perſon has, however
innocent he is, yet as our bodies do without
our conſent partake of the quality of the
things we eat; ſo our minds eſpouſe, even
in ſpite of us, the Spirit of the Books we
read: Our humour is alter'd while we think
not of it; we laugh with them that laugh,
we are debauch'd with the Libertine, and
we rave with the Melancholick. To that
degree are we influenced as to find our ſelves
altogether changed with our reading of ſome
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61440:24"/>
Books: we entertain other Paſſions and Steer
another courſe of life.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is not difficult to be found
out: for as teeming Mothers cannot look
intently upon ſome Pictures without give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Infants ſome marks of what they
obſerve, why ſhould we not eaſily believe
that the Laſcivious ſtories in Romances may
have the ſame effect upon our Imagination,
and ſo leave ſome Spots upon the mind? I
grant indeed that we know what we read
to be meer fiction; yet it fails not for all that
to give real motions while we read it; the
inclination that we have to evil is ſo ſtrong
that it improves by examples of evil, tho
we know them to be falſe ones. As the Jvy
mounts and ſupports its ſelf by the hollow
and dry Tree as well as by the ſound and green
one: ſo our natural corruption and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Appetites carry us ſo ſtrongly to what
is forbidden, that even a falſe and feigned
Hiſtory is ſufficient to encourage and animate
us to the moſt wicked undertakings. As the
Birds were invited to peck at the Painted
Grapes of <hi>Xeuxis,</hi> ſo our Paſſions take fire
at the Amours that are deſcribed in Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The reading of ſo many wanton things in
thoſe Books heats a Perſon by little and little,
and inſenſibly deſtroys that reluctancy and
horrour that ſhould always poſſeſs us againſt
all that is evil. We grow ſo familiar
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61440:25"/>
with the Image of Vice, that we fear not
when we meet with the thing it ſelf. And
after a Man has loſt the modeſty of his mind,
he muſt be in a great deal of danger to loſe
alſo that which his modeſty alone could have
preſerved. As the Water infallibly runs weſt
when the Banks that reſtrain'd it are broken
down, ſo our affections eſcape with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of liberty after that this honeſt fear
which ſhould govern them, is remov'd. This
licentiouſneſs indeed is not always form'd
in a moment, nor do we become vicious
all at once by this reading. The contagion
of theſe Books gains upon the heart almoſt
by inſenſible degrees, it works in the mind
as Seed does in the Earth, firſt it ſpurts,
then it ſhoots out, and grows every day
ſtronger and ſtronger, that it may bring
forth at laſt the pernicious Fruit of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>But this is not yet all the evil that attends
the reading of Romances. But after it has
render'd us bold enough, and given courage
to do ill, in the next place it renders us
ingenious and cunning: we derive from thence
ſubtilty with confidence, and do not only
learn the evil we ſhould be ignorant of, but
alſo the moſt delicate and charming ways
of committing it. And to ſpeak with reaſon
how can it be imagin'd poſſible to read ſome
Paragraphs in thoſe Books without a great
deal of danger? When we often ſee there,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61440:25"/>
this Woman quitting her Country and her
Parents to run after a ſtranger, whom ſhe
fell in love with in a moment: Or read
how the other found ways to receive Letters
from her Gallants; or to give them their
guilty aſſignations. Theſe are nothing but
Leſſons of Artifice and skill, to teach perſons
how they may ſin with ſubtilty. And for
my part I am not able to apprehend with
what appearance of reaſon any can juſtify
ſo dangerous a Reading.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
the hearing of Comedies, becauſe they
preſent ſometimes Murders, ſometimes Thefts
or Adulteries; and becauſe in a well regulated
Common-wealth nothing ought to be ſuffer'd
that is contrary to the Law, not even in
fictions or plays. Why then are theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
permitted, where we read almoſt
nothing but actions that are diſhoneſt, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that are laſcivious, and paſſions that are
extravagant? Shall we dare to read thoſe
things in Books which the Heathens forbid
to be repreſented on Theaters? Shall it be
ſaid that Chriſtians have leſs love for Vertue
than Infidels? And if they were afraid
leſt the People ſhould be debaucht by ſuch
ſights, have not we reaſon to fear that
weak minds may be corrupted by ſo filthy
reading?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61440:26"/>
Nevertheleſs ſome may accuſe me of too
much ſeverity, who will be vext to ſee me
raviſhing from them their beloved Idols, in
taking away their Romances: who will be
griev'd no leſs for their loſing of theſe bad
Books than the Women of whom the Holy
Scripture ſpeaks that were weeping for the
loſs of <hi>Jammuz.</hi> A falſehood ſhall often have
more of the Vogue than truth: and they will
more willingly read thoſe Books that corrupt
the manners than thoſe that regulate them;
and there are many Ladies that learn to
tell without Book the Stories of <hi>Amedis,</hi> while
they neglect thoſe of the Holy Writt. Laſtly,
they take much leſs pleaſure in the beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than in a ſorry Comedy; and go oftner
to hear a Buffoon than a Preacher. <hi>Straton</hi>
complain'd very juſtly that he had fewer
Scholars than <hi>Menedemus;</hi> becauſe there are
many more to be found who ſeek the School
of Pleaſure than there are that follow that
of Vertue; and we love rather thoſe who
flatter us and make us laugh, than thoſe
that make us ſad, and menace us tho for our
advantage.</p>
            <p>AND THAT I may conceal nothing
that is to the purpoſe, It is extreamly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
to mankind, that it is enough to raiſe
a curioſity for the Reading of any Book, to
know that it is forbidden, as we obſerve by
daily experience. I think the ſame Evil Spirit
who deceiv'd the firſt of Women poſſeſſing her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61440:26"/>
to her deſtruction with the pleaſures of the
Tree of knowledge, does ſtill inſpire others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, promiſing their eyes ſhall
be opened, and they ſhall ſee admirable things
in what is forbidden them, and making them
believe 'tis out of envy alone that ſuch reading
is forbidden them. This errour corrupts a
great number of thoſe who are perſuaded
by their Flatterers, that as weak perſons are
always in danger even in the midſt of things
that are good; So the moſt able Spirits are
never in danger, no not among a multitude
of things that are bad: and therefore all read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to be forbidden to the one ſort, and
all is to be permitted to the other. But for
my part I muſt needs think the contrary, and
declare that whatever meaſure of Wit any can
have, they are not withſtanding always oblig'd
to flee from danger. And I doubt there are
very few that have the ſtrong conſtitution
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to nouriſh themſelves with
Poiſon, and live upon that which is mortal to
all others. I approve no more of the Poets,
than Romances, when there is any thing of ill
in them: In what ever Period or Page I find
any thing of Vice, it is my intention to make
War with that. And let the World think
of this matter what they will, I will eternally
condemn theſe ill Books, which ſerve but as
a School to teach perſons to ſin with addreſs,
and which one may very juſtly call the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of the Vicious, and of the Libertines.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61440:27"/>
I declare my ſelf an enemy to all that which
is an enemy to Vertue. And, to ſpeak in a
few words what I think of the Reading of
good or bad Books; It is very neceſſary that
they who are not able to make a difference,
ſhould follow the counſel of the moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
And they who are the moſt capable
to diſcern aright, in this matter, ſhould yet
not ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with
a curioſity to ſearch into what is forbidden,
which ſeems to be a humour even natural
to the moſt. It is without all doubt that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is both pleaſant and uſeful; and if care
be taken to read ſuch Books as are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, it will inſtruct the ignorant,
reform the debauched, and divert thoſe
that are Melancholy. It affords remedies
to them that are greatly afflicted, againſt
the greater evil of Deſpair; and to the happy
and proſperous it adminiſters antidotes againſt
Inſolence. It exhibits examples fit to humble
the one ſort, and to encourage the other. It
makes our diſcourſes the better when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain,
and our thoughts when we are alone.
Without that it is impoſſible both to meditate
or to ſpeak well. But this ſubject is too
copious; and if I ſhould purſue it as I might,
inſtead of putting an end to this diſcourſe
of it, I might begin and exhauſt another.
There is then no doubt to be made but the
reading of honeſt Books is a moſt agreeable
employment: But we ſhould always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61440:27"/>
that it is not enough that this be uſeful to
the Underſtanding, unleſs it be ſo moreover
to the Conſcience. As Vertue is of much
more worth than Knowledge; the Ladies
ought to think, that 'tis of more avail to them
to be good, than learned. And I fear not
to ſay, that if they have a true Modeſty they
would bluſh no leſs at the reading of an ill
Book, than if they were ſurprized alone,
and ſhut up with a debauched Man.</p>
            <p>THUS MUCH I thought fit to ſay
concerning the reading of other Books:
But to make now, as I promiſed, ſome remarks
upon the reading of this of mine, I believe
it will be very uſeful to the Ladies after that
I have ſhewn them <hi>why</hi> I make ſo much
uſe of Fables, <hi>why</hi> I make a great part
of the Subjects I treat of to appear with two
Faces; <hi>why</hi> I have not produced ſuch general
Inſtructions, as would have ſerv'd for the
Men as well as the Women; and <hi>why</hi> I have
not deſcended to inſtructions ſo particular
as the Vulgar could wiſh for, that they might
be touched the more ſenſibly. Theſe are
the four principal parts of this Book
of which, it ſeems to me I ought to give
an account, for the rendring it the more
profitable to thoſe who will take the Pains to
read it.</p>
            <p>AS FOR FABLES if I bring in ſome
examples of them, I do this but to explain
my ſelf with the greater clearneſs; I do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61440:28"/>
it not to ſupport my Arguments, but to
embeliſh them; tis not to render Truth
more ſtrong, but only to make it more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
All the World know that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Fables divert us more than thoſe
of Hiſtory, becauſe: they are contri'vd
to pleaſe. The Hiſtorians recount ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
Poets invent them. So that when
I ſerve my ſelf of theſe only to recreate
and not to convince, I have contented my
ſelf often to chuſe the moſt diverting ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the moſt probable. Beſides; No
one ought to think it ſtrange if I have
endeavour'd to render the Metamorphoſis
profitable, ſince it ought to be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to the guſt of thoſe that are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded;
and there are many that love Fables,
and that read them. If we cannot utterly
deſtroy Serpents out of the World, at leaſt
we have reaſon to make remedies of their
Poiſon; and if the reading of fictions be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
we endeavour to draw ſome profit
from it, and to find good in that evil which
we cannot hinder. Let it be conſider'd that
the Ancients have conceal'd in a manner,
all their Morality and all their Divinity
under Fables; and tho they could have
ſerv'd themſelves of Examples that were
true, as well as of falſe; yet they ſometimes
choſe the latter, to make their inſtructions
the more ſenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61440:28"/>
AND AS I make uſe of Fables ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to render my thoughts the more
clear, and the more agreeable, it is for the
ſame reaſon too that I treat of many Subjects
in the way of Problems. It is that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
may gratifie, and that I may yield de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
at the ſame time that I give inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I have conſtrain'd my ſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
that I might Pleaſe while I Teach.
I believe that the Mind as well as the Eye
is recreated with variety, and that men take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to ſee both what is evil and what is good
in all things. And moreover, ſince the beſt
inſtructions ought to ſhew at the ſame time
both what we ought to avoid and what to
do; I have thought, that to ſucceed in both
theſe things, it would be good to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
on every Subject what it is that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of our Love, and what will deſerve our
Hatred. And cannot every one ſee that
there is nothing, but the matters of Faith,
which we may not view under divers aſpects?
If the Melancholy Humour has ſomething
that is Good, is it not alſo true, that there
is in it ſomething Evil? If it be wiſe for
deliberation, yet it is not ſufficiently ſtrong
to enterprize: It is a Paralytick that has
good Eyes, but the Hands are feeble, and it
cannot move of it ſelf. And may not as
much be ſaid of the Gay Humour; which
on the one ſide appears fit to entertain,
but on the other hand is found too much a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61440:29"/>
Pratler to contain ſecrets, and too light for
deſigns of Importance. I might here repeat
ſeveral paſſages of my Book to demonſtrates
that if I have made uſe of Problems, it is
becauſe all moral actions are full of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which give occaſion to conſider the
ſame thing under ſeveral viſages, and make
it now appear good, and anon to appear
evil. Tho I have always concluded, that
vertue ought to be lov'd, I have yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhewn, that it has two Extreams, of
which men ought to be aware: Leſt they
run into the danger of being Prodigal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of practiſing Liberality, or of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opinionative, while they aim at conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or fall into impudence while they ſeek
to be pleaſant. This is that, I believe,
which deceives the Vulgar Readers, that
while I preſent the exceſs and the defect, it
ſeems to them as if I did praiſe and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the ſame thing. Who are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that I am willing to ſhew what it is
that abuſes us, and to diſcover in every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that which is worthy of our choice and
of our averſion. If I attack the Crafty and
Deceitful, and after that condemn the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent;
If I blame them that give too much,
and then do not approve thoſe that give too
little; 'tis without doubt that ſome groſs
wits may imagin that I mingle my condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and praiſes; inſtead of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this is the true way of putting a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61440:29"/>
difference between Good and Evil, to do
it agreeably. That this is not to confound
but to ſeparate; and theſe are not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Problems, but reaſonable Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>LET ME SPEAK NOW to thoſe
who ſay that this Book might have been
made ſerviceable to the Men as well as to the
Women; and that I have not deſcended to
circumſtances ſufficiently particular for the
ſubjects that I treat of. I own that a great
part of my inſtructions, which are good for
the one Sex, may be alſo uſeful to the other:
But what is it that they could wiſh I had
found out in particular for the Ladies, when
they were to be taught the hatred of Vice
and the purſuit of Vertue? Is there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a particular Morality for them?
Is there for them a diſtinct Chriſtianity?
Muſt we for them invent a new Religion
or a particular Philoſophy? Do not the
Preachers ſpeak at the ſame time concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertues and Vices both to the one and
the other Sex? Let theſe perſons conſider
what 'tis they deſire; ſince we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the ſame Law, the Inſtructions may
be common, provided the Examples be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
And this is that which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
my ſelf to do through the whole,
as far as the matter would permit, and
as ſeem'd to me decorous; that I might
not engage my ſelf too far in ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61440:30"/>
matters, wherein I ſhould have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my ſelf more Ridiculous than Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>IT IS TIME NOW to ſatisfie thoſe
who ſay that I diſguiſe my Precepts under
Praiſes, and that I ought to have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to circumſtances more particular. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how they come to believe that the Ladies
have need of Leſſons ſo courſe, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
ſo ſenſible. They are only the Blind
that we lead by the Hand, it is enough to
carry a Torch before thoſe that have a
good Sight. This is to do wrong to their
good Wit or their good Nature. They
muſt have leſs underſtanding to know what
is good, or leſs inclination to practiſe it,
to need this treatment. I am aſſured that
they who are of the contrary opinion are
ſome petty Regents in a Country Village,
who would exerciſe a tyranny there where
they ought rather to ſubmit themſelves.
They ſhould conſider, I ſpeak not here as a
Maſter, but as a Counſellor: That I do
not make Ordinances or Laws, but only, as
I ought, I content my ſelf to give advice.
It is enough to me to praiſe good
things, and to blame the bad, to ſay that
they ought to ſhun the one and love the
other. I ſhould be aſham'd to turn Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
as ſome do, who in like matters talk
thus, I will, I mean, It muſt be, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
I condemn. If the manner of their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61440:30"/>
writing be obſerv'd, one ſhall ſee that it has
no whit more of force, but has leſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Their Style is not more ſtrong, but
more uncivil. After all, I conceive that,
there is no better ſecret can be obſerv'd in
Writing, than to render ones ſelf the more
agreeable, that one may be the more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
There is a way to inſtruct without
diſobliging; and, I believe, they will not
blame that Phyſitian who had found an art
to give good Medecines without diſguſt and
bitterneſs. We may ſpeak of the manner of
Teaching, after that of Healing; and it muſt
be believed that there is nothing done amiſs,
if both the one and the other be done
agreeably. Provided we can ſucceed on this
occaſion, I judge it much better to uſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions
than Precepts. There is a great
deal of difference between the Laws of an
Emperor and thoſe of a Philoſopher: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
and <hi>Seneca</hi> are not obeyed alike. The
Commands of the one are ſupported by
Power, thoſe of the other by the Addreſs.
But ſuppoſe I had all this Power, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
can there be for my abuſing it, ſo as
to render my ſelf troubleſom, and to treat
with rudeneſs a Sex to which we cannot
ſpeak with too great civility? And when
'tis ſaid that I might give them Inſtructions
more particular towards the rendring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
excellent, without violating the reſpect
that is their due; I anſwer, that this had not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61440:31"/>
only been ſuperfluous, but indeed it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impoſſible. If I would deſcend to
Inſtructions very particular, inſtead of one
Book, I ſhould have been conſtrain'd to
compoſe many Volumes. What? When I
have ſaid that an Excellent Woman ought
not to be Ignorant of what is becoming
to her Age and her Condition; Muſt I needs
then come to ſhew the way of playing on
the Lute, or how ſhe muſt Dance, or dreſs
her Head, or make her Curteſie? Muſt I
do the Office of a Muſick-maſter inſtead of
that of a Philoſopher? I grant that theſe
petty accompliſhments are not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
but they are no more than the Nails
or the Hair of an Excellent Woman: It
is in Morality alone that theſe qualities are
to be found which are requiſite to form
ſuch a perſon as I recommend. I endeavour
above all things to regulate the Mind and
the Conſcience. Theſe are in my opinion
the two parts the moſt conſiderable in the
perſon that ought to be eſteemed Excellent.
This is, moreover, that which I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in, and I have not treated of any
other conditions of the Sex, either becauſe
it had been impertinent to my deſign, or
becauſe they are of ſo eaſie attainment, as
there is no need to loſe time in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
Rules for them. Thus I think I have
ſaid what I ought to theſe things for the
ſatisfaction of thoſe that would not take the
pains to read Prefaces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61440:31"/>
I CANNOT be adviſed to comply
with thoſe who ſay that there are many
Compariſons in my Book, and but few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions.
I ſhall content my ſelf to ſend
them to the reading of <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi>
to learn after what manner the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have treated of Morals. And above
all, if there are here any thoughts that can
pleaſe them, tho they have not ſo much of
connexion as they could wiſh for, I entreat
them not to caſt them away for want of
that; and to conſider that Pearls may be
very precious, tho they are not ſtrung.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Converſation.</head>
            <p>AS THERE IS nothing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
to the Ladies, than to know
how to chuſe good Wits to converſe with,
and good Books to read; ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more difficult than this: Becauſe there
are ſo many things evil which reſemble the
good, that without a great judgment, or
extraordinary good fortune they can rarely
make a good Election in theſe caſes. It
muſt needs be acknowledged a thing too
difficult to paſs the time innocently and
pleaſantly too either in company or retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61440:32"/>
Indeed, if we were ſtill in the times of
the primitive ſimplicity, where it were
enough to ſucceed if we were only not
dumb, and where, as yet, no other fault
in Society entred but that of falſhood: I
own that an ingenuous plainneſs alone would
be ſufficient for them, and that Prudence
would be a thing ſuperfluous. But ſinee
we are fallen into an Age full of Artifice,
wherein words which were invented to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
our thoughts, ſeem now to be applied
only to the concealing them with a good grace,
it muſt be confeſt that Innocence it ſelf has
need of a Mask or Veil as well as their
Faces, and 'tis no leſs imprudent to lay open
ones Heart to thoſe that are always upon
the guard, than it were to march altogether
naked among Enemies that are armed, whom
we could neither offend, nor defend our
ſelves from them.</p>
            <p>If it were enough to take and give de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleaſure in entertaining, and there
were no better end of it than to paſs away
the time; there were not ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to perform it commendably, for this
alone would be ſufficient for that purpoſe;
Not to be born Melancholy. But ſince the
principal aim of Converſation, with the
world, is to make ones ſelf paſs for a good
Wit and a very judicious Perſon: It is for
this reaſon that ſomething elſe is neceſſary
to them beſides a good humour, and they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61440:32"/>
ought at leaſt to have as much of Addreſs
as of Vertue. It is very difficult to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ones ſelf compleat in this matter, and
the Wiſeſt perſons have confeſt, that there
is not yet a School to be found where we
may learn to manage well according to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
our diſcourſe and our ſilence.</p>
            <p>How many perfections are neceſſary
to render one's ſelf agreeable in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How many qualities are requiſite
to be able to pleaſe many? Since even the
moſt Excellent perſons have divers inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Good ſentiments are alſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
among themſelves, as well as the good
and the bad are contrary to each other.
If plainneſs cauſes contempt in ſome;
ſubtilty again will raiſe ſuſpition in others.
If any deride thoſe that are frank, others
will miſtruſt thoſe that are not ſo. This
Lady wants a good Grace, the other wants
to have Read more: One Senſe is perſecuted,
while the other is contented; and you
ſhall not dare ſometimes to open your Eyes
and your Ears together unleſs you will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be incommoded.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Xeuxis</hi> would draw a perfect Face,
he propoſed for his Pattern five of the
beſt Faces in <hi>Italy,</hi> that he might take
from each the Charms and the Features that
he judged moſt powerful. And to draw
a Character of the Lady that ſhould be able
to pleaſe in all Converſation, there would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61440:33"/>
need no fewer of charming qualities and
rare conditions: Yea, It would not be too
much for this purpoſe to have all that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can give, and Morality can teach. It is in
this ſubject that we have need of all the moſt
beautiful Ornaments of the Civil Life.
And none ought to think it ſtrange, if I ſpeak
here of thoſe other excellent qualities that
I recommend in the reſt of this Book; for
they all terminate in Converſation as in a
Center; and it is not eaſy to touch this
Point without touching at the ſame time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lines that meet in it.</p>
            <p>TO SAY THEN that which, at
preſent, ſeems to me moſt neceſſary, I
will content my ſelf to wiſh the Ladies thoſe
three advantages which <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont
to deſire in his Diſciples; they were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
Silence, and Modeſty. Theſe are ſo
amiable qualities, and ſo neceſſary to their
converſation, that to judge of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
we need only repreſent the abſurd
Vices which are contrary to them; as
Tatling, Imprudence, and Impudence, the
firſt of theſe defects brings with it uſually
the two latter. And it frequently comes to
paſs they who delight to talk much and give
themſelves leave to do ſo, They have not
enough either of Prudence or Modeſty.
It muſt not be thought however that I have
a deſign to take away the uſe of ſpeech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of regulating it. It would not be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61440:33"/>
at all handſome to attempt to compoſe a
converſation of Perſons that are dumb.
But to make a ſtrenuous oppoſition to a
Vice that is the moſt troubleſome and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in company, I only beſeech thoſe
Ladies, that cannot find themſelves diſpoſed
to talk but ſparingly, that they would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
That if there be a time to ſay, ſomething,
and a time to ſay quite nothing there is never
a time to ſay all. That they who talk much
are not only in danger often of ſaying
that which is falſe, but alſo of ſaying
ſome things that are true, but unfit to be
ſaid; and ſo they would offend either Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Truth, and many times both of theſe
together: That they who talk ſo much
with others, do in a manner never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
themſelves; that they ſee not their
Thought till it has eſcaped them: That
they apprehend too late in their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that which they ought rather to have
apprehended by foreſight; and that regret
and ſhame always follow very ſoon after that
diſcourſe which Prudence did not go before.
Laſtly, that the greateſt part of their Sex
need leſs pains to ſpeak well than to ſpeak but
a little: and that Diſcretion is more difficult to
them, and more neceſſary too than Eloquence.</p>
            <p>It ſeems then to me that the Great <hi>Numa</hi>
ſhew'd not leſs Judgment than Religion,
when he erected an Altar to a tenth Muſe,
whom he ſtyl'd <hi>Tacita:</hi> To ſhew, that when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61440:34"/>
all the Sciences together have their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any one perſon, They are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
there without ſilence, and that
'tis in vain that any one has learnt the Art
of ſpeaking, unleſs he has alſo the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of holding his Tongue. And in truth
as it is much more eaſy to be an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
than to be Wiſe, ſo Morality has
much more difficulty to teach the Rules
of keeping ſilence, than Rhetorick has to
infuſe thoſe of Diſcourſing. Although
what we know, were, without this, unuſeful,
and even without ornament; Yet we may
alſo moſt juſtly place Silence among the
moſt neceſſary Arts, and may ſay with that
Wiſe King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the Nine Muſes
have not their Luſtre entire without the
addition of this for a tenth.</p>
            <p>Silence gives, I know not how, a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace even to diſcourſe, as the Shadows
do to the Colours in a Picture; and there
is nothing more true than that Intervals
well choſen in a diſcourſe, do like the
Pauſes in Muſick, ſet off and ſhew more
evidently, whatever is truly fine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.
When we ſpeak none but the
beſt things, yet even then is not Silence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſuperfluous. It relieves thoſe that
ſpeak, or thoſe that hear. It ſerves to
prevent both ſterility and tediouſneſs,
that the Speaker may not be too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
nor the Hearer tired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61440:34"/>
There are ſome however that think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that puts in a word does them
wrong, and takes ſomething from them
in converſation. But thoſe that ſpeak ſo
much in Converſation themſelves, do not
deſerve to be heard, becauſe they require
a civility that they will not pay. As they
are uncapable to ſpeak what is fine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo they are to underſtand it when
ſpoken by others. And it muſt be beliv'd
they would not ſpeak ſo many ill things
if they would give themſelves more leiſure
to hear thoſe that are good.</p>
            <p>And however there are too many to be
ſound who affect and are proud of this
impertinent Tattle, who think it a ſign and
proof of much Wit to ſpeak much, and a
diſgrace to liſten with ſilence to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of others: Yet I fear not to ſay
to them a truth which may be very uſeful,
tho it be not very pleaſant. Thoſe of this
Humour are incapable of any truſt, they
can keep nothing ſecret of their deſigns or
buſineſs. That which is only in the thoughts
of the Wiſe, is in the Mouth of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent.
And no otherwiſe than as they
ſay of the Dead Sea, that nothing there will
go to the bottom, and whatever is caſt
upon it, inſtead of ſinking down, floats at
the top of the Water. It is juſt after the
ſame manner with ſome tatling humours,
they can keep nothing to themſelves; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61440:35"/>
of concealing wiſely what is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
they make all appear both in their
looks and diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>See here the unhappineſs of thoſe that
talk much in an entertainment: Let them
conſider as much as they can their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
it is next to impoſſible but that
in ſaying a great many things ſome of
them will be ſuch as ought not to be ſaid.
As it is difficult in removing the hand
often, not to lay it ſometimes upon the
part that is ill; ſo 'tis as difficult in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much, to avoid touching ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our moſt ſecret and important deſigns.
And if unthinkingly we many times lay
our hand upon a place that is in pain, we
as unthinkingly let our Tongue run into the
predominant Paſſion of the Mind.</p>
            <p>I know well enough there are thoſe who
promiſe themſelves, they will never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Secrets, tho they do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
leave to talk much in Company:
Imagining 'tis enough for the avoiding this
to put themſelves upon general matters, and
to propoſe the ſpeaking of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
But there is no manner of ſafety in
this ſort of Conduct; for tho they think
themſelves ſpeaking only of Common
things, they that have any meaſure of
Wit above a very low degree, will eaſily
remark ſome traces or ſhadows of their
thought. The ſecret meaning appears
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61440:35"/>
through this Veil. And as we ſee the
Needle touched with a Loadſtone, tho far
diſtant from the Pole, yet turning that way,
and pointing towards when it does not
touch it; ſo our Speech has always I know
not what of our Thought, and will ſhew
it in the moſt diſtant Harangue, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the matters that are the moſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
            <p>Let us ſet our ſelves as much as we
will to diſſemble and feign; after we have
flutter'd a while about the ſecret of our
Hearts like a Flie about the Candle, yet
at laſt we ſhall there burn our Wings.
We loſe our ſelves, like them, there
where we trifle and play. I am extreamly
in love with this Compariſon, becauſe thoſe
Women that are ſo much addicted to talk,
do mightily reſemble thoſe little Creatures,
who are made up altogether of Wings,
who have no ſolidity of Body, who have
nothing but Colour to derive to their young
ones, and diſcover their weakneſs even by
their lightneſs.</p>
            <p>But if the Arguments I make uſe of do
ſeem to be weak, I will give them a
moſt excellent Example, which perhaps
will have more effect than all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Morality. For let them caſt their
Eyes but a little on her that ought to
be the Rule as ſhe is the Ornament of their
Sex, they will perceive that the Holy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61440:36"/>
Scripture does not mention her ſpeaking
more than four or five times in her whole
life. It may be this will ſeem to them very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult;
and I believe it were a miracle in ſome,
if they could only hold their peace with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
ſo many times as the Bleſſed Virgin is
ſaid to have ſpoke, and if they did abuſe their
ſpeech but as ſeldom as ſhe made uſe of hers.
They are alas, too far from arriving at this
perfection: Inſtead of an imitation of it, in
not ſpeaking but out of Charity or Modeſty
as ſhe did, they hardly ever ſpeak but to
ſay ſomething ill of others, or to boaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
good of themſelves. Their Diſcourſe
is all made up of Condemnations or Praiſes
that are both unjuſt: It is nothing elſe but
Vanity or Evil ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt then to be made but
that many muſt be at great pains with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to reſtrain, as they ought, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of their Tongue. From whence it is
very hard for them to ſucceed well in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining;
and the indiſcretion of their
diſcourſe does very often expoſe them to
the railery or hatred of the Publick. It
is alſo the unhappineſs of thoſe who have
not prudence enough to examin their own
ſpeeches, that they are yet leſs able to
conſider well what they hear ſaid by others.
Their liberty is blind, and utters upon all
manner of occaſions, and in all companies.
Yet I do not deſign to ſay in this matter,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61440:36"/>
that there are not certain rencounters wherein
they may ſpeak with more freedom than in
many others.</p>
            <p>BUT IT OUGHT to be very
well obſerved to whom we diſcover our
ſentiments, when there is danger in having
them publiſht. And it would be to us an
occaſion for a moſt bitter repentance, to
find that in the mouths of all the World,
which ought never to have fled from our
own. It ſeems to me therefore that the
remedy for this miſchief, that you may not
be continually ſubject to the alarms of other
peoples obloquy, nor yet forced to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
under a violent conſtraint, is this; to
chuſe well thoſe whoſe company you intend
moſtly to frequent, and not to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
indifferently with all ſorts of
perſons. And to ſpeak my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Election that ought to be made
of the Wits or Humours capable of your
Converſation: I find there are two ſorts of
perſons whom you ought abſolutely to fly;
they are the Vicious and the Ignorant. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Conſcience is not ſafe with the
former, nor the Mind contented with the
Latter. The entertainment of thoſe who
want Religion or Knowledge, ought to be
entirely ſuſpected: and we have reaſon to
judge that it muſt have ſome grand deſign,
to excuſe two ſo great defects as Impiety
and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61440:37"/>
This Evil Choice offends the Vertues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Moral or Chriſtian. For is it not true
that in communicating as freely with the
meaneſt Spirits as with the moſt excellent,
we oblige neither the one nor the other;
becauſe the latter are offended at this, and
the former will deride and abuſe it? This
is imprudently to afford matter either to
Hatred or Railery; you will in this way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the approbation of no body, while you
think to merit that of every one. And in
truth, I never ſee thoſe Women which have
a humour ſo univerſal, as to gratifie with
the ſame aſpect, indifferently, all the World,
but it puts me in mind of that Ridiculous
Image of the <hi>Romans</hi> which they called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi>
which was carried about to Feaſts to
paſs away the time and make the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
laugh. We may ſee in ſuch perſons, as
in this Pleaſant Statue, the Looks, the Smiles,
the Reverences, the Affectations that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But this that has been mention'd, is not
the greateſt of their Infelicities; their ill
choice carries them inſenſibly into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
dangers. One may ſee in them,
that it was not without great reaſon ſaid
by the Philoſophers, that Prudence is a piece
the moſt neceſſary for a pattern to humane
actions. When they are without conduct,
they are alſo very often without Vertue;
They become many times evil, tho they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61440:37"/>
have not a deſign to be ſo, and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking of it, when their complaiſance
is ſo unhappy as to engage them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of thoſe that are debauched. After
this, Vice ſlides in by little and little into
the Soul, ſo that they perceive not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
'till 'tis mortal and uncurable.</p>
            <p>This is the moſt important part of the
preſent Diſcourſe: For ſince a diverſity of
humours cannot long ſubſiſt in Converſation,
you muſt needs at length either imitate the
Vicious or hate them; you muſt be like
them, or be their Enemy; you muſt (do
what you can) in communicating with them,
either eſpouſe their Wickedneſs, or defend
your ſelf againſt it. But tho one were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of the Victory in this caſe, yet what
need is there to give ones ſelf the trouble
of the Combat, ſince there is always much
leſs danger and inconvenience, in the ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Temptations than in reſiſting them?</p>
            <p>Whatever can be ſaid, we cannot dwell
amidſt Wickedneſs and Vice, but we muſt
needs be infected. Example has a great deal
of power, even upon the ſtrongeſt minds.
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> made profeſſion of Vertue, while
he kept company with <hi>Socrates;</hi> but he gave
up himſelf to Voluptuouſneſs when he was
amongſt his Lovers. The Soul defiles it ſelf
inſenſibly while we converſe with the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as the Face tanns, without our percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it when we travel in the hot Weather.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61440:38"/>
It is our unhappineſs that we are more
apt to receive evil than Good, that ſickneſs
conveys its ſelf more eaſily than health;
that the Converſation of Wicked Perſons
has more power to corrupt the Good, than
that of the Vertuous to correct the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched.</p>
            <p>It may be I may ſeem too ſevere, if I
ſhould propoſe to them for a Rule to their
Converſe, the Example of <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian,</hi>
who would not hold communication
with an Hermit that was a moſt vertuous
Man, but when they had a River between
them. I doubt not but thoſe that are good
may be ſeen much nearer than that, and
without danger. But as for thoſe that are
Vicious and Licentious, you ſhould keep as
far from them as you can: Their hatred
will do you leſs harm than their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and theſe are Enemies that will do
you more miſchief by Peace with them than
by War.</p>
            <p>And in truth the Unhappineſs of the firſt
Woman ought to make all other the more
fearful, for they may ſee in her fall the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cauſe of their own. What advantage
can they have in talking too privately with
the Serpent? In being bold in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Devils as <hi>Eve</hi> was, inſtead of being
aſham'd in the company even of Angels, as
was the Bleſſed Virgin? And to ſuffer the
Converſation of Licentious Wits which are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61440:38"/>
full of the Old Serpents Fatal Poiſon, and
have none but ill deſigns againſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, THE ſecond ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whoſe company they ought to ſhun,
are the Ignorant and Stupid; becauſe the
Converſation of ſuch is ſhameful, unpleaſant,
and unprofitable; and that of good Wits
and Underſtanding Perſons is honourable,
pleaſant, and fruitful. Indeed we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſufficiently, that the perſons which
have had no improvement from Study and
Reading, have always ſomething that is rude
in them; and if they produce any thing, 'tis
as thoſe wild Trees that are never grafted
nor dreſt, and which bear no Fruit but what
is Inſipid, or Harſh and Sower. And, to
reflect a little upon another Error that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
a publick complaint: Is it not a
ſtrange thing to ſee that the Sciences, and
eſpecially the Art of Reaſoning are not to
be found but in Colledges? And that we
dare not degrade Philoſophy ſo as to make
it the ſubject of Converſation? As if it were
impoſſible or unjuſt to ſtrip it of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that it may be made ſpeak with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace. As if it were a matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to turn it into a Vulgar Language;
or as if we ought to be reaſonable but in
Latin only; or as if the rareſt Secrets, or
the brighteſt things in Nature might not
be expreſt in our Mother-tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61440:39"/>
This can no one believe without being
in an Error: We have Terms in our own
Language that are fit to expreſs whatever
is of greateſt force, or is moſt ſubtil in
reaſoning: And if the moſt ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
did ſometimes ſerve us for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Diſcourſes, it would be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced,
that there is more pleaſure as well
as more of profit in entertaining one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſerious ſubjects, than in talking
of the Tippet in faſhion, of Peticoats, of
the News of the Place, or of Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.
To ſpeak ſincerely, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
thoſe Women that will make a dozen
wiſe perſons hold their Tongues, to liſten
to a paltry Violin: Who give their Ear
more readily to a company of Scurrilous
Jeſts, or Malicious Slanders, than to the
moſt excellent and important things: Who
make a great ſcruple of ſpoiling a Song
with the leaſt noiſe, and make no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of giving a thouſand interruptions to
the beſt Diſcourſe one can entertain them
with: And who are raviſht with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the moſt Impertinent Fops, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be but finely dreſt, and treat
them with the titles of Queen or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
            <p>They would utterly deride theſe perſons
nevertheleſs for their Complements inſtead
of eſteeming them, if they could but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
how much it calls in queſtion their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61440:39"/>
own Wit, to approve, and take ſo much liking
to thoſe that have none. For as we judge
thoſe Stomachs weak, that cannot digeſt any
but the lighteſt Food; ſo we may very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
queſtion the ſtrength of their Wit, who
can reliſh nothing that is ſolid: Their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
appears by their approbation; and
one may know what they can beſt do, by
what they love. This defect is, in truth,
a very great one: But ſince I have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to touch alſo upon ſome others which
are no leſs obſervable in Converſation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoken of thoſe Women that deſpiſe
knowledge and good diſcourſe, let us ſpeak
next of them that prophane and abuſe
it.</p>
            <p>FOR AS THE Ladies that are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unacquainted with Study, and great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to Reading, are moſt truly barren;
ſo they that have been converſant in theſe,
are oftentimes a little confuſed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.
There is nothing but diſorder in
their thoughts and conceptions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
and affectation in what they ſay. It
ſeems as if their Wit had not heat enough
to digeſt that which their Reading furniſhes
them with; And one may ſee in the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
and confuſion of their Diſcourſe,
even at the ſame time that they ſpeak of
excellent things, that to have Marble and
Porphiry and the moſt excellent Materials
by us, is not enough for the building a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61440:40"/>
beautiful Palace, if one be not a skilful
Architect to diſpoſe them. Theſe perſons
are mightily ſubject to Repetitions; for
having tackt their Idea to particular words
and phraſes, and fill'd their thoughts with
ſome particular matters and Subjects, their
Spirit is not at liberty to invent other
when it is neceſſary. They are ſo inſlav'd
to their Memory, that they can make as
it were no uſe of their Judgment.</p>
            <p>It is for this reaſon that they cannot ſpeak
but by common Place; and that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
themſelves ſo much when they are
upon a ſubject wherein they have ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that they are ready to ſpeak all,
even to the Margins, Leaves, Quotations and
other ſuperfluous circumſtances. I could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
find my ſelf among the Conferences
of the Miniſters of State, when they are
diſputing the Place of Congreſs, the Day,
the Matter; and the Arbiters. To deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
theſe Women from the defect, it were
beſt to ſend them to the Theater of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, or ſome other large and Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Book in which they might read all
that they have a mind to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>Their Repartees and their Complements
are Orations; when they have begun a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
before they can make an end, they
muſt exhauſt their Chapter; they ceaſe
not to ſpeak till they have no more to
ſay. They much reſemble thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61440:40"/>
Plays on the Theater, who are not
able to add to, or diminiſh in the leaſt
from their Leſſon without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out and forgetting the reſt. It is
true, they make themſelves admired in
ſome Rencounters; but this is more by chance
than that they can be at all aſſured of it.
And to ſpeak the Truth, that they may
ſeem able perſons, they have need to ſpeak
to thoſe that are not ſo.</p>
            <p>If by misfortune they are led from
what they have ſome knowledge of, and
are made fall upon a Subject that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to them, and where Reaſoning
or Judgment is more requiſite than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
you ſhall then at the ſame time
perceive their Weakneſs and their Vanity,
in that they can neither hold their peace,
nor ſpeak with any good Grace. The
force upon their Looks ſhews that they
have not Modeſty enough to keep ſilent,
nor Ability to diſcourſe; either they are
ſilent with regret, or ſpeak with diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principal Vices of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which I thought neceſſary to be
obſerv'd, that the good qualities might
appear the better after I had painted out
the bad. So that now to make an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Thoughts in this matter, I
judge that there is nothing more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and conducing to our Converſing with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61440:41"/>
good ſucceſs than to know well our own
humour that we may duly regulate that;
or to know the Humours of others, that we
may pleaſe them, or defend our ſelves
from them. Knowledg, and a ſweet Temper
are the two qualifications moſt neceſſary
for an entertainment: Without the former
the Converſation will be too trival,
without the other too rude and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that ſpeak little, as well
as they that ſpeak much, ought to conſider
that Modeſty is neceſſary to Silence as well
as to Diſcourſe; as it frees the one from
Contempt and the other from Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And whatſoever Humour they are of,
that they may avoid the danger of being
perſecuted or debauched, it would be good
for them never to ſeek the Converſation
but of two ſorts of perſons: That of the
beſt Wits, becauſe ſuch will excuſe moſt
eaſily their defects, and can beſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
and acknowledge their merits: And
that of the moſt Vertuous; for when the
Licentious can do no harm to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
yet they will do it to their
Reputation, and will render them but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
if they cannot make them Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

            <head>Of the Chearful Humour and the
Melancholy.</head>
            <p>THERE IS NOTHING more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the Ladies for Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than to know well their own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
that they may Reform it if bad,
or Poliſh it if it be good. This is the
foundation of all that which is of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in this matter. But as there are
two ſorts of Humours that may both ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
well, each of them in their ſeveral
way, I think fit at preſent to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of them in this Diſcourſe, that they
may the better remark that which is good
or which is evil, in the one and the other.
And to deſcribe in the firſt place that
which is of greateſt eſteem in Society; It
muſt be own'd, that the Gay and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Humour has here by much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Melancholy, which truly is
not unfit for Knowledge, but is a little too
heavy for Diſcourſe, and too coarſe for
the Genteel Carriage or Repartee. The
merry Humours have a much better Grace,
and more liberty in all they do; and ſo
they are much better receiv'd in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as being the more natural in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
leſs conſtrain'd in their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the moſt innocent in their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61440:42"/>
Whatever ſome ſay in Favour of the
Melancholy; If their Meditations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in ſome things, 'tis certain they
have their bad as well as good effects; and
they that call it the Mother of Wiſdom,
ought to acknowledg that 'tis very often
the Mother of Extravagance. They would
perſuade that ſuch Spirits diſcover many
things, and that they go far in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation;
but their Voyage is often ſo
long too that they never return again: Or
if they do return again, this is as the
Pilgrims, who abandon their own Country
to run needleſsly into ſtrange ones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other advantage, than to bring
back from thence Poverty and Wearineſs.
Muſing is a Labyrinth wherein they loſe
themſelves eaſily, and from which they get
out with difficulty.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs they name Melancholy the
Element of Good wits, thinking to excuſe
their Weakneſs by giving it a ſpecious
Name: But as the Lame do not gain any
Glory when they ſpend a great deal of
Time and Labour to make but a little
way; ſo theſe poring Spirits do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
any praiſe, for being long in finding
out that which others of ſtronger parts
could better find and with leſs pains. Thoſe
that are more ſubtle have the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
over them, as Birds that can fly,
have over Serpents that can only creep,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61440:42"/>
or ſuch as Angels have of Bodies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
things.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I do not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehend,
why they make a boaſt of
their ſpeaking but little; for their Silence
proceeds rather from their Barrenneſs than
their Diſcretion; and if they hold their
peace on many occaſions, it is not ſo much
to chuſe words, as to ſeek them. Theſe
perſons would need take but little pains
to become good Diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras:</hi>
Were it not that while they hold their peace
but meerly out of neceſſity, they are not
capable to learn how to ſpeak with addreſs.
They want a School quite contrary to that
of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> where they may ſtudy that
Readineſs which they want; they have
more need of Medicin than Precept; and
to cure them it is not only neceſſary to read
Leſſons, but alſo to work Miracles.</p>
            <p>As it ſeems much more eaſy for the Fire
to deſcend than for the Earth to mount;
ſo 'tis poſſible that they who have a ready
forward Humour, may moderate it by
reading and experience: But they that have
the groſs and heavy Souls, let them employ
themſelves in whatever ſtudy they will,
have a great deal of difficulty to render them
more lively or more ſubtle. The Birds have
Wings that inable them to fly; yet they
fold them up when they will to refreſh
themſelves: And the moſt tranſcendent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61440:43"/>
Spirits can do as much as they, either
for action or repoſe. But when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſet themſelves to animate their
faintneſs, they put themſelves into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Icarus,</hi> who was too dull and had not
enough of Addreſs, to fly upon the Wings
of Artifice: Their Diſcourſe and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
are altogether unhandſome when
they force themſelves to expreſs and ſhew
in them a heat that they have not in
their nature. They reſemble thoſe old
Men, who run, when they think only to
go, or mend their pace but by chance;
and then they loſe their breath all at once
after the leaſt effort, becauſe they do not
wiſely accommodate their pace to their
weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſome ſay in commendation of
their Coldneſs; To Imagine that this is of
excellent uſe in buſineſs, I think a Man
had need to be poſſeſt with the ſame
humour. If they ſuceed in that, it is more
the effect of Chance than of Knowledge.
If the forward Spirits are to be accuſed
for taking Occaſions too ſoon, and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them before they be ripe, the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
are in danger of coming always too
late and of ſtaying till they are rotten;
and if the former do not attend till they
preſent, the later think not of them many
times but when they are paſt. They are
too ſubject both to Fear and to Deſpair.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61440:43"/>
As they are without heat, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
action; and their Icy humour repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
all things impoſſible, whether they
are what they ſhould avoid or what they
ſhould undertake. Their Senſes are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
with a Lethargy, and cannot be
rouſed but by cutting or burning them.
They ſeem to want a reſurrection rather
than an awakening, and are a ſort of Sick
perſons that muſt be made to die, to teach
them that they are not dead. If they
have Judgment to deliberate, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
no Confidence to reſolve, and yet
have leſs of Courage to execute. This is
a Paralytick Vertue that needs to be ſpur'd
upon occaſions, and remains always Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
with remedies at hand, without
being able to make uſe of them, if it be
not ſtir'd up with great endeavour.</p>
            <p>It were indeed too great an offence
to believe that there is not a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of very wiſe and excellent perſons of this
temper: But alſo it ought to be allow'd they
would be too injurious to Wiſdom and
Vertue that ſhould make it always mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and reſerv'd; as if they who have
nothing to fear or deſire out of themſelves,
ought not at all to ſhew a ſmiling Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for a Teſtimony of the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Conſcience. On the contrary,
if Serpents breed in Standing Waters, ſo
do ill Thoughts enjoy themſelves in this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61440:44"/>
muddy Humour: And if the Spirit of ſuch
perſons is fit to invent what is wicked,
their Face is no leſs fit to cover it.</p>
            <p>When a Ruſt is gotten among the Wheels
of a Clock, there is no more any Rule in
the motions, or any certainty in the Dial
of it. And when a profound Melancholy
has mingled it ſelf with our Thoughts, the
Spirit is full of Inquietude, and the Viſage
of Grimaces. What Light or what Reaſon
can be expected where a multitude of black
Fumes from Melancholy infect the Brain?
Juſt as the <hi>Demons</hi> have ſometimes mingled
themſelves with a Storm to kill the Men,
or burn the Temples; ſo they often ſerve
themſelves of this gloomy Humour to poſſeſs
the Soul with Superſtition, Deſpair or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.
<hi>Ceſar</hi> well teſtified what we ought
to judge of theſe Melancholy Humours,
when he openly declar'd, that he fear'd a great
deal more, thoſe that were Melancholy, as
<hi>Brutus,</hi> than thoſe that were Merry, as
<hi>Dolabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ought not to be taken ill if I, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
this Melancholy Humour, do ſay ſome
of thoſe things that it produces, that we
may the better obſerve the nature of the
Cauſe in that of the Effects. There are
then ſome <hi>Hypocondriacks</hi> to whom Mirth
and innocent freedom are no leſs diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
than Day-light to an Owl: and as
their Viſage ſhews always I know not what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61440:44"/>
of Fatal in it; ſo one cannot chuſe but have
an Averſion for their ſad Mein.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, if their Coldneſs is only an
effect of the Temperament, it deſerves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Excuſe or Compaſſion: But if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from Artifice, it cannot be exempted
from Suſpicion or Blame. So that to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
well the difference that is uſual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two Humours; The Modeſty of
the Native Plainneſs is all in the Heart; that
of the Labour'd and endeavour'd Perſons is
all on the Forehead and the Outſide. The
One in truth are not Good, nor the Other
Bad, but in appearance. I grant the Caſuiſts
have ſome reaſon to ſay of Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes
as the Phyſitians judge of Muſhrooms,
That the beſt of them are good for nothing:
And yet I am not willing ſo abſolutely to
decry thoſe pleaſures that are indifferent in
themſelves, and which the Intention alone
can as well render Good as Bad. St. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
of <hi>Hungary</hi> did not refuſe ſometimes
to dance, yet nevertheleſs her Good Humour
did not hinder her from being Canonized.
Thoſe that lay ſo great reſtraint upon the
Uſage of things that are honeſt, are uſually
very free in the enjoyment of what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
when they can avoid the having a
Witneſs to their Actions.</p>
            <p>And nevertheleſs it is the Unhappineſs
of theſe Times, that people live under ſo
much diſguiſe and endeavour, that one hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61440:45"/>
can laugh without giving occaſion of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
to weak minds, or of ſlander to thoſe
that are wicked; as if a chearful humour
were a certain ſign either of a light Spirit
or a ſmall Judgment.</p>
            <p>We ought rather to deride ſuch a Cenſure,
than be troubled at it. And thoſe Ladies
that would preſerve their good humour,
without putting conſtraints upon themſelves
out of regard to this Vulgar Error, they
ought alſo to forbid themſelves as much as
may be, either deſire or regret, as being two
of the greateſt Tyrants of our Repoſe;
ſince the one carries us away to the time
to come, and the other makes us return to
that which is paſt; Taking away from us
the liberty of making the preſent time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
while we deſire thoſe things that are
not yet come, or unprofitably regret thoſe
that are paſt. The abler Spirits do eaſily
reſiſt and defie this Tyranny. As when a
Ship is toſt in a mighty Tempeſt, tho the
Maſt be broken and the Sails torn in pieces,
yet the Needle is always pointed towards
the Polar Star; ſo ought we always to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
a ſteddineſs of Mind in the moſt
tragick misfortunes, and to ſhew a temper
equal amidſt the greateſt inequality of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
And as the Winds can eaſily drive
the Ship beſides the Port ſhe deſigns for,
but not the Needle from pointing to the
Pole: After the ſame manner when ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61440:45"/>
retard our pretenſions, they ought
not for all that to drive us from our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or make ſhipwrack of our Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>NOW I HAVE SAID what there
is of good that may be found in the Gay
and Chearful Humour, it is time to examine
what evil may be met with in it. And ſince
we have remarked the defects which many
attribute to Melancholy, let us betake our
ſelves a while to mention its good effects
and juſt praiſes. This is that which renders
the Mind ſubtle for the Sciences, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for affairs, ſerious in Converſation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in Deſigns, modeſt in good Fortune,
patient under Bad, and judicious and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
in all Things. It is of this juſt and
equal Temperament that Vertue ſerves her
ſelf to appear with all her Ornaments: This
Nature has been wont to chuſe when ſhe
would form Conquerors or Philoſophers:
And this is that, which Grace it ſelf has
always employ'd to give to the World
the moſt extraordinary perſons. It ſeems
as if the Perſons of this Humour were born
Wiſe; that Nature had given them more
than Study and Endeavour can procure to
others: And that without falling under the
inconveniences of Old Age, they poſſeſs in
good time almoſt all its maturity. 'Tis true,
they reproach it with this, that their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is of more worth than their Diſcourſe:
But they ought to know, that as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61440:46"/>
of ſuch perſons is ſolid, ſo they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
diſdain that ſuperfluous ornament,
and ſhew which the ſlighter Wits make ſo
much uſe of, to procure credit among the
Vulgar. In this their Modeſty they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Eagle in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> that had
Light within, and had Eyes under his Wings:
Whereas the great Talkers have them only
upon the Feathers, as the Peacocks on thoſe
of their Train; being no otherwiſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but in Colour and Appearance.</p>
            <p>I do not at all deny but the Gay and
Chearful Humours have ſomething of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs,
but they are alſo ſubject to very
great defects: For as much as the Railery
and Jeſting which they often engage in,
tho it be agreeable to ſome, yet it uſually
does offend more than it pleaſes. And one
ſhall often ſee this ſort of Wits, among
themſelves, begin in Jeſt, and play, like Puppies,
and ſoon end in Earneſt and quarrel. But
eſpecially when Religion or any ones Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is their Subject; 'tis the eaſieſt thing
in the World for them to fall into Impiety
and Slander. And ſince we cannot rally the
Great without Imprudence, nor the Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without Cruelty; and then in doing this,
we ſhould always contradict either the Rules
of Policy, or the Laws of Nature: The
graver Spirits have a great deal of reaſon
to abſtain from that which makes them,
who profeſs it, paſs for Buffoons or for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61440:46"/>
Enemies, and which often gives themſelves
in the end an occaſion to weep, after that
they have provided for others ſomething to
laugh at.</p>
            <p>For my part, I think it no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Melancholy, to own that it has no
inclination to ſo ridiculous a quality, which
ſuppoſes always a lightneſs of Spirit, and
very often a great liberty of Conſcience.
It was this giddy-headed Temper which was
that of the fooliſh Virgins, and of the ſame
are they who have more Wit than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Who nevertheleſs ſeem for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to have ſome Light, but it is an <hi>ignis
fatuus,</hi> or ſuch as, like a Spark, ſhines but a
moment e're it goes out. They let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be impos'd upon, for want of being
able to foreſee far enough into Affairs of
Importance; whereas the Wiſe are never
drowſie when they ſhould prepare themſelves
for good, or dangerous occaſions, for fear
they ſhould afterwards be oblig'd to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Shame.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak of things as they are: Since
the Spirit and the Senſe have a quarrel
which will laſt as long as life, and the Soul
is not ſtrong but in the weakneſs of the
Body, as in the ruin of an Enemy; There is
ſome ground to ſay, that when the Humour
is ſo brisk and ſo free, that it is become
the more ſtrong; and on the contrary when
it is Humbled and Melancholy, 'tis become a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61440:47"/>
Slave to Reaſon; like a Maid-ſervant that
ſhews diſcontent in her looks, when ſhe is
hardly treated by her Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The Joy which ariſes from the Conſcience
has marks that are altogether particular;
'tis the pureſt that is, and reſembles the
unſpotted brightneſs of the Stars, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
caſt forth an Equal Luſtre: But that
which comes from the Body or the Temper,
is like the Comets, which have there nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from below by the exhalations of the
Earth, which preſage none but dire Events,
and which ſeem to dance in the Air, while
they run after the Vapours that feed them,
but go out as ſoon as they are deſtitute of
that Matter. The Paſſion of the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has nothing parallel to theſe Tragick Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
either in their formation, or in what
maintains them: Their Amity has no Aim
beſides the Goods of the Mind: And as
the Fire of their Affection is moſt pure, ſo
it loſes nothing of its ardour, it endures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in an equal ſtate, like that which ſome
Philoſophers fancied to be under the Orb of
the Moon.</p>
            <p>I readily acknowledge, as to what regards
Friendſhip, that the Gay Humors are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
more forward and free; but then the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
are more diſcreet in it, and fitter
to be truſted. Theſe adhere conſtantly to
their deſigns, while the other change every
moment their Paſſions, and lend themſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61440:47"/>
out to every Object that preſents. A very
little matter ſerves either to overcome or
perſuade them. Inconſtancy is almoſt inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from this Humour, and if they are
not capable of corruption through malice, at
leaſt they are liable to it by weakneſs.
But if their Plainneſs merits ſome Favour,
I cannot for all that count it reaſonable,
that we ought to eſteem ſo very much a
Natural Goodneſs, which is rather an effect
of the Temper, than the Choice. When a
Perſon cannot be Bad, there is no ſuch great
glory in being Good: And if the Simple
do not much miſchief, they are not to be
thought the leſs culpable for that, ſince not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they may do all that they
know.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſaid, that tho they are not
better, yet they are more happy than the
others, becauſe their mind is without inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude
as it is without deſign: In truth, it
were the greateſt injury that could be done
them, to ſpeak of them in this manner: For
this were to found their Felicity in their
Defect, and to own that they are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
happy, but becauſe they are Stupid or
Ignorant. If a Marble Stone feels nothing
of pain, we do not ſay for that reaſon it
is very well: We do not account it in health,
but unſenſible. It is after this manner that
the thoughtleſs are not unhappy; for 'tis
the wanting of a ſenſe of it that hinders
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61440:48"/>
them from being ſo: And this is no very
honourable advantage to them, that they are
free from care and trouble, as Stones are
free from Sickneſs, or Beaſts from Remorſe
of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>If the Stupid are found ſometimes at the
ſame point with the Philoſophers in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of their Mind, 'tis yet with a great
deal of difference between them; in that the
latter ſurmount what the others are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of. The Serpents under the Earth are
not leſs ſafe from a Tempeſt, than any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are above the Clouds: The meaner
Spirits, like them by creeping, find their
ſafety in their weakneſs: But it is much more
glorious to be above the Storm than beneath
it, and to have it under our Feet than over
our Heads.</p>
            <p>Since the true Felicity cannot be acquir'd
without Vertue and Morality, the Happineſs
of the Simple is of another Nature than that
of the Wiſe: And, in my Opinion, they
are no otherwiſe happy in this World, than
thoſe in a feigned <hi>Limbus</hi> in the other, where
they ſtay between good and bad, without
being touched by either of them. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
do not live in this indifference,
they owe not their felicity to the Ignorance,
but to the Goodneſs of their Minds; and
it would be too ſhameful a happineſs to
them, and ſuch as they would complain of,
if it were neceſſary to them to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61440:48"/>
of Good, that they might be ſo of
Evil.</p>
            <p>To know how much the Melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
excels all other, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that they who are forward and light
are no leſs uncapable to defend themſelves
from Misfortunes, than to taſt the true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
Their Heat precipitates them into
extreams: They do nothing but in Frolick, as
if they were made up only of Sulphur and
Gun-powder; they need but a mear Spark
to ſet on Fire both their Actions and
their Thoughts: And of this there is no
other remedy but to wait for the end of
their Impetuoſity, which often tires its own
ſelf, and of it ſelf the Fire goes out. The
Spirits that are without Conduct in their
Enterpriſes, are alſo without Courage in their
Afflictions: They are a bad ſort of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that uſe well neither the Sword nor
the Buckler; and the ſame lightneſs which
makes them very raſh in their onſet, does
alſo render them weary and impatient when
they come to ſuffer or defend themſelves.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the Melancholy have
always the Spirit equal: They are free from
Inſolence in a Good Fortune, and from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
under an Evil One. They endure
what they cannot overcome, they ſurmount
the Maladies of the Soul by Strong Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and thoſe of the Body by Invincible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61440:49"/>
And if heretofore a Man could find himſelf
bold enough to aſſault the perſon of a Duke
of <hi>Milan</hi> in the middle of his Guards, in the
face of his Court, and even in a Church,
only for the having practiſed ſeveral times
upon the Picture of this Prince; What bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ought thoſe Wiſe Men to have who
are of this Temper, what can they find of
new in any Events that may be able to put
them in a Wonder? Inſtead of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
they diſcover things to come at a
diſtance by their foreſight, that they may in
good time accuſtom themſelves to them. They
render things as eaſie to them by Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they become to the Vulgar by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>It ought not to be ſtrange, if the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
are very conſtant; and one can
never ſee them troubled, even when they
are conſtrain'd to give way to Force, ſince
they always reſerve a ſecret place within
themſelves where the Storms of Fortune
know not how to arrive. It is thither that
the Soul withdraws her ſelf to maintain an
eternal Serenity; there ſhe gains an Abſolute
Empire over her Opinions: And there ſhe
entertains her ſelf alone, even in the midſt
of Company, without ſuffering any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of her repoſe and ſilence by the
Throng or Tumults of the World. It is in
this ſolitude and abſtractedneſs of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Part in us that the Spirit fortifies it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61440:49"/>
ſelf, that Morality is learnt; and that ſome
poſſeſs before-hand, even without a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of years and a long experience,
the Prudence of Old Men, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Philoſophers. Laſtly, It is in
this place that we ſhall have always the means
of having pleaſant Thoughts, if we preſerve in
our ſelves the Images of thoſe things that
are agreeable: For if the preſent Objects
diſpleaſe us, we may by entring into our
ſelves render our Minds eaſie and content,
while our Senſes are under a perſecution.
We may entertain our ſelves with the
thoughts of a beauty, at the ſame time when
an ugly Face is before our Eyes.</p>
            <p>But who can ever enough commend this
Noble Contemplation of the Melancholick?
Since 'tis by this that the Soul ſeems to
quit, when it will, the troubleſom commerce
of the Senſes. And we may conſider with
an Attention the leſs diſtracted, what we
are, when our Imagination repreſents us to
our ſelves; which it does more clearly and
with leſs danger than the fooliſh <hi>Narciſſus</hi>
is ſaid to have ſeen himſelf in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
I do not wonder at all that the Poets
feign'd he deſtroy'd himſelf, becauſe he
fought himſelf out of himſelf: It is in truth
impoſſible we ſhould find our ſelves but in
our ſelves; by all that is beſides, we meet
with nothing but our appearance and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Inſomuch, that without the Uſe of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61440:50"/>
this Noble Meditation, to which the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Temper is diſpoſed, a man ſeems to
have his Reaſon imperfect and even unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
For as the Bees muſt retire themſelves
to the making of Hony, after they have
been collecting Matter for it among the
Flowers: So 'tis neceſſary, that after we
have viewed a diverſity of Objects, we ſhould
retire within our ſelves to derive the fruit
of our Obſervation, and to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
it will afford. Without this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Study or Experience we have, it will
be nothing but a confuſion and medly of
things; we may gather good things, but
ſhall be very ill Managers of them; our Actions
will appear without Conduct, our Thoughts
wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>out Order, and our Diſcourſe without
Judgment.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the groſſer Spirits
have a ſentiment quite contrary to this, and
cannot bring themſelves to imagine, that
there is any other contemplation but that
of Fools, and ſuch as are diſtemper'd. And
in truth this Meditation in them, would
cauſe no leſs hurt than it does fear of it;
it would be as contrary to them as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing:
It dazels the Spirits of thoſe that
are wicked; the one ſort it Blinds, and
others it ſeverely Scourges. It is not to be
imagin'd, that they who have nothing but
Darkneſs in the Mind, and Guilt in the
Conſcience, can take any delight to enter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61440:50"/>
into themſelves, or to ſearch there for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
or repoſe. But to deſpiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
becauſe there are ſome that may
loſe themſelves in it, is not this as great an
Error as if one ſhould find fault with the
Sun becauſe the Owls cannot bear his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
without conſidering that the Eagles
can ſtedſaſtly behold it; and that we ſhould
not tax this glorious Star, for that our feeble
Eyes are dazled by his Rayes, and we find
Darkneſs even in the Source of Light it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have now ſaid enough concerning theſe
two Humours: Having thus compar'd them
together, there is not a perſon who may not
eaſily judge what ought to be her uſage of both,
that ſhe may ſucceed well in Converſation.
If the Chearful humour ſeems moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
the Melancholy ſeems moſt ſolid; the
one is the moſt beautiful, the other the
moſt rich. They have both of them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Good, and ſomething of Evil; and
indeed, to ſpeak my Opinion, I judge that
as the mixture of hot and cold is the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of our lives, ſo all the force of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
and a good Grace is derived from
the tempering of theſe two Humours,
when it is ſo done, that the one ſerves for
a remedy to the other. And if the <hi>Romans</hi>
eſteem'd thoſe the beſt of their Tribunes,
who teſtified the moſt inclination to the
Senate, and thoſe the wiſeſt among the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61440:51"/>
which moſt favoured the intereſts
of the People; in like manner, I think, we
may ſay that the moſt excellent among the
Chearful Perſons, are they who approach
neareſt to the Melancholy; and among the
Melancholy, they are the beſt who have moſt
Gayety of Mind. For being thus temper'd,
the firſt ſhall be the more Diſcreet, and the
latter leſs Auſteer and Impoſing.</p>

            <p>BE IT SO THAT Reputation is a
Mighty Treaſure, and that it ſerves no
leſs to Vertue, than Day-light does to a
Picture to make it appear: Nevertheleſs, if
it be well conſidered after what manner
ſome loſe, or ſome poſſeſs it in theſe days,
we might rank it among the Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in which the Fooliſh have many times
a larger ſhare than the perſons of greateſt
Merit. If there were Wiſe and Juſt Judges
to diſtribute this, it were enough to be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
for the obtaining a Reputation and
Eſteem among Men: But it does frequently
depend upon ſo very ill Arbitrators, that if
it were not for this, that we are always
oblig'd to avoid, as much as we can, the
giving of Scandal; it would really become
thoſe that are Wiſe to content themſelves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61440:51"/>
with the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience
alone, without any further care for the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Imprudent, which a meer Chance
may render either Good or Bad. This is
a thing that depends too little upon our
ſelves, to be that which can render us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
And this were a Felicity but very ill
ſecured, which the Ignorance or the Malice of
an Enemy can take from us.</p>
            <p>A Renown or Great Fame is many times
an Effect which ſeems to have nothing of a
Cauſe, and which riſes like thoſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Alarms which put ſometimes a whole
Army into a Pannick Fear and Diſorder,
while they can no ways find out what
ſhould be the ſubject or occaſion of it. I
muſt alſo approve the opinion of thoſe who
compare it to the Winds, becauſe it riſes
and falls as lightly as they, and above all,
becauſe there is no one knows certainly the
Original of them. And ſince it is then ſo
uncertain a thing, why ſhould any man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
with great unquietneſs of mind, to
know how he ſtands in the opinion of
others, and afflict himſelf for the Error of
the Vulgar, as if it were but now, that
the Ignorant had begun to miſtake or
lie?</p>
            <p>I have taken occaſion to wonder, with
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the Ancients gave more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
to ſtrength and force of the
Body, than to the abilities of the Mind,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61440:52"/>
diſtributing their Lawrels to a bulky Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and not to the Wiſe or Prudent. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be but that Ignorance and Poverty
muſt have hinder'd them from putting a
Price upon Vertue. Ignorance might do this,
becauſe Vertue being a thing that is hid in
the Heart, men are often abuſed in the
judgments which they make of it: And Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
might cauſe it too, becauſe when they
were forced to acknowledge its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they had nothing in the World ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
precious to make Rewards or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
worthy of it. Now then if Human
Judgments are ſo full of uncertainty, what
advantage or what wrong can Vertue receive
from their Error? In truth they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
it, ſince they cannot know it;
they are not knowing enough for this, nor
rich enough O what Blindneſs and what
Levity is in the World! May we not ſee
ſome perſuading themſelves there is great
Vertue there, where there is truly nothing
but Vice; and ſome, on the contrary, that
give baſe and unworthy names to excellent
things? Like Aſtrologers, that call ſome of
the Stars the Bull or the Scorpion, which
have nevertheleſs nothing either of Fury or
Venom, but only Purity and Light.</p>
            <p>I could heartily wiſh that they who med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with judging of things without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well the nature of them, might be
Puniſht as <hi>Midas</hi> was. This Ignorant Judge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61440:52"/>
prefer'd the ruſtick Sound of <hi>Pan's</hi> Pipe
before the raviſhing Harmony of <hi>Apollo's</hi>
Lute, giving his Vote to that which made
the greateſt noiſe. And his fit condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to wear Aſſes Ears, having but an
Aſſes Head and Wit before. His Judgment
was very like to that of a great many,
who eſteem things only by their Colour
and Mein; and they are no leſs worthy of
long Ears for a mark of their ſtupidity.
And indeed to make more account of the
Appearance than the Truth of a thing, Is
not this to prefer <hi>Pan</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> a Pipe
before a Lute, and a Noiſe before a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
There is a great deal of Brutality
in an Opinion ſo barbarous. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
there are of ſuch as theſe a great
many in the World; and theſe are they
who give a bad repute to thoſe that merit
only a good one. I ſhall therefore reſerve
my Reſentment for thoſe who can give juſt
condemnations or praiſes; and I ſhall not
be at all of the mind to ſuffer my ſelf
to be uneaſy at that which I ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride.
There are very few perſons that
judge with any ſoundneſs, of that which
they ſee: The mind of the moſt does not
penetrate far, it ſtops as the Eyes do at
the Colour and Surface. Their Opinion
is of very little Importance, and I think;
that, without ſcandal, 'tis enough to avoid
their ſlander, without ſeeking their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61440:53"/>
We live in an Age of Pomp and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
wherein Morality is overthrown;
and the Vertues of the Time conſiſt only
in the exceſs and extravagance. To gain
the reputation of a Devout perſon one
muſt run even into Superſtition and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy:
And the Politick Spirits do by
Chriſtianity juſt as the Stoicks did by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
to abuſe the Vulgar, they fram'd
Imaginary Vertues to which humane Nature
could never attain. It is a mighty unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
that Honeſty is not to be found
in Commerce, nor Purity in Religion.
And that we muſt in common life as well
as at Court, demand often more than
we can hope for or deſerve, that we may
gain Reputation and Credit.</p>
            <p>BUT TO GIVE my Opinion as a
Philoſopher as well as Caſuiſt; It ought
not to be concluded that we may neglect a
Reputation, becauſe it is ill diſtributed
This diſorder does not at all diſpenſe with
our Duty; and it would as ill become us
to render our ſelves infamous for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as to commit Murders or Thefts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſome Thieves abſolved, and
perhaps ſome that are innocent puniſht
for that Crime. Since all Women are not
very Prudent, and there are many that
govern themſelves more by Example than
Reaſon, the wiſer part ought at leaſt to
conſider, that Reputation is then a publick
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61440:53"/>
Good, and they ought as much to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the remedying an ill Repute, as to
extinguiſh a Conflagration, or to purge a
common Contagion.</p>
            <p>In truth it is worthy to be laught at, that
any ſhould give themſelves all manner of
liberty, as we may ſee ſome do, becauſe
Vile Slander puts ſometimes the moſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in the rank of the greateſt Debauchees,
to give them an ill Repute; and ſometimes
the moſt vicious with the beſt Men, to give
them a good one. This is wholly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Impoſture to Truth, and Opinion to a
good Conſcience. As if a King ſhould cauſe
Torches to be lighted up at Noon-day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Sun ſhines upon Peaſants as well
as upon him; or as if he ſhould chuſe to
be ſick and loſe his Health becauſe, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are well. We ought not to become
vicious becauſe of the ill Opinion any have
of us, but rather endeavour always to live ſo
much the better, that we may force them
to have a good one. When one cannot
be ſo happy as to gain this, yet he ſhould
inceſſantly endeavour to practiſe ſo much
Vertue as to deſerve it. The Teſtimony
of the Conſcience is more to be eſteem'd
than all this report of us. When there
are neither Friends nor Enemies preſent to
praiſe or to blame, thoſe that are Fair find
always enough to ſatisfie themſelves in
their Looking-glaſs, and thoſe that are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61440:54"/>
homely, ſee there enough to afflict them.
The Conſcience does as much for Vice and
for Vertue, as the Glaſs does for the Viſage.
The Inſolent are far from troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for a good Reputation, ſince they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do all they can to obtain a bad one.
To judge rightly of the Lives of ſome
Women, it ſeems as if they would imitate
the <hi>Lesbia</hi> in <hi>Martial,</hi> who was wont to
ſeek for Pomp and Clamour, that ſhe might
ſhew her ſelf debauched, and who took
more pleaſure in the Spectatours than in
the Adulterers. She was for her brutiſh
Pleaſures as the Sophiſts were for their
Vertue; They could not do what was
good, nor ſhe what was bad, but upon
Theaters.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, ſince tis not
enough to be vertuous, but we muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
Men that we are ſo, we ought to
take care what appearance and ſhew we
make, and to take away pretence from
Slanderers, who are wont to <hi>make</hi> Men
criminal, when they do not <hi>find</hi> them ſo.
I grant that <hi>Socrates</hi> had no love for <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>
but ſuch as was altogether Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that his Affection was not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Philoſophy: Nevertheleſs when
he made him his Bed-fellow, he ought at
leaſt ſo to have managed his coming in and
going out, as to take from them that
ſhould ſee him going away in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61440:54"/>
all pretence to ground a Slander up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the time and the place of this Young-Mans
Viſit. Though the Oracle publiſht
the Wiſdom of <hi>Socrates,</hi> yet the Imprudene
of his Conduct in this Friendſhip cannot
be juſtified. Prudence and Love can hardly
conſiſt even in the beſt Wits; and it is
for this perhaps that the Poets have feign'd
<hi>Cupid</hi> to be always a Child; for let Love
grow never ſo old, it never arrives at years
of Diſcretion. His Childhood endures as
long as himſelf, for fear he ſhould be aſham'd
of the wanton Tricks of his Sports and
Paſs-times. I wonder not at all if Love
makes a Man loſe his Reputation, ſince it
makes him loſe his Wit; and ſince <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
himſelf with all his Wiſdom and
Vertue could not defend himſelf from the
injury of reproach in a ſimple Friendſhip</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romans, Claudia</hi> the Veſtal
was innocent; and yet ſhe was accuſed of
having loſt her Honour, only becauſe ſhe
order'd her ſelf with too much Art and
Curioſity: And they thought it cauſe
enough to condemn her, becauſe ſhe took
a little more pains about her Habit and
Diſcourſe than was well ſuiting with ſuch
a Votary. It cannot be ſaid but this was
a very ſlight ground for the forming of
her Proceſs; but certainly ſhe had never
been ſaved but by a Miracle: When ſhe
drew a Ship along with her Girdle, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61440:55"/>
many Engines, and many Men had not been
able to ſtir.</p>
            <p>In truth we are oblig'd to do all that
we are able, to take away all matter of
Slander and to avoid Scandal: But the moſt
Wiſe and even the moſt Vertuous often
labour in this matter in vain. For let them
do or not do, there are no Rules or means
Infallible for the preſerving a Reputation;
and ſince it depends upon the Opinion of
others, it follows Fortune more than Prudence.
It ought not to be believ'd that Innocence with
a good conduct are ſufficient for this, when
the Son of God himſelf, who is the Source of
all Goodneſs and Wiſdom, ſaw his Reputation
ſlur'd for a time by the Impoſtures of his
Enemies, who made him paſs for a Glutton
and a Wine-bibber. This Example alone
does abundantly ſhew that there muſt be
ſome other thing than Addreſs and Vertue
to maintain a Reputation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is I know not what Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
that follows perſons of worth, which
expoſes them to Obloquy they know not why;
and this happens more often to the vertuous
than to others; for as much as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals
create them Enemies, and they often
put themſelves in danger, like <hi>Suſanna,</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accus'd of that crime which they would not
commit. There are even ſome ſorts of Viſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that contract a Slander, and this proceeds
ſometimes from hence, That Fooliſh People
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61440:55"/>
imagine a Man cannot laugh without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vicious, and that there is no Innocence
where there is not Grief and Melancholy.
This is the Judgment of the Ignorant, who
believe that Vertue ought always to weep,
and who know not that it ought to guard it
ſelf as much againſt a dull Humour as againſt
Cloudy Weather, and that of all ſorts of
Wits thoſe are the beſt, that have ſome
Gayety. And it is neceſſary that perſons
be very heavy, to believe that we cannot
have a good Humour without an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>And beſides, if there were no Malice, or
a Man had no Enemies in the World, there
is almoſt nothing ſo aſſured or evidently
true to which Men may not give ſeveral Faces:
If we conſider our Actions well, it will
appear that they are all liable to a different
interpretation. Who can certainly judge
(where there is no Chriſtianity,) of a Man that
gives his Alms in publick, Whether this be
for a good Example, or out of Vanity? May
it not be ſaid of a perſon that is Patient, that
this is a ſign he has little Senſe, as well as that
he has this Vertue? How know we whether
a pleaſant Humour be a Teſtimony of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
or of Freedom? Thoſe that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
may they not paſs for ſtupid or vain
perſons as well as for modeſt? The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
does all; and tho the things are not
indifferent, yet we ſpeak of them more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61440:56"/>
to our Sentiment, than according to
their Nature. After all this, Thoſe that are
Wiſe ought to ſeek their conſolation in their
own Mind; and after they have done all
they can to merit a good Reputation, they
ought then to diſdain a bad one.</p>
            <p>The diſdain of Injuries is the death of
Slander, but the reſentment revives it. This
is to acknowledge the force of its Arms, when
we confeſs it has been able to hurt us. And
they who are hurried into an exceſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
when they find themſelves injur'd, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the deſigns of thoſe that ſought to offend
them; for this is to render our Enemy pleas'd
when we give him Teſtimony that he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us from being ſo.</p>
            <p>Tho our Reputation may be ſtolen from us,
or retrencht in ſome meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet at laſt it
will return again; As our Hair grows again
after 'tis cut, provided it have but a Root,
and our Innocence and Patience do remain.
In every caſe if they blame us unjuſtly, we
ought to feel more conſolation in the Truth
than trouble for the Impoſture. The Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ſhould no more afflict themſelves when
they are ſaid to be guilty, than if it ſhould
be ſaid they were ſick when they are in a good
ſtate of Health. It is from hence we may
learn why the Vertuous are leſs revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when they are blamed than the Vicious.
For as thoſe that are not beautiful, would yet
be often eſteem'd ſo with their Diſguiſes: So
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61440:56"/>
the diſhoneſt perſons endeavour by their
Artifices to gain the opinion of being very
wiſe.</p>
            <p>It is for this that ſuch Women are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
troubleſome, and that one ſhall not dare
to touch them in the leaſt where they are
hurt, but preſently they are extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd.
All the World knows that <hi>Lucrece,</hi>
when ſhe kill'd her ſelf for the Violence
which ſhe ſuffer'd from <hi>Tarquin,</hi> ſaid as ſhe
was dying, ſhe had two Teſtimonies of her
Innocence that were unreproachable, the
one was, her Blood in the ſight of Men, and
her mind before the Gods. But I am almoſt
of the Opinion of a great Author, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
her of not having been always ſo chaſt
as ſhe would fain be reputed. And if ſhe
had not been at all Criminal, ſhe might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt have found more remedy for her
trouble in her Conſcience than in Death. They
ſay ſhe reſiſted more out of humour, or ſome
ſecret conſiderations, than out of Vertue;
and having paſſed away the time with other
Galants of leſs quality than this Tyrant,
ſhe fear'd that all her other faults would be
diſcover'd by this; and this fear they ſay
made her reſolve to leave the World by
her own guilty Hand, rather than to ſee
her helf outlive the loſs of her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I declare that it is of more worth to be
good in Effect, than in Appearance; and that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61440:57"/>
an honeſt Woman ought to eſteem Vertue
beyond Reputation: But I believe too, that
if one be very ſenſible of the Importance of
her Fame, ſhe will with the more care
avoid the danger of loſing it: Since
they who have a true ſenſe of Honour,
ought to eſteem themſelves unhappy when
they are put to the trouble of juſtifying
themſelves, and that when they are not guilty:
They ought always to have before their
Eyes that which was ſaid by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi>
when he divorced his Wife <hi>Pompeia,</hi> and
that even after ſhe had made her Innocency
appear: It is not enough, ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that the Wife of <hi>Caeſar</hi> be Innocent,
but ſhe ought alſo to be free from Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>

            <p>THEY WHO Imagine that the Piety
of Women is nothing elſe but the
tenderneſs of their Complexion, and the
weakneſs of their Spirit, are not at all of our
Opinion: And they offer them no leſs affront
in their endeavour to take away this Divine
quality, than if they had attempted to Rob
their Faces of their Eyes. It muſt be believ'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61440:57"/>
that they who deſire a Woman without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
do alſo wiſh her to be without Modeſty
too. And after they have taken from her
all Sentiments of Piety, they deſign and
intend next to raviſh ſomething elſe. This
is an old Errour, which begun with the
World it ſelf: And the Libertins do nothing
elſe in this, with the Women of the preſent
Age, than what the Devil practiſed upon the
firſt Woman, whom he firſt depriv'd of the
fear of God, to the end he might afterwards
perſuade her to all manner of Liberty.</p>
            <p>But it evidences a great want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for any to ſeek the Reputation of a
good Wit in the contempt of Religion;
and that eſpecially during a Reign, and in
a Court where Religion and Piety are ſo
much reverenced by the greateſt. None can
now obſerve the common Rules of Policy
while they Violate the Rules of their Religion.
And 'tis a very happy neceſſity which renders
the looſer Spirits of the Court without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
when at this day they may ſee, that if
they will not render themſelves ridiculous,
they muſt ſeek their Salvation together with
their Fortune.</p>
            <p>It is then neceſſary that the Ladies, who
would teſtifie that they have Inclinations to
Vertue, ſhould gratifie more thoſe that make
profeſſion of this, than the Others; for fear

nor enough Diſcretion to conceal their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>And Nevertheleſs we may often ſee that
they who are vain, or deſigning, do ſeek among
the fooliſh their Admirers and Confidents; as
if this were not a choice that is altogether
blind, to take ſo ill Judges of their Merit,
and ſo bad Secretaries of their Paſtimes.
Ignorance and Simplicity are two Confidents
that are very unſafe. Intereſt and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
eaſily make them ſpeak of the things
they are acquainted with: And Imprudence
even when it is not ſollicited, will often ſpeak
of that which ought to be buried in Silence.
The Phyſician of <hi>Midas</hi> fooliſhly addreſt to
the Reeds, that he might keep a Secret from
the long Ears of his Maſter. He had a great
deal better have made uſe of an Honeſt and
Wiſe Man than of this Plant: And the ſtupid,
as well as he, prove at their coſt that there can
be no true Fidelity there, where there is no
Wit nor Reaſon. There are to this purpoſe
more Hiſtories than Fables, and we need
not return to the Times that are paſt to ſeek
Examples there, of what we may ſee every
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61440:58"/>
moment, in a ſufficient number, to afford
Matter for many Tragedies.</p>
            <p>AND AS FOR Piety, If any Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that it takes away good Humour, and
renders a Woman too Melancholy for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
In truth I do not approve of thoſe
who put their Devotion upon the Rack, to
force it to make wry Faces; as if one could
not be ſaved without making one's ſelf terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
When the Grace of God is in a Soul,
the Viſage is ſenſible of the ſweetneſs, and
does not at all carry the Lines and Colours of
the Damned or of <hi>Demons.</hi> The Weather
is clouded when 'tis diſpoſed to a Tempeſt;
and theſe dejected Looks prognoſtick ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fatal in the Thought.</p>
            <p>They that have no deſign to commit any
thing that is evil, nor remorſe in the Soul for
any that they have committed, have not this
ſad Humour, which we account to be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Devotion as it is to Decency. We
do not take any thing from Repentance for
this: The Summer has Rain as well as the
Winter, and Love may no leſs be turn'd into
Tears than Fear. Joy weeps as well as Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and the remembrance of our ſins will
give us no more Grief than the return of Gods
Favour which attends our Repentance, will give
of Joy and Pleaſure. As it does ſometimes
Rain, even while the Sun ſhines, ſo Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
often makes Tears fall from a ſmiling
Countenance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61440:59"/>
Whatever the Libertins ſay, Devotion is
not contrary to Civility: If the Bees ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Hony from the Flowers without
doing them any wrong when they touch them;
Devotion does much more in whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
it is found, by embeliſhing it and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
it more agreeable. As Jewels caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hony, get there a greater luſtre, each
of them according to their natural colour:
So there is not any condition in the World
which does not become more beautiful and
more eſtimable when 'tis accompanied with
Piety. It is for this that Divine Wiſdom
has ſaid, the Righteous are the Excellent of
the Earth. It renders thoſe that retire, more
chearful, and thoſe that live more in the
World, leſs inſolent; it moderates the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the one ſort, and ſweetens the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities
of the other. Marriage is hereby
the more commendable, War the more juſt,
Commerce the more faithful, and the Court
the more Honourable. Is there not a great
deal of Ignorance and Tyranny to ſay, that
this ought no where to be found but in a
Cloyſter, and that it cannot be mingled with
the Affairs of the World without making
ſome encroachment upon the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> or
<hi>Capuchins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OTHERS THERE are that have a
Sentiment quite contrary to this. We are
in an Age wherein many make no account
of this, unleſs it be exceſſive in the Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61440:59"/>
and ſhow; Inſomuch that many content
themſelves with the decency of Devotion
alone, or rather with a Humane Religion.
I can never ſee this Monſtrous Devotion
but it puts me in mind of the famous Trojan
Horſe, which was full of Enemies within;
and to which nevertheleſs under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Piety, they did not meerly open a
Gate, but even broke down a part of their
Wall, that they might receive with the more
ſolemnity this Preſent dedicated to <hi>Minerva.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, let us content our ſelves to have
not approved this Appearance of theſe
Times, for fear we ſhould fall into ſome
miſchief, if we undertake to oppoſe it. <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coon,</hi>
who took his Lance in his Hand to make
a ſearch with it into that <hi>Machin,</hi> was puniſht
for his Curioſity, tho it were juſt. If we
ſhould venture to make War with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
we ſhould have too many Enemies
to encounter, and might be more aſſured of
their Hatred than of their Amendment.</p>
            <p>It is true, that thoſe Women who uſe ſo
much Ceremony, and practiſe ſo much Subtilty,
that they may deceive ſome Eyes with
pretences to conſcience, do reſemble thoſe
Spiders who employ a great deal of pains
to make Nets, wherein themſelves at laſt
are Intangled; without any other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by their Labour and Art, but that of
catching a few Flies. The ſmaller Wits
admire this Artifice; but the great deſpiſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61440:60"/>
it. And for my part I am not able to
conceive how the excellent Woman can
take Dreams for Revelations, or ſuffer her
ſelf to be impoſed upon by ſuch Illuſions and
Ravings. Thoſe Women that are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
careſſing when they are Married,
have often a deſire to deceive while they
flatter; inſomuch that heretofore thoſe
Ladies were ſuſpected for the death of their
Husbands, who made exceſſive Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
over their Tombs. In a private life as
well as in publick Pretence is blamable,
and this great oſtentation is altogether ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
at leaſt, if it be not vicious. As
for what concerns Converſation, the beſt
Artifice is to have nothing of Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for 'tis more eaſy to be good indeed,
than to be ſo in appearance only; and
there is very often leſs difficulty to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Conſcience, than the Mein. And
to ſay the truth, is it not a blindneſs that is
moſt extream, to expect from the hands of
Men a recompence of the ſervice which
we render to God, and to ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Approver of our Actions beſides him
who is truly the Sole and Final Judge of
them? It is to have very wrong Notions
of Piety; to practiſe it becauſe ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it; or to renounce, becauſe others
blame it: Theſe are Motives too humane for
ſo Divine a thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61440:60"/>
THE SUPERSTITIOUS have more
ſcruple at the commiſſion of a ſmall ſin,
than of a great one; and are like the <hi>Jews,</hi>
who made more Conſcience of entring into
the Judgment-Hall, than of condemning
Jeſus Chriſt; and of omitting to waſh their
Hands, than of perſecuting the Innocent.
It is true, that ſuch Women have deriv'd
this from the firſt, who made more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and teſtified more Fear at touching
the Forbidden Fruit, than at eating it. Theſe
Queſtions, theſe Accounts, theſe Scruples
without Reaſon, give no trouble at all to
the Excellent Perſons; who follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> while they vertuouſly
cut the troubleſome Knots, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode
themſelves to untie them, as the
Vulgar do, to whom the true Devotion is
very often unknown.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, for fear we fall out of one
extream into another, we ought ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our ſelves in blaming Superſtition, as
they that burnt the Houſes in <hi>Aſia</hi> in the
time of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> They did not dare to touch
thoſe Buildings that were adjoining to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not only to prevent thoſe Sacred
Places from being burnt, but alſo for fear
they ſhould ſuffer the leaſt blemiſh. In like
manner we muſt pardon in this caſe many
things, which we might blame without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to them, but yet not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of carrying weak Spirits thereby even
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61440:61"/>
into Impiety. When Superſtition proceeds
from Simplicity, it ſeems worthy of pity
or of excuſe: But when it comes from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
it does deſerve to be puniſht. The
Ear that covers the Grain, or the Leaves
about the Fruit, are not at all made in vain:
Nature has given them theſe, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
or to adorn them. The Ceremonies
are of the ſame uſe in Religion: And as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
is inſeparable from Love; it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
borrows the tranſports of that, and
makes the Servants of God run beyond
their bounds, as well as the Prophane, who
honour their Miſtreſſes even to their Hair
and the Letters of their Names. It is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that Divine Love ſhould teſtifie more
ardour in its effects than the worldly. And
'tis for this reaſon that a great Author did
very handſomely ſay, That if the <hi>Cupid</hi> of
the Poets has two Wings, our Seraphims have
ſix.</p>

            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61440:61"/>
            <head>Of Chaſtity, and of Complaiſance.</head>
            <p>IT IS BUT reaſonable that we join
together theſe two amiable qualities, to
reduce them both to a perfect temper; ſince
there are ſome Women render themſelves
unſociable that they may keep themſelves
Chaſt; and there are others refuſe nothing
that they may be complaiſant. This is in
truth to be of too good, or too bad an
Humour; and is no other than the changing
one Vice into another, inſtead of ſhunning
Vice. If the Vertue has two extreams that
do equally tranſgreſs the rules of it, we ought
not to make uſe of one of theſe to defend
our ſelves from the other: As if a man ought
to be Covetous, for fear he ſhould be Prodigal,
or throw himſelf into the Fire to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the Water. Morality does not at
all approve this Conduct, that does not teach
to chuſe Sins, but to ſhun them, That we may
reſt in Vertue alone, which is difficult to be
found, becauſe the exceſs or the defect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it from the Eyes of the Ignorant. Thoſe
Women that think they cannot be ſtrictly
honeſt and yet ſufficiently obliging, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
but ill the Nature of theſe Vertues:
For in truth they are not contrary, they are
only divers, and their correſpondence is too
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61440:62"/>
natural for them not to be able to ſubſiſt
in the ſame Subject. When they are both
of them there in a juſt degree, they have a
much better Grace in each others company
than either of them would have alone. Hence
it is that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was the moſt commended
of all the Emperors, in that he ſeem'd to have
good qualities contrary to each other to raiſe
his eſteem: His ſweetneſs and gentleneſs took
away nothing from his Majeſty, nor his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from his gentle Condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>THERE ARE SOME that have a
Countenance ridiculous rather than ſmiling,
they do ſo much conſtrain themſelves to be
agreeable; and others are ſo much under a
conſtraint to put on Gravity, that they have
the Aſpect of furious Perſons or School-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.
However it be, to give a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of theſe two Humours, it muſt be
ſaid, that they are uſually ſuſpected either of
Artifice or Stupidity: In that, if there
be no Deſign in them, then there is no Wit;
and if there be Deſign, the one feign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
grave that they may deceive, and the
other feign themſelves eaſie, only to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The latter believe the World will aſcribe
their Familiarity to their Humour, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
imagine that their cold behaviour will
be accounted an effect of their Vertue. Theſe
diſguiſed perſons can never ſucceed long,
eſpecially with thoſe of good wit; among
whom the very beſt means to appear Chaſt
is really to be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61440:62"/>
As the greateſt Hypocrites are the leaſt
devout, ſo the moſt Reſerv'd are often the
leaſt Chaſt. <hi>Hecuba</hi> might have a handſom
Mask, and <hi>Helen</hi> an ugly one; but this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and that Beauty would impoſe upon
none but thoſe Eyes which ſaw no farther
than the outward appearance. It will in the
end be diſcovered what we are in truth.
And as Innocence falſly accuſed, does become
afterwards more glorious when it appears
in ſpight of its Enemies: The Vice which is
unjuſtly commended, appears to us the more
ſhameful, as ſoon as we are diſabuſed.</p>
            <p>BUT TO SPEAK ſome of the Praiſes
of Chaſtity, it muſt be that this Quality is
Divine, ſince even its proper enemies make
great account of it; and the moſt debauched
have leſs reſpect for her that yields, than for
that reſiſts. We may learn from the Poets,
that <hi>Daphne,</hi> while ſhe fled from the guilty
embraces of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was turn'd into a Lawrel,
from which ever after he took the Garlands that
he wore: But on the contrary, when <hi>Io</hi> had
conſented to the Will of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhe was
changed into a Cow. How different were
theſe two Metamorphoſes, and how much
more glorious marks had the Refuſal than
the Conſent! Reſpect accompanies Deſire,
but Diſdain always ſucceeds Poſſeſſion in
theſe Caſes. And it ſeems thoſe Women
are no longer Amiable after they are become
Amorous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61440:63"/>
The God <hi>Pan</hi> being raviſht with the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Nymph, employed Violence when
Intreaties had fail'd him: She ran even to
the brink of a River, where ſhe was juſt
ready to throw her ſelf in, that ſhe might
ſave her Honour with the loſs of her Life;
there the God took pity on her and turn'd
her into a Reed, of which he made a Pipe
for the Honour of her Reſiſtance; and that
he might have her every moment between
his Hands and his Lips. Thoſe that are
gain'd, are not treated after that manner,
for as much as they have not that Honour
now, which made them ſought and deſired
with ſo much care and pains.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that promiſe themſelves
they will never go ſo far, and give no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
but ſuch indifferent ones as Civility
will permit, after they have ſuffer'd more
than they ought, are carried on further than
they thought to be. I could wiſh that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
of many Ladies did not often give
a truth to the Fable of <hi>Europe.</hi> This young
Princeſs was innocently walking on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
where ſhe view'd her Herds as they
were grazing by her; ſhe ſees among them
a Bull that pleaſed her more than all the
reſt; ſhe approaches to ſtroak and play with
him, ſhe mounts upon his Back when ſhe
ſees him ſo gentle, but ſhe found her ruin
at laſt there where ſhe ſought only diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He enters by little and little into the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61440:63"/>
water with her, and ſo far at laſt that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in vain the brink of the Ocean without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to return to it. She ſaw her ſelf at
that time between two frightful dangers,
one of which ſhe muſt needs fall into: She
could not quit him without the loſs of her
life, nor commit her ſelf to his conduct
without the loſs of her Honour. She was
tranſported to an Iſle, where ſhe ſadly knew
to her coſt, that this Bull was a God thus
diſguiſed to ſurpriſe her.</p>
            <p>See herein what will happen to thoſe that
will play with Beaſts, when they are more
free or more familiar with Stupid Perſons
than with Good Wits. <hi>Europe</hi> was more
bold with a Bull than ſhe would have been
with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> if he had but declared himſelf:
He made his approaches more eaſily under
the Hide of a Beaſt, than under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a God. The moſt cunning
perſons, after his example, will counterfeit
themſelves ſilly and ignorant, to arrive with
the more eaſe at what they deſign: They
paſs from ſmall Favours to great ones, and
always advance their deſign, till they change
their Entreaties into Threatnings, and their
Soothing into Violence. And it is from
thenceforth that ſuch acknowledge, too
late, that the true Simplicity is ill treated
when it entertains it ſelf with the falſe
one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61440:64"/>
The fear of loſing their Reputation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have given ſome advantages, does
corrupt many: But they deſerve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
for their eaſineſs, that they may learn,
at their coſt, that there is no great ſafety
with perſons that are diſguiſed, and that
thoſe Spirits that are leaſt diſſembled, are
the more vertuous, and the more capable
of Friendſhip. Thoſe that would diſparage
the Ladies, ſay that the Fooliſh are more
fortunate and happy with them than the moſt
Worthy Perſons: Becauſe the Violence of
the one ſort ſucceeds better than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions
of the other; and becauſe they are
leſs aſhamed to let Favours be wreſted from
them, than to beſtow them, to the end
they may excuſe their conſent by the force.
But theſe are Opinions that deſerve rather
to be deſpiſed than credited, and which no
leſs contradict the Sincerity, than the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Ladies; who ordinarily do not
fall into any evil, but by reaſon that they
have not artifice enough againſt that of their
Enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT THAT WE may blame Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
after we have commended Plainneſs:
It is not very eaſie to employ ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
as ſome do, that they may appear
amiable, without having ſome deſign in ſo
doing. They that give Love for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
are often forced to receive it by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
Thoſe Women would work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61440:64"/>
in carrying ſo much fire in their Eyes,
without having any kindle in the Soul; and
how reſolv'd ſoever they may be, their Looks
have not the priviledge of the Sun, who
burns all below without inflaming his own
Sphere. Theſe are ill Weapons, theſe of
Love, that one can rarely make uſe of them
to hurt others, but firſt or laſt ſhe ſhall hurt
her ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have heretofore a long time muſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Statue of <hi>Venus,</hi> made by <hi>Phidias,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the feet of which, he placed a Tortoiſe.
I judge that the greateſt Myſtery that can
therein be diſcovered is, that the Tortoiſes
go but very little, or if they remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſometimes, they are always arm'd and
cover'd, carrying their Houſe along with
them. <hi>Venus</hi> deſpiſes the Solitary and the
Cautious: Thoſe Women that ſeek with ſo
much Paſſion all ſorts of Converſation, do
pleaſe her more for the encreaſe of her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
And above all things, ſhe has always
affected Nudity, becauſe it was that which
gain'd her the Apple.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that are ſo much pleaſed
to find themſelves often in the midſt of
their Enemies, have ſomething of a deſire to
be overcome. And in truth, how good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a Company may be, yet Diſtruſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
better than too much Boldneſs: And
ſince ſhe who ought to be the Pattern of
her Sex, was confus'd at the preſence of an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61440:65"/>
Angel, who appear'd to her in the likeneſs
of a Man; The Women alſo ought always
to teſtifie ſome baſhfulneſs in the company of
men, tho when they are under the form of an
Angel: Unleſs it were ſo, that they having
no other than his deſign, the Women alſo
would have no need of her fear.</p>
            <p>IT IS DOUBTLESS ill aſſerted to
ſay, That Timerouſneſs reſtrains more Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
than Vertue: If their inclination were
bad, would they want to be ſolicited? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſhews ſufficiently, that if they have
any apprehenſion, it is rather of being Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
than of being blamed. Tho the Men
that have written Books and Proverbs, have
writ all things to their own advantage:
Yet they have declar'd that Chaſtity does
particularly belong to the Women; for as
much as they, who have loſt this, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for Monſters. It would not be thought
ſo ſtrange if this Quality were not natural
to them. There have indeed ſome Men
been found that have poſſeſt this Vertue;
but this has been upon ſuch occaſions, as
wherein ſome Conſiderations, or Conſtraint
have taken away all the merit of it. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
teſtified ſome reſervedneſs with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Family: But to ſhew that
this was more out of Policy than Vertue,
what did he not do with the <hi>Amazons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio,</hi> while he was yet a Young Man,
ſent back a very fair Woman to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61440:65"/>
after his Souldiers had preſented her
to him: But Glory was ſtronger in him
than Love; becauſe he had loſt his Credit
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> if he had accepted that
Offer. What praiſe did <hi>Xenocrates</hi> deſerve
for not medling with the Woman whom
they brought to him? His coldneſs proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Old Age; he was Drunk, he
wanted to Sleep. And if he had not been
either Feeble or Drowſie, yet it was in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
in which caſe the moſt Debauched had
been aſham'd as well as a Philoſopher. There
is no need of a long Diſcourſe to prove
that Chaſtity does not belong to Men; they
themſelves too freely renounce any part in
it, and believe that they ſhould encroach
upon the profeſſion of the Women, if they
ſhould put in practice the Precepts which
they themſelves give to them.</p>
            <p>Is not this a Cuſtom altogether worthy of
blame, to ſee the Men take all manner of
Liberty, without being willing to give the leaſt
degree? One would ſay when one beholds
this Tyranny, that Marriage ſure was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
for nothing elſe but to put Women
under the Cuſtody of Goalers. There is
herein a great deal of Ingratitude as well
as of Injuſtice, to make claim to a Fidelity
which they will not return, eſpecially when
they themſelves are no leſs obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it. The Women have enough of Wit
and of Conſcience, to believe that a Revenge
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61440:66"/>
would coſt them too dear, if they ſhould
loſe their own Vertue to have ſatisfaction
for the Vice of their Husbands. <hi>Octavia</hi>
did not ceaſe to love the Lewd <hi>Mark Antony,</hi>
even while he made Love to <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and
abandon'd a great Beauty at <hi>Rome</hi> to poſſeſs
one that was far a leſſer one in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thoſe
Women that have this Conſtancy, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Admiration; but thoſe that have it
not, find pretexts for their weakneſs: The
Example ſerves them for a Reaſon, and they
cannot imagine that Cryſtal can reſiſt thoſe
Bodies, which are able to break Marbles or
Diamonds.</p>
            <p>IF WE MAY be permitted to give
ſome advice after we have been commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Since the Son of God himſelf had a
more tender affection for one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
than for any of the other. There may
be particular inclinations allow'd without
any offence to Chaſtity, which does not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Affections, but only regulate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
them. However, we ought to take
care that if Friendſhip, in its own nature, be a
Vertue, it does not become a Vice in our
practice. That it may not be therein abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
we ought to examin the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of it as ſoon as it commences; and
to aſſure our ſelves it is dangerous if we

And above all, to preſerve the more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
this Vertue, it is good for them to
betake themſelves always to ſome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Exerciſe. Evil Thoughts have no leſs
advantage of an idle Spirit, than Enemies
have over a man when he is aſleep: And
I am of the ſame opinion with him who
call'd this languiſhing Repoſe, the burying
of a perſon alive: Becauſe that as Worms
breed in the Body when 'tis without the
Soul; ſo bad Deſires and Paſſions from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a Soul that is without employ.
And if diſhoneſt Loves are the trade of thoſe
who do not ſpend their time in ſomething
that is commendable; It ought to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Chaſtity will be preſerv'd by the
help of employment, as it is corrupted by
Leiſure. Her whom the Ancients held for
the Goddeſs of Love, they alſo took for the
Mother of Idleneſs: <hi>Diana</hi> follow'd the Chace,
and <hi>Minerva</hi> Studied; but <hi>Venus</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

            <head>Of Courage.</head>
            <p>IT SEEMS to the Men, that Courage
is a Quality that ſhould be peculiarly
affixed to their Sex; without their produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
any other Title to it than only their
own preſumption: But he who made ſo much
difficulty to imagine that there was one
ſtrong and couragious Woman in the World,
he made the Sex a very honourable amends
for ſo great an injury: And tho he was
eſteemed the Wiſeſt and the Ableſt of all
Men, he nevertheleſs loſt this high advantage
among the Women, and became ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
feeble, and was ſo far conquer'd by
them, that they obliged him to ſacrifice to
Idols. Hiſtories are full of their generous
actions, which they have perform'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Country, and out of Love to their
Husbands, and for the Religion of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</p>
            <p>BUT TO SEE whether our Praiſes
are true or falſe in this matter, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to examin what is the opinion of the
Wiſe, and what that of the Vulgar concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true nature of Courage. There is
nothing then more true than this, That as
the ſtrength of the Brain appears in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the higheſt places without fearing
a fall; that of Good Spirits conſiſts in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61440:67"/>
ſeeing a danger without being troubled at
it. And nevertheleſs the Stupid have no
advantage in this matter, while they wait
till occaſions come without concern, nor have
the raſh any that ſeek them: It is only the
Wiſe that defend themſelves from misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
without being precipitant or inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Since Courage ought always to be
join'd with a free deliberation, and that it
is not a Vertue, either wholly conſtrain'd
or purely natural; I cannot perſuade my ſelf
to account thoſe to be generous who have
a Temper ſo light that it is raiſed without
good Cauſe, nor thoſe that have a Nature ſo
heavy and dull, that one cannot provoke
them, tho by ill treatment and injury. Here
is either an exceſs, or a defect of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which may better be term'd Levity
or Stupidity, than Courage. If Judgment
ſhould be found in all the Diſcourſes of an
Orator, Prudence ought to be met with in
all the Actions of a Wiſe Man: Without
that let <hi>Polyphemus</hi> be as ſtrong as he will,
he ſhall not fail to loſe firſt his Eye, and
then his Life. And tho <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was much
weaker than he, yet the bulky Giant could
not defend himſelf from him with all the
force that he had in his Arms.</p>
            <p>AFTER WE have ſeen wherein the
true Courage does conſiſt, thoſe that know
the temper of Women, muſt allow that
they have a great diſpoſition to this Vertue:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61440:68"/>
For they are not ſo cold as to be unſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nor ſo hot as to be raſh. We do not
ſee that the moſt Couragious among the Men
do precipitate themſelves upon all ſorts of
occaſions, as if they had as many Lives as
there are Hazards and Misfortunes in the
World. Whatever good Face they may put
upon it, the moſt underſtanding perſons
have ſome difficulty to reſolve upon a thing
that depends upon Opinion, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
at the committing ſuch a fault, in the
loſs of Life, as can never be repair'd. This
would tell us, that this Vertue ought to
have Eyes as well as Arms, and Prudence
as well as Vigour. And therefore they who
know Morality well, will never give the
name of Courage to Anger, nor to Deſpair;
and I am not able to believe, that the Men
have Reaſon, when they call the Women
Timerous, only becauſe they are not Haſty
or Imprudent.</p>
            <p>But if any ſay that I have made an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for Cowardiſe, they muſt not take it
ill, if I accuſe them of recommending Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
What glory has a man by cutting
his own Throat? And what advantage, bating
the brutiſh cuſtom, in making Oſtentation
of a Trade, where the Barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> and
<hi>Vandals</hi> have been the Maſters, and of which
they gave us the cruel Rules and Examples?
What is there more eaſie, than for a man to
let himſelf be tranſported into Fury, and to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61440:68"/>
follow the Motions of his Paſſion? Thoſe
whom the Vulgar call Courageous, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Glaſſes which we cannot touch
almoſt without breaking them. They do
not know that the Minds of Men as well
as their Bodies, are always there moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
where they are moſt weak. For if this
be brave and generous to be provok't, or
to complain every Moment, then the ſick
are more ſo than the ſound, the Old than
the Young, and the Vulgar than the Wiſe.
Since Fear and boldneſs are both reaſonable,
they are not contrary to each other; The
one opens our Eyes to diſcover Evils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they arrive; and the other animates
us to repulſe them when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>BUT LET US leave off reaſoning, to
come to Examples; and in truth we have
admirable ones of this kind. Has not <hi>Titus
Livius</hi> left us a Hiſtory much to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which he writ, as himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,
with Aſtoniſhment and Love? After
that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> had put to
Death the Principal Lords of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> many
to avoid his Cruelty, fled, and betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into other Countries. <hi>Poris</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxene</hi>
took their way to <hi>Athens,</hi> to find that
ſecurity there, which they could not have
in their own Country. But they Sail'd ſo
unluckily, that inſtead of advancing, the
Winds drove them back again into that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61440:69"/>
very Port whence they had ſet Sail: The
Guards having diſcover'd them at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Sun, advertiſed the Prince of it,
and laboured to deprive theſe unhappy
Creatures of that Liberty which they had
more in Eſteem than their Lives. In t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Extremity <hi>Poris</hi> employ'd his intreaties to
appeaſe the Souldiers, and even to invoke
the Gods to his ſuccour: But <hi>Theoxene</hi> ſeeing
inevitable Death was approaching, and not
being willing to fall into the Hands of this
Tyrant, ſhe ſav'd her Children from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
by an Extraordinary Reſolution. She
preſented a Ponyard to the Elder of them, and
a Cup of Poiſon to the Leſſer, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke
them. <q rend="margQuotes">There is now no further
help either for our Liberty or our Lives;
and ſince we muſt expect and propoſe to
our ſelves that we ſhall die, let us take
Courage, my Dear Children; it is better
for us to chuſe a Death than to receive
one from the Hands of thoſe that will
inſult over us. Thoſe that are ſtrong,
let them make uſe of the Sword; thoſe
that are more weak, let them drink off
this Draught.</q> Her children obey'd their
Mother, ſhe threw them half Dead into

to caſt him Headlong with her ſelf after
them; this ſhe did in the ſight of the
Souldiers, who could not forbear to lament
the Loſs, and to admire the Reſolution of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61440:69"/>
this Lady. Muſt we not own that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Conſtancy appear'd on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
with a marvelous Luſter? Can we
find among Men any thing more great, or
even comparable to this?</p>
            <p>Without diſſembling I muſt declare, that
I think we cannot ſee an Action more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous:
The Deſpair of her Husband, the
Tears of her Children, the Threats of her
Enemies could not ſhake her Conſtancy:
And in the ſight of ſo many misfortunes,
ſhe ſhew'd an Aſpect as free from Fear as it
was from Pity; ſhe had none but generous
Sentiments, there where many Men would
have had none but Cowardly ones.</p>
            <p>But if the Courage of <hi>Theoxene</hi> did thus
appear in the defence of her own Liberty;
That of <hi>Megiſtone</hi> for the ſake of her
Country, was yet more remarkable. After
that <hi>Ariſtotimus</hi> had uſurped the Sovereignty
of <hi>Elis,</hi> he drove away the better part
of the Citizens, who entreated him that at
leaſt he would permit their Wives to bear
them company in their Misfortunes. This
Tyrant conſented, in appearance, to their
Demands; but ſo ſoon as he perceiv'd and
knew that the Women diſpoſed themſelves
to depart, and that they prefer'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their Husbands to all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of their habitations in their City,
he put to death a great many of them
upon the place, and commanded the reſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61440:70"/>
into Priſons. Nevertheleſs, for as much as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
does no leſs harm to thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
it than it does to thoſe that ſuffer
under it, and there cannot be much Safety
where there are as many Enemies as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<hi>Ariſtotimus</hi> begun from thenceforth to
fear his own fall: News was brought him
that the Baniſht Citizens had form'd a Body,
and were coming back to lay ſiege to <hi>Elis.</hi>
This deſperate Barbarian not being able to
find a more ready remedy for his danger,
went with a mighty fury to the Priſon,
to command the Women that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould
call to their Husbands in order to appeaſe
them. <hi>Megiſtone</hi> disdain'd his Commands,
and without fearing any effects of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt

in the name of the reſt. <q rend="margQuotes">You ſhew very

            <p>BOTH HISTORIES and Fables
are full of ſuch Examples. But, to ſay
that which ſeems to me of greateſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
concerning the Uſe of this Vertue;
It is neceſſary to be conſider'd well on
what occaſions any ſerve themſelves of it.
It is here that the Vulgar have great need
of a Guide, becauſe if they ſeparate Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from humane Actions, then Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Deſpair or Raſhneſs will have even
the ſame effects and the ſame appearances
as Courage.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak rightly of this matter, this is
an Infallible Rule, That thoſe Women who
teſtify a great Reſolution in any evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
they are in a manner always Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
in any Vertuous Enterpriſe. And
for this Reaſon the Ladies ought to take
great care, that they be not more bold for
their Paſſions than for Vertue. And in
truth I can by no means approve of them,
who reſemble <hi>Thetia</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61440:71"/>
ſo great a fear of Flies, that ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
endure any light in her Chamber, leſt
ſhe ſhould thereby ſee them; and yet had
Reſolution enough to kill her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Was not this to abuſe both Fear and
Boldneſs? To be afraid of Flies, and yet
commit a horrid Murder with ſo much
Confidence?</p>
            <p>And to give a touch at the Principal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are contrary to this Vertue. Thoſe
Women that kill themſelves, are not coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
but deſperate; this is to give way,
inſtead of defending our ſelves: It is to
yield our ſelves to an Enemy, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to the trouble to conquer us.
There is no great need of Reſolution to
lay hold on Death for a rememdy to it ſelf:
There is no great ſtrength of Spirit to
practiſe upon our ſelves the Office of an
Hangman. It is better to ſeek the end of
a Diſeaſe in good Medicaments than in Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
otherwiſe this is not a reſiſtance,
but a flight; this is not to ſeek a remedy,
but to render our ruin the more Infallible.
As we count the Body weak, when it ſinks
under a ſmall Burden; ſo we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Mind cowardly when it faints
under an Affliction.</p>
            <p>It is indeed upon this ground that many
accuſe the Women: But the Men have no
Reaſon to Reproach them for a Vice which
themſelves are often guilty of. As <hi>Lucretia</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61440:72"/>
kill'd her ſelf for the Loſs of her Honour;
<hi>Cato</hi> did the ſame thing for the Loſs of
Liberty. And why ſhould they blame a
young Lady for that which many have ſo
highly commended in a Philoſopher? And
to ſay the truth, though ſome have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to invent Slanders for the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Women; it ought to be own'd
that they are more firm to their deſigns than
the Men. At leaſt, let us learn from the
Holy Scripture, that upon an occaſion which
required the greateſt Affection and Courage
towards the Service of God; One might
have ſeen three <hi>Mary's</hi> under the Croſs,
where there was but one of Twelve Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

            <head>Of Conſtancy and Fidelity.</head>
            <p>THOSE THAT HAVE been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with a belief, that Levity is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to Woman; when they read this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which undertakes to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they will perhaps think that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to find Stability in the Winds, a good
foundation upon the Waters, or ſtrength
in Reeds. But ſetting aſide their Opinion,
ſince it is not our Deſign or Commiſſion, to
rectify all thoſe who are in an Errour,
we will make it appear that as to what
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61440:72"/>
concerns Inconſtancy, that Sex are more
in danger to be injur'd by it, than to be
guilty of it. And that their diſtruſt is
very juſt in an Age when the Friendſhips
that are promiſed with a great deal of
Ceremony, are without Truth, or but of a
Moments Duration. Conſtancy is not uſed
but in good things, and Obſtinacy in thoſe
that are evil; otherwiſe Wickedneſs would be
Eternal, and Repentance ſhould be forbid
for fear of a change. When an alteration
is juſt it is a matter of Choice; when 'tis
not ſo it proceeds from Levity. As it is
not reaſonable that they who are ſick ſhould
remain always in that condition that they
might not be inconſtant; ſo likewiſe I do
not think there is any more fault in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
an ill Opinion, than in getting rid of
a Fever: And I believe that to Repent
may be as neceſſary to the Mind, as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are ſometimes to the Body. What
danger is there in preferring a greater merit
to a leſs, or to own that the Sun has more
of light than the Stars? Otherwiſe the firſt
things that we ſhall happen to ſee in the
World would put a Shackle upon our Liberty,
even to the taking away from us the right
of Chuſing, or to the making us love that
which may be worthy of Hatred.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that highly eſteem'd <hi>Nero</hi> while
he manag'd himſelf wiſely in the firſt five
years of his Empire; Were they oblig'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61440:73"/>
for this to love and Honour him alſo when
he was become a Tyrant? After he had
caſhier'd all his Vertue, muſt they ſtill owe
him Friendſhip? I did love this Man for
his Merit, this Face for its beauty, this
Flower for its Colour; this Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht
and become vicious, this unhappy
Face is grown ugly, this fine Flower Alas,
is wither'd; why would you have me to be
ſtill fond of an object where the lovely
Qualities are no more to be found? And
can the Building ſtand when the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taken away? If this be a due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of theſe Melancholy Laws of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
They who love a curious Picture
would be oblig'd to admire the Cloth
too, after that the fine Draught were
defaced. There is no Religion in that
Love which obliges to pay an Honour
to ſuch Relicks, any more than as our
Affection may be changed into Pity with
the decay of the Object, or unleſs it were
to avoid Ingratitude rather than Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.
It is for this reaſon that they who
love nothing but the Beauty of the Body,
have a great deal of difficulty to live long
in Love: It is only the Beauty of the Mind
and the never fading Charms of Vertue
that can lay hold of us for ever. Faces, as
well as the Years, have their Seaſons: How
agreeable and lovely ſoever a Spring may
be, we muſt expect to ſee the Flowers
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61440:73"/>
wither'd away, and to endure a Winter
after the fine days.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS there is no
ground to condemn ſo noble a Vertue, and
a quality ſo neceſſary to the World, as
Conſtancy; without which all the Love in
it were but Treachery and Deceit. Let it
then be taken how it will, whether as
Men are wont to do, or according to reaſon,
I ſay the following Examples will ſhew that
the Men are very injurious when they give
the Names of Vices to the Vertues of the
Women; when they will needs call them
obſtinate or fickle tho they have reaſon to
change or not to change. <hi>Sinorix</hi> being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Love with <hi>Camma</hi> the Wife of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nattus,</hi>
he employed all his Arts to win her
conſent to his Paſſion: But when all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
together with the Luſter of his
Quality, were not of force ſufficient to
ſhake the Reſolution of this Woman, he
imagin'd that if her Husband were but taken
out of the World, he ſhould then eaſily
poſſeſs what was now refuſed him: He kill'd
him; and after that Cruelty, he ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
the Parents of this Widow, that
by their influence ſhe at laſt conſented,
in appearance, to the Marriage of <hi>Sinorix.</hi>
When they were come then to Celebrate
the Marriage, and that they muſt go to the
Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> This Chaſt Lady brings
out a Cup of Wine, of which ſhe drinks
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61440:74"/>
a good part to <hi>Sinorix,</hi> and gives him the
reſt; he received it joyfully, and drank it
all, not imagining in the leaſt that it was
poiſoned. <hi>Camma</hi> ſeeing her deſign now
accompliſht, ſhe threw her ſelf upon her
Knees before the Image of <hi>Diana,</hi> to whom
ſhe gave her thanks and made her excuſes
after this manner. <q rend="margQuotes">Great Goddeſs, thou
knowſt with how great a Conſtraint,
and with what Deſign I have conſented
to marry with this Murderer. If Grief
would kill as often as it is extream, I
ſhould not have been now in this World;
where nevertheleſs I have not refuſed to
ſtay a while, that I might take vengeance
on this perfidious Man, whom thou ſeeſt
here, who believes that I am able to love
him after he has raviſht from me my
Dear <hi>Synattus.</hi> Think with thy ſelf <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi>

right I have to Sacrifice thy life to that

do not value at all my own, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to put an end to it only that I
might give to Poſterity one more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Teſtimony of my Love and of
thy Cruelty.</q> 
               <hi>Camma</hi> was happy in this that
<hi>Sinorix</hi> died before her, tho he drank laſt
of the fatal draught: The Gods gave this
ſatisfaction to her Fidelity, and ſhe ended
her life calling ſtill upon <hi>Synattus,</hi> that he
would come and accompany her in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61440:74"/>
from this World. Can any of the
Men give a more noble Example of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
than this? And was it not a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick
Madneſs to maintain in publick,
that among a thouſand Men one ſhould
hardly find one conſtant, but amongſt all
Woman-kind not one?</p>
            <p>After this it is eaſy to judge, whether the
Prince of Philoſophers had reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Woman to the firſt Matter, becauſe
that has always a deſire to the changing of
its Forms; and tho it has gained one that
is altogether perfect, yet it ſtill retains a
general inclination for all other. He had
a deſign to ſhew by the Parallel, that the
Women are as unſatisfied and unconſtant
towards the Men, as Matter is towards the
Forms. But this is a Compariſon too injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſuch as would agree better a great
deal with the Philoſopher himſelf, than with
any the moſt unconſtant Woman that could
be found: For he forſook one Miſtreſs for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom he made his devout Addreſſes,
that he might Teſtifie with the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
that he himſelf was guilty of a
Crime of which he had accuſed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
In truth they have more reaſon to
complain of the Men, than they have to fear
their Reproaches. How are credulous Spirits
at this day ill requited for their ſimplicity!
Whatever aſſurances many Men do give, they
ought rather to be reckoned Deceivers than
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61440:75"/>
Inconſtant; becauſe at the ſame time that
they promiſe Fidelity, they are forming a
Deſign to violate it: There is no alteration
in their Reſolutions, but there is in their
Words.</p>
            <p>THIS VICE does not haunt thoſe Minds
that are above the Common Rank: One may
be aſſured of them, and their leaſt deſigns
remain firm in all ſorts of occaſions, and
under the greateſt ſtorms of Fortune. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
comes of Weakneſs, and Conſtancy from
a ſtrength of Spirit. After that Affection has
bound together two Generous Souls, the
Separation of them muſt be impoſſible: For
ſince Love is in its Nature Immortal, when
it can ceaſe to be it muſt be acknowledged
that it is not true. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, that
his Friend and he ſeemed to have between
them but one Soul both for Life and Love:
That Death had not ſo much Separated
two, as divided one. And that after the
Loſs of this Confident he had a fear of Death
and a horrour at Life: Becauſe without
him he was but half alive, and nevertheleſs
he ſaw himſelf oblig'd to preſerve the reſt,
that his Friend might not entirely die. There
are but few ſo conſtant as this great Perſon
was: The Friendſhips of theſe times are no
longer ſo firm. And if we conſider well,
thoſe between whom the affections they had
for each other are ruin'd upon the ſlighteſt
occaſions, we may believe that the Union
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61440:75"/>
is very often without ſtrength, when
the Separation is ſo often made without
regret.</p>
            <p>AFTER WE have ſpoken of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
we ſhall encounter Perfidiouſneſs,
which is ordinarily inſeparably adjoyned to
it. And in truth, I am not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
how it comes to paſs that any are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,
when the whole World has ſo great
an abhortence of this crime, and it does ſo
infallibly procure Enemies: They that make
uſe of it ought to fear it, and they whom
it has hurt will ſeek to be revenged on it. But
that which is worthy of aſtoniſhment is this,
Tha the very Aſpect of ſuch Perſons teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that while they ſet the whole World
againſt them, they are not in a very good
agreement with themſelves; thus declaring
without words, the horrour which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are filled with at their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is not neceſſary to be very well
skill'd in the Rules of Phyſiognomy, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
upon their Faces the wickedneſs and
the torment of their Minds. It muſt needs
be that theſe are the greateſt Criminals in
the World, ſince they themſelves form their
own Proceſs in their own Conſciences, and
that even to the executing it too upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſometimes with their own Hands.
The forlorn Wretches practiſe a new form of
Juſtice upon themſelves, where they alone
are Judges and Executioners, Accuſers and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61440:76"/>
Guilty. Altho naturally we love our ſelves, yet
ſuch can ſhew themſelves no Mercy, and they
ſhew by thoſe their fatal Looks, that none
can abſolve them while their own ſevere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
do condemn and torment them. This
is the moſt horrible and the leaſt excuſable of
all Crimes, becauſe thoſe that attempt this,
are at the coſt of ſo much trouble to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, and they muſt do ſo much harm to
themſelves to do it to others. Faithfulneſs
on the contrary is always chearful even among
difficulties; and Perfidiouſneſs is always
muſing and melancholy even in the midſt
of Divertiſements. A Mind that is faithful
does not reſent its Afflictions; but that which
is treacherous has no taſt of its Pleaſures;
Their Sentiments are very differently taken
up; for the Vice makes the one ſort weep even
among Delights, and the Vertue helps the
other ſort to laugh even among their Evils
and their ſufferings. When a Soul is ſullied
with this Vice, it is capable of all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that can be imagin'd, and eſpecially does
Avarice follow it very near. And when
once a Woman is become Covetous, ſhe has a
great deal of difficulty to be faithful; there
is nothing that ſhe will not do and that ſhe
will not ſell to be rich. This is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
mark of a clowniſh Spirit and of a
Soul debauched. The Ladies ought never
to teſtifie that they have any inclination to
to this, leſt they fall under the Fate of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris;</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:61440:76"/>
who after ſhe had reſiſted both threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and ſubmiſſions, yet ſhe yielded aſſoon
as ſhe ſaw the Mony told down.</p>
            <p>BUT THAT WE MAY ſee this
Vice in all its Aſpects; The Credulous and
the Ignorant are no leſs in danger of falling
into this than any other: They are perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to many things, which their Eaſineſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
makes them ſuffer contrary to their
Honour. It ſeems, to ſay the truth, that
theſe Women are neither Faithful nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious;
for they have not the Deſign that
ſhould make them Perfidious, nor yet Strength
enough to be faithful. It is this ſimplicity,
as the Poet ſpeaks, which is worthy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
provided that one does not take pleaſure
in being deceiv'd. The Politick are liable
to do by Wickedneſſes that which the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do by Misfortune. Subtilty often times
makes Snares in which its ſelf is entangled.
There are evils where flight is better than
reſiſtance, and the good Swimmers are the
moſt frequently drowned, becauſe their skill
tempts them to caſt themſelves into the
ſtream, from which they are not able to
diſengage themſelves again.</p>
            <p>THERE IS NO NEED of proofs to
ſhew that the Women are much leſs and
not ſo frequently perfidious as the Men;
We have but too many Examples of this,
and Experience alone does ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that they have more need to defend
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61440:77"/>
themſelves from the perfidiouſneſs of the
Men, than to correct their own. Do we not
ſee among the Heathen Ladies, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Paulina</hi> cauſed her own Veins to be
cut, when ſhe ſaw her Husband <hi>Seneca</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to that puniſhment by <hi>Nero?</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to live after the death of him that had
taught her to love as a Philoſopher, that is,
conſtantly. They clos'd and ſtopt her Veins
againſt her Will; but ſhe always teſtifi'd from
that time, by the pale colour and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of her looks, that this cure was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
troubleſom: And that ſhe remain'd in
the world with regret, ſince ſhe could ſee
no longer here the Man, of whom ſhe had
learnt to deſpiſe both Life and Death, to
teſtifie the conſtancy of Love. The Wife of
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> ſeeing the affairs of her Husband
growing deſperate, ſhe took the Garland that
was about her Head, and twiſted it about her
Neck, to ſtrangle her ſelf therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
when it broke with the firſt attempt, ſhe
took the remaining piece in her Hand,
and fell into the moſt paſſionate complaints,
for that ſuch things could only ſerve to be
the Ornaments of a good Fortune, but were
not able to afford any relief in a bad one.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew a moſt admirable effect of
their Conſtancy, among the Women that
have embraced the Chriſtian Religion, in the
moſt noble occaſion of Courage that could
ever be preſented; Do we not ſee a Penitent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61440:77"/>
Woman perfectly reſolv'd to attend her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
through all hazards, even at the time
when his Diſciples forſook him, tho they
had all made, too, a thouſand proteſtations
that they would never abandon him?</p>

            <head>Of Prudence and Diſcretion.</head>
            <p>THE LADIES ARE but humane
in their Beauty; but they are, as it
were Divine if they are Prudent: When their
Beauty procures them Love, Prudence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them worthy of admiration and reſpect.
This is the Vertue that is moſt neceſſary to
them, and which gives them the greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
Since without this all their other
fine qualities are without Ornament, or at
leaſt without Order, like the ſcattered Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which the Wind carries confuſedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
With this the moſt Vicious preſerve
a little while their Reputation, (if it be fit
to call their Cunning by the name of Prudence)
and without this, very often, the Vertuous
loſe theirs. For this cauſe it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the Ladies to direct them in what
they do, and in what they let alone. And
as the Architects have always a pair of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
in their hand to meaſure every inch of
their Works; ſo ſhe that will be Wiſe, ought
to have every moment the Rules of Prudence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61440:78"/>
before her Eyes, that ſhe may render all her
actions the more reaſonable. But if we ſhould
go about to ſpeak all the good effects of
Prudence, we muſt recount all the good that
there is in Morality or in Politicks: As the
Poets feign'd, that the fire of <hi>Prometheus</hi> was
divided into many parcels for the animating
of ſeveral Creatures; ſo we may ſay when
we conſider this Divine Vertue, which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
all others, and which is neceſſary even
to the leaſt deſigns, That whatever it is we
call either an Art or a Science, it is nothing
elſe, in truth, but a fragment of Prudence.</p>
            <p>THE SLANDERERS accuſe the
Ladies, that they have no Addreſs but where
they have a Paſſion; that they have no Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
but for very ſmall or very evil Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
That like the Spiders, all their Art is
Impoyſoned; and that they ſpread their
Nets but for the catching of Flies. But this
is an Impoſture more worthy of a Puniſhment
than an Anſwer: It is alſo a Tyranny and a
Cuſtom that is not leſs unjuſt than it is old,
to reject them from the Publick Government,
as if their Minds were not capable of Affairs
of Importance, as well as thoſe of Men. <q rend="margQuotes">The
Honour of her Sex, who now deſerves and
poſſeſſes the Partnerſhip of a Throne, is alone
a ſufficient confutation of this Calumny;
whoſe admirable Conduct we have lately
ſeen, worthy, not only of the Thanks, but of
the Imitation of a Senate.</q> And the Examples
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61440:78"/>
following ſhall further teſtifie, that the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
we give them are not without foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that we have reaſon to aſſert, that
they have often produced remedies for the
moſt deſperate and ſinking conditions of
Eſtates and Provinces.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Latins</hi> demanded liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> with Arms in
their Hands to take vengeance on the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal;
The Senate found themſelves mightily
at a loſs what Anſwer to give them; for
they ſaw that to refuſe would bring upon
them a certain War; and they knew that to
conſent would bring their Eſtates in danger,
for as much as this Alliance was but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
in the <hi>Latins</hi> for the making themſelves
Maſters of <hi>Rome. Tutola,</hi> a very young Maid,
preſented her ſelf to give them her Advice;
and having obſerv'd a great irreſolution and
uncertainty what to do in the Diſcourſes of
ſo many Old Senators, ſhe no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
her Counſel, but it was approv'd by
them all. She ſhew'd them they muſt agree
with theſe Strangers in what they demanded,
and cauſe the Servant maids to be dreſt in
the Habit of Brides: That ſo the <hi>Sabines</hi> being
amuſed with the pleaſure of thoſe Gueſts,
might be diverted from the deſign they had
of making a War.</p>
            <p>This ſucceeded according to her Opinion;
and theſe Slaves when they ſaw their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Husbands fallen faſt aſleep, they ſtole
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61440:79"/>
from them their Arms, and gave notice to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers by a lighted Torch, that
they might come and ſurprize their Enemies
when they were unable to defend themſelves.
We cannot ſufficiently praiſe the Courage,
the Conduct, and the Affection of <hi>Tutola,</hi>

            <p>Let what will be ſaid of the Imprudence
of the Women; If the Men would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take their Advice, as God has given
them for a help in the management of their
Affairs, perhaps they would ſucceed the more
happily: And it would be acknowledg'd
that they are mightily in the wrong, who
deſpiſe them in a matter where there is need
of Addreſs, and Prudence.</p>

This Labyrinth is a reſemblance of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
or Affairs that are difficult; <hi>Theſeus</hi>
repreſents a man entangled; the Thread is
Prudence, and <hi>Ariadne</hi> that gave him it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
to us thoſe Judicious Ladies, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
withdraw their Husbands from thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
out of which they were not able
to help themſelves. When <hi>Jaſon</hi> was to
have become a Prey to thoſe furious Bulls
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61440:79"/>
that guarded the Golden Fleece, was it not
<hi>Medea</hi> that enchanted them, and made an eaſie
way for this Prince to carry off that which no
man before durſt attempt? By theſe Bulls we
are to underſtand thoſe dangers that often
hinder the getting poſſeſſion of excellent
things; by the Fleece, is meant the deſigns
of men, and what they pretend to; by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
the Women of Wit and Spirit, who
know to charm theſe dangers, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of any other Magick for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but only that of their Prudence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
to the end they may deliver thoſe that
reſemble <hi>Jaſon,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch as have
more Boldneſs to undertake Buſineſs, than
Addreſs and Skill to ſucceed in it.</p>
            <p>The Ladies are not only capable to know
what is of Importance in Buſineſs or Trafick;
but even to apprehend whatever is moſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
or Solid in the Higheſt Wiſdom. If the
Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> declar'd <hi>Socrates</hi> the wiſeſt
among men; <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf afterwards
freely confeſt, that his <hi>Diotima</hi> had taught
him that Prudence which the Gods themſelves
had thus judg'd Incomparable. It is not a little
to the Advantage of that Woman to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
a Philoſopher, whoſe life was ſo full
of Vertue, and whoſe Morality agrees better
with Chriſtianity than any other. And we
cannot ſee more to this purpoſe, either in
Hiſtories or Fables, than experience daily
ſhews to them who are willing to judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61440:80"/>
BUT IT IS NOT enough to prove
that they are capable of this Vertue; it is
more Important to them to know the means
to preſerve it. After we have ſeen how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
it is to them, we muſt ſhew alſo how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it is too. After we have ſhewn the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of it, it will be good to examin its
Uſe and Effects. There is nothing then more
true than this; That Prudence and Fear are,
in a manner, always inſeparable: And that as
Raſhneſs often puts the moſt able perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great danger, ſo Diſtruſt ſets the weakeſt
in ſafety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pallas</hi> of the Poets, who ought to be an
example of Wiſdom to the Women, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
armed, to ſhew thoſe of her Sex that it
would be beſt for them to be every moment
upon their Guard: And that becauſe they have
ſo many Enemies, they have always need to
defend themſelves. The Women have no leſs
cauſe to tremble, like thoſe that are covetous,
even at the ſhadow of a Reed, that is, for a
very little matter: Since they carry a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that is very eaſie to be loſt, and very
worthy to be preſerv'd. And certainly, how
deſerving ſoever they may be, ſhe that is
without Fear is as a Town without a Wall,
as eaſie to be taken as it is difficult to be
kept. I do not here ſpeak of the fear of thoſe
that are diſtracted, which is a much greater
evil than any which that threatens them with:
But I ſpeak of that wiſe Fear which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61440:80"/>
Misfortunes to us without hurting the
temperament of the Body, or the repoſe of the
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I do not at all deſign that Prudence ſhould
put us always in a fright; There is a certain
Path between Fear and Temerity, which this
Vertue ſhews, that we may prevent or avoid the
Misfortunes that are impending. And in
truth there are ſome that are too credulous
or too diſtruſtful; there needs but a meer
Phantome to fright them; they fear as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
as they hope: We may ſee their
weakneſs no leſs in the credit they give to
Good, than in that they give to Evil: And
theſe both proceed from the ſame Error;
which is, that they know not how to examin
well either the one or the other. Since Prudence
ſhews the point of Mediocrity for other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
ſo it ought to ſhew in this what is the
Exceſs or the Defect: But, not to diſſemble,
it ſeems to me, that Diſtruſt is more often
join'd with Wiſdom than Credulity; and
that if the former is not more Reaſonable,
yet at leaſt 'tis more Safe.</p>
            <p>This Vertue appears no leſs in the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Good, than in the fear of Evil. And
altho we ſee nothing more common at this
day than bad Elections, whether of Freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
or Fortune: Prudence is that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
this Defect, as it is particularly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to deliberate and to chuſe. Without
doubt a great many have need of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61440:81"/>
and they ought not to wonder if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
follows their Affections, when
Knowledge and Choice did not precede them.
When this is wanting to them, theſe Affections
of theirs are meerly Brutal, their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are Dangerous, and their Confidences
very Ill Aſſured.</p>
            <p>In this, as in every other occaſion where
a good Conduct is required, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Conſideration which muſt examine all
the Circumſtances of a Deſign: And if Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is the Eye of the Soul, this diſcretion
or diſcerning of things is as the Apple of
that Eye; this is the Flower of that Plant,
the Point of that Arrow.</p>
            <p>BUT TO EXAMINE one of the
Principal Effects of this Vertue: Commonly
thoſe Women that would ſeem to be Wiſe,
are not ſo at all. The beſt Wits ought to
conceal the ſecret Springs of their Conduct,
leſt people ſhould be cautious of confiding
in them, and leſt they rather defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt, than rely upon them. This
is a Treaſure that we may enjoy and uſe as
long as we hide it; like the Sepulchral Lamps
of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> which would give
light a long time if they remained under the
Earth, but go out of themſelves as ſoon as
they come to the Air. This great Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is uſually join'd with Levity of Mind:
And thoſe Women that boaſt of ſo much
Sufficiency, very often have little of it. They
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61440:81"/>
reſemble thoſe Apes, who are never more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and remarkably Beaſts, than when they
are diſguiſed under the Habits of Men.
What Reaſon had the Holy Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the joyning of the Wiſdom of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
with the Simplicity of the Dove! That
the former might be without Poiſon, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without Folly; that the one might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
nor the other be deceiv'd. In truth,
theſe are two Companions that ought always
to be inſeparable, ſince the one of them
mightily recommends the other: And becauſe
Prudence may take the Charms of Simplicity,
to render it ſelf the more Amiable, and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
may uſe the Conduct of Prudence to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it ſelf the more aſſured. And to ſpeak
rightly; If Addreſs without Honeſty is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but Wickedneſs; Simplicity alſo
without Prudence is nothing elſe but Folly.</p>

            <p>I AM NOT ABLE to refrain from

of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> who teſtified
an extraordinary Paſſion for <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he undeſtood that
ſhe was an utter Stranger to Study; perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himſelf that a Woman had Learning
enough when ſhe could put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61440:82"/>
the Shirt and the Doublet of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
The Opinion of this Prince would be
very ridiculous in thoſe Countries where
People go Naked, or as well among thoſe
Nations who make the Shirt and the Doublet
all of a piece: The Eſteem which he had of
the Ignorant and Simple, does oblige me to
believe he might have made a Vow that he
would love none but thoſe that were like
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> made not ſo great
account of the Ignorant; He married <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi>
only becauſe ſhe was Learned, and of a
good Wit, without any regard to this, that
ſhe was Daughter to a Father of but
mean Extraction, who left her no other
Dowry but the Beauty ſhe was born with,
and the Philoſophy of his School. They that
will diſtruſt a Woman when ſhe knows a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more than ordinary, are certainly ſuch
weak people as deſerve to fall under what
they fear, and who found their Suſpicions
upon the very Reaſons themſelves which
ought to give them Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Ladies that have ſome
Knowledge and Learning, do of all others
afford the greateſt pleaſure in Converſation;
and they receive no leſs in ſolitude when
they entertain themſelves alone. Their
Thoughts have wherewithal to content them,
while the Ignorant are ſubject to Evil
Thoughts, becauſe they know nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61440:82"/>
to employ their minds about: As
their Converſation is tedious, ſo their Muſing
can be but extravagant. They that ſay the
Women have a great advantage in their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
do they not give too much honour to
the untaught ſimplicity of the Village,
which is commonly much in danger when it
meets with Importunity and Occaſion? Or
if this Sentiment be good, why may we not
ſay as well, that the Blind are great gainers
in the loſs of their Eyes, if it were enough to
ſhut the Eyes for the avoiding of a Precipice?
In the Court, as in the Ocean, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to know the Shelves if we would avoid
the making Shipwreck; and if the Ladies do
that which is evil, after they know it to be
ſo, we ought to place the Cauſe of their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
in their Deſign, not in their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>And nevertheleſs I will maintain, as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

be Learned, that ſhe may make a figure in
Converſation. It may be that this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will at firſt ſight offend that of
the Ignorant and Stupid, who perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they ſhould find their own dear
reſemblance every where; that a Woman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtudy nor read without becoming Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or at leaſt without being ſuſpected. But
they that judge ſo raſhly in this caſe, do
deſpiſe that which they ought to deſire, as if
they were oblig'd to hate all the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61440:83"/>
which they have not themſelves, or as
if they ought not to make account of any
but very little Spirits: Whereas they ought
to repreſent to themſelves, that thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have not Judgment enough to
know Vice, they have not enough neither
for the choice of Vertue; or to know how,
according to the Occaſions, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Truth to an appearance. Alſo they who
underſtand ever ſo little of Morality, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be for this Advice, ſince we are daily
taught by experience to acknowledge, that
the light of our Reaſon is, as it were, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Vertue which diſpoſes to do good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
without any Study; and that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſee a very good Wit without a good
Conſcience. The aſſiſtance of Learning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
the good Inclinations, and they that
perſuade themſelves the reading of Books is
only a School to teach them to commit
Evil with Addreſs, might more decently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Ladies may find there more to
correct than to corrupt them.</p>
            <p>Reading and Converſation are abſolutely
neceſſary to render the Wit and the Humour
agreeable; and as the one collects for us mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Diſcourſe, the other by uſe teaches
the method of unfolding it gracefully, that
we may join together Readineſs and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
without this, our Converſation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but an inſupportable Tyranny;
and it is impoſſible without putting ones
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61440:83"/>
ſelf upon a Rack, to ſtay long with theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who can entertain us with nothing but
the number of their Sheep, if they be of the
Country; or if they be of the Town, then
can talk of nothing but the Heads and Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats
in faſhion. It ought not then to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
that in ſpeaking of this accompliſht
Woman, whoſe Character we are framing,
we do intend to deſcribe a Mother of a
Family that knows well how to follow her
Servants, or takes care to comb her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Tho we do not condemn theſe things,
yet we muſt declare that skill in Muſick,
Hiſtory and Philoſophy, and the like accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
are more agreeable to our deſign
than meer good Houſwifry. And there can
be none ſo much Strangers to Common-Senſe,
as not to own that without theſe
good Attainments, tho the Women may have
an excellent Wit, yet they will be apt
to have their minds fill'd with things
very Evil and very Impertinent. Their
good Nature and their good Inclination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without effect under the want of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Converſation, when the Tyranny
of their Mothers or of their Husbands, or
elſe ſome other misfortune hinders them
from attaining thoſe excellent qualities which
they are born capable of.</p>
            <p>FOR TO SAY that the Sciences are
too obſcure for the Ladies, and that they
cannot comprehend the Arts, even in their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61440:84"/>
Principles, becauſe of the Terms that are
too hard to be underſtood: This in truth
is a very ſtrange Error. It is an opinion
altogether extravagant to think that the
Sciences cannot as well be expreſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
as in Greek or Latin. Theſe Diſputers
that through Ignorance or Malice, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd
the Arts under Terms that are rude,
as under ragged Cloaths, and who will not
unravel the Confuſion that we may ſtill
have recourſe to them as to an Oracle;
They do them no leſs wrong in forcing
them to appear in an Apparel ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than the Libertins do to Vertue, when
they deſcribe it as terrible and inacceſſible,
that they may deter others from ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon it. But the Worthy Perſons know
how to take away this Mask. It is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture
that gives no trouble but to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Vulgar. I eaſily allow, that as
for Philoſophy and Theology, one may find
in them ſome words that ſeem not to be
purely Engliſh: I grant that when other
Arts have their peculiar Terms which are
not uſually ſoftned and explained, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to them who do not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of thoſe Arts, it is not reaſonable
that two of the nobleſt Sciences in the World
ſhould make themſelves more familiar than
the others. I own too that in ſtrong reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are ſometimes words uſed which
are a little myſterious, becauſe they expreſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61440:84"/>
the truth ſomewhat better than thoſe that
are more Polite. But after all, where there
is not this neceſſity, what need have we to
affect Obſcurity in our Diſcourſes and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
As if Clearneſs would render the
Sciences leſs venerable; or as if the Darkneſs
ſerv'd them for Ornament and Luſter; as if
the Force and the Dignity of reaſoning
were neceſſarily tackt to the Rudeneſs of
Terms. On the contrary, we no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
their price in taking away the Veil
that conceals them, than it leſſens the value
of Gold to dig it out of the Entrails of
the Earth, to refine it, and make it ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Commerce. I judge that they who
clearly explain the Sciences, do diſcover to
us true Treaſures, and that they merit ſome
part of the Glory of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who brought
Wiſdom down from Heaven to Earth; that
is, he render'd it eaſy to be underſtood by
thoſe minds which ſeem'd to be the moſt
uncapable of it. There is then nothing
more true than that when the Sciences are
well and rightly conceiv'd and underſtood,
they may alſo be expreſt even in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
whatever; and the Ladies are then
capable to underſtand them.</p>
            <p>ON THE OTHER SIDE, tho
ſome ſay that all the hindrance lies on the
part of their Minds, as not being ſtrong
enough for Learning: It ſeems to me that this
is a very wrong Judgment of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61440:85"/>
which according to the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
being more delicate than ours, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
more diſpoſed to the ſtudy of Arts and
Sciences. Whatever can be ſaid, they
are capable of theſe as well as the Men;
and if they quit ſometimes what they might
pretend to, this is more out of Modeſty
or Conſideration than out of Weakneſs. Do
we not ſee in Hiſtory that the Ancient
Gauls divided with their Women the glory
of Peace and of War; that the Men reſerv'd
the Arms to themſelves, but left to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the Eſtabliſhment of Laws and the
Preſervation of their Republicks? This could
not be done out of Ignorance; and it may
be judg'd from hence what Eſteem they
had of the Women, when the Part allotted
to the Men was the Exerciſes of the Body,
and they committed to them the matter of
Conduct, and the exerciſes of the Mind.</p>
            <p>What Science ſo difficult can be imagin'd
wherein they have not excell'd at leaſt as
far as the Men? Was not <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> judg'd
worthy to teach <hi>Pericles,</hi> who yet was able
himſelf to give Inſtructions to all the World?
<hi>Cornelia</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> compoſed
Letters ſo excellent, as that her Sons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
derived from them all their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which was alſo great; and theſe
Letters of hers did <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf admire.
<hi>Pamphila</hi> wrote ſo many as an hundred and
three Books of Hiſtory, which all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61440:85"/>
Men of that Age highly eſteem'd. And as
for the Sacred Sciences, Does not St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
himſelf acknowledge that his Siſter
ſerv'd him for a Tutoureſs, and that ſhe
gave him the knowledge of the beſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
But it is not neceſſary to ſearch the
Ages paſt for Examples of this kind; We
have in our own ſome Inſtances ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
as may be compar'd with any the
greateſt in Antiquity: We have Ladies
that know how to write upon the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and the moſt difficult Subjects. In
truth I cannot chuſe but believe, that the
moſt obſtinate Perſons would yield the
cauſe, if they would only take the Pains
to read the Homilies that Madam the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſs
of <hi>Auchy</hi> has Compoſed upon St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> She has not undertaken thoſe places
that are more plain, and where ſhe might
moſt eaſily have ſucceeded: She has beſtow'd
her pains upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
which contains, as every own knows, the
moſt ſecret and the moſt lofty Myſteries
of our Religion. Nevertheleſs in a matter
ſo Elevated there is nothing can conquer
the force of this great Spirit; ſhe marches
over Thorns as another would do upon
Roſes; her Style has nothing forced or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it is ſweet and pompous both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and the niceſt Perſons would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in this Work, that which one ſhall
rarely find in the ſame Author; there is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61440:86"/>
Clearneſs joyn'd with Vigour, and Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with Politeneſs. There is that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the devout, and ſatisfie the curious: The
learned and the delicate will there find
things that do deſerve to be conſider'd with
Attention; and they that perſuade themſelves
a Woman cannot write well, would confeſs
their Errour after the reading of that
Book.</p>
            <p>What need is there to enumerate a
great many more? To mention thoſe amongſt
us that have excell'd in Poetry, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as to force Applauſes from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitours
in Fame. This Subject is too large
to be follow'd through. And tho the Men
have been very ſparing and cautious in
writing the praiſes of Women, yet they
have not been able wholly to refrain from
bringing Teſtimony to this Truth, and many
of their Books have afforded room for their
Commendations. And if it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
us for this purpoſe to appeal to
Fable for our aſſiſtance, we may learn,
that if the Men have an <hi>Apollo</hi> for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Sciences, the Women have alſo
a <hi>Minerva,</hi> the Goddeſs of Wiſdom, who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the better Learning, and who gives
them a juſt right to pretend to the ſame.
If I did not fear to ſupport ſo known a
Truth upon Fictions, I ſhould content my ſelf
to ſend them that yet doubt in this, to the
Famous Nine Muſes of the Poets, to whom
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61440:86"/>
all the Ancients aſcribed the Invention of
Arts.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Habits or Ornaments.</head>
            <p>IT IS CERTAIN, that in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Faſhion we can poſſibly cloath our
ſelves, we ſhall very hardly pleaſe all ſorts
of perſons; either the Old or the Young
will find in our Habit ſomething or other
to find fault with: And it is next to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that we ſhould avoid falling under
either the Deriſion of the one or the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the other. There are ſome melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Spirits that cannot endure we ſhould
do any thing according to the Faſhion, and
who will infallibly find out ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in our Dreſs, if we cannot prove that
it has been a thouſand Years invented and
uſed. This is to diſdain altogether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Time, that we may give too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to that which is paſt: Without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that we muſt bear with that which
cannot be hinder'd, and that there may
often be leſs Vanity in following the New
Modes than in adhering to the Old ones.
It is true, that the Fooliſh invent them; but
the Wiſe may conform too, inſtead of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
them. The Habit, as well as the
Words we uſe, ought to be conform'd to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61440:87"/>
Time we live in. And as they would take
him for a Madman who ſhould talk in the
Court the Language uſed in the time of
King <hi>William</hi> the Firſt; ſo we ought not
to think better of them who would cloath
themſelves as he did. Thoſe who blame,
without a diſtinction, the alteration of our
Faſhions, would better become themſelves
in quitting their ſlaviſh Sentiments. Who
would forbid the ſeeking our Convenience
or Decency, for fear we ſhould not be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like our Anceſtours? Were it not in
truth an indecent Confuſion to ſee a Boy in
the ſame Dreſs with his Grandfather? I would
willingly learn of thoſe, who would not
have young People (at leaſt) follow the
Cuſtom, of what date the Habit ſhould be
which they would allow? For if Antiquity
alone will ſerve them for a Rule, we muſt
return back even to our Great-Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
<hi>Adam,</hi> and cloath our ſelves with
Leaves and Skins, that we may render our
Faſhion the more venerable by being the more
ancient.</p>
            <p>They who ſay that Reaſon and Cuſtom are
like the Sun and the Moon, have not made
their Gueſs altogether amiſs; for we muſt
needs make uſe of the light of theſe two Stars
according to occaſion, tho the one be much
brighter than the other. Exceſs is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
throughout; but eſpecially in Novelty:
It is Folly to diſdain it, and Vanity to addict
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61440:87"/>
our ſelves too much to it: As I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe Women who ſeek with too much
curioſity after the neweſt Faſhions; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I much eſteem them who have ſtill
a regret at thoſe that Cuſtom has a while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.
This Obſtinacy comes from the
love of themſelves; and they ſeem to deſerve
puniſhment no leſs than they who would
paſs away old Medals for good Mony in
Trade, contrary to the Laws of the Prince
and the Cuſtom of the Country. They ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Age ridiculous, who run after the
new Faſhions when they themſelves are old,
and uſe a great deal of Ceremony to make Men
obſerve in them the ruins of Time and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Nature. It is true, that the care and the
time that Women uſe in dreſſing, do make
them blameable, when this is extream, or
when their intentions are evil: But without
this abuſe I do not believe that there is more
danger in adorning the Face, than in the
enchacing of precious Stones, or the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of Marble. We lay Azure upon a
Cieling, we guild a Sword, we trim our
Cloaths, we adorn all things, even to the
Churches themſelves; why ſhould we forbid
Women their Ornaments when they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and when their deſigns are not evil,
when theſe are permitted to every thing
elſe? St. <hi>Jerom</hi> writing to <hi>Gaudentius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Habit of the Young <hi>Paula,</hi> ſeems
to excuſe the Innocent Curioſity of thoſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61440:88"/>
Women, who adorn themſelves according
to what becomes their Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Their Sex is ſo curious of Ornament;
and does ſo naturally deſire even a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Habit, that one may ſee many even
of the Chaſteſt and moſt Vertuous Ladies
dreſs themſelves with care, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any other end or deſign in it, but
only their own particular contentment,
and out of I know not what complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
which is altogether innocent.</q> This
Inclination is ſo natural to them, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
many Ladies have put their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in their Coffins, that they might
carry with them out of the World, what
they have ſo much lov'd when they were
here. Thoſe that do not approve theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, which only the Intention
can render either good or bad, do think
they have great advantage againſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when they call them the Inſtruments
of the Devil; without conſidering, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
thoſe evil Spirits do make uſe of their
Actions or Habits to make them temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the vicious and fooliſh, the Women
themſelves are in that caſe no more guilty
of the evils they occaſion, when their own
deſigns are honeſt, than the Thunder is
guilty when the Spirits of the Air direct
it to fall upon Men or upon Churches.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS this diſcourſe
does not extend it ſelf at all to the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61440:88"/>
of Exceſs, or the defence of Vice.
Let not any think that I would herein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Painting. Modeſty is a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Charm; without it Beauty has no life
nor Soul: And if the other Vertues are
worthy of Admiration, yet this only merits
Love. The Ornaments that are deceitful
and diſhoneſt, do add nothing to Beauty,
nor diminiſh any thing from Deformity;
ſince according to the Sentiment of the
Wiſe and good <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> an homely Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
painted makes Heaven laugh and the
Earth mourn. After all, They have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what may be found in the Shops,
they glory in a Stolen Feather: Whoever
conſiders them well, ſees the daubing, and
knows they abuſe the Eye, like thoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whoſe outſide is guilded and fine, but
under that they are only Worm-eaten and
rotten Wood.</p>
            <p>BUT IS IT NOT a thing yet more
ſhameful; To ſee the Men ſome of them
more addicted to this ſuperfluity than the
Women? <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Roman Oratour
ſpent one half of the day to conſider and
adjuſt himſelf, inſtead of Learning his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And without returning back ſo far,
we are in an Age wherein the Men make
profeſſion of this blamable Curioſity more
than ever. I am certain that if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
Affectation of ſome Gentlemen
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61440:89"/>
were well examin'd, they would have the
Title of <hi>Aristagoras</hi> put upon them, who
took ſo much pains to make himſelf pretty,
that at laſt they call'd him Madam. In
good truth, they are herein as much eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Deſign as from the Decorum
of their Sex; for as much as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leſs agreeable than when they too much
force themſelves to be ſo. This great care
is odious to all them that obſerve it, and
Negligence were to them much better than
all their Ornaments and Affectations, which
are things really unworthy of Men.</p>
            <p>I find alſo that the Poet very handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd, that <hi>Theſeus</hi> was not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
when <hi>Ariadne</hi> gave him the firſt
proofs of her Love. There is reaſon to
fear that the Ladies too manly are not ſo
modeſt as they ſhould be, and the Men
that are too ſpruce are without Courage. The
young Cavaliers of the <hi>Romans</hi> in whom
<hi>Pompey</hi> placed all his hope, turn'd tail in
the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Field to keep their Faces
from being hurt: They were leſs afraid to
ſee themſelves conquer'd, than a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd
with a Scar; and to preſerve I
know not what Imaginary beauty, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
their Honour, their Liberty,
and their Country. And the Ladies
may indeed juſtly apprehend that theſe
delicate Fops are conſcious to themſelves
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61440:89"/>
they are no otherways capable of pleaſing
them.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, to return to
that which belongs to our deſign: <hi>Caeſar</hi>
having ſeen his Daughter <hi>Julia Auguſta</hi>
too well ſet out, he ſtar'd on her a good
while without ſpeaking a word; to teſtifie his
diſcontent with her Dreſs by his ſilence: The
next day ſeeing her more modeſtly cloath'd,
he ſaid with a ſmiling Countenance, this
Habit becomes much better the Daughter of
<hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The Repartee of this Princeſs
was not leſs conſiderable than the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of the Emperour; Yeſterday (ſaid ſhe)
I was dreſt for my Husband, and to day I
am dreſt for my Father.</p>
            <p>Certainly as the moſt wiſe, will not be
at all offended, if the Ladies are conſtrain'd
to pleaſe many, that they retain one; ſo it
muſt be acknowledged, that if they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
adorn themſelves only to ſecure their
Husbands, there would not be that Exceſs
that there is; and we ſhould not hear ſo
many complaints as now go abroad, of
thoſe whoſe Luxury brings Poverty and
Jealouſy into their Families. They often
carry three or four Manners hanging at
their Ears, and with this ſpecious pretext
ſpare neither Pearls nor Diamonds: But in
truth it is not without reaſon that ſuch
are ſuſpected by many Perſons, and it is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61440:90"/>
not theſe Ornaments that entertain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
affection; and there is ground to
believe that the wantonneſs of their Dreſs
is rather contriv'd for their Gallants than
their Husbands.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Beauty.</head>
            <p>THEY THAT ADORE or that
deſpiſe Beauty, do defer too much or
too little to the Image of God. It is one
of the rare preſents that Heaven has made
to this lower World; but we ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
all the worth of it to the Power
and Bounty of him that has gratified us
therewith. In the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> it is
an Humane Splendour amiable in its own
Nature, that has power to raviſh with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Mind and the Eye.</p>
            <p>And certainly this ought to be a ſign
of the inclination that we have to good.
For as much as Heretofore the Prieſts that
were deform'd were excluded from the
Temple, let us not have an ill opinion of
Beauty which God himſelf did judge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to them that were to approach his
Altars. The Judgments that we make of
the Beauty of the Mind, by that of the
Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not often the worſt grounded.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61440:90"/>
The Soul, like a Queen, makes the richeſt
preparations where ſhe intends to appear
with the greateſt luſter and advantage.
And in truth, if Vertue be neceſſary for the
eſtabliſhment of Sovereign Authority, it
ſeems that Beauty is at leaſt as neceſſary to
grace it. If we find ſometimes the fine
Wits in ill contriv'd Bodies, theſe are like
Relicks ill enſhrin'd, to which a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will not pay ſo much Reverence as they
would if they were cover'd with Gold and
Pearls.</p>
            <p>This Lovely Quality is worthy of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in all places where there are Eyes
and Reaſon. It has Enemies no where but
there where it meets with the blind and
the ſtupid. The only glorious Countenance
of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> made him conquer ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Barbarous Nations even without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sword; and <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> himſelf,
from being Prieſt of the Sun, became Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the whole World as ſoon as his
Mother had ſhew'd him to the Souldiers.
Thus do the whole World, pay their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to thoſe to whom Nature has given
this advantage; and however they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blame Beauty, yet at leaſt they pity
it too.</p>
            <p>THE VULGAR believe that if
there is not Evil cover'd with Beauty, yet
at leaſt Misfortune attends it; and there is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61440:91"/>
danger in it, if Sin be not found with it.
But, to ſay the truth, when this is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of evil, it is often an Innocent that
makes the Criminals; and they who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of it do as unjuſtly as they who ſhould
accuſe the Sun for dazling their Sight when
they have been ſtaring too ſteddily upon that
Star. <q rend="margQuotes">That is but hardly kept (ſays <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophraſtus)</hi>
which a great many love and

they will lay ſo long Siege to thoſe
Cities, and attack them on ſo many ſides,
that at length they will make themſelves
Maſters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Authority of this Great perſon does
no prejudice to Beauty, ſince 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſay any thing more to its praiſe,
than to own that all deſire this as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the moſt pleaſing to them. And if
the Fair ſometimes ſuffer themſelves to be
won upon, this complaint muſt be directed
to their Minds rather than their Faces.
A Place is not the leſs ſtrong, becauſe they
have yielded it up who ought to defend it;
the default is in the Captain rather than
in the Citadel. Be it as it will, the Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have no advantage in this reproach: For
ſince they are never ſollicited, there is no
reſiſtance there to give a judgment of their
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61440:91"/>
ſtrength. They are at more coſt and pains
to defend themſelves from diſdain than
purſuits, and Patience is the Vertue which
they have rather moſt occaſion for.</p>
            <p>THERE ARE SOME will accuſe
the Fair of being ſcornful: But if this be
well conſider'd, it would be acknowledg'd
that their Diſdain comes often from the
goodneſs of their Conſcience rather than
from their Vanity; becauſe they know not
how to endure thoſe Idolatrous Addreſſes,
and exceſſive Praiſes, which enamour'd Fools
or crafty Pretenders make uſe of to catch
them with. As wiſe Kings deride the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of depending Courtiers, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that 'tis Intereſt more than Affection
that inſpires them: The Ladies alſo ought
to deride the Reſpects of ſuch Gallants,
for as much as with all their cares and all
their labours they ſeek nothing ſtill but
their own pleaſure, and the deſtruction of
thoſe that give ear to them: All their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and endeavour aims at, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find
to, their own pleaſure and the ruin
of the imprudent. There is not ſo much
Preſumption in the moſt Fair as there is of
Cowardlineſs in thoſe Men who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Fetters; the Services which
they pay, and the proud Names they give
the conquering Miſtreſs, do diſcover as
much their own weakneſs and extravagance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61440:92"/>
as they do their Paſſions: Is there any
ground to call that Empire Tyrannical,
where the Vaſſals are ſo Voluntary and ſo
much the Enemies of their own Liberty?</p>
            <p>YET I DO NOT intend for all this
to make an Apology for thoſe that are
really Vain but only for thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and plain. Thoſe Women who
perſuade themſelves that the great number
of their Gallants adds ſomething to their
Beauty, and who pleaſe themſelves ſo much
in the ſubmiſſions and reſpects that they
pay them; theſe give a great advantage
to their Enemies, and ſhew that they may
be conquer'd at an eaſy rate, ſince that there
is nothing neceſſary to this but a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
and flattering Commendations. Theſe
are things of which the Men will be no
leſs prodigal than the Women can poſſibly
be deſirous of them. But the Women
ought to believe, that when plain Ingenuity
makes a bargain with Craft and Artifice
it can never make it to advantage. It
often comes to paſs, that if the Women are
fair, thoſe that praiſe have a deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; if they are not fair, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to deride them: For this reaſon they
have all of them great occaſion both for
Wit and Vertue, in order to defend them
ſelves from danger and contempt.</p>
            <p>THERE ARE that ſcruple altogether
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61440:92"/>
the praiſing of Beauty, becauſe it fades in a
little time, it endures but like the ſudden
flaſhes of Lightning, and that very often it
forebodes no leſs than the approach of Storms
and Tempeſts. It is a Flower, ſay they,
which is gone almoſt as ſoon as it is blown,
which the Winds tear in pieces, the Sun
withers, and the Rain beats down, and which
is of ſo delicate a conſtitution, that even
without the help of Enemies, it periſhes by
its own Weakneſs. But what do they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſay of this, which may not alſo be ſaid of
other things in the world, which alſo are not
able to laſt always? If they complain of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is becauſe this has not the duration of
the Stars, as it has the Value and the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of them. And nevertheleſs it muſt be
acknowledged, that the moſt Fair may find
an excellent remedy againſt Vanity and Pride,
if ſometimes at the age of ſixteen or of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, they would preſent to themſelves
the defects, and inconveniences of Old Age.
Whatever fine Feathers nature or art now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,
they would be as much aſham'd as
the Peacock is when he views his black Feet,
if they would foreſee a little ſo great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and ruins. I do not make profeſſion
here of Preaching the four laſt things that
men muſt come to; but it ſeems to me that
none ought to afflict themſelves for a thing
that Time will take away from them inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61440:93"/>
yea which diminiſhes every moment
in ſpight of all the Art that can be uſed to
preſerve it.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Cato</hi> had ſo great an eſteem
of Beauty, that he ſaid publickly, that it
was no leſs crime to injure it, than to rifle
a Temple. But he ſpake of that which is
Natural, not of that which is Studied and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
<hi>Sulpitia,</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſo
beautiful Eyes, that thoſe of her time could
not look upon her without being ready to
adore her. The Neck and Breaſts of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
the <hi>Athenian,</hi> were ſo agreeable, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
himſelf became in love with her. Theſe
are the Features or Charms that ought not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be ſought by Artifice, or poſſeſt with
Vanity; Nature has favour'd ſome perſons
with theſe things with deſign to pleaſe the
Eye; and to elevate the Mind to the love of
him who is the ſource of all human Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
The forced and feigned Beauties
luckily fail in the view of all the world, juſt
after the manner of thoſe falſe and ſeeming
Stars, which after they have a while abuſed
our Eyes, do demonſtrate by their fall, that
we took a Vapour for a Star.</p>
            <p>How much Art and Pains do many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
employ to cover the defects of Nature,
as if it were not better worth their while
to have recourſe to Vertue than to Diſguiſe;
or as if it would not be much more to their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61440:93"/>
advantage to repair what is wanting in the
Face by the qualities of the Mind? Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
ſucceeds extreamly ill, and muſt do ſo,
becauſe their Vanity appears with their Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and they are not the more excuſable
hereby, but more ridiculous. They would
think it very ſtrange if they were treated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the faſhion as <hi>Phryne</hi> did with thoſe that
came into her Company: As ſoon as this
Courtiſan appear'd, ſhe defaced the luſtre of
all the Ladies at the Aſſembly, leaving them
no other Colour than what Shame and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
could afford. She invented a Play to
make them merry, wherein every one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by turns in their rank. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Water to be brought, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſhould waſh her Hands and her Face.
As ſoon as they had obeyed her Commands,
there was diſcover'd all their Paint and
Diſguiſe, there was not a perſon could be
known, they had quite other Faces all full
of Blemiſhes, and Features that were fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
This Sport would not be at all leſs
troubleſom to many of our Age, than it was
advantageous to that extraordinary Beauty.
It was alſo by her that the <hi>Areopagites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
loſt the reputation of being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Judges, for they did not believe
her Innocent; nevertheleſs after they had
ſeen her, they were not able to judge her
guilty. <hi>Hipperidus</hi> pleaded unſucceſsfully
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61440:94"/>
againſt her, tho he was a moſt eloquent
man, for as ſoon as ſhe appear'd, her
Preſence ſerv'd her for an Apology,
and ſhe needed but to ſhew that ſhe might
defend her ſelf. It is not only now-adays
that the Fair carry the Cauſe. After that
Juſtice has lifted up her Vail to ſee them,
let them plead as little as they will, their
Cauſe will ſucceed well for them.</p>

            <head>Of Curioſity and Slander.</head>
            <p>CURIOSITY is not very often at a
good agreement with Silence; thoſe
that are deſirous to learn abundance of
News, are not uſually reſolv'd to conceal
it, and Slander does infallibly make waſte
of that which an Imprudent Curioſity has
collected. The Mind of theſe Curious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
reſembles the Barrel full of holes which
the <hi>Danaides</hi> were condemned to fill, which
ſtill let out the Water as faſt as it was put
in: That which enters by the Ear, goes out
immediately at the Mouth, becauſe the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
which lets them hear no leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
than they ſpeak, does no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61440:94"/>
the opening to Lies, for their going
out, than for their coming in.</p>
            <p>I do not blame at all that Divine Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Philoſophers, and the great Wits,
which reveals to us the Secrets of Nature,
and has afforded us the means to govern the
Paſſions of the Soul. I condemn only that
Curioſity which carries us after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things unprofitable or vicious, and
leaves us ſtrangers to the knowledge of our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>And to ſay the truth, I have no leſs ſhame
than compaſſion, when I ſee ſeveral that
amuſe themſelves with the little ſtories of
the place they live in, and who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is impertinent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to good Companies. They ſeek to
adorn their Minds as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their Cabinets, I mean with ſome anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
outlandiſh Trifle or ſorry Pedlary. I
would adviſe thoſe of this humour, who
are for ſpending all their time about things
unuſeful, to learn themſelves the Anatomy
of little Flies, or the Art of numbring the
Atoms of the Air: And that they may treat
their Bodies as ill as they do their Minds,
I would have them live upon ſuch things as
Cray-fiſh, where they may find more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
than nouriſhment. This inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61440:95"/>
gives but an ill credit to their Wit,
and no better to their Conſcience: We ſhall
judge hereupon, that they do not employ
their Time only to hear ſuperfluous things,
but alſo to hear evil ones: And above all,
the readineſs they have to believe a fault
in another, is a moſt certain ſign of that
which they have to commit as much them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>THERE ARE THEN ſome that
liſten with delight to all manner of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
that cannot endure one ſhould ſpeak
to the advantage of any; and who think
that while their Company are finding fault
with all the World beſides them, they make
an Apology for their faults in ſhewing them
many like themſelves: As if the number
of Criminals could authoriſe their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
When they hear the Vertues of ſome
rewarded with their deſerved Praiſes, they
ſit as ſad and uneaſie, as the Ugly are
wont to be when the Fair are complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their preſence. And if we ſhould
examin well their thoughts, we ſhould find
here yet a much blacker ſource of evil.
They are glad to have Companions in the
Infamy, but they would not have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with them in the Pleaſure; they have
more of Jealouſie than of Shame, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
themſelves, that thoſe who make uſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61440:95"/>
of their Paſtime do ſteal ſomething from
them. They are of the humour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> who ſent his Officers about
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to diſcover and condemn
the Adulterers, that there might be none
but himſelf alone.</p>
            <p>The Vertuous excuſe Faults rather than
publiſh them; And on the Contrary, the
Vicious are always unmerciful towards thoſe
that are like themſelves, to make ſhew as
if that Crime were unknown to them.
But the effects give the Lye to their
words, and this Artifice ſucceeds ſo ill
to them, that they diſgrace, inſtead of
defending themſelves. The Honeſt and
Good Women chaſe Vice out of the World
by their Charity, and the Licentious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Vertue by their Slanders. But if I
grant that ſome do not utter Slanders
themſelves; yet nevertheleſs when they
liſten and give credit to theſe, their two
Ears are no leſs guilty than the Tongue
of the others: And if Calumny is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Reputation, theſe are at leaſt
to be accounted Acceſſories.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to know a Woman that is
Chaſt from her that is not ſo: The latter will
examin all things even to the leaſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
their own Wickedneſs ſerves them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61440:96"/>
for pattern to judge of evil by; their own
experience and deſign make them put bad
interpretations upon innocent things. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Procris</hi> had been treacherous to her
Husband, ſhe was always a diſtruſtful Spy
upon upon his Actions; ſhe could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty believe him innocent in a
thing wherein her ſelf was ſo guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Vicious are always in an Alarm, they
fear that others ſhould abuſe their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and cannot perſwade themſelves that a
Walk or a little Converſation can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
They apprehend that others will
do as much ill as they themſelves have
done, or as they were willing to have
committed if they had had as much power
as wickedneſs. And nevertheleſs, in truth,
they have no better way in the World
to conceal their own ſin, than to make
ſhew of aſtoniſhment and diſpleaſure when
they hear others condemned. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to give credit to Slanders, people
would be ready to judge of them that
they are far from being guilty of a Crime,
of which the very Name is Odious to
them. But if they teſtifie their repugnance
but by halves, and their Look permits
what their Tongue forbids; this will give
Courage to the Vicious, who are very glad
to have to do with thoſe that will not uſe
them roughly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61440:96"/>
BUT TO EXAMINE the Vice well, it will
be convenient to ſee wherein Flattery and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are alike or different. The one aſſaults us
with Poiſon, the other with a Sword. But
conſidering the thing well, it ſeems to me that
there are more to be found who reſiſt Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than Flattery: becauſe the love of our
ſelves, which fortifies us againſt Blame, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us weak when we are aſſaulted with
Praiſe. It was a Sentence derived from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wiſdom, which <hi>Solomon</hi> has to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<hi>As a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Pot for Silver, and the
Furnace for Gold, ſo is a Man to his praiſe.</hi> I
put theſe two Vices together, becauſe they
are in a manner always inſeparable, and we
may ordinarily find, that thoſe given to
Slander are as much addicted alſo to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
The one and the other comes from
Cowardice; in that this is a want of Courage
for a Man not to dare to ſpeak the truth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not to be able to reprove the things
that are Faulty to their Faces who commit
them. But to ſay truth, if there be weakneſs
of Spirit in them who exerciſe Slander, there
is no leſs in thoſe who cannot conquer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
it. For what neceſſity is there that we
ſhould be ſick when the pain and the ſenſe of
it depends upon our ſelves? There is not a
neceſſity for Patience here, it is enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe;
we ought not to receive the Wounds
of Slander, when we have it in our power to
hinder them from reaching to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61440:97"/>
There are ſome that uſe great Art in venting
their Slanders, who are not willing to hurt
but with gilded Weapons; they diſguiſe
their diſparagement of another under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Praiſe. If they ſpeak any thing
that is ill, they will pretend it is with regret
that they do ſo: But this is to imitate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who draw the Arrow towards them,
but 'tis that they may the better ſend
it to the Mark they aim at. How much
Error and Vanity is there in our Judgments
and Diſcourſes! ſince even between the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the Evening we differ more from our
ſelves than perhaps we do from others? How
can we be aſſured that ſhe who yeſterday was
involv'd in Pleaſures, may not to day be
chuſing Auſterities? But ſuppoſing that our
Judgment were not falſe, we ceaſe not for all
that to ſin againſt Charity, though we do not
againſt Truth.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have as yet committed but one
Fault ought not to be denominated Vicious:
thoſe that have done many, it may be, will
continue in them no longer; the former have
perhaps corrected, the latter have changed
themſelves. And in truth there can be no
great aſſurance that we can ſpeak any ſort of ill
concerning any Perſon without being in danger
of a lye, ſince there needs but one moment or
one thought to alter her who is called by an ill
name, and to make her a Penitent or a Sinner.
After all, it is no ſmall Conſolation to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61440:97"/>
to think that Calumny even at its firſt
birth had the Impudence to aſſault the Pure and
moſt Holy God; and that through all Ages this
has been the baſe Enemy of Vertue. This is a
forcible reaſon why we ſhould not be troubled
at it. But that you may not be guilty of it,
the grand remedy is to avoid Idleneſs, and to
believe that there is no time more proper and
fit to ſpeak evil in, than that which we do not
employ in doing Good.</p>

            <head>Of the Cruel and the Compaſſionate.</head>
            <p>WHATEVER the moſt of Men think of
the Fury of Women, yet is Pity ſo
natural to them, and their Inclination is ſo
ſtrongly carried to Mercy, that the Furies
themſelves could not forbear to weep for the
Misfortune of <hi>Orpheus</hi> when he went down
into Hell, to beg that his Wife <hi>Euridice</hi> might
be return'd to him. But if thoſe mercileſs
places, where it is ſaid horrour continually
reigns together with implacable Cruelty,
could not poſſibly ſtifle the motions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to this miſerable Perſon; may not this
Fable alone make us judge, that Gentleneſs
and Pity is a quality inſeparable from the
Ladies; if we had nothing elſe to incline us
to this belief, as indeed we have a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61440:98"/>
of Examples, and moſt true Inſtances in
Hiſtory that may diſpoſe us to it. Does not
this Fiction ſhow that even the worſt of the
Sex have always, I know not what, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in them that they cannot wholly put off;
and that they never are wholly deſtitute of
Compaſſion for the Unfortunate, nor of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
to the Guilty?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs many accuſe them of being
extream in their Paſſions: They believe that if
a Woman defers a while to take Vengeance
for an Injury, ſhe does this only to render
it the more Violent when ſhe takes it: and
eſpecially that ſhe will very rarely pardon any
that injure her in her Love or her Fortune. But
although this miſtake is more worthy to be
paſs'd by with Diſdain than to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
anſwer'd, I will nevertheleſs ſay this
to it; That if any will give themſelves the
trouble to examine their Inclination, they
ſhall find it as innocent in this matter as their
Enemies have repreſented it guilty, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
worthy of excuſe at leaſt, if not of
Praiſe. The indifferent ſort of Wits are
moved eaſily, and eaſily appeaſed again; for
their violence tires it ſelf, and it comes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to paſs, that their Paſſion weakens it
ſelf, if it continues a little while, becauſe it
is neither natural nor reaſonable. But when
a Paſſion is juſt, it always augments its
ſelf the longer it endures; for the Thought
and Meditation preſerves it, and gives it force,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61440:98"/>
while a Perſon muſes the more deliberately
upon the reaſons that gave it birth. The
reſentments of the Feeble and the Strong
Spirits reſemble Fire, which goes out almoſt
as ſoon as it is kindled in Flax or Tow; but
maintains it ſelf a long while in Iron or any
ſuch more ſolid Matter. The Ladies are not
of that light Temperament as to be tranſported
without reaſon: They are as well hard to be
appeaſed as to be provoked; they are equally
hard to be brought either to War or Peace.</p>
            <p>They would deceive themſelves not a little,
who ſhould imagine for this that my Proofs are
as unreaſonable as unartificial: I always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my Morals to Chriſtianity; and I own
that I ſhould make of them rather a School
for Vice than for Vertue, if I would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Revenge to oblige the Ladies; which
were alſo to affront both Religion and even
their Humour which is not addicted but to
Gentleneſs and Civility. I praiſe only their
Conſtancy in deſigns when they are juſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
I ſhould offend inſtead of obliging
them, if I ſhould defend a ſin ſo prejudicial to
themſelves, and which makes them paſs for
Monſters. They have ſo little Inclination to
this, and are ſo unfit for it, that it is not only
unbecoming them to be Cruel, but alſo even
to be Severe; and of the two parts there are
of Juſtice, they ſeem to be contrived for the
exerciſe of that which is the leaſt Rigorous.
And, to ſay the truth, it is no leſs ſhameful
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61440:99"/>
to ſee a Woman without Pity, than a Man
would be without Courage.</p>
            <p>AND nevertheleſs that they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves in this part of Morality, I
muſt ſay they ought not to be prodigal of their
Compaſſion, nor to throw it away upon all
ſorts of re-encounters. <hi>Anaxarete,</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi>
was not at all Cruel when ſhe ſaw the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Iphis</hi> die before her Gate without offering
to prevent it. Her refuſal was juſt, becauſe
his demand was not; and he was a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
that executed Juſtice upon himſelf for
his own Raſhneſs. The Honeſt Woman
ought to fear leſs the Ruine of a Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Perſon, than the loſs of her own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
and it would be a ſign of very little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if a Woman ſhould be Cruel to her ſelf,
in order to the being ſo impertinently pitiful
to the inſolent or fooliſh.</p>
            <p>BUT OUT of this occaſion where
Gentleneſs were a Crime; and beſide this
Honeſty which makes ſeverity abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
the Ladies ought always to repreſent
to themſelves, that Cruelty comes from Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Spirit, that they who are deſtitute
of Compaſſion want alſo Knowledge and
Courage. Moſt certainly, the moſt Generous
are the moſt Pitiful. Thoſe Ladies know 'tis
more Glorious to conquer their Paſſions than
their Enemies: and that to give a life when
'tis in their power to take it away, is, as it
were, to raiſe the Dead without the working of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61440:99"/>
a Miracle. The Proud and the Vicious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſeem uncapable of this Vertue, becauſe,
while they find a great many Enemies to
their ill deſigns, there is not a wickedneſs
ſo black and horrid but their Paſſion may
inſpire them therewith, for the ruin of
thoſe who hinder them from enjoying the
Pleaſures they deſire, or the Fortune they aim
at. <hi>Aphrodiſia</hi> the Wife of the Emperour <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocletian</hi>
try'd all ſorts of ways to make her
ſelf Belov'd by her Son-in-law <hi>Eraſtus:</hi> but
after ſhe had uſed a thouſand Inſinuations,
in a private Chamber too, where ſhe thought
the opportunity would help her to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
he ſtill moſt vertuouſly refuſed, and
that refuſal created in her no leſs hatred than
ſhame. She went all confuſed and diſordered
as ſhe was to the Emperour, her Husband, to
accuſe this Innocent Prince of that Crime
which ſhe could not perſwade him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
It is the Cuſtom of thoſe that are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
to change their Love into Hatred
when their deſires are not ſatisfied as ſoon
as they diſcover them: For they are willing
to preſerve their own Reputation, though by
the Ruine of thoſe who were Witneſſes
to their wicked Intentions, and would not be
complices with them. There was ſome ground
for the Philoſophy of <hi>Chilo</hi> when he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
maintained, concerning ſuch Women,
That it is the laſt and the greateſt evil any Man
can wiſh his Enemies, to fall under the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61440:100"/>
Anger of a Woman: And it ſeems
indeed to be an incomparable Maſter-piece,
and ſuch as hardly any Man could ever learn
the Art of Performing to appeaſe a Furious
Woman.</p>
            <p>BUT THAT we may moſt forcibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
this Vice of Cruelty, and make this
Sex conceive yet a greater horror againſt it,
I ſuppoſe this further Addition may ſuffice;
To ſay, as is moſt true, That this is as
contrary to Beauty and a good Face, as it is
to a good Conſcience, and wrongs it as much:
Though Tears have ſomething of Charm and
Gracefulneſs upon the Countenance, yet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
has not the ſame Privilege with Sadneſs.
Though we may often ſee a Melancholy
Perſon very beautiful, yet I could never hear
any one ſay that a Woman look'd lovely in
her Fury. I grant that for the reſiſtance of
other Paſſions they have need of ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
but for the cure of this, methinks,
they ſhould need only a Looking-Glaſs;
they ſhould need only to ſee that they might
be perſwaded to correct themſelves: and it
is perhaps for this reaſon that they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dare not view themſelves in this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for fear they ſhould be aſham'd at the ſight.</p>
            <p>This Paſſion is too violent not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and deface the moſt beautiful Features
of any Countenance, the Eyes by little and
little change their pleaſing Charms into Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
the Vexation of the Soul paints it ſelf
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61440:100"/>
upon all the Behaviour; and this may come
to that degree of Horrour as to put a Man to
his Prayers when he approaches them, and to
make them as frightful as <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> while
their Rage puts them into the Poſtures and
Looks of thoſe miſerable Creatures. The
Head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> which gave ſo much fear to
all the World, had only the Hair of it turn'd
into Serpents: Theſe Women by right ought
to have their Eye-brows of the ſame ſort, that
they might be entirely frightful. And it muſt
needs be that the Devil who inſpires them with
ſo much Fury, muſt caſt, as it were, a Miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes, and confound their ſight
when they behold their own Faces in a Glaſs,
ſince they are not afraid of themſelves; and
inſtead of being contented that Men endure
them, they are ambitious of being loved.
They require Careſſes, and in truth do hardly
deſerve our Patience. Let Hell keep the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Furies to it ſelf, theſe are enough to
this World to commit or perſwade Crimes
that are more black and horrid than thoſe
that have fetcht Fire and Brimſtone from
Heaven, or have cauſed the Earth to open
and ſwallow up alive the committers of
them.</p>

            <head>Of a Good Grace.</head>
            <p>THE SOUL is not more neceſſary to
Life, than a Good Grace is to Pleaſing:
It gives Luſtre to the Beautiful, and cures a
great deal of the Defect in thoſe that are not
ſo. As ſoon as any are poſſeſt of this amiable
quality, all that which they undertake is comely
and agreeable. There are many ſorts of it; every
Humour has its Charms, as every Star its
Influences; Hearts may be wounded, as well
as Bodies, with different Weapons: The
Looks, the Gate, the Diſcourſe, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Voice, and even the Silence have
their diverſe attractives: and ſo far does this
truth go, that ſome are to be found who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appear more lovely than when they are
Weeping; As <hi>Panthea</hi> who had ſo much Grace
in her Melancholy, that <hi>Araſpes</hi> was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fall in Love with her Tears.</p>
            <p>In truth it ſeems as if this agreeable quality
were even natural to the Women, and that
they poſſeſs it without any Labour or Study:
Nevertheleſs, though Birth does contribute
very much to it, and the force of a Good
Grace is much eaſier felt than it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt;
yet it muſt be acknowledged, that ſome
Rules may be given, in order to the rendring
it the more perfect. It muſt be declared in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61440:101"/>
this place, That the Beauty of the Body does
in ſome meaſure depend upon the Wit, and
that the Laws of a Good Grace are join'd to
thoſe of Morality. Wickedneſs has neceſſarily
thoſe Remorſes that thè greateſt diſſimulation
cannot long conceal. Rage, Cruelty, Love,
and Reſtleſneſs appear on the Forehead; the
Countenance does depend upon the Paſſions in
its Serenity or Trouble, as the Dial depends
upon the Motions of the Clock for ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Hours. Inſomuch, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
a Good Grace, it is neceſſary that you
know how to regulate the Motions of the Mind
as well as thoſe of the Body.</p>
            <p>AND TO BEGIN with that which
is of moſt importance, there is nothing that
ought to be avoided ſo much as the Artifice
that is conſtrain'd. They muſt not aſpire
after the Excellence that is impoſſible; Art
cannot employ too much endeavour any more
than Nature, without forming a Monſter. It
often comes to paſs through the extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
they have to pleaſe, that they cauſe a
hatred and diſtaſte inſtead of liking and love.
When they employ too much Care in their
Diſcourſe, inſtead of a natural and plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of their Thoughts, they diſturb and
confound themſelves. They reſemble thoſe
Veſſels that have a very narrow Mouth, out of
which nothing can come, though they be full,
but with noiſe and violence. As conſtraint
diſguſts in the brighteſt Actions, ſo a plainneſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61440:102"/>
pleaſes even in the meaneſt. That Woman
has Charms which no one can reſiſt becauſe
they proceed from Innocence; and Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is never without ſome Imperfections, or
without a too great ſelf-love.</p>
            <p>What an unreaſonable thing it is, not to
dare to laugh, for fear of making the Patches
fall off; or leſt they ſhould change their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
at any other time of the day than in the
Morning when they are dreſſing? This is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
the Faſhion of thoſe who will not
endure a Glaſs that does not flatter them, nor
like the Day, but in a falſe Light; and tho
they pretend to be very devout, yet they will
not come to Prayers but by Candle-light:
What a real Perſecution it would be to theſe
Ladies to bring them to Maſs, and force them
to undergo the ſprinkling of Holy-Water,
whereby their Paint would be diluted, and
the ill Features of their Faces diſcover'd. But
their Deſign appears with their Deformity
hereby, in that while they endeavour to hide
their Defects, they render them the more
conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>A good Grace is ſo much an Enemy and
Stranger to this Slavery and Racking, that if
we can always do well, I cannot tell whether
we can always pleaſe; we muſt allow of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Intervals to relieve the Spirits. Art in
this caſe ought to conform it ſelf to Nature,
that has not ſtuck the Stars ſo thick in the Sky,
nor planted Flowers ſo in the Meadows as that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61440:102"/>
there is no Space between them. And although
the Flowers are not comparable to the Stars
in Beauty or Value; yet nevertheleſs we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
look upon them with more Pleaſure and
Attention, becauſe their duration being of ſo
ſhort continuance, they always leave us with
an Appetite and a Deſire to ſee them again.
The Spirits may come to diſtaſte as well as
the Senſes, and may have need of Repoſe,
and ſome Releaſe for the digeſting of their
Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not my Intention in ſaying this, to
perſwade that they ſhould ſtudy Faults, but
that, provided they be light ones, they may
be ſometimes ſo happily committed that they
ſhall become advantageous; foraſmuch as
the ſhamefac'dneſs which ordinarily attends
them, and which appears on the Countenance,
is an infallible Teſtimony of an innocent Soul,
and ſuch as is far from the conceiving of great
Evils when it is ſo ſenſible of ſmall ones, and
that even when they are but imaginary ones
too. If then a good Grace obſerves to do all
things as it were naturally and without Study,
it follows that Plainneſs is much better than
Conſtraint. All the World does well enough
know that there is difficulty in doing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that is rare. Addreſs is not uſed
to ſhow that we perform with Difficulty; an
untaught Villager can eaſily do as much as that;
but it is to ſerve for the concealing that
difficulty cunningly, without letting the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
be diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:61440:103"/>
PLAINNESS is not leſs deſirable in
Diſcourſe than in Actions; the Words that
are moſt common, are the moſt excellent, and
every Word that is obſcure is forbidden.
That Philoſopher that always wept when he
conſider'd Mankind, perhaps would have had
ſome inclination to laugh, if he had heard
ſome of thoſe Women talk, who have a mind
to be thought more learned than they are:
They are always uſing in diſcourſe the moſt
uncommon and unknown Words, and ſuch as
far better expreſs their extravagant Folly than
their Thoughts.</p>
            <p>THIS EXCESSIVE Deſire to pleaſe
which we have condemn'd, is almoſt continually
join'd with a Fear that they do not. And from
hence it comes to paſs, that when theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Paſſions meet together in one mind they
muſt needs cauſe great inequalities and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
alterations; becauſe, if the Deſire excites
us, the Fear again damps us; when the one
animates us to the ſpeaking of a good Word,
the other interrupts us and obliges to Silence.
We may judge from hence how much wrong
this Fear does to a good Grace as well as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Conſtraint. It ordinarily comes to
paſs, that thoſe Women who are always in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm,
and every moment fear they ſhall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
do almoſt nothing elſe but miſtake:
An Extream Apprehenſion diſpoſes the Mind
to Errour as well as the Body to Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:61440:103"/>
And to make a right Judgment of this
troubleſome Paſſion, it ſeems to me that if we
enquire well into the Cauſe of it, we ſhall find
the Education contributing no leſs to it than
Temper and Birth. Thoſe that are brought
up in Slavery know not how to do any thing
with Liberty; they dare not look up with
that honeſt aſſurance which ſhould give a
good Grace to their Actions; their Thoughts
are always mean, and whatever good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they may have, yet their Shame and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
hinder them from ſucceeding in all
their Enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that have ſeen nothing of
the World are liable to be aſtoniſh'd at ſmall
Matters, becauſe the conſtant Diſtruſt which
they have of themſelves makes them fear and
admire every thing. For the moſt part after
their Reverences they have no other Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but thoſe that are uſed at the ends of
Letters. They would have found out an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Remedy for this if they would but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves that they ought not ſo eaſily
to admire things; and that if they would give
themſelves leiſure to examine that, which at
firſt ſight amazes them, they would often find
after the converſation of an hour's length, that
what was the Subject of their Admiration
ought to cauſe their diſdain. But this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is not acquired without Labour: It is
very Difficult, even to the beſt Wits, to have
Addreſs without Experience, or Readineſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61440:104"/>
without Practice: Actions breed a Habit with
ſome difficulty; but when the Habit is form'd,
then that produces the Actions with Ornament
and a good Grace. Nevertheleſs when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the ruſtick Shame, I have no Intention
herein to recommend Impudence; ſince both
of them have Iſſues and Effects that are unjuſt;
foraſmuch as the one tranſports us beyond our
Power and what becomes us, and the other
detains us below them both: On the contrary,
the Modeſty that I deſire, is placed between
theſe two vicious Extreams, that it may keep
us at a Diſtance from too good or from too ill
an Opinion of our ſelves.</p>

            <p>THERE ARE perhaps but few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces

the Laws of Chaſtity and Honour during the

whether this was an Effect of their Skill, or of
their Vertue; but be it as it will, this was
a Chaſtity of a long Duration, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
Admiration and Praiſe as much as the
Corruption of the preſent Age deſerves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
and Puniſhments. It may be this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
will not be at all pleaſing to thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61440:104"/>
to whom I deſire it ſhould be uſeful; but
if the Vicious are not diſpoſed to receive our
Remedies for their Cure, at leaſt they muſt
expect to undergo our Affronts for their ſhame.
I ſpeak boldly to all; for if they be debauch'd,
I deſire not to be in any Favour with them;
and if they be honeſt, I do not fear that I ſhall
hereby incurr their Hatred. The one ſort
will applaud my Cenſure, and the other will
do me honour in not approving my Diſcourſe
any more than I do their Life. However I
ſhall always lie under this Inconvenience, That
whatever Horrour I can help any to conceive
at this Crime, it muſt be more obſcure than
injurious in ſuch a matter. It is neceſſary to
conceal, through Modeſty, that which Hatred
and Truth would require to be publiſh'd. It
is herein that this Crime has a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
in that, while it is worthy of Reproof,
the Filthineſs it ſelf nevertheleſs ſerves it for
a Defence, and one is conſtrained to ſpare
it more out of ſhame than pity.</p>
            <p>IT IS VERY TRUE then, that the
Paſſion of the debauched does no way deſerve
the Name of Love; it is ſome other Diſeaſe
which cannot be cured but by a Miracle:
and one may well ſay to the reproach of thoſe
that are infected with it, what the Poet ſaid
of <hi>Myrrha;</hi> that it was not <hi>Cupid</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
ſuch a Flame in her, but rather one
of the moſt inraged Furies. This is a Fire
from Hell, which has for its Smoak a black
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61440:105"/>
and diſmal Blindneſs, for its gloomy Shine a
horrid Scandal, and for its Aſhes Infamy and
Shame. And how can their filthy Deſire be
call'd Love; when inſtead of Election there
is nothing in it but a brutal Univerſality? For
in loving all, to ſpeak properly, they do not
love any; ſince this is a Fire which mingles
with all ſorts of Matter, even to the burning
in the Water: I mean it can entertain for
its Objects ſuch as are worthy of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
horrour and deteſtation.</p>
            <p>AND NEVERTHELESS, though
they have the Conſcience full of Crimes, theſe
are often they who would paſs for Saints: As
the moſt deform'd have moſt need of Paint
and Diſguiſe; ſo theſe Debauchees do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeek the moſt induſtriouſly the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Vertue. It is for this Reaſon they
live with ſo much conſtraint; and that there
is nothing equal or natural in their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that they appear this day inſolent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their humour, and to morrow
carry themſelves modeſtly according to their
Diſſimulation and Hypocriſie. They who ſay
the Vicious reſemble the <hi>Syrens,</hi> perhaps do
not know all the Myſtery of this Compariſon.
One of theſe Monſters was named <hi>Parthenope,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>Virgin;</hi> having a ſmiling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to allure Mariners withal, and make
them ſplit upon thoſe Rocks that were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Water. The moſt Immodeſt
will ſometimes endeavour to appear the moſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61440:105"/>
Chaſt, but with all their Diſguiſe they are but
infamous Gulphs where none but the Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and the Deſperate make Shipwrack.</p>
            <p>They make a ſhow of Candour and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Freedom, to the end they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deceive thoſe who are ſimple enough to
believe they do thoſe things only out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
or very innocently, which they really
do with Deſign to catch ſome Fool or other
thereby. They do nevertheleſs even herein
acknowledge the worth of Vertue, ſince
they borrow the Appearance of that for the
putting off their Vice. But herein their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
ſucceeds ill, whatever addreſs they have,
their Artifice renders them ſuſpected: And as
we know that is counterfeit Gold which bears
too bright a Colour; ſo we may diſcover
their diſguiſed Vertue, by it's making too
great a ſhow. After all, the true Chaſtity
does not ſeek ſo much to ſet off it ſelf as that
which is feigned; the Caution and Reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of an honeſt Woman is very different
from that of her who is not ſo; the one is
plain and natural, the other is conſtrain'd.</p>
            <p>But to ſay the truth, it is not in this, that
the Debauched ſeem to me moſt blameable; as
yet they give ſome Honour to Vertue, when
they take pains to counterfeit it. It ſeems
that their Artifice is an effect of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
and that as the homely, in uſing paint,
do own the Defects of their Faces; ſo the
vicious, while they diſſemble their Crime,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61440:106"/>
have ſtill ſome horrour at it, not being able
to endure that it ſhould appear quite naked.
But there are ſome Impudent Creatures who
boaſt of their Filthineſs, and make their Sin
publickly appear; who love not the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of any but thoſe that are moſt licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
and who entertain themſelves always
with the moſt ſhameful Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER ſome ſay to excuſe this
Liberty, I muſt needs think that 'tis neither
Genteelneſs nor good humour that gives ſuch an
Eaſineſs; that Complaiſance does not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
hitherto; and that it is impoſſible any
ſhould live in ſuch Looſneſs, without Offence
to Modeſty. Shamefac'dneſs is always ſevere
when 'tis entire and true; it is corrupted
when it becomes ſoftned. If the Widow of
<hi>Sigiſmond</hi> had been the moſt chaſt of all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
yet had ſhe not put a Slur upon her
Vertue, when ſhe anſwer'd to them who
counſell'd her not to marry again; That if
ſhe were to take an Example from any of the
Birds, ſhe ſhould rather chuſe to imitate the
Sparrows than the Turtles? Though ſhe
had been never ſo innocent, this bold Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
would have made her accounted guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If there was no wickedneſs in it; yet at
leaſt there was Impudence. But that I may
diſſemble nothing in this matter; it muſt be
ſaid that the true Modeſty will not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
a Woman from ſpeaking what is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
but even from hearing, and giving her
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61440:106"/>
ſelf leave to underſtand it. After <hi>Helen</hi> had
opened the Letter which was ſent her by <hi>Paris,</hi>
ſhe thought her ſelf bound to refuſe him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
When they have granted ſome Favour
they engage themſelves afterwards to do more
than they intended. They who have indeed
no Deſire to be conquer'd, ought to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at firſt all Hopes from thoſe that aſſault
them; for fear leſt they ſhould take a gentle
Refuſal for a diſguis'd Permiſſion.</p>
            <p>THE DEBAUCHED are not only
Impudent, but alſo Slanderers; perſwading
themſelves by a falſe Politick, that they have
juſtified their Sin if they can make it be thought
univerſal. What Errour, what Blindneſs is
here! If they ſlander the moſt Vertuous, they
alſo hate thoſe that are like themſelves: So
that the Conformity which produces Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in all other Profeſſions, breeds nothing
but Hatred among theſe. Is not this to be at
Variance with all ſorts of Perſons; when the
Preſence of the Vertuous ſeems to reproach
them with their Crimes, and the Company
of thoſe that are like them, does ſomething
diminiſh their Divertiſement?</p>
            <p>Laſtly they add Cruelty to Impudence and
Slander. And that we may not engage in an
impoſſible Task in undertaking to reckon up
all the ill that is in ſuch Perſons; it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to ſay that we muſt reckon up all that
there is of Wickedneſs and Crime in the
whole World, to expreſs all that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61440:107"/>
theſe abject Creatures. The Salvation
of theſe hardned Wretches is almoſt deſperate,
their Repentance ought to be placed in the
rank of Miracles; and whatever purpoſes they
make of Converſion, they always relapſe into
the ſame Hell. It ought not to be a Wonder
if they have ſometimes in this World as
much of Proſperity as of Sin; and if they
are as happy as they are guilty, it is becauſe
the Righteous God deferrs their Puniſhment,
to render it the more extream: He is not
willing that they ſhould encroach at all in this
Life upon the Puniſhments which he prepares
for them in the other.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, that in this Age, as well as
in that of <hi>Phryne,</hi> there may be found too
many fair Debauchees. But if we could
well conſider a great many of theſe infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Sinners, and had compar'd the Lines
of their Faces with thoſe in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
we ſhould often enough find in them
an equal Deformity. They do not think
what muſt needs be the ugly Horrour of their
filthy old Age; ſince many of them have given
their Nurſes ſome fear almoſt from the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
They do not conſider that the wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
make a reckoning of the Years upon
their Faces, as the figures do of the Hours
upon a Dial. If one had painted the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
of theſe wretches to the life, and
any could perſwade themſelves that the
Devils do reſemble them, I believe the more
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61440:107"/>
among Mankind would take care not to damn
themſelves, and that this frightful Object would
beget in Men a greater fear of Hell than the
ſevereſt Preachers are able to do.</p>
            <p>But that I may be as ſhort as obſcure in
a matter ſo unpleaſing, I ſhall finiſh the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Debauchee after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as <hi>Appelles</hi> did one of his Pictures. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this admirable Limner had conſidered,
with abundance of Pleaſure, the Features

he was ſo in Love that he was not
able to finiſh the Copy of ſo lovely an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
I do that out of Hatred which he
did out of Love, and I find ſo many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Lines in the Pourtraicture of theſe
Infamous Wretches, that the Pencil falls out
of my Hand; having too much Anger, and
too few Reproaches, to finiſh this Peice with
Colours that are black enough.</p>

live in no fear of being deceived, as there
are that expect to be ſo. If the Goods of
Fortune and of the Body yield to thoſe of
the Mind, then alſo is the loſs of theſe
the moſt ſenſible: and when any rob us of
thoſe Affections in another which we were
poſſeſs'd of, and think we merit by our own,
they take from us the greateſt Good. And,
to ſay truth, that we may Philoſophize
rightly, we muſt ſay, Love is like an Empire
or Kingdom Ruled by two Perſons only,
where the Dominion cannot be extended
further without detroying it; and where
Obedience and Sovereignty are reciprocal.
It is a Niggard that can be willing to loſe
nothing, not ſo much as a glance of the
Eye or a little Hair of the Head.</p>
            <p>In truth it is no leſs fooliſh to believe
that there is no longer any Love in the
Mind of one that is jealous, than it would
be to think that a Man has no Life in him
when he complains he is ſick. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as the grief and the ſenſe of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are not found in thoſe that are Dead,
ſo Jealouſie can never be met with where
there is really a Hatred and Indifference.
And it may well be that this Paſſion may
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61440:108"/>
have an appearance of Reaſon for it, ſince
God himſelf heretofore permitted to the
Husbands a tryal of the faithfulneſs of their
Wives with the Water which was call'd
the Water of Jealouſie or Probation. If
the ſuſpicion of this ſort had been a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
and unjuſt, God had forbidden it
directly, inſtead of appointing ſo ſolemn a
remedy for the cure of it, and had teſtified a
Hatred rather than a Compaſſion for this
Malady.</p>
            <p>Alſo they deceive themſelves groſly who
think they have rendered Jealouſie altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Criminal, when they have ſaid, That it
makes us have too bad an Opinion of our
own Merit, or of the Fidelity of the Perſon
whom we love. If we examine well this
Paſſion, we ſhall not find that it comes often
from a diſtruſt of our ſelves, and that we
do not ceaſe for that to believe our ſelves
Amiable or others Amorous. It is a fear that
does not ſo much diſcover our weakneſs, as
it does declare that the Merit of what we
love may make it ſought after. And what
do any in this which is not done by all
for a Treaſure or any other valuable thing,
which it is not poſſible for us to love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having ſome fear of loſing it? As
they that believe very firmly may receive
ſomething of doubt, ſo the moſt aſſured in
love are capable of ſome ſuſpicion. The
ſtrongeſt Trees are moved with the Winds,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61440:109"/>
though the Roots are faſt, when the Branches
and the Leaves are ſhaken.</p>
            <p>One would perhaps be very willing to
throw off an ill Opinion, but the likeneſſes
and conjectures ſollicit and ſhake us till we
are forced to conclude rather on the ſide of
fear than aſſurance. During this irreſolution
the Mind ſuffers much, and the appearances
give a great deal of pain, when we cannot
certainly judge whether they be true or falſe.
There are good and bad Examples, either
to make fear or to cure it: but ordinarily
we fix our Thoughts more upon thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that perſecute than on thoſe that
may comfort us. Such an one as that of
<hi>Penelope</hi> affords comfort, when one repreſents
to himſelf that ſhe was twenty five Years
faithful, during the Abſence of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſo
long. But that of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> torments and
awakens ſuſpicion, when one thinks of her
Infamy and Filthineſs. Our Spirit wavers
between both ſides: and it is an unhappineſs
that conjectures having alarm'd us, we find
or we invent, by much examining, ſomething
to change our doubt into a belief.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſaid that we ought to be at
reſt, after the experience that we have made
of a Perſon who has teſtified her Affection
by many effects: It ſeems to me that theſe
Proofs cannot hinder but that we ſhall have
a great deal of Trouble, becauſe the fear
that ſometimes is not in our power, will put
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61440:109"/>
the worſt Interpretation upon the leaſt
appearances, even to the buſying it ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
with falſe Objects when it has not
true ones. Whatever Fidelity we have
proved, when Love has no more to deſire,
it begins to fear all. This is the natural
courſe of our Paſſions which always threaten
a change when they are extream; and which
fall of themſelves, without a true cauſe to
do ſo, only becauſe they are mutable and
humane. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has given us a Maxim
to be obſerved, That our Bodies are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a Diſeaſe when they have too much
health and ſtrength: A Poet has made an
handſomer one concerning the alteration of
thoſe Minds that have too violent an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
The Will, ſays he, deſerves a
Wheel of Inconſtancy for its Paſſions, as well
as Fortune does for her Favours: when we
are raiſed to the top we cannot long ſtay
there, either out of our infelicity or our
weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are arrived at the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree of Love, are like them that
ſtand upon a very high building or hill;
their Brain is confuſed, and though no Perſon
thruſts them, they ſtagger and even fall of
themſelves through the meer fear of falling.
When the Sun is arrived at the heighth of Noon
he begins to go downward; for that not
being able to get above that pitch, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
and withdraws himſelf into another
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61440:110"/>
Hemiſphere without being driven by any
Perſon to it. Our Minds ſeem to have the ſame
Motions; a diſguſt follows the pleaſure by
an order no leſs natural than that which
makes the Night ſucceed and take place of
the Day. We find our ſelves inſenſibly weary'd
with pleaſant things; and though the Soul be
Immortal in its Nature, yet in its Actions,
which have the Body and Animal Spirits for
their Inſtruments, it fails not to teſtifie a Youth
or Old Age with the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, That the Gods had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to mingle together Pleaſure and
Pain; but when they found this could not
be done, at leaſt they would needs faſten
them by their Tails, to the end that one might
ſucceed the other, ſo to hinder in us both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
and Deſpair. This comes to paſs
ſometimes when we contribute nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it voluntarily; and as we paſs from
Joy to Sadneſs, ſo we often perceive that
our Love changes it ſelf either into cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or indifference. The Diſtempers of the
Mind, as well as thoſe of the Body, do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often form themſelves without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
we loſe the Reſt of the Soul as we do
our Health, all at once; ſometimes without
having foreſeen this change, and without
being able to find either the Cauſe or the
Remedy of this Paſſion, any more than we can
that of a Quartan Ague.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61440:110"/>
BUT I HAVE too long ſpoken againſt
my own ſentiment as well as againſt truth
it ſelf, in favour of a Paſſion that ruins our
Love, our Reputation, and the Quiet of the
Mind; Reaſon begets Love, and Love Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie:
but both the one and the other of
theſe prove what ſome, ſorts of Worms are
to the Subject in which they are bred, that
is, the Deſtruction of it. The one kills the
Father, the other the Mother. Let this
Paſſion be moderated as it can be, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dangerous; and for this it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to to commit an Injuſtice, in taking
away the uſe of it for the ſake of the
abuſe, becauſe the one is too much faſtened
to the other. As there is not any Serpent ſo
little but it has ſome Poiſon, ſo there is no
Jealouſie ſo well regulated, as not to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a great deal of Miſchief. They that
compare it to the Ivy have made a handſome
Compariſon; for ordinarily that grows only
upon old and ruinous Buildings: in like
manner this Paſſion chuſes out of all the reſt
of Mankind the moſt abſurd and ill-natur'd
Spirits. We may ſee the Ivy flouriſhing
and green upon a Tree that is withered
and dry; and by ſo much the more old a
Man grows, by ſo much does this Paſſion grow
more vigorous and young; ſo that it becomes
more ſtrong in thoſe whom Age or want of
Wit render more feeble or ſtupid. Other
Plants have their Roots only at the foot of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61440:111"/>
them, the Ivy has roots every where, and
even more than Leaves; Jealouſie alſo roots
its ſelf more every day, and renders it ſelf
more inſeparable from the Soul than the
Ivy is from the Trees or Walls that it
grows to.</p>
            <p>They are none but the indifferent ſort of
Wits that are capable of this Contagion
the excellent are above and the very ſmall
ones below it. Theſe latter are ignorant of
the occaſions for it and obſerve them not,
the former ſurmount and deſpiſe them. It
is in this that Stupidity attains the ſame pitch
with Wiſdom, and the Ruſticks are as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as the Philoſophers. On the other ſide,
they that afflict themſelves for a misfortune
which has no remedy but Patience, make
their errour the entertainment of the World,
and are Lunatick, having the Moon whole
in their Heads, while they think they have the
horned half of it on their Foreheads. This
is not to have a great Spirit to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
ones ſelf without obliging any body,
and to damn ones ſelf in this World that
we might be ſure not to miſs of it. If the
diſtruſt of the Jealous be known, it increaſes
the evil inſtead of bringing a remedy to it;
if it be not known, it is ſuperfluous to them.
And 'tis an evil which when it is hid,
ſilence and modeſty render it more inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61440:111"/>
I do not wonder at all if the Jealous
are very meager, their Paſſion feeds its ſelf
only with Shadows and Phantaſms. The good
Wits knows how to reſtrain their Curioſity,
while the indifferent ones give it an entire
liberty, to learn that which it ought not
to know; not minding that in the Trade
of the World the moſt exact Perſons have
not always the beſt ſatisfaction in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
If we had well regulated our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we ſhould have ſubjected many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Melancholy and Muſing maintain
Jealouſie, divertiſement and forgetfulneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it: the Spirit tires it ſelf as well as the
Eye when 'tis faſtened too long to one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
In ſuch caſes as this, we muſt gain our
Victory as the <hi>Parthians</hi> did theirs, that is by
flying; and muſt divert the thoughts rather
than too obſtinately fix them. It is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
whoſe Weapons are poiſoned, and to
approach us is enough for it to conquer us.
After that the memory has received it, the
reaſon comes too late to make a reſiſtance:
It may be hindred from entring, but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes out till it has ruined them that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cydippus</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> having taken
a great deal of Pleaſure in ſeeing a Combat
of Bulls, he muſed ſo much upon it all night,
that in the morning he aroſe with Horns
upon his Forehead. This Spectacle had
pleaſed him, it had entertain'd his phancy,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61440:112"/>
and at laſt his Imagination did him this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
office. It is after this faſhion that many
diſorder their own Heads, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that their reſtleſneſs or their curioſity is
always hurtful to them. For if they learn
that their ſuſpicions were falſe, they would
be obliged to repent of them; if they find
them to be true, they become miſerable by
having been too curious. They that ſay
the ſin of the Angels was Jealouſie or
Envy, ſeem, in part, to juſtifie thoſe that
entertain this Paſſion, in that the Angels
were capable of this, with all their light,
which far ſurpaſſes the darkneſs of our
Minds. But we may alſo learn by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that it was this which made Hell,
and which daily renders Men miſerable in
the midſt of Pleaſures, even to the making
Lovers loſe their Paradiſe, if ſo imaginary
contentments can yield one.</p>
            <p>There is not a Wickedneſs ſo black but this
Paſſion renders us capable to commit it, while
it gives addreſs to the moſt Clowniſh, and
debauches the Vertuous under pretence of
having ſatisfaction for an Injury. <hi>Circe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jealous of <hi>Scylla,</hi> and fearing that <hi>Glaucus</hi>
was in love with her, poiſon'd the Waters
where ſhe was wont to bathe her ſelf, that ſhe
might turn the Beauteous Nymph into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Monſter. Murther, Poiſon, and
Magick are but Sports to it, and it has no
other bounds in its Inventions and its Crimes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61440:112"/>
than Impoſſibility. It is a ſtrange thing that
thoſe Women who ſpend their time in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
themſelves, cannot forbear to be
jealous of their Husbands, and violate the Law
of Nature as well as the Law of God, in
that they will not endure to receive the ſame
uſage that they give. They are very often De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
themſelves; for they practiſe what
they fear others guilty of, and their fear
ariſes from their experience. The jealous
Minds never own their Error but when it is
paſt remedy. All the World knew the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
that <hi>Herod</hi> had of <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and the
occaſion of them was nothing elſe but that ſhe
was beautiful; having no other ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
her guilty, but only that he thought her
worthy to be ſought after. But what Fury
and what Rage was there in this! When he
had put to death this Innocent Lady, he would
call to her as if ſhe were not dead, and
thought to find her in his Palace who was
convey'd to her Tomb: This Tyrant might
well commit ſuch a Crime every Month,
ſince he could forget them ſo ſoon, and had
a Memory as ſhort as his Judgment. Jealouſie
does carry us away from our ſelves; we have
ſome reaſon then to diſown the effects of it
when we are recover'd, and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Malice and Extravagance of it. We
oftentimes, after his example, oblige the
Perſons whom we love to die with grief by
our ſuſpicions, and then afterwards we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61440:113"/>
this unprofitably; we give them Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by our Repentance, but cannot reſtore
the Life which their Melancholy has taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
we condemn our blindneſs too late to
juſtifie their Innocence. The reports of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
render'd <hi>Procris</hi> jealous of her Husband
<hi>Cephalus;</hi> ſhe imagined he had a Miſtreſs
whom he went to meet in the Woods, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going to hunt there: ſhe hid her
ſelf behind a Thicket to hear his Diſcourſe
when he ſhould reſt himſelf in the ſhade, and
to diſcover the Object of his Meditations: he
heard the noiſe of her, and believing it was ſome
wild Beaſt he drove an Arrow into her heart
and kill'd her, crying out <hi>Cephalus.</hi> This word
made him underſtand that he had taken his
Wife for a Beaſt, and it may be he was not much
deceived: It is want of Wit to give Credit
ſo lightly to ſmall appearances, and to find
bad Interpretations for good things. An
honeſt Liberty is of more value than ſuch a
Conſtraint; Liberty extinguiſhes the Fire that
Reſtraint kindles. When the occaſions to
tranſgreſs are common, they will be deſpiſed:
but when they are ſcarce, they will be eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid hold on out of fear that they will not
return with ſo much advantage.</p>
            <p>IN ALL CASES, how extream ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a Jealouſie may be, I think the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Vulcan</hi> may ſerve for a remedy to
it. When he was Jealous of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
he laid Nets to catch them in the ſight
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61440:113"/>
of all the Gods; but what did he get at laſt
by his Curioſity and Cunning, but only to be
declar'd infamous with the more ſolemnity,
and to be caſt out of Heaven, and break a
Log with the fall?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs that none may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this matter, I deſire they would take
notice of this Diſtinction; That Jealouſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
Love, Envy the goods of Fortune, and
tis Emulation that follows Vertue. The
goods of Fortune are too groſs, thoſe of
Love are too ſlight for our Minds, there
are only thoſe of Vertue that can deſerve to
be the Object of it. It is only in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of this that Competitors can endure one
another, as well as many may agree to ſerve
themſelves of the Light of the Sun or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the Stars.</p>
            <p>Alſo we may ſee among the Ancients, that
the three Graces hold each other by the
Hand and are united in the Alliance of
Vertue, while the Goddeſſes are at ſtrife for
the Honour of excelling in Beauty, and the
Famous Triumvirate fell out about the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Univerſal Empire.</p>
            <p>And if we may add for this purpoſe any
thing of Chriſtianity to our Morals, that
we may find a remedy for the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of Jealouſie, let us obſerve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Bleſſed Virgin and her Husband
<hi>Joſeph;</hi> where we may find that the moſt
Chaſt of all Women yet gave ſome Jealouſie to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61440:114"/>
the moſt Honeſt and Sincere Man. There is
in this ſometimes more of Misfortune than
of Malice; and therefore thoſe that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be Jealous ſhould like him deſpiſe the
ſlight appearances of ground for it; and thoſe
that are wrong'd by Jealouſie ſhould like her
ſuffer patiently the ſuſpicions of it. It would
be no ſmall Conſolation to think, that after
all the Proofs, and all the Witneſſes that might
conſtrain us to judge ill: it is better in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
to believe a Miracle than a Sin, and to
own the Power of God than the weakneſs of a
Creature.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Friendſhip, and the Love of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and that of Election.</head>
            <p>SINCE there is no Pleaſure in Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Friendſhip; and the greateſt Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is tedious, and the leaſt Affliction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this is inſupportable; it is not fit I ſhould
forget this Divine Quality of Amity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Ladies have, at all times, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
themſelves. It is not reaſonable
that I ſhould paſs by this lovely Vertue, to
which they have even erected Altars among
the moſt Barbarous Heathen Nations, and
which exerciſes an Empire moſt abſolute over
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61440:114"/>
the Hearts of Men, in all places where there is
any Senſe or Knowledge of it. There is then
no need of long Proofs to make it appear, that
Love and Amity are neceſſary to the World:
It is of more importance to ſhow how it is
dangerous. It is more profitable to ſhow
the Uſe than the Worth of it. Moſt certainly
if any know not how to diſtinguiſh well what
is worthy of their Love, they muſt be very
unhappy; for the imprudent and ill-placed
Affections ordinarily prove a cauſe of the
greateſt evils that afflict our Lives. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of Love is truly a ſource of Miſery if not
well directed, as well as it is of Felicity if it
be ſo. For this reaſon we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our Love and Amity from the very
birth of it, ſince all the Paſſions and all the
Motions of the Soul depend on this. For as
heretofore among the <hi>Romans</hi> when they had
choſen a <hi>Dictator,</hi> they did at the ſame time
depoſe all thoſe that had any other Office,
to the end that a new Lord might be attended
with new Officers; ſo alſo when we change
our Love all the other Paſſions change their
nature; they all follow this firſt mover. If
we hope or if we fear ſtill, yet it is not
for the ſame end, as it is not for the ſame
Object. And in truth, when I think with my
ſelf that this Paſſion not only gives motion to
all the reſt, but alſo that it conſtrains us to
eſpouſe the qualities of thoſe whom we love;
and above all, that it never ends but as it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61440:115"/>
were with Life: I declare that it is in this
more than in any other concern, that our
choice is of great importance, and that we
know not how to employ too much care and
prudence to examine well whether that which
at firſt we eſteem worthy of our Love, does
not indeed deſerve our hatred and averſion.
This choice is not leſs difficult than neceſſary.
But ſince they commonly ſay that Love has
two Eyes, that of Inclination, and that of
Election; I think that, to ſpeak of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
with ſome method, it will be convenient
to ſhow with which of theſe it may ſee moſt
clearly that which is Amiable.</p>
            <p>AND TO BEGIN with the Love of
Inclination which many eſteem the beſt.
What the Poets ſaid of <hi>Achilles</hi> may give us a
great light into it: For as we learn from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that this great Captain had but one
place in all his Body that was capable of
receiving a Wound, and that every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
neither Dart nor Arrow could injure
him: In like manner it ſeems to me, that the
only part in which our Soul is moſt ſenſible is
that of Inclination; and that they who have
found out this fatal place, as <hi>Paris</hi> did the
Heel of <hi>Achilles,</hi> need only to touch that that
they may wound and conquer us. Without
finding this, let any render the beſt ſervices
they can, they will all be unprofitable to
them; or if they ſucceed ſometimes it is with
great difficulty and hazzard. One only look
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61440:115"/>
with Inclination has more effect than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this the devoirs of many Years can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
It is violent and yet conſtant; though it
is excited in a moment, yet it fails not to
endure a long time. It ſometimes finds in
one inſtant its birth and its perfection. It
was that which rendered <hi>Dido</hi> in Love with
<hi>Aeneas</hi> from the very firſt time that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him; ſhe begun to love as ſoon as ſhe
begun to know him: without taking any
notice that this was a ſtranger whom a
Tempeſt and not Love had caſt upon the
Coaſts of <hi>Carthage.</hi> It is true that reaſon
and conſideration at firſt, as it was with
this Queen, will endeavour ſometimes to
ſtifle thoſe Sentiments that the Inclination
gives birth to: But theſe are very uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
efforts, and we with difficulty reſiſt the
love that pleaſes: Reaſon it ſelf takes its
part, and becomes as complaiſant as was
the Siſter of that Princeſs; even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
and trying means to ſucceed in our
deſires. Inclination has no leſs of Skill and
Cunning than of Courage. It can Enchant
and Deceive even an <hi>Argits</hi> with his hundred
Eyes. It can give Wings to convey us from
a Labyrinth. There is nothing that it will
not endure, that it will not undertake. And
if it be ſaid we may ſee ſome that can ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
this, and make themſelves Maſters of
their Inclination, it muſt in truth be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that this is very rare; it muſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61440:116"/>
rather be believ'd that ſuch were never ſeiz'd
with this Malady, than that they are cured
of it. Whatever any feign, all that which
proceeds from our ſelves is very agreeable to
us; we yield our ſelves to be carried eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the Stream of it; we can refuſe it
nothing: and when this <hi>Eve</hi> preſents us with
even a forbidden Apple, yet to comply with
her, we forſake all our Intereſts. Neither
ſhould any wonder at this, ſince ſhe was taken
from our own Side, and is even a part of
our ſelves. Though ſhe ſometimes may ſeem to
us but evil; yet our Reaſon does not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
over her but with regret. When we go
about to combat this, we reſemble thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are conſtrained to make War
with their own Children, and who have
as much fear even to gain the Victory as to
loſe it. But in truth, what ground is there
that we ſhould be willing to hinder the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of our Inclination, when they are ſo
ſweet and ſo natural? What reaſon is there
why this ſhould be idly barren, and that ſo
pleaſant a cauſe ſhould produce nothing? Can
there be a better Amity or Love than that
which comes from thence? Can there be a
more faithful or more conſtant one? It is
as pleaſing as it is ſtrong; it has no leſs ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than duration. We take no more pains
to love an Object that Inclination carries us
to, than a Stone does to fall towards its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the Fire to mount upwards towards its
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61440:116"/>
Sphere. If the Elements are neither heavy
nor light in their natural places, and there is
need of violence to draw them from thence;
ſo neither can we divert our ſelves but
with pain and trouble from the Object that
we love out of Inclination. It is here that
our affection finds its repoſe, and its moſt
pure delights. There is ſome reaſon to ſay,
That the Love which proceeds from Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
does reſemble the Fire that we have
here below, which has always a need of
nouriſhment, and which goes out if it be
not always affixed to ſome combuſtible
Matter; but on the other ſide, the love of
Inclination is like that above in the Sun, its
proper Element, which endures always equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and maintains its ſelf. This is the moſt
natural as it is alſo the moſt noble. This Love
is not mercenary at all, it does not nouriſh it
ſelf by any ſhameful pretentions; it propoſes
to it ſelf no other end but only Love. I do not
wonder at all if the Love of Conſideration
endures but a little while, and if it is ſtronger
while it hopes, than when it is in poſſeſſion;
ſince it faſtens upon us by Intereſt, and has
no other bond but that of Pleaſure or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
It holds us but by rotten Cords, which
need but a little misfortune or ſickneſs to break
them. And if we are to judge that Amity the
beſt which is able to endure the longeſt, we
ought to account that of Inclination the moſt
excellent, which as it is the moſt pure is alſo
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61440:117"/>
the moſt conſtant and laſting. There are
ſome nevertheleſs who think it enough to
diſparage this to ſay, That it proceeds from
the Love of our ſelves; but it ſeems to me that
this Argument makes much for its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
ſince one would conclude from thence,
That 'tis almoſt as impoſſible to ſeparate
us from that we love with Inclination, as to
ſeparate us from our ſelves: and at leaſt, that
it will continue a long time if it comes from
ſuch a ſource. And if it be ſaid, That we
may alſo judge hereon, that this Love is blind
as that commonly is which we bear to our
ſelves: In truth I muſt return, That I am not
able to ſee how this Opinion can maintain it
ſelf; I cannot comprehend why ſo many will
have it, that Inclination is blind: We believe
it has not Eyes becauſe we do not ſee them;
and if ſometimes we cannot diſcover the
cauſes of it, we chuſe rather to ſay it has
none, than to own that they are unknown to
us. It is true, we cannot ſo well judge of the
reſemblance of Humours as of that of Faces.
But nevertheleſs, if any would give themſelves
the trouble to ſearch well into the Original of
our Inclination, they would often find it: If
they would give themſelves leiſure to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſe
a little upon the Perfections of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that pleaſes us, they would infallibly find
out wherein it is amiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61440:117"/>
It is from this Inclination it comes to paſs
many times, that of many who look upon a
beautiful Face, there ſhall not be, it may be,
more than one of them that has any lively
feeling of its Charms: and thoſe that deſerve
beſt find oftentimes more admirers than Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
We do not love all that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend:
the Will does not always take the part
of Reaſon: and we give ſometimes our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
to a thing when we deny our
Love to it. Many may have the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but it is not ſo eaſie that they ſhould
have the ſame Inclination: and though I grant
that ſeveral Perſons may love the ſame
thing, yet this ſeldom comes to paſs by the
ſame Reaſon. As we have not an Appetite for
all ſorts of Meats, not even thoſe that we
may judge to be good: ſo we cannot have
Inclination for all ſorts of Perſons, not even
for thoſe ſometimes whom we judge to have
a great deal of Merit. As there are divers
reliſhes in the ſenſe, ſo there are different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
in the Soul.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould we not follow Inclination in
Love, when we follow it almoſt in all other
things? In the chuſing an Office, in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Trade, or in the ſtudying of a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we have regard to the Humour and
Temperament. Why then may we not do
this as much in our love which is the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
thing in the World? And in truth,
if we examine our Nature and Complexion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61440:118"/>
before we addict our ſelves to Learning or
any other Exerciſe? Why ſhall we not alſo
ſeek for a Diſpoſition to love as well as to
ſtudy; ſince there is nothing more true than
that as we cannot ſucceed in the Arts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of our Nature; ſo neither can we any
better ſucceed in an Amity when it is againſt
our Inclination. It muſt be acknowledg'd,
that as the ſame Earth is not proper for all
ſorts of Seeds; ſo the ſame Heart is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all ſorts of Affections. It ought not
to be a Wonder if we have Inclination for
one thing and not for another, any more than
to ſee the Load-ſtone draw the Iron rather
than Copper or Lead. And if we have a
Love that is a little contrary to our humour,
how do we entertain an eternal Sedition
within our ſelves? We cannot be happy but
by halves; our Inclination is upon the rack
while our Reaſon is ſatisfied. It is true that
is ſaid of Love, that without Inclination it
cannot long ſubſiſt: Without this an Amity
has not an entire Satisfaction, nor even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
It is a Building without Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which needs but a Touch or Blaſt to
throw it down. But to finiſh this Argument
with the ſtrongeſt Proof of all. Since Love
ceaſes to live when it ceaſes to reign, and that
it cannot divide its Power without loſing it:
That we may ſufficiently prove the Love of
Inclination to be the moſt Sovereign and the
moſt Legitimate, it is enough to ſhow that it is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61440:118"/>
the moſt ſingle, and that it will never permit
that we ſhould love more than one thing. As
we can have but one Sympathy, we cannot love
perfectly more than one Object. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as we can ſeek our Intereſt in ſeveral
Perſons, when we find it not in one alone; ſo
this Love of Conſideration may be divided;
it may ſeek what is profitable in one, and what
is agreeable and pleaſing in another. After all,
if Conſideration and Inclination were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
before a Wiſe Judge, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to which of the two Love does moſt
lawfully belong, as heretofore the two Mothers
pleaded before <hi>Solomon</hi> for the living Child, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
would at length have the advantage:
He would give Love to that, ſince it can endure
no Diviſion of it, as the other can, and becauſe
it will poſſeſs it or loſe it entirely.</p>
            <p>AFTER WE have ſeen the Reaſons
which are given to prove that Inclination is
the more ſtrong in Amity; it is time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
thoſe which may be brought to ſhow
that Election is the more aſſured and ſafe in
ſuch an important Concern. It ſhall then
ſuffice, at the firſt, to make it appear how
much Inclination is dangerous, to ſhew how
blind it is. For as the Dawn precedes the
riſing of the Sun; ſo Knowledge ought to
go before Love; and however Sympathy does
act without Choice and Light, yet that
which it does in a Moment, cauſes oftentimes
the repentance of the whole Life. Election
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61440:119"/>
is not ſo forward nor ready, 'tis true, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
it is not ſo unfortunate. And I think
<hi>Zeuxis</hi> return'd a very prudent Anſwer to
thoſe that reproach'd him, for that he was
long in finiſhing his Pieces: I, ſays he, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a long time in drawing a Picture, becauſe
what I draw is to endure a long time. One may
ſay for a firm Affection that which he ſaid for
an excellent Picture: It is neceſſary that a long
Experience ſhould precede a true Amity, for
fear leſt a long Regret ſhould follow an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too lightly made. This of Sympathy
is an Agreement very ſuddenly made; it
often obliges it ſelf without knowing to what
Conditions; and commonly ſigns without
having look'd upon the Articles. The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Dido</hi> alone ſufficiently ſhews the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Effects of this Lightneſs: The Poet had
reaſon to ſay that her Love was blind, and
that it conſiſted of a Fire that had more heat
than brightneſs. And in truth I find in this
Fable, the Infelicity as well as the Blindneſs
of this Love. If <hi>Dido</hi> had an Inclination,
<hi>Aeneas</hi> had none at all; as ſhe was impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
he was ungrateful. Hiſtory and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
afford us Examples enough of this ſort;
and when I make uſe of Fable I do this for
Ornament to my Diſcourſe, not to give it
greater Strength. But to ſay truth; is not
this a very weak Reaſon to perſwade a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to love me, to ſay that I have a great
Inclination for her? The ſame Argument I
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61440:119"/>
bring to perſwade Love, may ſerve her for
the refuſal of giving it. If I ſay I follow my
Inclination in loving ſuch a Perſon, may not
ſhe ſay ſhe follows hers in not loving me? Is
not her Averſion as well founded as my Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy?
If I wiſh that ſhe would renounce
her Humour to ſatisfie mine; has not ſhe
right to pretend to the ſame advantage over
me? In truth, I extreamly love what the
Poets ſay of this matter. They feign that
<hi>Cupid</hi> has two ſorts of Arrows; the one of
Gold, the other of Lead; the former gives
Love, the latter Hatred: With the one he
inflam'd <hi>Apollo,</hi> with the other he chill'd
<hi>Daphne.</hi> Was not the Flight of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
altogether as juſt as the Purſuit of
the God? If he ſought her becauſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to her; ſhe ſhunn'd him becauſe ſhe
had an Averſion to him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what Aſſurance have we, that any
have an Inclination for us; what Marks that
are ſufficiently certain can any give whereby
to know it? It is true, that we may well
perceive our own; but whereby can we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
obſerve that of others? This can
only, if at all, be done by the means of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which ought to examine, whether that
which we take at firſt for true, be not an
Illuſion or Fiction. And to ſpeak rationally
of this thing, when the Inclination ſurpriſes,
as ſometimes it does, our Reaſon, ſo as to
make us too eaſily fall in love with an Object.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61440:120"/>
Reaſon then is found like a Servant intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or corrupted that will engage her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
to her Diſadvantage: The Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
herein would often debauch the Spirit; they
are Servants that are traiterous or ignorant,
and bring falſe reports to their Maſter. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it not then a great deal better that we love
for the amiable Qualities that we ſee, than for
an Inclination that is hidden from us? Why
ſhould we entertain a Love for which we
know neither Cauſe nor good Reaſon? This
is, in truth, to love by chance; here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Uncertainty. There can never be
an intire Satisfaction in our Love, while we
ſhall be in pain to know whether the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
be equal on both ſides. We perceive
a Wound, without knowing the Hand that
ſtruck, and are enſlav'd by inviſible Chains. And
I aſſure my ſelf that if we would be curious
to examine well that which has arreſted us,
we ſhould ſoon acknowledge our Errour and
Imprudence. If we did but light up a Lamp
as <hi>Pſyche</hi> did, perhaps we ſhould find, with
her, that this Love is but a Child, who fears
to be ſeen, leſt we ſhould know and deſpiſe
his Weakneſs. It is a great unhappineſs
that we have ſome Difficulty to undeceive
our ſelves. Though the Sentiments which are
moſt natural are not the moſt reaſonable,
yet as the Earth cheriſhes beſt thoſe Weeds
that it brings forth of it ſelf, more than the
Plants that the Gardener ſows in it: So we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61440:120"/>
ſeem to entertain more carefully the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that come from our natural Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
than thoſe that proceed from our
Reaſon. Nevertheleſs we ought to conſider
that as the Phyſician corrects the Appetite to
make it reliſh what is wholeſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
So we ought alſo, if we will be wiſe,
to regulate our minds that we may direct
our Affections to right Objects. We muſt
of neceſſity treat our ſelves like ſick Perſons
in this caſe; there is nothing we ought ſo
much to forbid our ſelves as that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
us moſt; our Inclination is no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd
than their Taſte; it proceeds from a
poiſon'd Spring, it comes not from Nature
ſound and well; but from that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
I approve mightily the Opinion of
them who compare the Amity of Election
to the Sun, and the Love of Inclination to the
Moon; for the former is always equal, and
the latter is commonly unconſtant, full of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and of Spots. The Moon of her ſelf has
no Brightneſs; Inclination alone has no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
It has need to borrow that from Reaſon.
And above all, after the ſame manner as the
Moon appearing ſometimes with the Sun, does
not make the Day for all that, nor contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any aſſiſtance towards the Enlightening
of the World; ſo when by good Fortune the
Love of Inclination meets with that of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it ought not to govern us, or make it
ſelf our Maſter; but on the contrary, it ought
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61440:121"/>
to borrow all it's Light and Direction from
the other. But to improve this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
a little further, I could wiſh to this
purpoſe, that the Ladies would imitate Her
whom the Holy Spirit deſcribes in ſacred
Writ, as having the Moon under her Feet,
and being all over inviron'd, and as it were
cloathed with the Sun. I mean, that they
ought not utterly to throw away Inclination,
but to conquer and moderate it: that there
ſhould be in Love a little of Humour, and a great
deal of Prudence: That Amity has no need
of Inclination, but in its Birth; but has
need of Conſideration as long as it endures. If
it be neceſſary that the one be the Mother of
it, it is ſo too, that the other be the Nurſe and
Miſtreſs. And in truth, Inclination is like an
imprudent Mother, who loves her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
too well: They muſt be wreſted from
her Boſom as ſoon as they are brought forth,
for fear that in Careſſing and Embracing ſhe
ſhould ſtifle them.</p>
            <p>After all, this Inclination is nothing elſe
for the moſt part but a Phantaſm; the moſt
learned find it difficult to expreſs the Cauſe
or the Nature of it. It is ſo occult and
hidden, that many not being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Love that it gives Birth to, they
ſay, it is they know not what, which forms
it ſelf, they know not how; and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
by they know not what ſort of Charms.
There are ſome that teach, upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61440:121"/>
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy, That Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
comes from Remembrance, and that our
Souls, having view'd each other in another
World before, it ſeems that this is not the
beginning of a Love, but the continuance of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. That this is not properly the Birth
of an Affection but the awakening of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that, according to their Opinion, our
Souls call to mind their former Alliance; no
otherwiſe than as two perſons that have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
lov'd heretofore; when they ſee each
other again after a long Separation, they are
ſurprized at firſt ſight; while the Imagination
and Memory are at labour to diſcover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
thoſe that touch them. There are
ſome others that attribute an Inclination to
the Stars; and who will have it, that the
ſame Cauſe which produces Flowers in the
Boſom of the Earth, produces alſo the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
that is in our Souls. Some again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it to the four Qualities that they fanſie
are mingled in us; namely, Heat and Cold,
Dryneſs and Moiſture. And others make
ſhort Work of it, and aſcribe it to Deſtiny. But
that I may not trouble my ſelf or the Reader
with the Opinions of all thoſe that deceive
themſelves, and who ſeek the Original of the
Inclination there where it is not; it ſeems to
me (that we may philoſophize rightly) to
proceed only from the Love of our ſelves.
We love all that which reſembles us, even to
our Pictures; we cheriſh our Image in all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61440:122"/>
things where we ſee it. We love all that
which comes from us: Fathers, for theſe
reaſons, love their Children; Painters their
Draughts; Artificers their Work. It is from
hence, that we may learn the great danger
there is where the Love of Inclination engages
us; for ſince we very often love our ſelves
on that ſide where we are moſt Imperfect,
and we embrace even our very ſhadow like
<hi>Narciſſus:</hi> It follows from thence, that we
are in danger to love the Imperfections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
if it happens that they reſemble our
own. If the love of our ſelves be blind, that
of Inclination is ſo likewiſe; this is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that muſt carry the reſemblance of its
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But if this Love of Inclination were not ſo
dangerous, and ſo full of darkneſs; what
need is there of this Sympathy, or natural
Conformity? And why may not Love place it
there where it was not? Love as well as
Death equals all things, and <hi>makes</hi> a likeneſs
where it does not <hi>find</hi> it. In loving as well as
dying, both Kings and Shepherds find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at the ſame point. Herein they are both
Men equal, in reſpect of Affection and of
Weakneſs. Love is like a Fire which can
kindle another any where: It does not only
tranſmit it ſelf into the ſubject it burns, but
alſo has power to diſpoſe that to receive it: It
removes the qualities contrary to its own, to
put in others: It drives the Enemy from the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61440:122"/>
place it lays Siege to, before it does render it
ſelf Maſter of it. And to ſay the truth, as
there are hidden Forms in the Boſom of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which natural Agents are able to excite and
produce; ſo there are hidden Inclinations in
our Souls, which Converſation and Familiarity
may give birth to. There needs no more but
to ſeek well after them, and if we find them
not at firſt, yet a little time uſually produces
them. How often do we ſee ſome Perſons
that diſtaſt us at the firſt, and who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
after a little Converſation, do highly
pleaſe us? And others again who raviſh us
at the firſt ſight, and afterwards diſpleaſe us
as much? Love may ſucceed to Averſion, as
well as Averſion to Love. Experience ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſhows this; and as thoſe Trees that
are of different kinds being well grafted, do
not fail to bring forth Fruit; ſo the Amity
that is formed between two Perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Humours may not fail to ſucceed well.
<hi>Plato</hi> had ſome reaſon to ſay, That Love is a
Teacher of Muſick; for as much as an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
may breed as well in an inequality
of Humours as a harmony may be made up
of unequal Voices. And indeed what ſort
of Conformity can we find between the young
and the old, who yet nevertheleſs do often
mutually Love and Careſs each other? What
proportion or likeneſs is there between the
Loadſtone and the Iron? If the one drew the
other out of Sympathy and Reſemblance,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61440:123"/>
would not Iron be rather attracted by Iron
than by the Stone, to which it has a great deal
leſs likeneſs?</p>
            <p>But to the end that we may the better ſee
how ſhameful and unjuſt this Love of Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, it is enough to conſider that they
who love us only out of Inclination, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
us: they do not love us at all for any
Merit in us, ſince very often they love before
they know us, and become amorous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can well know whether we are
amiable or not. This is an effect of their
Temper rather than Choice, and in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
we have no great Obligation to
them for the doing that which they cannot
hinder.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſhown what there is of
Good on of Evil in theſe two ſorts of Amities,
it will be very eaſie to obſerve what will be
the beſt life of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not neceſſary to
divide, but only to regulate them: It is
true that theſe are to our Minds, like the two
fanſied Poles to the Heavens on which they
turn; theſe are the Poles of our Thoughts
and Actions. And as the one Pole of the
Heavens is under our Feet while the other is
elevated above our Heads; ſo it ſeems fit
that we have leſs regard to Inclination than
to Election, and this latter ought to ſerve
us for a Star to guide our Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by. They ſay the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> had
two Favourites whom he obliged after a very
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61440:123"/>
different faſhion; He lov'd <hi>Epheſtion</hi> tenderly
as the Companion of his Pleaſures, and <hi>Craterus</hi>
ſtrongly for the government of his Eſtate and
Affairs: As Emperour he eſteem'd the one, as
<hi>Alexander</hi> he lov'd the other. It is neceſſary
to join theſe two ſorts of Love together to
make a perfect one, leſt Love, being without
Inclination, be conſtrain'd, or being without
Election it be too Imprudent. If there be no
Conſideration, Love is without Conduct: If
there be no Sympathy in it, 'tis without much
Pleaſure and Sweetneſs. In truth it ſeems as
if theſe two Loves are in one Soul after the
ſame manner that thoſe two Twins, of whom
the Holy Scripture ſpeaks, were in the Womb of
their Mother. Theſe are two Brothers of which
the one is foremoſt in the Order of Nature,
but nevertheleſs he muſt not have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of this. The one is the more violent
and impetuous, the other is the more gentle
and prudent. And it is the unhappineſs of our
Minds, as it was of their dying Father, to
encline more to the ſide of that love which
is the more natural, and which proceeds
from Sympathy. But as the Mother of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
gave him means to ſupplant his Brother,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

After all, if any ſhould demand of me the
Rules that are moſt neceſſary to be obſerved
in our Amity; as well for the ſatisfaction
of the Conſcience as of the Mind; in my
Opinion there is no better than this; To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that our Affection is unjuſt whenever it
is contrary to that we owe to God. As the
Ark was between the Cherubims, ſo 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that God be preſent between two
Hearts that mutually love: This ought to
be the Knot of our Loves, that we may
render them ſtrong and reaſonable. And to
ſay, as that Reverend Biſhop who has writ
ſo Divinely on the Love of God; Love is
the more commendable on Earth, by ſo much
as it is the more like that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Wiſe and Pure Inhabitants of

            <p>IT IS TRUE that there is nothing

the means to ſucceed well in it, and to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61440:124"/>
gain the Affection and Eſteem of thoſe we
meet, when we are in Converſation or in
Buſineſs. It is true, that among all the
Qualities neceſſary to this, there is not one
that ſeems more requiſite than Complaiſance
or Courteouſneſs, ſince without that, all the
other are without Gracefulneſs and are as it
were dead. But it is alſo very certain, that
the Uſe of this is very difficult: Moſt eaſily
does this offend either in Exceſs or Defect.
If it be not attended with a great deal of
Judgment and Diſcretion, then the Ladies
that are too Complaiſant paſs for Looſe or
Affected: and if they are not enough ſo, they
ſhall be thought to be Diſdainful or Uncivil:
There is not leſs danger in receiving this, than
in giving it. Thoſe Ladies that <hi>render</hi> too much
Complaiſance, are liable to be troubleſome,
thoſe that <hi>receive</hi> too much are in danger to
be ſeduced. There are thoſe that will mingle
Flattery with Complaiſance, to bring them
into Error; as Wine is mingled with Poiſon
to draw down the deadly Draught. There
is therefore danger leſt many ſhould take the
Poiſon for Food, and leſt they drink the
Flattery while they think themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
only a ſimple Complaiſance. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the one of theſe is ſo ſtrictly join'd to
the other, that there is need of a great deal
of Prudence to be able to ſeparate them.
And that we may the better ſucceed in this,
it ſeems to me convenient to examine, in the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61440:125"/>
firſt place, what there is of Good or of Evil i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the Complaiſant Humour, to the end we
may learn, with the better method and the
greater facility, wherein the Uſe of this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
or forbidden to us.</p>
            <p>AS THE Complaiſance which I muſt
condemn is nothing elſe but the Art to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
pleaſantly, it muſt be acknowledg'd,
that the moſt pernicious of its Effects are
that it makes an appearance paſs for truth,
and a feigned Friendſhip for a true one.
Thoſe Spirits that are moſt diſſembled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
themſelves to appear Genuine and
Sincere, to the end they may gain the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of Confidents and Friends: But it is
herein, that their Artifice is diſcovered; and
it comes to be known that they have not that
Freedom and Ingenuity they pretend to, in
that they over-act their Pretences to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

but after all their Artifice, it will
be always obſerv'd, That it is impoſſible to
ſerve themſelves well of a pretence to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Candour. As upon painted Faces
we may commonly ſee both the Paint and the
uglineſs too; ſo we may ſee at the ſame time
upon the looks that are too Complaiſant the
plain traces of Diſſimulation and Knavery.
The Ladies have but too much experience of

Vice they have Ointments for all ſorts of

Truth: To ſpeak of them as they deſerve we
may ſay, they reſemble much the <hi>Hercule</hi>
upon a Theatre, who holds in his Hand a
mighty Club, but it is Hollow; It is made
but of Paſt-board and painted Cloth, and
may ſtrike a Man without making a Wound,
and almoſt without making it ſelf felt.</p>
            <p>Certainly if the Holy Scripture calls the
Complaiſant Preachers by the name of
<hi>Adulterers,</hi> we may ſay the ſame of ſeeming
and diſguiſed Friends, who do not ſpeak ſo
as to be uſeful to us, but only that they may
be agreeable: who do not talk to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
a pleaſure but to receive one from us.</p>
            <p>Let a Man ſuffer himſelf to be enchanted
as much as he will with the Complaiſance of
another, and rely upon it, and appear to do
ſo, yet he ſhall commonly find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
falſe, and the appearances deceitful:
Thoſe of this ſort who make ſhow of an
Affection for all the World, have indeed
none for any body. As we ſee nothing upon
the Sepulchers of the greateſt Princes, but
only Names and meer Titles of their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:
ſo likewiſe the viſages of theſe Perſons
carry as it were only the empty Names of
Friends. And as there is nothing to be found
within thoſe Gilded Tombs, but only Duſt
or Rottenneſs, ſo there is nothing but Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Inconſtancy under ſo Complaiſant
a Mien. Let us elſewhere ſeek for truth and
not pleaſe our ſelves with the embracing of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61440:126"/>
a Phantaſm. This ſort of wits are always
ſomewhat ſelfiſh in their Deſigns, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
follow Fortune, and turn about with
the Motion of her Wheel. When <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>balus</hi>
commanded theſe fawning Flatterers
to be tied to a Wheel and thrown into the
Water, he ſeemed to have a very right Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them, and to have condemned them
to a very ſuitable puniſhment; in making
them to be caſt into an Element of which
they themſelves have the pliableneſs, and in
tying them to a Wheel of which they have
the Inconſtancy. It would be no wrong to
them to compare them to the poor baffled <hi>Ixion,</hi>
who believe and rely upon theſe Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters;
inaſmuch as they experience that
after all their Promiſes, if they come to
the proof of them, they can find no effect in
them, they embrace in them but meer ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
To embrace a Complaiſant Perſon, is
to embrace a Cloud inſtead of a <hi>Juno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus taken Notice of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Effect of this Humour, let us now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
one of the principal Marks of it. The
Complaiſant aim at nothing but Oſtentation,
and Show: And as when we ſee the moſt
Paint upon a Face, we believe moſt largely of
the Defects of it, judging the height of the
Malady by the Quantity of the Phyſick: In like
manner, the more Study and Endeavour, and
the more Conſtraint we perceive in a Perſon's
Actions and Demeanour, we may very well
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61440:127"/>
conclude we ſhall find in the ſame Proportion,
that their Deſigns are wicked; and that the
greateſt Wickedneſs often ſeeks the faireſt
Mask for it's Diſguiſe. A Flatterer will make
more Offers than a Friend; and the falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
often glitters more than the true. The
Reaſon of this is not at all difficult to find.
It is becauſe Art is more prodigal than Nature,
and Fiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than Truth. Fiction willingly
produces nothing but Appearances; and
Truth lays hold of nothing but Subſtance.
Men, as well as Trees, commonly bring forth
more Leaves than Fruit, and have a great
deal more of Show than Effect. The Art
of Limning and that of Complementing do
not much differ from each other; both the
one and the other employ themſelves only
about Colours, and helabour nothing but
Surfaces. I do not at all think it ſtrange to
ſee the complaiſant Perſons prodigal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements;
a Man will be more liberal of
Counters than of Angels; and it coſts a great
deal leſs to gild the Statues which are made
of Lead or Wood, than to make them of
ſolid Gold. The moſt beautiful Roſes have
not the better Smell, they that have ſo much
of Colour have the leſs of Scent. Nature her
ſelf divides her gifts, and, as if ſhe were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
or poor and feeble, ſhe ſeems to find a
Difficulty is making the ſame thing very
beautiful and very good. We may ſay as
much as this concerning the Truth and the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61440:127"/>
Appearance of Friendſhip: It is often found
that the one is ſeparated from the other,
and known that they who ſhow ſo much
Affection upon the Forehead, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
none in the Soul. To ſpeak the truth,
they are like thoſe Cuſhions we lean upon,
that are on the out-ſide ſome coſtly Stuff,
perhaps, but have nothing within them but
only Chaff or Flocks. Theſe are Bats that
fly not but in the Twilight, that love neither
the Day nor the Night; but a third
Seaſon compoſed of both. They are Peacocks
which carry very lovely Feathers, but have
the Feet of a Thief, the Head of a Serpent,
and the Yellings of the Devils. They are
Reeds that comply with every Wind, and
accomodate themſelves to every Humour, but
they grow in the Mud, they are weak and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
they break under the Hand that leans
upon them, and wound it too.</p>
            <p>COMPLAISANCE is not only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
but alſo Defective too, and in both
Caſes Degenerates into Flattery. It is Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
in praiſing, and Defective in reproving;
it ſpeaks either too much or too little; it
equally abuſes both Diſcourſe and Silence.
It is like a Perſpective that ſhows a thing great
or little; and ſets it as at a diſtance, or very
near, as one will. It aſcribes a great deal to
the leaſt Vertues; it takes much away from
the greateſt Crimes; it laughs and it weeps
when it pleaſes; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, it is no
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61440:128"/>
leſs exceſſive in Pretences to pity than to
Love. There is no ſort of Part but it can
act: Now it ſhall be defending Vice; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it ſhall be accuſing Vertue. One
while it gives beautiful Names to things that
are moſt ugly, calling Raſhneſs Courage;
Covetouſneſs Thriſt and good Huſwifry; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
a good Humour; and then turning
up the reverſe of the Medal, it will give the
moſt infamous Titles to that which is highly
commendable; calling Eloquence Babling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Modeſty Fooliſhneſs; and an ingenuous Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Inſolence.</p>
            <p>It is after this manner that it abuſes both
Reproofs and Praiſes, and makes the Laws
either ſevere or favourable as it will. It
throws Oil into Fire, it foments and inflames
yet more the moſt debauched Inclinations;
it encourages to the committing of evil, thoſe
that as yet boggle a little at it; it lets looſe the
Reins to the moſt wild Deſires, when a juſt
Fear had reſtrain'd them. It ſpeaks to us as the
accurſed <hi>Julia</hi> to her Son <hi>Baſſianus: You can
do whatever you will.</hi> This young Emperour
being become moſt monſtrouſly in love with
his own Mother, when at a certain time he
ſaw her with her Neck and Breſts uncover'd,
and ſigh'd in her hearing, without daring to
tell the Cauſe; the Motions of his laſcivious
Love not having yet entirely ſtifled thoſe of his
Reſpect and Fear. This complaiſant Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan
took away from him all Apprehenſion;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61440:128"/>
ſhe hardned him in his Paſſion inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
him: She was not aſham'd to have
her own Son her Gallant; and to be Mother
and Miſtriſs to the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>What is there ſo horrid and impious, but
Complaiſance can adviſe to it? It can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
with any thing; there are no Paſſions
ſo extravagant, but this can breed them in
the Soul, or maintain them there. When
the vile <hi>Myrrha</hi> fell in love with her own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhe found a Compliance in her Nurſe,
who afforded her Means to ſucceed in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Deſign, inſtead of diverting her from
it. When <hi>Dido</hi> was paſſionately in love with
a Stranger, her Siſter, too complaiſant in the
Caſe, added to the Flames, inſtead of ſtriving
to quench them. Complaiſance approves all
that which we will, and takes but little care
to perſwade, tho' without Eloquence; ſince
it adviſes only to that which pleaſes. The
Ills that Concupiſcence cauſes only to bud in
us, Complaiſance makes them increaſe and
bring forth Fruit. If Concupiſcence be the
Mother of Wickedneſs, this is the Nurſe of
it; it finiſhes and exalts that which the other
left but low and beginning.</p>
            <p>It finds Excuſes for every thing: It ſaid to
the Wretch <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> when he was in love
with his Mother; that the Will of Kings
ought to be their only Rule: And they being
above all others, there is no reaſon they
ſhould be depriv'd of the Pleaſures they deſire,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61440:129"/>
by ſubmitting themſelves to the forbiddings
of another Man. This ſaid to <hi>Myrrha,</hi> that
the Gods themſelves had no Regard to Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Blood; that <hi>Juno</hi> was the Siſter, and
Wife of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and that the Motions of Love
do not at all oppoſe thoſe of Nature. It told
<hi>Dido,</hi> that the Dead do not mind at all what
the Living do; that there is no Fidelity due
to him that is not any longer; and that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi>
was not jealous in his Tomb of that
which <hi>Aeneas</hi> might do at <hi>Carthage.</hi> This
has in it a readineſs to undertake the moſt
horrid Enterpriſes; this was the Siſter of
<hi>Dido</hi> that corrupted her; this was the Nurſe
of <hi>Myrrha,</hi> that led her to the fatal Precipice;
this was the Mother of <hi>Baeſſianus,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
her own Son. It encourages thoſe
Women that heſitate and tremble; it teaches
thoſe that are ignorant; it hardens thoſe that
are ſcrupulous, and fortifies them that are
weak.</p>
            <p>It is for this Reaſon, that Complaiſance
is ſo well receiv'd when any have ill Deſigns;
becauſe, inſtead of contradicting or reproving
theſe, it gives the Means to carry them on and
accompliſh them. It is from hence that the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guards about the Perſons of Kings cannot
hinder this from entring into Palaces: It is
for this that it is every where receiv'd with
ſuch a gracious Countenance, and eſpecially
in Courts; where there muſt be nothing uſed
but ſupple Cringing, and where Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61440:129"/>
will not be reprov'd. It is laſtly for this
Reaſon that the Amorous and the Courtiers
ſtrive to keep the Fair, and the Princes in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to the end they may maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their Favour. Let us not diſſemble
in this matter, and while we are ſpeaking of
this baſe and cowardly Complaiſance, let us
not render our ſelves guilty of the Crime we
condemn. The Complaiſant, round about a
Man that is in favour, are as Shadows about
a Body in the Sun-ſhine. If one removes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
they are ſtirr'd with the ſame Motion;
if one ſweats, they wipe their Faces; if one
be a cold, their Faces are frozen; if we ſpeak,
theſe are but Echo's to repeat our Words.
They are Shadows which have no Solidity,
and fly from us when we think to lay hold on
them; Voices without a Soul, which Intereſt,
and not Truth, drives from the Breaſts of
Flatterers. How unprofitable to us is ſuch
a Complaiſance? Have we any Aſſiſtance from
a Shadow that follows us? Have we any
Conſolation from an Echo that pities us?
But alas, how dangerous is this Complaiſance!
If you ſpeak Blaſphemies, this Echo will
anſwer them; run to any manner of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
this Shadow will follow you. This
Echo repeats the Speeches of the Impious as
well as of the Juſt; and this Shadow follows
the Bodies that are Sick as well as thoſe that
are ſound. Unhappy Compaſſion! that
knows very well how to deſtroy us in a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61440:130"/>
good Fortune, but knows not how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us as it ought under a bad one.</p>
            <p>Deceitful Complaiſance that ſtays with us
but only while our gaudy Days laſt, and flies
away like the Birds that change their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
when the Winter approaches. May we
not after all this ſay, That Proſperity as well
as Adverſity, has but few true Friends; ſince
as the one wants them that ſhould comfort
it, the other is no leſs in want of thoſe that
ſhould admoniſh. As the Miſerable have none
to ſhow them ſome grounds of Hope; ſo they
that are Happy, are no leſs deſtitute of ſuch
as ſhould warn them to fear. If Compaſſion
be dumb in the preſence of the Afflicted;
Complaiſance is ſo in the preſence of the
Vicious; the one is careful, not to keep at
too great diſtance from a good Fortune; the
other ſometimes fears to approach an evil
one. See here that Complaiſance is the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Great, the Enchantment of the
Court, the Enemy of Truth, and Mother
of all Vice.</p>
            <p>AND NEVERTHELESS, how
much Miſchief ſoever it does, we have no
ſmall Difficulty to defend our ſelves from it;
it is an agreeable Murderer, the Wounds of
it pleaſe us, and when it kills we cannot
tell how to complain. I grant there are ſome
that have Remedies, as well as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this fatal <hi>Syren,</hi> who ſmiles to make
others weep; and wracks thoſe Veſſels that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61440:130"/>
ſhe has allur'd to her by her Songs; and
who appears beautiful, but is indeed a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
Certainly if there be ſome that are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to Complaiſance, there are a great
many more that ſuffer themſelves to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
with it. If there are ſome few that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> in this, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
to their Commendations; and that
they chuſe rather to endure Slander than
Flattery: There are many more like <hi>Antipater,</hi>
who are willing to diſſemble their Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and will be painted with but half a Face
if they want an Eye. There are more that
ſuffer themſelves to be catch'd with the
Charms of it, than there are, that defend
themſelves from them. Complaiſance is an
Enemy that is reſiſted only by flying from it;
it has poiſon'd Weapons; it needs but to
touch that it may Wound, and to come near,
that it may conquer us. It has Charms that
are of great value, even to the moſt grave
and ſerious. We cannot repulſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Regret; we ſhun it only that it may
ſeek us, and if we refuſe it Entrance, 'tis only
in jeſt and pretence; and as to a Miſtreſs,
againſt whom her Lover ſhuts the Door, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ſhe may thruſt it open. As ſoon as
this has gain'd the Ear it wins the Heart,
and to defend our ſelves from it, we muſt be
either very wiſe or very inſenſible. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the more it pleaſes, the more it hurts us;
it is by ſo much the more dangerous, by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61440:131"/>
how much it is agreeable. It was for this
Reaſon that <hi>Artemidorus</hi> ſaid to his Friends,
That there was danger of ſeeing a Flatterer
even in his ſleep, and that there can be no
ſafety even with his Shadow or Picture. You
may judge from hence of the Malice of this
Enemy, ſince his very Picture is miſchievous
and deſerving our Caution. This is not but
too true at this time. We live in an Age
wherein Complaiſance is more in Vogue, and
has more of force than ever. We are in a
time when they who know not how to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are accounted Clowniſh; and thoſe who
will not be flattered are eſteem'd Dull. At
this day they who have not the Art of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
know not how to Pleaſe. In the preſent
Age as well as in that of Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> they take
Flattery for an effect of Humility, or Good-Will;
inſomuch that they who abandon this
ſhameful Trade, are held for Envious Perſons
or Proud.</p>
            <p>BUT certainly if we examine well thoſe
whom Flattery corrupts, we ſhall commonly
find that it has no power at all but upon the
ſmalleſt Wits. The Pyramids of <hi>Egypt</hi> are
ſaid to caſt no ſhadow, notwithſtanding that
they are very high; and the good Wits will
not ſuffer about them this Complaiſance or
Flattery. They are no more dazled with the
Rays of Truth than the Eagles are with thoſe
of the Sun. <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> his Compariſon
ſeems to me moſt admirable, when he ſaid that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61440:131"/>
the Complaiſant Perſons reſemble Courtiſans
in that they deſire all things in their Servants
excepting Reaſon and Prudence. Theſe are
things greatly wanting in thoſe who love to
Complement, thoſe that have good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
abhor ſuch cringing; and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Wits had rather be troubleſome than
diſſembled; and much rather may I ſay, they
had rather be troubled than flattered. Thoſe
that are wiſe are neither willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
nor deſirous to deceive; they are not
willing their Judgment ſhould commit an
Error any more than their Will. If we do
not ſee the Artifice of the Complaiſant it is
our Ignorance, if we do diſcover this and
yet endure it, 'tis an intolerable Ambition.
This compliance is proper only to the looſer
Souls, and freedom is natural to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
If the Hypocrite is thought the moſt
guilty of all Sinners, the Flatterer may be
deem'd the moſt pernicious of all Enemies; for
as the former would impoſe upon the Eyes of
the All-knowing God; ſo the latter would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
abuſe the Eyes of them that are Wiſe. And
as God abhors a falſe Devotion, ſo a wiſe Man
ought to deteſt a falſe Amity.</p>
            <p>BUT IF this Complaiſance were not
dangerous, yet it is infamous, both in thoſe
that receive, and in thoſe that practiſe it.
It is a ſign of weakneſs of Spirit to let it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
us; and the Ladies that have a good
Judgment cannot be pleaſed with this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61440:132"/>
trick, of finding Vices and Vertues
where ever one will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſaid, That the only fruit he had
received from his Philoſophy was to ſpeak
plainly to all the World, and to tell freely his
Thoughts of things. The good Minds ſhould
have no other aim but this, nor any other
ſenſe of things but what they declare; though
the Vulgar may perhaps endeavour only to
conceal what they think. I eſteem very much
that other Philoſophy which taught the
Diſciples of it this one thing as conducing
enough to a good Life alone, which was,
That they ſhould always obſerve the Sun, to
the end they might thereby learn, that, as
that Planet ſcatters even the ſmalleſt Miſts,
ſo a good Conſcience will diſſipate all manner
of diſguiſe and conſtraint. All this Artifice
is a ſign either of Wickedneſs or Cowardiſe,
and of a Spirit very feeble or very ill diſpoſed.
As Prudence and Courage are inſeparable, ſo
Policy and Weakneſs are always together.
Reeds yield more to the Winds than Oaks do;
and Foxes are more crafty than Lions, the
fearful than the generous, and the little Spirits
than great ones. The beſt and wiſeſt
Minds ordinarily hate tricks and cheating, and
if at any time they make uſe of Artifice 'tis
only as a counter-poiſon; it is never to do
evil but only to avoid it, 'tis not to aſſault
any others, but only to defend themſelves. It
is one of the moſt noble effects of Magnanimity
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61440:132"/>
to love and to hate only openly. Beſides,
thoſe that are wiſe muſt be always equal, but
the Complaiſant are under a neceſſity of
changing every moment; there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or ſteady in their humour, any more
than in their looks, becauſe that as well as the
other depends upon the humour of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they would pleaſe. They are forced
ſometimes to condemn in the ſame hour that
which they have before commended, or to
extol to the Skies the ſame thing which they
had before damned to the bottomleſs Pit.
Complaiſance then has commonly attending
upon it theſe two ſhameful qualities, Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
and Inequality or Unconſtancy.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak nothing in all this but what the
Complaiſant themſelves will own; and ſo
thoſe that are moſt expert at this Trade will
not addreſs themſelves to any but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught,
and meaner Wits: They are like
thoſe Mountebanks that produce their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Medicines only before the Ignorant
Vulgar. They that have but a ſmall meaſure
of Knowledge can lift up the Mask and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
the Cheat; they will more regard what
theſe Perſons are in effect, than what they
are in the Opinion of others. And if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this matter rightly, we ſhall know
it is from hence that they who mightily love
themſelves do alſo love thoſe that flatter
them; for it is very ſeldom that we can
find together much knowledge and a great
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61440:133"/>
admiration of our ſelves. They that well
know themſelves and what they are, will give
no heed to the Complements, that aſcribe to
them what they are not. They therefore
that Idolize their own Opinions have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for all thoſe that contradict them:
They, like <hi>Ahab,</hi> love none but the fawning
Prophets, and they care not if one does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, provided he flatter too.</p>
            <p>Certainly there are too many of the Ladies
like <hi>Jezebel</hi> in her Hatred of <hi>Elijah,</hi> I mean that
hate thoſe who reprehend their faults; like
the Apes that endeavour to break the Looking-glaſſes
wherein they ſee themſelves, becauſe
theſe diſcover their Uglineſs. Nevertheleſs
I wiſh they could underſtand, that a good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
or a Reproof well given, is of much
more advantage to them (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays)
than the moſt coſtly Pendants at the Ears. I
confeſs, that when ever a Reproof is given,
it ſhould be ſoftened as much as is poſſible that
it may not give the receiver too much pain:
But yet it muſt be ſaid, That if there be
ſome ſmart in it, the Ladies ought to reſolve
that they will endure it, ſince it may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them, and ſerving to their Honour;
and a ſeaſonable Correction may contribute
more to the ornament of the Mind than
Jewels at the Ears can do to the adorning of
the Face. But on the other ſide, if any do
ſo love and admire themſelves as that they
cannot bear the truth when it ſhows them
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61440:133"/>
their defects, ſuch a Humour ſhall eaſily be
conquered by Complaiſance. As they make
it a very eaſie and ſhort Work to a Beſieger
who give up the place they ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
ſo it is not difficult to conquer that
Perſon by Flattery whoſe ſelf-love betrays
him. Complaiſance has no difficulty to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
our Minds when it has an intelligencer
within us of this folliſh ſelf-admiring hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
It is like thoſe Thieves that have their
correſpondents in the Houſe they deſign to Rob
that ſhall open the Doors for them in the
Night when People have no thoughts of
defending themſelves. As when <hi>Eve</hi> was
gain'd, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf follow'd ſoon after;
ſo when the Inclination is corrupted by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
the Mind is not long before it yields.
This Compariſon ſeems not to be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
ſince the Complaiſant have the ſhifting
Tricks of the Serpent as well as his Poiſon,
and eaſily ſlide themſelves quite in there,
where the leaſt part of them is admitted;
and in that they accoſt our humour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
our Reaſon, and make the former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Apple to the latter.</p>
            <p>They therefore that perceive that their
good-nature carries them to the Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
ought to be always upon their
guard: They muſt never be drowſie or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
leaſt the Flatterer like the Serpent ſhould
ſeduce this <hi>Eve</hi> It is in this Caſe that the
Ladies are in a great deal of danger, if they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61440:134"/>
do not take good notice, that Complaiſance
will ſhow them ſuch Fruits as promiſe Life,
but will give them Death. Certainly they
ought to conſider well this Example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they may ſee how much miſchief this
thing did to the firſt Woman, in giving her
Courage to Sin, in permitting her that which
God had forbidden her. Thoſe of her Sex
ought to remember that they have Enemies
that flatter, to deſtroy them, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themſelves to their humour that they
may enſnare their Judgment.</p>
            <p>IN MY OPINION it were an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
remedy againſt the miſchief of this, for
the Women to conſider ſeriouſly what they
are when any praiſe them for that they are
not. To judge whether theſe Painters have
drawn our Picture true, we muſt confront
the Copy and Original, and obſerve whether
the Pourtraicture drawn for us be according
to our Nature. There is nothing ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Complaiſance as Conſcience: this does
very often condemn us even while that is
commending. But as the Slanders of the
Malicious do not hinder but that we may
be very good; ſo notwithſtanding the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes
of Flatterers we may be very blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
Complaiſance then is the Capital
Enemy of Conſcience, it would extinguiſh
this Divine Light, it would lull this
careful Sentinel aſleep, it would ſilence this
inward Monitor which ought to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61440:134"/>
liberty to ſpeak to us, and who laſhes us
with remorſe if we deſerve it, while the
Complaiſant are flattering us with Praiſes.</p>
            <p>What is there then in Society ſo pernicious
as this? when it hinders us from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our faults, and would have us continue
in them and make our errors the Diſcourſe
of the World. It is for this reaſon better
that we undergo Cenſure than Complaiſance;
becauſe it is leſs dangerous to be accuſed than
praiſed falſly: The Wounds of a Friend are
of more worth than the Kiſſes which a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
gives us. If we muſt needs commit an
Error, and take our ſelves to be what we are
not in truth, it is better far to have too bad
an Opinion of our ſelves to the end we may
be humbled thereby, than to flatter our ſelves
into an Opinion of more worth than we have.
It is leſs dangerous to fly from a Shadow than
to let an Enemy come within reach of us: it
is better to fear an apparent evil than not to
fear a true one; our fear is herein much leſs
dangerous than our boldneſs.</p>
            <p>IT IS TRUE that Slander and Flattery
do both equally make War againſt Vertue, but
as the one aſſaults it with a Sword, the other
does this with Poiſon: for which reaſon they
ought to have more fear of Flatterers than of
the Slanderers; as they would more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſhun thoſe Enemies who hide their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
than thoſe that openly make their War.
But let us ſee what in the end becomes of the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61440:135"/>
Complaiſant, with all their falſhood, with all
their diſguiſe and dawbing. As ſoon as their
Artifice is diſcovered, they are held in abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
they remain ever after ſuſpected by all
the World; they are never lov'd any longer
than till they are known. And, to ſay the
truth, the content which Complaiſance affords,
and the diſtaſt that is ever cauſed by a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
are both equal, but of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
At firſt the Candid and Sincere are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed,
and the Complaiſant are approv'd,
but experience changes the Sentiment: and
Complaiſance at the end gains the ſame Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which the freedom met at the beginning.
As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>He that rebuketh a man, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
findeth more favour than he that flattereth
with his tongue.</hi> The one begins with a ſhort
ſweetneſs, to end in a long diſtaſte and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs;
and the other begins with a ſlight
diſguſt, but 'tis to continue in a ſatisfaction
the more ſolid and durable. The one is like a
Medicine which does not diſtaſte us but to
give us Health, the other like a Poiſon which
is ſweetned that it may kill. Hence it comes
to paſs that herein Complaiſance has effects
quite contrary to thoſe of the truth that
corrects us: In that all the World eſteem and
ſeek this truth before it appears, and when
they ſee it, it makes their Eyes ſmart, and
offends. On the contrary, all the World
blames the Compliance of Flatterers, but
when it comes near it pleaſes and bewitches us.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61440:135"/>
We cannot hate the latter nor love the former,
but only during their abſence from us.</p>
            <p>NOW THAT WE HAVE THUS
SEEN What there is of Evil in Complaiſance,
let us next examine what it has of Goodneſs
or Uſefulneſs in it. Whatever ſome may ſay
of this, it may be as far diſtant from Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
as Prudence is from Craft, and Courage
from Raſhneſs. And if it ſhould be ſaid that
at leaſt it is very difficult not to run out of
one into the other, this were to deceive ones
ſelf as much as if we ſhould think that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot be Liberal unleſs he be Prodigal, or
that we cannot poſſibly ſeparate a Mediocrity
from an Exceſs.</p>
            <p>I readily own there is often a Compliance
that is baſe; as when <hi>Cynethus</hi> commended
<hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> for that he kept time in
ſpitting when he was troubled with a Cough.
I own that the Flatterers may abuſe this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Vertue, but what one is there that they
do not abuſe? What is there ſo Beautiful or
Divine, as that the Ignorant or the Wicked
cannot prophane it? May they not even do
ill with truth? Thoſe that boaſt themſelves
of a good Action they have done are not they
guilty of Vanity though they tell no lye in the
caſe? We ought not therefore to condemn
Complaiſance, for that there are many that
do not know the right uſe of it. It is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good in its nature, though commonly it is
very bad in mens practice and uſe of it.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61440:136"/>
And that this may the better appear, is it
not true that this great freedom which many
praiſe does very often proceed not from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of Manners in the Man's own ſelf,
but from Conceitedneſs rather, and from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Imprudence. We take pleaſure to
contradict, ſometimes, becauſe the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome makes us loth to confeſs even
the truth it ſelf. Nevertheleſs though I ſhould
grant that this ſharp reprehending humour
does not come from a bad Principle, yet at
leaſt it muſt be ſaid of it, That 'tis a bad
effect of a good Cauſe. Thoſe that are ſo
rude and uncomplaiſant are Objects of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
though they be Learned and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
One may ſay of them what <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Xenocrates,</hi> That notwithſtanding his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and his Honeſty, he had need to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Graces. If this rudeneſs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
a Philoſopher, how ſhall it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in a Lady? As gentle ſweetneſs is
natural to their Sex, ſo Complaiſance ought
to be inſeparable from their Actions and
Diſcourſe. 'Tis true I do not approve of
that which appears affected and conſtrained
when it endeavours to Pleaſe: but alſo I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuſe thoſe Women that put on ſo much
Gravity as to become Moroſe. Sweetneſs and
Severity are not contrary, but only different
things; and Prudence may put them into ſo
perfect a Temperament, that the one may give
Luſtre to the other.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61440:136"/>
Alſo I do not mean, that to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Complaiſant, they ſhould univerſally
approve all things; theſe are two extreams
equally blamable; to take upon one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
or contradict indifferently in all ſorts
of Rencounters. Thoſe Spirits that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
every thing, are ſowre or preſumptuous;
thoſe that approve of all, are ignorant or
cowardly. Thoſe Women that make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Contradicting all things, do this
either out of Inclination, or with Artifice: if
this be from Inclination, it ſhows the rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Humour; if from Artifice, they
are vainly proud of a little Wit. Certainly
let it proceed from what it will, it cannot
always ſucceed, it is always joyn'd with a
vicious Temperament, or an imprudent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
and is in Perſons ill born, or ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
            <p>How troubleſome are theſe Women in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation!
If they did but regard the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good ſo much as they do their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Satisfaction, they would vow an eternal
Solitude and Retirement; and would never
ſhow themſelves but when People wanted
Mortification. Let us do what we will, or
forbear to do, 'tis impoſſible to content them.
If the Company do not agree to their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are vexed; if they follow their
Opinion, then they themſelves begin to have
another quite contrary, on purpoſe that they
may contradict without end. If any others
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61440:137"/>
commend a Vertue, they will detract and
condemn it. If any condemn a Vice, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
their Part in the Scene, to excuſe or
defend it. They value and mind not what
their Opinion is of any thing, provided it be
contrary to that of others. If you praiſe
them, they will accuſe you of Flattery; if
you do not commend them, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you for ungrateful; if one ſpeaks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, one is a Babler; if one does not
ſpeak, he is diſdainful. They will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to blame, both in our Diſcourſe, or in
Silence; they will condemn both Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Solitude.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak rightly of this Matter; we muſt
ſay that the Women of this Humour are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always proud there, where the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
are commonly humble: For, to deſcribe
a true Complaiſance rightly, we muſt ſay 'tis
nothing but a patient Civility, or a civil
Charity. As the Love which Chriſtianity
teaches, endures all things; ſo the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of Morality, after a ſort, does as much:
although the Motives of theſe are different,
in that the one proceeds from a Deſire to
pleaſe God, the other from a Deſire to pleaſe
Men. After all, we ſhould find it no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to be complaiſant, and to bear
with the Infirmities and Imperfections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if we would but conſider, that we do
no more herein than what we often have need
of for our ſelves. But this is the Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61440:137"/>
of ſome, that they can neither ſhow
Mercy to others, nor ſuffer that any others
ſhould do Juſtice to them, or uſe them as
they herein do deſerve.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that have not ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
as to bear with the leaſt Faults, have
neither the Humility to endure that any one
ſhould reprove their greateſt Crimes. They
believe others will always abuſe Reproof as
themſelves do; and that it will not be uſed to
inſtruct, but to injure. They deſpiſe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the World, and would have all
Men adore theirs: They are as well Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
as Inſolent; and have as much Vanity
as Rudeneſs. And if at laſt either their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or the Evidence of Truth obliges
them to conſent, or hold their Peace, yet
their Mien and Looks contradict ſtill: and
after that their Mouth has made a Peace,
their ſilence ſtill continues the War. What
can there be more troubleſome in Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than this Humour? Certainly this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome
Temper were much better in the
Schools than in Converſation. I do not at
all deny but we may ſome times reaſon and
argue together, the better to find out truth;
and that we may render Diſcourſe the more
agreeable by the diverſity of the Subjects that
are ſpoken upon: But yet there ſhould be
ſome fear and caution leſt we be diſordered
or fall out: At leaſt it ſhould be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that Diſpute in Converſation is a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61440:138"/>
War where we ought not to combate with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
nor to overcome with Inſolence. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Complaiſance be mingled with the
Debates, there is nothing ſo agreeable, and
there will no more injury be done by a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that ſort, than two Perſons would
do by throwing Flowers at each other.</p>
            <p>The ſame that have the Humour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting,
have alſo a perpetual Inclination
to Correct, and reform all Matters: but they
are as unprofitable as troubleſome; they
know not how to teſtifie a Good-will in their
reproofs, no more than a good Spirit in their
Diſputes. All that which comes from their
harſh Humour is diſpleaſing; though they
ſpeak that which is true they do it ſo ungrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that inſtead of making People good,
they make them their Enemies. As ſoon as
ſuch Perſons are ſeen they are diſtaſted; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that we have an averſion for them, at
laſt an abhorrence: they are generally the
Objects either of Hatred or Laughter.</p>
            <p>Complaiſance ſucceeds much better, ſince
as it commends without Flattery, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
without Injury. This knows the Art
of curing pleaſantly, it takes from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
its bitterneſs without robbing it of its
ſtrength: It is a Sun that does not diminiſh
his Light to make it the more tolerable to
ſore Eyes; it refrains from dazling with its
Beams, but not from enlightning. If the
Load-ſtone has not only the Vertue to attract
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61440:138"/>
Iron, but alſo to ſhow the Pole, Complaiſance
Charms the greateſt Spirits, as well as the
ſmall ones.</p>
            <p>It enlightens thoſe that have Eyes, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
thoſe that have none; They who know
and underſtand it ſee its force, they that do
not, yet feel it. In truth, it has a ſecret Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
for the conquering of Hearts, it is a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
that draws even Iron, I mean the moſt
Clowniſh and Barbarous.</p>
            <p>It inſenſibly wins upon us even when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves:
it does not fall with an impetuous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
like Hail, but as gently as Snow.
Though the Snow be cold, yet it wraps up
the Earth as in a Mantle of Wool (to which
the Holy Ghoſt compares it) to the end it may
cheriſh and keep warm the Seed that is in it. In
like manner though Reproof be in it ſelf
ſomewhat diſagreeing, yet it fails not to make
good Deſigns and vertuous Undertakings bud
and ſprout in our Hearts. Complaiſance
obliges while it reprehends. And if this
ſtrikes it is but with a Rod of Roſes; where
it ſtrikes it leaves a Flower inſtead of a
Wound. Without this the beſt Advice ſeems
but a Reproach; without it, Correction is
Injurious, Praiſe is diſagreeable, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
troubleſome.</p>
            <p>Complaiſance is not a blind Vertue, it has
Eyes as well as Hands, it does not ſtrike blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
There are ſome faults it reproves, and
ſome it bears with: it endures what it cannot
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61440:139"/>
hinder and prevent. And in truth, excepting
the brotherly Correction to which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
obliges us, what matter is it to
us if many Erre, or if they have ill Opinions,
unleſs it be in matters of Conſcience or that
concern their Salvation? As we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to heal all that are Sick, we are not
bound to endeavour the undeceiving of all
thoſe that are in Error. We ſhould have no
leſs trouble and difficulty in becoming the
Correctors of all the ill Opinions in the
World, than if we ſhould go about to heal
all the Diſtempers that are in it. We have
not this in charge, this care appertains to the
Providence of God and not to us.</p>
            <p>Beſides what need is there that we ſhould
ſpeak all our Sentiments, or make known
every where all that which diſpleaſes or
contents us? One that is wiſe ought well to
conſider always that which he ſays, but he
is never bound to ſay all that he thinks.
There is no need that for the avoiding of a
lye, he ſhould fall into Indiſcretion. To be
free, he does not need to be Uncivil; we
do not injure Truth every time that we do
not ſpeak it. We are always forbidden to ſay
that which is falſe, but we are not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſay always all that is true. There is
no Law that obliges us to ſpeak all our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
or to diſcover all our Thoughts</p>
            <p>

On the other ſide, this great liberty of
ſpeaking is not only-unjuſt or troubleſome, but
alſo dangerous; this Imprudent plainneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
the moſt mild Perſons, when the true
Complaiſance would ſoften the moſt rugged.
<hi>Clytus</hi> loſt the love of <hi>Alexander</hi> by ſpeaking
too freely. <hi>Scipio</hi> won the Heart of <hi>Syphax</hi>
by having treated him with gentleneſs: The
one by Complaiſance preſerved his Life in
company of a <hi>Barbarian;</hi> the other by uſing
an indiſcreet freedom loſt his by an intimate
Friend. Daily experience affords us examples
enough of this ſort, ſo that we need not ſeek
for them in the Hiſtories of paſt Ages: we
ſufficiently find every day, that without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
we become odious, and intolerable
to all the World. Where there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
there can be no Civility, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe two lovely Qualities, Society cannot
be but very troubleſome. Eſpecially let the
Ladies obſerve, that as their Faces cannot
pleaſe without Beauty, ſo neither can their
Converſation without Complaiſance.</p>
            <p>BUT THAT WE may ſay what yet
further concerns them: After we have ſeen
how Complaiſance ought to be practiſed, let
us now take notice how they ſhould receive it.
Let us learn the difference there is between a
Complaiſant Perſon and a Flatterer, for fear
the Ladies ſhould take the one for the other.
The Example of <hi>Panthea</hi> ſeems to me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
famous to make a good Diſcovery of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61440:140"/>
this. This Lady was no leſs Modeſt than
Fair; ſhe deſpiſed praiſes as much ſhe deſerv'd
them. <hi>Lucian</hi> deſcribing the Perfections of
her Wit and her Face, compared her to the
<hi>Minerva</hi> of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and the <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Praxiteles.
Panthea</hi> would not accept of the praiſes that
ſeem'd to her exceſſive, nor endure that they
ſhould compare her to the Goddeſſes. <hi>Lucian</hi>
to give an anſwer to this, and to juſtifie the
Compariſon he had made, ſhows, in a very
few words, the difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the praiſes of an Orator and thoſe of a
Flatterer.</p>
            <p>We ought not (ſays he) when we would
praiſe a thing, to compare it to that which
is below it, for this were to abate the merit
of it: nor to that which is its equal, for that
were to do no more than if it were compared
with its ſelf: But the Compariſon ought to
be made with ſomething that is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
to the end that what we praiſe may have
the more of brightneſs and luſtre. A Hunter
(ſays he) will not compare a good ſtout Dog
to a Fox, when he would commend him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this were too mean a Compariſon; nor
to a Wolf, becauſe this is a thing too like him:
but rather to a Lion who has more of Force
and Courage. If Praiſes are without Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
they are Flatteries: If they are without
Ornament, they are injurious. Thoſe who
can join Ornament with merit in doing this
are juſt and allowable in what they do.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61440:140"/>
It were Flattery to praiſe one that is crooked
for her fine Shapes, or one that is bald for
the fine Hair ſhe has. It may be ſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this reaſoning of <hi>Lucian,</hi> That
in praiſing what is little may be elevated to
indifferent, and what is indifferent to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
A commendation ought not to lye, but
it may amplifie: It ought not to be prodigal,
but may be liberal. There is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a meer Hiſtory and a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;
it is not enough for this latter that it
do barely deſcribe, but it ought likewiſe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in it ſome Ornament and Pomp.</p>
            <p>The Ladies may judge from hence that
there is more difference between praiſing and
flattering, than there is between dreſſing and
painting the Face. We may plainly ſee in the
example of this Orator, how praiſes ought
to be given; and in the example of that Lady
we may ſee how they ſhould be received. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
ſhows that he underſtood well the Laws
of his Rhetorick, and <hi>Panthea</hi> teſtified, That
ſhe was not ignorant of thoſe of Decency and
Modeſty. I grant there are very few that
like her do make a Conſcience of receiving the
praiſes that are given them, though they be
entirely exceſſive. I know that the vanity
of many is no leſs Sacrilegious than Sawcy,
when they receive from their Idolaters the
names of Angels and Divinities without any
Scruple: I know too, and grant that there is
more occaſion to exhort to reſtraint than to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61440:141"/>
liberty in this matter. Nevertheleſs they
ought to conſider that they muſt not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Laws of Decency in obſerving thoſe
of Modeſty. It is neceſſary that Prudence
ſhould ſhow them a certain way between In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
and Incivility. If Chriſtianity does
oblige them to deſpiſe all ſorts of praiſes and
even thoſe that are moſt juſt, nevertheleſs it
is convenient ſometimes that Complaiſance
do approve theſe praiſes in the Countenance,
even when Humility does deſpiſe them in the
Soul. Herein they owe always their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to God, and ſometimes their Mien to
the World and Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>But to finiſh this Diſcourſe on that part
which is of greateſt importance: If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves moved with the praiſes that
are given them, they have no more to do but
to look into themſelves, that ſo they may find
a remedy for this in their own Conſcience.
As we are the leſs afflicted when we know the
ill imputed to us to be falſe; ſo we ſhall be
the leſs proud for our Commendations, when
we find that the good aſcribed to us is not
truly in us. We muſt therefore defend our
ſelves from Flattery as from Slander, by the
knowledge of our ſelves. For as Conſcience
may comfort us againſt falſe accuſations by
ſhowing us our Innocence: ſo it may humble
us, while we are flattered, by ſhowing us our
Defects. And if it be not enough for this
purpoſe to conſider our own Imperfections,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61440:141"/>
let us conſider moreover how much Treachery
and Deceit there is in others! How much
Falſhood there is mingled with the Affairs of
the World! They who have the looks of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,
have ſometimes the Hearts of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers;
oftentimes they who praiſe us in their
Diſcourſe, diſparage us in their Thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Ladies, like the <hi>Eurydice</hi> of the Poets,
are liable to find Serpents under the Flowers;
As their Sex is carried naturally to Gentleneſs,
their Enemies put Poiſon in what they love,
and lay Snares where they are ſure they will
paſs. The Flatterers would do them leſs
harm, if they would take more heed to the
Deſigns of ſuch Men than to their Diſcourſes:
They would the better know thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
the truth if they would repreſent to
themſelves that there are three Conditions
neceſſary to the ſpeaking well; that there
muſt be Reſolution, Prudence, and Friendſhip.
When Reſolution is wanting, they will palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and dawb: when Prudence and Amity are
abſent, they are Injurious. The Cowardly
Spirits dare not ſpeak; the Imprudent know
not how to do it; and Enemies will not.
Laſtly, That they may give and receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
the more Innocently, ſhe that is wiſe
muſt conſider, that this is in all thoſe caſes
forbidden, wherein we have more care to
pleaſe Men than God. It ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that oftentimes the Righteous God
condemns thoſe Actions that Men praiſe;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61440:142"/>
and that he who entertains Flatterers to exalt
and puff him up, while God threatens him in
this World, ſhall not have them to defend
him when God ſhall condemn him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Birth or Nature, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</head>
            <p>IOWN that <hi>Plato</hi> had good Reaſon
to ſay that three of the happieſt
and moſt neceſſary Principles in the World,
are Nature, Fortune, and Art: Since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gives Life; Fortune, Goods; and
Art, Knowledge. I own too, that Nature
and Art have ſometimes no luſtre without the
Goods of Fortune; and this ſerves like a
Theatre or Ornament to the other two. But
certainly I cannot approve that Opinion of the
Philoſopher, when he ſaid, That the greater
things are done by Nature, and by Fortune;
and the leſſer by Art. Nature makes Men;
Art can make but the Pictures of them; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
gives Sceptres; and Art can give but Talk
and Science. <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to me more the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
than the Divine in this Opinion: The
Works of Art are ſo pretious, that Nature
and Fortune have need of them in all that
which they do, that is moſt admirable: The one
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61440:142"/>
and the other is blind, if Art does not open
their Eyes: Without Art, no one can well
live or reign. How many great Fortunes do
we ſee overthrown for want of Conduct?
How many do we ſee, whoſe good Parts lie
barren for want of Education? I ſhall not
ſpeak here of what Fortune can do; but only
of Nature and Art, or rather of Birth and
Education, that it may be ſeen, which of
theſe two ought to have the greater part in
the Lives and Actions of the Ladies.</p>
            <p>IT SEEMS in the firſt place, that a
good Birth is more requiſite to them than
any other thing; ſince, with this Advantage,
they do that which is good, as it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and without Difficulty. An happy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has no more need of Rules than a good
Conſtitution of Medicines: A good Birth
ſucceeds better without Education, than an ill
one can with the beſt Education. As there is
not the leaſt Star in the Sky, but is of far
greater worth, and has more of Force than
the moſt glorious Sun in a Picture: So it muſt
be acknowledged that the Advantages which
Nature gives are none of them ſo little; but
that they deſerve more Eſteem than all that
can be acquir'd by Art and Study. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
Gracefulneſs muſt yield as much
to a natural one, as a painted thing to a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one. And if the Ladies were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
before a Judge, as heretofore the three
Goddeſſes were before <hi>Paris,</hi> I believe he would
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61440:143"/>
give the ſame Judgment that <hi>Paris</hi> did, and
that he would declare the more naked, I
mean the more native, to be the faireſt.</p>
            <p>Tho' a Face be not adorn'd, we may ſee
Beauty in it, if it be there; ſo tho' good
natural Parts are not cultivated, yet they
will make their Strength and Excellency to be
obſerv'd. Suppoſe Pearls be caſt into the
Mud, we may yet ſee ſomething of their
Luſtre, even in the middle of the Filth; and
tho' a Perſon that has good natural Parts
be brought up in Obſcurity; yet her good
Birth will always dart out ſome Rays, and
make ſome Signs of Vertue ſhine in her Looks.
Thoſe Women that have this Advantage do
all things with the better Grace, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with more Equality in all their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
            <p>The Vertues to which we have an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
endure much better than thoſe to which
we have none. We entertain more eaſily
that which is in us by Birth, than what we
have by Art and Endeavour. Nature herein
reſembles Step-Mothers, who always take
more care of the Children which themſelves
have brought forth, than of thoſe of another
Woman: She does as the Earth, which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cheriſhes thoſe Plants and Flowers that
its ſelf produces, than thoſe which the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
or Gardener ſows in it. The Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Nature are like thoſe Streams that run
of themſelves, without any Labour about
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61440:143"/>
them to make them paſs along: But the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Art are like thoſe Pipes that belong
to Fountains which are always wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other to be done to them. That
which comes from Nature is the more equal
and the more aſſur'd.</p>
            <p>And if there may be many found, who love
rather to follow their Nature, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it for the Affectation of ſomewhat
elſe, tho' it may ſeem better: I think their
Opinion is very reaſonable; for in truth, we
ſhall ſucceed better in cultivating that which
is indifferent in our ſelves, than in imitating
that which is excellent in others. If <hi>David</hi>
fought better with his Sling, than he could
have done with the Weapons of <hi>Saul,</hi> and
ſtruck his blow ſurer with the Equipage of
a Shepherd than with that of a Warriour:
So likewiſe we may do more with Nature on
our ſide, than with all the Endeavour in the
World; if the exacteſt Method, and the
moſt pompous Style do not ſuit with our
Temper.</p>
            <p>How ſuperfluous and unprofitable is that
Labour, that would acquire a Perfection which
is contrary to our Humour, when that which
is but indifferent is not worth our Imitation;
and that which is excellent is above it? That
which is moſt excellent in all things, is what
cannot be acquir'd by Art. As for Eloquence,
who can acquire the Vigour of it? As for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing,
who can acquire the Subtilty, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61440:144"/>
neceſſary to it? As for a good Grace,
who could ever acquire that native and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Charm, which Painters know not how to
draw, nor the Poets to deſcribe; and which
is felt much better than it can be expreſs'd?</p>
            <p>Beſides, what need is there to light up
Torches when we have the Sun ſhining upon
us? And what need to receive the Light of
Art, when we have that of Nature? This
is not only ſuperfluous, but alſo ſhameful and
more difficult. And in truth, whatever good
Rules, or whatever fine Examples we follow;
there is ſometimes more Difficulty to do as
another does, than to do more; it is leſs
hard to ſurpaſs than juſt to equal them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may be, to do more there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Force or Courage; but to do juſt
ſo much, there muſt be Meaſure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
It may be much eaſier to out-go a
Man by running, than if we are confin'd to
that ſort of Pace which he uſes; ſince in the
former Caſe we depend upon our ſelves; but in
the latter we muſt regulate our going by his.</p>
            <p>Would there not in this be a great deal of
Conſtraint and Wearineſs? Would it not then
be better to follow our own Humour, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it be not contrary to Reaſon? Were it not
beſt for us to examine our Temperament, and
be guided by that to chuſe the Perfection we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour;
as men regard the Nature of the
Mold in which they plant their Trees or ſow
their Seeds? Certainly, whatever they ſay of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61440:144"/>
Art it is nothing but a Labyrinth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
us: We ought to take wing and fly up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it rather than vex our ſelves with ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way out among ſo many windings,
where vulgar Souls are wont to loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
It is true that excellent Wits as well as
the Birds may ſometimes walk in Paths; but
alſo they ſometimes fly up above all; they
uſe their Wings as well as their Feet; they
follow the force of their Genius as well as
the Rules that Art preſcribes.</p>
            <p>If we did but well know how to diſcover
the force of our Temper, we ſhould have it
leſs difficult to ſucceed in any thing we had a
mind to undertake. When we renounce our
own humour to imitate that of another, we
reſemble them who forſake a good Patrimony
to go and ſeek their Fortune: We do like
<hi>Mark Antony,</hi> who might have lov'd a moſt
excellent Beauty in <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet he went as
far as <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſeek one far inferiour. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to renounce our own humour that we
may take up another, is like the leaving an
<hi>Octavia</hi> for a <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> it is to deſpiſe what
is our own, as that <hi>Roman</hi> Prince did, though
it be very excellent; to love a ſtrange thing
though that be but indifferent. Let the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
take notice, That they ſhall much better
ſucceed in all that they do or forbear, if they
know how to diſcover and learn the excellency
or worth of their Temperament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:61440:145"/>
Here is the ſcource of the greateſt diſorders.
While we are ignorant of what Nature can
do, we would fain be acquiring what it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
A chearful humour would fain affect
the Gravity of the Melancholick, and the
Melancholick would affect the Vigour and
Fierceneſs of the Cholerick. Inſtead of
finding out what there is of good in our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
we quit it whole, and go out of our
ſelves to follow an example that is inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to us, and that hinders the raiſing our
ſelves to any higher point of Perfection. If
we could but obſerve the Seeds of Vertue that
Nature has ſcattered in us, we might, without
doubt, render our ſelves the more perfect,
and the more happy. We ſhould become the
more perfect, becauſe we ſhould have leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to acquire a perfection conform to our
Humour: and we ſhould be the happier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Actions would be without conſtraint,
and we ſhould employ none but ſuitable and
agreeable means for the attaining that Felicity.</p>
            <p>But it is an Unhappineſs (ſays <hi>Cicero)</hi>
that we ſuck in error as it were with our
Milk. That we may obey Cuſtom, Truth
muſt give place to Vanity, and Nature to
Opinion. We are ſo confounded in the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Opinions, and Impreſſions that they
give us from the Cradle, that we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
our ſelves even when we are at an Age
ſufficient for the making this Reflection. We
are Ignorant of the Capacity of our own
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61440:145"/>
Genius, and take more notice of what others
do than of what we our ſelves are able to
do. In this we are like thoſe unnatural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that careſs and ſhow kindneſs more to
the Children of others than their own, and
love better an adopted Child than one born by
themſelves. This is from want of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if we would go where Nature calls us,
we ſhould more often come near to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and happineſs; and from the
want of conſidering too, that whatever we
do which is contrary to our Humour, it
can have neither Freedom, nor a good
Grace.</p>
            <p>I DENY NOT for all this but there
are bad Inclinations: and there is often that
which needs reforming in our Humour; but
we have herein great Evidence of the Power
of Nature, in that 'tis ſo difficult a thing to
correct the Defects of our Temperament, or
to overcome the Vices we are naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to. And this is not only true of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons, but alſo of whole Nations.
There are Vices naturaliz'd to Countries, ſo
as that they cannot be rooted out but with
a great deal of difficulty and labour. Let
us do what we can we ſhall never get a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Victory over natural Inclinations. If
this Man be a lover of Learning he reads
Books to the point of Death: If the other
be born with the Gift of Rallery, he jeſts
even to the laſt moment of his Life.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61440:146"/>
To have a deſire to conquer entirely ones
Nature, is as if a Man would ſain leap away
from his Shadow, or be ſeparated from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
We may mortifie our natural Paſſions,
but we can never utterly kill them; we may
hinder them from domineering, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hinder them from rebelling. If they are
ruled, yet they will be troubleſome; we may
ſtop and reſtrain their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urſe for a little
while, but afterwards t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> will break out
like an Impetuous Torrent, and carry away
all that ſtands in their way. At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Nero</hi> could be wiſe for a few Years,
but at laſt, the Conduct of <hi>Seneca</hi> muſt give
place to his Temper, and the Perſon he
acted be changed for the Perſon he was.</p>
            <p>We return to our ſelves: There will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſomething of our Humour eſcape us,
notwithſtanding the Efforts of Reaſon or
the Precepts of Philoſophy. If our ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does continue tamed for a while; yet it
will do at length like the Bear in <hi>Martial</hi> that
fell upon his Maſter and devoured him, even
after he had been tamed many Years. How
ſtrange are the Effects of Nature! There are
ſome who perhaps ſhow not the Vices of
their Temper but towards the end of their
Days. <hi>Pliny</hi> had reaſon to ſay, That as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Indians</hi> there are ſome Countries
where the Hair of the People is white while
they are young, and grows black with Age:
ſo we ſee ſome Perſons that are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61440:146"/>
and well governed while they are
young, who in a riper Age give themſelves
to nothing elſe but Sports and Liberty and
Debauchery. There were in them the Seeds
of Evil that did not ſprout nor put forth till
the Autumn of their Lives.</p>
            <p>Nature will have always its Courſe, and
what Education ſoever may be employ'd to
correct it, yet in the end it will make appear
what of Good or Evil it has in it. There is
an inſtance ſufficiently famous among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to demonſtrate this, that is, in the two
Daughters of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> They were both
brought up in the ſame Court, they had the
ſame Inſtructions, and the ſame Examples,
and nevertheleſs <hi>Livia</hi> never cared for any
but Licentious Company; and <hi>Julia</hi> always
loved the Converſation of ſuch as were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and wiſe. They were ſeen at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Shows, the one ſurrounded with Lewd
Courtiers, the other with Philoſophers. Tho
theſe Princeſſes had the ſame Education, yet
they were very different in their Courſe of
Life; and while they both follow'd their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
the one was Vertuous, the other
Debauched. Thus we ſee what a good or
bad Nature can do: Let us now obſerve how
abſolutely neceſſary it is to have a good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER IS ſaid in favour of
Nature or Birth it ſtill ſeems to me that
Education is yet more requiſite. The former
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61440:147"/>
depends upon Chance, and the other upon
our Endeavour. Education is neceſſary to
all ſorts of Perſons. It makes thoſe Women
that have a good Temperament become the
more perfect, and thoſe who have a bad one,
it renders the leſs inſupportable. It gives
Luſtre to the one ſort, and repairs in ſome
meaſure the Defects of the other. As Lead
was more valuable when form'd by the Art
of that Excellent Statuary <hi>Phidias,</hi> than an
unſhapen Lump of Gold; ſo an indifferent
Nature will ſucceed better with an excellent
Education, than an excellent Nature with an
ill Education.</p>
            <p>We have mentioned in the beginning of this
Diſcourſe the Three Principles of <hi>Plato,</hi> but
here we muſt place the Three Principles of
<hi>Plutarch.</hi> We can do nothing with any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(ſaid he) in Vertue or in the Sciences
without Nature, Knowledge and Uſe. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gives the Capacity, Reaſon ſhows the
Rules, and Uſe gives us Exerciſe for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a readineſs and habit. Knowledge
without Nature is rude, and Nature without
Knowledge is blind; but both the one and
the other is ſtill imperfect without Experience.
We may ſee then how neceſſary Education is,
ſince it includes Art and Experience; and in
that it poliſhes and compleats what Nature
had but begun. If Nature gives Matter, it is
Education that gives Form and Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:61440:147"/>
It is for this reaſon that our Anceſtors were
of Opinion, we are indebted but little leſs
to thoſe that teach than to thoſe that have
begotten us; ſince if the latter have given us
Life, the other give us Knowledge, without
which Life would be but troubleſome and
unpleaſant. It was for this reaſon that the
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> choſe one of the wiſeſt and
moſt able Perſons among their Magiſtrates
for the Inſtructing, and bringing up of their
Children. It was for this reaſon that <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eocles</hi>
would needs have old Men given in Hoſtage
to <hi>Antipater</hi> rather than young Perſons, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leaſt their youth might be corrupted in
a Foreign Country. It was laſtly for this
Reaſon the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> were wont to ſay,
That the Education of Children is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>And in truth they were not in the wrong,
when they believed that the Happineſs of
Eſtates and Provinces depends much upon the
good Education of Children; for 'tis no
eaſie matter to retain the People in due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
when they are brought up with
Principles of Rebellion. Moreover, Nature
only gives us a ſenſe of private good and
advantage, but Education teaches us the ſenſe
we ought to have of the Publick Intereſts.
Nature carries us to Liberty, but Education
keeps us within our Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:61440:148"/>
Good Education then is altogether neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to both Sexes, whatever good Fortune they
have in their Birth: How good ſoever the
Mold is, yet there muſt be an Husbandman
and there muſt be Seed to make it bring forth
a Crop of Corn; ſo though our Nature be
excellent in its ſelf, there muſt be added
moreover good Inſtructions and good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for the making it bring forth good
Fruits: I may well ſay further, That as the
beſt Mold bears nothing but Briers if it be
not cultivated, ſo the beſt Natural Parts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
but very ill things if they are left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſcipline. Nature employs all her force
towards ill things, it is neceſſary then that
we retrench our Inclinations, as the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Branches of Trees are pruned away,
that ſo the Sap may be all ſpent upon thoſe
which muſt bear Fruit. I confeſs that we muſt
ſometimes have regard to temper, for that
as every ſort of Land will not bear every
ſort of Seed, ſo every Humour is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all ſorts of Impreſſions. If Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without Art has no certainty; Art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Nature has no ſtrength nor ſweetneſs:
It muſt needs be then that in this caſe the
Form muſt have Matter to ſuſtain it, and the
Accident muſt ſupport it ſelf by ſome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>I CONFESS that Nature is ſomewhat
neceſſary to our ſucceeding well, but it muſt
alſo be owned that it may be conſtrain'd; and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61440:148"/>
that there is no leſs labour neceſſary to the
excelling in a Vertue to which we have an
Inclination, than for that to which we have
none at all. In truth this Point of Morality
is not leſs agreeable than neceſſary. That
we may not abuſe our ſelves then in this
matter, it is convenient to obſerve that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does not give us an Inclination to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
ſo much as to the extreams about it.
It mounts to an Exceſs or falls even to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
if it be not faſtened in the point of
Mediocrity by the means of Education and
Art. Nature needs either a Bridle or Spur,
it either freezes or burns, it paſſes from
one extream to another, if Education does
not ſhow it the Middle where Vertue
dwells.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, when Nature carries us
to any exceſs, as to Raſhneſs or Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
we are thought to have an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſome Vertue there, where in truth
we do only encline to a Vice. It is for
this reaſon that Morality has much more
difficulty to cure the Diſtempers of the Soul,
than Medicine has to heal thoſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Phyſick hardly heals thoſe Diſtempers
that proceed from Want, and Morality can
hardly conquer thoſe which proceed from
Abundance. Phyſick more eaſily retrenches
what is ſuperfluous, than it can repair what
is wanting; Morality does more eaſily repair
than retrench.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61440:149"/>
So much truth there is in this, that we have
ſometimes moſt difficulty to do well even on
that ſide to which our Inclination moſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
us. It is harder for a Prodigal Perſon
to become rightly liberal than for one that
is covetous. It is more eaſie to raiſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
up to a Mediocrity than to bring an
Exceſs down to it. Behold the reaſon of
this: It is becauſe the Exceſs allures us with
more of Pleaſure than the Defect; and though
the two Extreams are equally Vicious, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
we carry our ſelves more freely to
that which is exceſſive than to that which is
defective. We rather chuſe what is too
much than what is too little: We love to
be ſwoln and puffed up with Fat, even till
we grow unwieldy, rather than to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
and lean: It ſeems to us as if there were
more Courage and Excuſe for Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by Prodigality than by Avarice, and by
Raſhneſs than Fearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>It is certain then that Nature gives us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Regular; it only makes us Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
or Raſh; it is only Art or Education
that can teach us how we muſt govern our
ſelves to be rightly liberal or courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It is not difficult to judge from hence
that they who ſeem to have the beſt Nature,
have need of the beſt Education, to the end
they may retrench or regulate that which
Nature has given them. Let us declare the
truth: A Lady born with the faculty of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61440:149"/>
Speaking readily, will, without Education,
become a meer Tatler: A ſerious Humour
will become Moroſe; A Prudent Wit will
grow crafty and deceitful. Nature wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
if we do not conduct and guide it;
even the force and vigour of it becomes
prejudicial, if we have not Art and Light
for it to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>BUT IF I ſuppoſe all that which I have
been laſt ſpeaking may be falſe, and that
it is more eaſie to become exactly Vertuous
in that to which we incline than in that
which we do not incline to, what praiſe
then would be merited hereby? What great
matter is it for a Man to be good, when
he cannot be bad? What honour can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to deſerve in being Vertuous there
where we cannot offend but by conſtraint,
and endeavour? If there be good fortune in
this, yet there is no glory due to it. It
is no more a matter of Praiſe to have a Vertue
ſo natural than to be born with a fair Face
or a robuſt Body. And, to ſpeak rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter, it muſt be ſaid, Thoſe
Vertues which are natural to us proceed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often from an ill Principle; the Patience
that is natural comes from Flegm and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity;
the Boldneſs that is allied to the
Temperament, comes from Ignorance or want
of Wit. And eſpecially ſince there is no
liberty nor choice in the matter, there can
be neither any glory or merit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61440:150"/>
But if I grant there is ſome knowledge
and choice attending the practice of thoſe
Vertues; yet certainly where there is ſo
much eaſineſs to do what is done, it muſt
be reckon'd to deſerve the leſs Praiſe. It
was not ſo much a matter of wonder to
ſee <hi>Demades</hi> become a good Orator as it was
for <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to be ſo: I ſay <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
becauſe Nature had ſeem'd to deny him both
Tongue and Lungs; and yet he rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo admirable in Eloquence, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
alone is ſufficient to ſhow that there
is almoſt nothing impoſſible to Art, and that
there is hardly any defect which we
may not correct, as he did his, by labour
and ſtudy. It is in this that we merit the
greateſt glory; when notwithſtanding a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
repugnance and averſion that we have to
do well in any caſe, yet we do not fail to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a habit of doing it. Certainly to raiſe
a Vertue in a Temper that is contrary to it,
is to do as thoſe Kings, who, to ſhow their
Power, cauſe Palaces and places of Pleaſure
to be made in Deſarts and upon Rocks.
What a glory was it to <hi>Heraclides</hi> to become
a Philoſopher, when he had ſo very little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Wiſdom? and for <hi>Socrates</hi> to
become a good Man, who had ſo little Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Vertue? What a glory is it to ſee a
Perſon Chaſt while Nature makes the Blood
boil high in the Veins? How glorious was
it to ſee a Philoſopher drag a trembling Body
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61440:150"/>
to the Wars, and to ſee a Spirit bold while
the ſenſe is weak and fearful? In truth, I
love better the Courage of <hi>Cato</hi> than that of
<hi>Ajax.</hi> I like the Boldneſs that is founded in
Reaſon, rather than that which proceeds from
the Blood. I do not wonder at all that the
Blind make nothing of Lightning, or that the
Deaf are not terrified at Thunder. In the
ſame Proportion that there is a want of the
knowledge of an evil, there muſt be, without
doubt, a want of the fear of it. That only
amazes me, to ſee ſo many great Perſons who
have acquir'd the Habits of many Vertues,
when they had not the leaſt Diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them.</p>
            <p>There is then a much greater Glory in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
the Repugnancy that we have to
Good, than in only letting our ſelves be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with the Inclination that we have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to it. And upon this account it is,
that Education is altogether requiſite; ſince
this poliſhes yet further a good Nature, and
corrects the faults of a bad one. It is for
this Reaſon, that there is not a Perſon ſo
unhappy in his Birth, who may not with ſome
hopes aſpire after Perfection; ſince we have
the Examples of ſo many great Spirits, that
have ſurmounted the Wickedneſs of their
Temper, and conquer'd the natural Averſion
that was in them to Good. For this Reaſon
we ought to have a great Eſteem of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſince it will ſerve us as our Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61440:151"/>
both for Food and Phyſick: It heals Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and it maintains Health: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
what is Good, and corrects that which
is Evil.</p>
            <p>LET US PROCEED to that which
is of moſt Importance. That we may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
well in this Matter we muſt begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to render our ſelves capable of true
Goodneſs, by the Means of a religious Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſince whatever the natural Repugnance may
be, that we have to any Evil, there is ſtill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of Vertue to be acquired, and of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to be overcome, to give us a great
deal of Labour. Obſerve here the Advice
which ſeems to me of more than ordinary
Uſefulneſs. We cannot ſet our ſelves too
ſoon to learn the Hatred of Vice, and the
Love of Vertue. I cannot approve of the
Opinion of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who forbids to teach Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
any thing before they are ſeven years of
Age. And I like that of <hi>Cryſippus</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who maintained, That in the ſhort Life
of Man, there could be no Time well afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be loſt. Can we begin too ſoon to heap
up thoſe good things in which we can never
become rich enough? Can we ſtudy too early
any Science, in which we can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
perfect.</p>
            <p>Men complain of the Length of Art, and
the Shortneſs of Life. But if we would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Errour herein, we ſhould own,
that this Unhappineſs comes not from hence,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61440:151"/>
that our Life is too ſoon at an end; but from
our Beginning in Vertue or Learning too late.
We might render it much the longer for the
Knowledge of good things, if we would begin
to live and to ſtudy together. They that do
not awake till Noon, have no right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that the Day is too ſhort: They might
have retarded the Evening by making a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Uſe of the Morning. Since we cannot
ſet the Period further off, at leaſt let us begin
the ſooner: Let us advance the Beginning,
ſince we cannot keep back the End.</p>
            <p>When is it then that they ought to take
care about the Education of Children? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they cannot begin too early to teach
them that which they ought to practice
through their whole Lives. As <hi>Lalius</hi> among
the Heathens taught his Daughter from the
Cradle the Laws of Eloquence, that ſhe might
know how to ſpeak well: So S. <hi>Jerom</hi> taught
<hi>Pacatula</hi> the Laws of Chriſtianity from the
very Breaſts, that ſhe might know how to live
religiouſly. What is there we ought rather
to know than Religion? and wherein can we
more worthily employ the firſt Fruits of our
Reaſon, and the firſt Eſſays of Speech, than
to acknowledge and adore him who has given
us one and the other of theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> knew the Law before
they knew their own Names. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
that we ought to begin our Chriſtian
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61440:152"/>
Education. It ought not to be ſaid, that at
ſuch an Age we are capable of ſo ſerious a
Knowledge. Certainly Childhood is capable
of learning the Laws of Religion, if it be
not of putting them in Practice: This Age is
capable of the Functions of the Memory, if
not of thoſe of the Judgment. Therefore the
Poets feign, that the moſt ancient of the Muſes
is <hi>Mnemoſyne,</hi> that is to ſay, the Memory; to
ſhew that this is the firſt Thing whereof we
are capable. For, as there can be nothing
expected from a Field that is never ſown; ſo
there can be nothing hoped for from all our
Endeavours, if this Mother of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
lies barren. It ought therefore to be
rendred fruitful betimes by an holy Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the end it may produce wholſome
Effects, when we ſhall have the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Underſtanding. Children are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to receive, if they are not to produce.
They are capable of Impreſſion, if not of
Action.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge of Good, forms it ſelf in
the Soul, juſt as the Seed ſhoots in the Earth:
There is a time when they are hid; there is
another when they flouriſh, and wherein they
bear Fruit. Ah, how happy are thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that know Heaven before Earth; and
learn Devotion before Vanity! This divine
Foundation can never be ruin'd: What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
at firſt in this clean Paper, can never
be got out again. The holy Scent with
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61440:152"/>
which the new Veſſel is perfum'd, will abide
in it a long time. For this Reaſon, 'tis high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
important that they ſhould have Impreſſions
of Good made in them, before they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to thoſe of Evil. And if <hi>Quinctilian</hi> wiſh'd,
that even the Nurſe ſhould be Eloquent for
the making an Oratour, and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Forming of the Speech of Children; there
would be reaſon alſo to deſire that ſhe were
devout for the better Forming of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and to lay betimes the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Vertue.</p>
            <p>I do not intend herein, that we ſhould
begin all at once to make Children learn
the higheſt Myſteries of our Religion: We
muſt accommodate Inſtruction to their Minds,
as we need to do Food to their Stomachs;
and give them firſt Milk before we give them
any ſolid Nouriſhment. I know well enough
we cannot reaſonably attempt to make the
little Creature ſenſible of the Grandeur of
the Eternal. Glory, which would deſire a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Plum
more; or to teach the Worth of
Obedience to her that lifts a little Hand to
ſtrike her Mother. I know well, that the
Knowledge of Chriſtianity has, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
ſpeaks, certain Degrees, and even ſeveral
Ages, wherein to grow and raiſe it ſelf by
little and little.</p>
            <p>But after all, ſuppoſing that Children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend that which is ſo elevated,
muſt we therefore not teach them any thing
but what is ſuperfluous and idle? Why is it,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61440:153"/>
do we think, that they are always in Action,
and play ſo many Tricks? Is not this as a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Complaint of the Time which they are
ſuffered to loſe? Is not this a ſign that
they want better Employment; and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
already they might be buſied about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe than in Play, and about Babies?
I do not herein deſire that any ſhould faſten
themſelves upon my Opinion. I have not ſo
great an eſteem of my own Thoughts, as to
be willing to impoſe them for a Rule to all
others. But let us obſerve what S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays
concerning the Education of the young <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catula;</hi>
and which may be of great uſe to
thoſe of her Sex.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">As ſoon (ſays he) as She ſhall have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Age of ſeven Years, let her learn
the Pſalter by heart, and let the holy Scripture
be all the Treaſure of her Soul: She ought
to begin to be inſtructed (he adds) as ſoon as
ſhe begins to bluſh. As ſoon as they are capable
of Shame, they are capable of Diſcipline.
From the Time that they ſhow the Marks
of their Conſcience upon the Countenance,
it ought to be believed that Remorſe has
taken place of Innocence; ſince they alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
know to put a Difference between
Good and Evil.</q> See here the Opinion of
that holy Man, which perhaps, may ſeem
too ſevere to a great many. But let the World
think of it what they will; the Corruption
of Education which we commonly ſee is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
Diſorder: When we may ſee Young
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61440:153"/>
Perſons allow'd all manner of Liberty; and
that they are praiſed for that which they
ought to be corrected for; and as if there
were a Fear that they ſhould not learn to ſin
ſoon enough; they are accuſtomed to ſee
and to do Evil, to the end they may have
the leſs Fear, when they ſhall be arrived to
a riper Age.</p>
            <p>THAT NONE MAY accuſe me of too
much Severity, I declare, that too great a
Reſtraint is often very dangerous; and the
<hi>Danae,</hi> whom the Poets tell of, was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that Tower where her Parents had
ſhut her up, to keep her ſafe. This Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was more dangerous to her, than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
might have been. I own, that as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
pent in, ruſh with the greater Violence
when they get looſe; ſo thoſe humours that
have been too hardly uſed, fly out with the
greater Licenſe, when they can meet with a
favourable Occaſion. Laſtly, I grant that
there ought to be Moderation uſed in this
Matter: That they ought not to have all
things permitted, nor all forbidden them;
that Prudence ſhould ſhew us a certain Path
between Licentiouſneſs and Tyranny; and
that we ſhould mannage wiſely our Promiſes,
and Threatnings; our Sweetneſs and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
            <p>BUT HOWEVER, in my Opinion,
Reſtraint is more ſafe for this Age than Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
And if one has not a very good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
the Chains of Fear hold us to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61440:154"/>
our Duty much better than the Cords of
Love. Gentleneſs is good for thoſe who
have ſome Knowledge and a good Wit; but
to thoſe that want theſe, it is very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
If they have a good Nature, Liberty
may corrupt it: If a vicious one, they want
nothing but Occaſions or Opportunities to do
ill. It ſeems to me convenient to treat young
Perſons as they do thoſe that are ſick: We
muſt have regard to what is profitable to
them, not to what would be moſt pleaſing.
There is too great Hazard in committing
them to their own Conduct: Diſtruſt in this
Caſe is one of the fitteſt Parts of Prudence;
which ought not only to regard the Evils im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending,
but alſo thoſe that are poſſible, ſo
as to make Proviſion againſt them. By keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them at a Diſtance from Temptation and
Opportunity; at leaſt, we take from them
the Effects, if we take not the Deſires: If
the Venom ſtays with them of a vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it is hinder'd from hurting. And that
we may the better make it appear how far
the Fear of Danger ought to extend, let us
obſerve, that S. <hi>Jerom</hi> did forbid to the
young <hi>Pacatula,</hi> not only the Company at
Balls and Comedies, but alſo even the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of the Church, when there was Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Theſe, in truth, are Holy Places; but
there are in them ſometimes Spectators and
Occaſions that are Profane.</p>
            <p>BUT IF WE enquire further into the
Original of Evil, we ſhall find that the greateſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61440:154"/>
Danger of Corruption for young Children, is
very often Domeſtick. And if many Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have the Vices of their Mothers; this is
by Imitation as well as by Reſemblance in
Diſpoſition. A bad Example has no leſs
Power and Influence in the Matter of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
than the Blood has upon the Birth.
I bluſh when I conſider the Diſorder of the
Age. How is it poſſible, that this Child
ſhould not be addicted to Gaming, who has,
perhaps, hardly ever ſeen his Father without
the Dice or Cards in his Hand? And how
can this Daughter be Chaſt, who knows her
Mother daily ſighing after her Gallants;
who ſees her, every Moment receiving Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Letters;
and never hears her ſpeak but of
Walks, and Aſſignations that are ſuſpected?
Beſides this; How can we reprove them for
a Vice, who have ſeen us committing the
ſame? To ſpeak the Truth; Whatever
Menaces, whatever Lectures we give them,
ſtill the Example ſhall have more Power to
carry them to Ill, than Corrections or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddings
can have to withhold them from it.
As the Vine lifts it ſelf upon the firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it can find; ſo Childhood conforms its
ſelf to the firſt Model that it ſees: Not
being yet able to act by reaſon it moves by
Example. Childhood receives the bad Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
eaſily, but they cannot be defaced again,
but with a great deal of Difficulty. And if
the Apoſtles ſeem'd to find it difficult to drive
out a Devil from one that had been poſſeſs'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61440:155"/>
from his Youth; we ought to believe this a
Miracle very rare, The Converſion of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
debauched from his Childhood. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Education is bad, Vice gets ſo
deep rooting in our Souls, that it is in a manner
impoſſible to get rid of it. And let it be
judged what Hope there is of ſaving a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when a vicious Habit is added to a vicious
Nature. To oblige Mothers to think the
more ſeriouſly of this Matter, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Examples, as well ſacred as profane,
which might be produced; but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf, to ſhew them that of the <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>
in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> This illuſtrious Lady being
now well advanced in Years, made her ſelf
be taught the Arts and Languages, to the
end that ſhe might be able to teach them
her ſelf to her Children. She did not at all
think it ſufficient to give them Life by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them forth, if ſhe did not alſo render them
vertuous by their Education. How lovely
is this Example! From hence we may learn
that the Mothers who have no Merit nor
Goodneſs, ought to acquire it, at leaſt, on
purpoſe for the Inſtruction of their Children.
And if a Heathen had ſo much Care for
the teaching of her Children to ſpeak well,
how much more ſhould the Chriſtian Ladies
have for the Inſtructing of theirs to live well?</p>

            <head>Of an Equal Mind under Good and
Bad Fortune.</head>
            <p>IT IS NOT a ſmall difficulty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
whether the Women are more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Moderation in a good Fortune, or of
Patience in a bad one. Whether they are
more ſubject to Deſpair under Affliction, or
to Inſolence when they are Proſperous; ſince,
to ſpeak the truth, both Grief and Pleaſure
ſometimes do no leſs harm to our Spirits
than Froſts or great Hearts of the Sun do
to Flowers; and as a Flame goes out by
either too little or too much of the Matter
that feeds them, ſo the Spirit is loſt by too
little or too much of Contentment. If our
Fickleneſs be well examin'd, it will be found
to proceed from theſe two ſources. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
aſſaults us with Sword or Poiſon: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
us either with the Face of a <hi>Syren,</hi> or with
that of a <hi>Fury:</hi> and for fear leaſt we ſhould
avoid the miſchiefs ſhe intends, ſhe will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
even that which is good to the doing of
us harm.</p>
            <p>Let us not diſſemble our weakneſs; we wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
both in one and the other Fortune.
And as the Painters obſerve, the ſame
wrinckles of the Face ſerve both for laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and crying; ſo certainly experience ſhows
that we laugh and weep very often
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61440:156"/>
like Children for the ſame cauſe. I will ſay
ſomewhat more; The ſame Perſons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
too much in what favours them, are
alſo too ſad under evil. The defect as
well as exceſs cauſes inequality in them; and
as thoſe Bodies which are very ſenſible of heat,
are alike ſenſible of cold, ſo thoſe Spirits
that ſuffer themſelves to be too much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with Grief, do alſo ſuffer themſelves
to be too much tranſported with Pleaſure;
they are commonly the ſame Perſons who are
ſubject to Inſolence and Impatience. There
are few Perſons who know how to regulate
their Reſentments, and who can ſhow a
ſtrength of Spirit on great occaſions of Joy
or Grief. There are few that are like <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
in this, who always ſhow'd a Countenance
and Mind equal in all ſorts of Occurrences.
We ſuffer our ſelves to be carried away with
the Stream; Occaſions command us; We
are like thoſe Birds that are ſwimming upon
the Water during a Tempeſt, that are exalted
or abaſed by the Wave that carries them.</p>
            <p>LET NOT ANY imagine now that
to deſcribe an equal Mind I will make a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
one. I deſire the Lady to be Prudent not
Unſenſible. I do not mean that ſhe ſhould
quite rid her ſelf of Paſſions, but that ſhe
ſhould tame them. This would be no leſs
unjuſt than impoſſible. But if this were a
thing that could be done, were it not a very
inhumane Philoſophy that ſhould renounce
Compaſſion and Mercy, or Love and Hope?
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61440:156"/>
A great Perſon of the preſent time had
reaſon to ſay, That to think of taking away
the Paſſions entirely, were to propoſe the
turning of a Man into a Rock, or a God,
by putting him either too much above, or
too much beneath reſentment. The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Epictetus</hi> in this matter ſeems to me
admirable. We ought not to be without Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(ſays he) as the Brutes, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon as Fools, but we ought to be ſo
ſenſible as ſtill to know how to oppoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to Grief; becauſe when we live after that
manner, we ſhow that we can be Sick, and
can cure our ſelves; that we have both a
ſence and wiſdom. Or otherwiſe we ſhould
not have an equality of Mind, but a ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:
and it were to ſhow that we have either
no reſentment, or no reaſon to govern it.</p>
            <p>And in truth, I cannot approve of a Mind
conſtant after the Stoical manner. The Wiſe
Perſon they would frame, reſembles the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
in <hi>Pindar,</hi> who had a Skin ſo hard that
it could reſiſt Arrows and Darts, though he
were perfectly naked.</p>
            <p>Their Inſenſible Philoſopher ſeems to be
compoſed of <hi>Adamant;</hi> he is ſhut up cloſe,
but will not acknowledge himſelf a Priſoner;
though he grows old, yet he does not think
himſelf wearing out; he is Ugly, but very
agreeable however; he is a King, but enjoys
nothing but his Arguments; he poſſeſſes all
things, but begs his Bread; his Fancy ſerves
him for a Horn of Plenty, even in Poverty
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61440:157"/>
it ſelf; and, to ſay truth, he is not happy,
but only becauſe he is unwiſe.</p>
            <p>This Stoical Spirit will not ſuffer itſelf to
be touched with Joy any more than with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
To be of an equal Mind according to
the Mode of this Sect, one muſt not put ones
ſelf to any trouble if a Friend be Sick, or
Unfortunate. We ought not any more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
at a Good Fortune, than to make our
ſelves ſad at an Evil one: A ſtate of good
Health ſhould no more render us content, than
that of Sickneſs. We muſt even paſs from
one to the other of theſe without any reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the change.</p>
            <p>See here the equal Mind of the Stoicks!
But is not this a very extravagant Morality?
Muſt it not be ſaid, That thoſe who maintain
this Doctrine might more fitly call themſelves
Poets than Philoſophers? And are not their
Wiſe Men like the Mighty Knights in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
that ſtop Rivers, and encounter the
Stars themſelves, and carry away every where
Prodigious Victories? It is not at all of this ſort
that I deſire a well compoſed Mind to be; I
do not ſeek for an imaginary force of Mind,
and ſuch as would deſtroy Humanity inſtead
of regulating it. I deſire only a Wiſdom
that is poſſible and reaſonable. I declare,
That there are times and occaſions wherein
one may very juſtly weep or laugh, and may
be joyful or ſad. Alſo I judge, that when
<hi>Euphrante</hi> had loſt an Excellent Wife, he had
reaſon to complain of his Philoſophy; for
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61440:157"/>
that it commands us (as he ſaid) to love
that which is good, and yet forbids us to be
grieved when we have loſt it.</p>
            <p>Since we ought to expreſs a joy when we have
with us an Object that pleaſes us, may we not
alſo teſtifie ſome regret when we have it no
longer? That which any poſſeſs with love,
they cannot loſe but with grief. It is no leſs
natural to be ſad for the preſence of Evil,
than to be joyful for the preſence of good.
Provided there be no exceſs in theſe things, it
is but a mad Philoſophy that would forbid us
the having reſentments ſo natural and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
To be joyful in the Morning upon good
Tidings, and ſad in the Evening for bad News,
this is not a Vicious inequality, this change is
juſt: and as our Taſte is diverſly affected with
that which is bitter or with that which is
ſweet, our Mind alſo muſt be moved with that
which is good or evil. What danger is there
in owning that our Soul is capable of joy and
ſadneſs, as well as our Senſes are of Pain or
Pleaſure? In truth it may be ſaid, That Reaſon
is not contrary to Nature, and it is poſſible to
ſhow our ſelves wiſe and ſenſible both at once.</p>
            <p>Let us make this Error yet a little more
manifeſt. There are ſome that think it a
great effect of Conſtancy to make no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of any evil that they endure: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is ſometimes no leſs danger than
blindneſs in ſo doing: It is a Vanity that has
coſt many Ladies very dear, while they have
encreaſed their ill by being deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61440:158"/>
it, and becauſe they would not ſhed a
few Tears, they have been ſeen to Die ſuddenly
upon the place. Since our Lord Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
willingly teſtified his Grief by weeping,
and ſurely none can accuſe him of having an
uneven or unconſtant Mind; we may declare
That Weeping and Complaint do not always
teſtifie Impatience, but only they ſhow that
we are not utterly inſenſible. Let us declare,
That if God himſelf was pleaſed to ſhow that
he was indeed Man too by ſadneſs, and
tears; we ought not to be aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our ſelves ſuch likewiſe by the ſame
ſigns and appearances. However it be a ſign
of weakneſs to do thus, yet is this ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
in this World that there is no more
blame due to a Man for being liable to Grief,
than for being ſubject to Die? We are no more
unſenſible in this Life than we are Immortal.</p>
            <p>After all, what advantage is it to be ſullen
in our Griefs? Were it not better to diminiſh
our diſpleaſure by weeping, than to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
into a Pillar of Salt, inſtead of letting
this bitterneſs drop out by the Eyes, or of
breathing it off with a few Complaints? A
great Poet had reaſon to ſay, That the
Tears as well as Waters have a right to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and we ought to moderate only, not
forbid the uſe of them. Grief is ſometimes
like a Stream, it ſwells if it be reſiſted; it ſlides
away and is ſpent in the leſs time if we give
it way. Provided we can overcome this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
what matter is it whether we do this by
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61440:158"/>
flying or fighting him? But certainly I fear
I may be accuſed for want of Judgment, for
my inſiſting upon this matter, in as much as
it ſeems no way neceſſary to allow Women the
liberty to complain of their Grievances, and
the moſt part of them ſeem to underſtand the
trade of that but too well. They mightily
extol the Conſtancy and Strength of Mind
that was in <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe
ſhe did not ſo much as complain under Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the extreameſt Pains. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
they find at times enough of their Sex
who have a Vice quite contrary to her Vertue;
ſuch who do not only complain with Reaſon,
but with Artifice too; and who would ſeldom
be long ill, if Complaining were enough to
cure them.</p>
            <p>However that be, we may learn from what
has been ſaid, that to have an equal Mind it
is not neceſſary that we always abſtain both
from laughing or weeping. It were a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
too Stoical, that would not permit any
but the ſame reſentment to events, that are
favourable or deadly. I judge that according
to the occaſions that preſent whether they be
Good or Evil, a Wiſe Man may be joyful or
griev'd; yea, I believe that he may complain
when he has cauſe without being guilty of
Cowardlineſs in ſo doing: and that he need
not be too much a Philoſopher as <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi>
who would needs appear well when he was
really Sick. Let us proceed further, and
having ſeen wherein the equality of Mind
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61440:159"/>
does not conſiſt, let us obſerve wherein it
does; and having overthrown the Opinion of
the Vulgar, let us examine that of the Wiſe in
this Matter.</p>
            <p>I grant then, that as there are many ſorts
of Winds upon the Sea that can toſs the
Ships, ſo there are alſo many ſorts of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
within us to trouble and ſhake our
Minds: But it muſt be own'd that among all
theſe Movements there are but two principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which cauſe the moſt remarkable changes
in us; I mean, when the preſence of Good
gives us too much joy, or that of Evil too
much Grief. There are ſome Paſſions that
make the Blood fly out too much to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of the Body, there are others that
cauſe it to retire and throng too much about
the Heart; and then that dilates or contracts
it ſelf too much. As it may be ſeen that
fair Weather envites us to walk, and a Storm
drives us into the Houſe: In like manner, the
Occaſions of joy make us go too much out of
our ſelves, thoſe of ſadneſs make us retire
too much within our ſelves. The Exceſs of the
one and the other hinders the due equality of
the Mind. It remains then only at preſent that
we ſhow which of theſe two Paſſions gives
us the greater trouble and diſorder; and to
ſee whether there be more danger of being too
joyful in a Good Fortune, or of being too
ſad in a Bad one.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY there are more die of
Grief than of Joy, and there are more Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61440:159"/>
in Tempeſts than in Calms. Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
deſtroys leſs than Adverſity. And it is
not to be imagin'd that Good ſhould do as
much Evil as Evil it ſelf. Though all the
Paſſions are able to cauſe ſome inequality in us,
yet there is none more capable to deſtroy us
than Grief: This appears ſufficiently even
in the Colour of the Face in thoſe that are
afflicted, and in the diſorder that it brings
into the Thoughts of the Wiſeſt Perſons. I
do not wonder at all that thoſe Women who
are poſſeſt with Grief are alſo pale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as if they had no Life remaining in
them: ſince, to ſpeak the truth, Grief is no
other than a long Death, and Death is no
more than a ſhort ſadneſs. And indeed Grief
keeps us too long under Puniſhment. It
would ſeem a very favourable blow that
ſhould put an end to our ſufferings though to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with our Lives. We never ſee any
that kill themſelves becauſe they are too
joyful, but there are many do that fatal Office
for themſelves becauſe they think themſelves
too much afflicted; and who take Death for
a Remedy to their Grief. How much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
does this Paſſion do both to Body and
Soul? It diſpirits the Blood, it infects the
whole Conſtitution, it gives Diſeaſes to the
Body and Inequality to the Mind: It weakens
the Inſtruments firſt and then the Reaſon: It
has ſometimes need of Phyſick as well as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
to heal it. I own that there are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſometimes wherein Afflictions quicken
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61440:160"/>
us, and open our Eyes; but if we examine
them throughly, we ſhall find that they dull
the Spirit more frequently than they awaken
and excite it.</p>
            <p>And, that we may not diſſemble the truth,
how many women may we ſee who in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
become like the <hi>Niobe</hi> of the Poets:
who loſt all ſenſe in her miſery and was turn'd
into a Marble Statue? How many are there that
grow ſtupid, and Immovable as ſhe was, who
teſtifie neither Wit nor Courage, who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
themſelves to their Grief, and are to
ſuch a degree diſabled, that they cannot make
one Effort either towards the comforting or
defending of themſelves? It ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be thought ſtrange if ſadneſs does ſo
much deſtroy the Wit, ſince as this is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
accompanied with diſpair, it makes
no reſiſtance, it ſtands with the Arms acroſs,
it gives up its ſelf a prey to the Enemy. One
may judge from hence how much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
this is than Joy, for that Moderation
depends more upon us than Patience. It is
much more difficult (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ones ſelf under Grief, than to abſtain
from pleaſure. Temperance has its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on our Liberty, but Toleration depends
upon the Malice of our Enemy. If Joy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades,
ſadneſs conſtrains us: While the one
ſolicits, the other carries us along. It is
much more in our power to defend our ſelves
from the Songs of a <hi>Syren,</hi> than from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Violence of a Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61440:160"/>
It is for this reaſon that there were ſome
Philoſophers who were of Opinion, That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
was the leaſt Voluntary of all the other
Vertues; ſince to bring that into the World,
it muſt be that ſome commit Injuries and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
endure them, and there muſt be Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that there may be Martyrs. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they think there muſt be much liberty and
freedom of our own Wills in our Patience,
ſince 'tis capable of a Reward; and if there
be ſome Pains neceſſary for the putting on this
Vertue, this is that which augments the worth
of it: For all the World know well enough
that 'tis more eaſie to reſolve the taking our
Pleaſure, than the enduring of Evil. After
this, ought it not to be own'd, that Sadneſs
has more power to deſtroy us than Joy; and
that we have more of difficulty to preſerve
our Minds, even while we are in Adverſity,
than during our Proſperity? Is it not true that
we are leſs in danger under an evil when the
remedy depends upon our ſelves, than when
it depends upon others? And muſt it not be
confeſs'd, That we are much more excuſable
when our Enemy kills us, than when we kill
our ſelves?</p>
            <p>And that we may ſhow yet further that Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is much leſs ſubject to our will than Joy;
it muſt be ſaid, That we have much leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to this than to the other. The
Tears which we ſhed when we are coming into
the World, teſtifie that we are rather born to
weep than to laugh. We are born in Tears,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61440:161"/>
we live in trouble, and die in grief. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Themiſtius</hi> ſpoke to the purpoſe, when he
ſaid, That if we naturally weep it ought not
to be a wonder, foraſmuch as that when <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>
was holding the Clay in his Hands, of
which he was to Form Man, he would not
temper it with any other Water than that
which came from his Tears.</p>
            <p>The Fable herein conceals a Truth which
Experience diſcovers to us every moment.
But if this be true of both the Sexes, it is yet
more particularly ſo concerning the Women;
to whom Sadneſs ſeems to be rather more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
than to the Men: For as their Temper has
much leſs Heat, ſo it is alſo much more capable
of this Paſſion, in Proportion as it is more moiſt;
Melancholy lodges there as in its proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and upon every the leaſt cauſe for
weeping, they are able to ſhed Tears in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
As the Worms breed rather in
that Matter which is tender, than in that
which is more hard; ſo Sadneſs forms it ſelf
more eaſily in an Effeminate Complexion, than
in one that is more Maſculine and Strong;
This natural ſoftneſs or delicacy is the moſt
ſenſible of Grief. In ſo much that if that Sex
would defend themſelves from ſorrow, they
have not only Fortune to Combate in the caſe,
but even Nature it ſelf. This is an Enemy
that they have ſo much the more reaſon to
fear for that it is Interiour and Domeſtick.</p>
            <p>All this is but little yet towards the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of that Miſchief which Sadneſs may do
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61440:161"/>
them. the Ladies ought to conſider that
this Paſſion is not only capable to craze the
Conſtitution, to disfigure the Countenance,
to trouble the Reaſon, but moreover alſo to
debauch the Conſcience. It is for this
Reaſon that the Caſuiſts forbid it as well as the
Philoſophers. And that they cannot ſay Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
ſhows us Heaven, when Proſperity
would hide it from us. Certainly if there are
Rich Men that are Impious, there be alſo
Poor that are Blaſphemers: If there are thoſe
that are Ungrateful for good, there are others
impatient under evil: If there are ſome Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in their Proſperity, there are others
deſperate in their Miſery.</p>
            <p>Let not any object to me that God makes
himſelf be acknowledged better by an evil
Fortune ſent to us than by a good one: If any
ſee this ſometimes come to paſs, they muſt
aſcribe it to our error and weakneſs. For
what reaſon is there to think that God ſhould
be more viſible to us in a Privation, than in
that which is true and ſolid? And how can this
be that he ſhould engrave the Image of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
in the Evil that he has not made, rather
than in the Good which is his Work and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Beſides why cannot we as well bleſs the
Hand that beſtows Favours, as that which
ſmites us? I grant that after it has pleaſed
God to attempt the making us love him and it
has prov'd in vain, He is as it were conſtrain'd
to make us fear him. But muſt not the Cauſe
of this be reckon'd only our own Ingratitude
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61440:162"/>
and Ignorance? Would he ever make uſe of
Severity, if we would ſuffer our ſelves to be
attracted with the Charms of his Love?</p>
            <p>Let us declare the Truth: We are no leſs
liable to offend God under an exceſs of Evil,
than in a great Proſperity; the Conſcience is
no leſs in danger in Affliction than in Felicity;
the Miſerable may conceive deſigns as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as the Happy; and if ſome are refin'd
like Gold in this Furnace of Affliction, there
are many more that are like Chaff conſum'd
in it. Laſtly, that we may ſpeak with a great
King to this caſe; We do not ſee that they
who fall into the Bottomleſs Pit do praiſe God
any more; they murmur even in Hell, but they
adore and worſhip in Paradiſe. It is not the
Mouth of the Dead, but that of the Living
that praiſes and publiſhes his Grandeur and
Power; ſee then the miſchief that Sorrow
does when 'tis exceſſive; ſee how it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Fervour from Piety, Vigour from Action,
Health from the Body, Light from the Reaſon,
and Repoſe from the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>NOW AFTER THAT we have ſeen
how much the Spirit is in danger under an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Fortune, let us ſee how much more it
is ſo under a good one. I deſire to begin to do
this on that ſide which is moſt important. A
good Fortune makes us Proud, Miſery renders
us Humble. The one makes us go out of our
ſelves, the other makes us retire and dwell at
home. This conceals our weakneſs, the other
makes us know it. <hi>Alexander</hi> learnt much
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61440:162"/>
better that he was Mortal when he ſaw
his own Blood flowing from him, than
his Father <hi>Philip</hi> did from the Meſſage
of his Page, who had it in charge to tell him
every Morning, <hi>That he was but a Man.</hi> The
Son underſtood better our Humane Miſery by
his Wound, than the Father could do it by a
Complement and Meſſage. It is ſometimes
very hard for one to know her ſelf rightly in
a great Proſperity. Vanity and Flattery hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from ſeeing rightly what we are. It is
for this reaſon we have elſewhere ſaid, That a
Good Fortune has no more true Friends than
an Evil one; becauſe if all the World ſhuns this
for fear of the Charge of Succour, no one will
approach the other, but only to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Proſperity is not only Blind, but alſo Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
as it hinders us from ſeeing our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
it does not permit us to acknowledge
with Equity the Merits of others. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reſpects are paid to it, ſtill it believes
that it merits more than it receives. One
would never be much concerned to oblige ſuch
Perſons by any Service, ſince they will hardly
believe that we have well diſcharg'd our ſelves.
Without doubt there are many could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to bluſh if they would repreſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as they ought, how often it comes to
paſs that the one poſſeſſes what the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves;
and that Fortune is ſometimes liberal
there, where Nature is more ſparing of her
Gifts.</p>
            <p>What a deal of Blindneſs is there in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61440:163"/>
World! How much do we ſee it in the Ugly
and Stupid, who nevertheleſs let themſelves
be perſwaded that they are Beautiful and very
Knowing; and they can never be undeceiv'd,
neither by the Glaſs nor any knowledge of
themſelves? See here the miſchief that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
breeds in the Mind: But this is not
all, it not only obſcures the Reaſon, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
corrupts the Conſcience, and effeminates
the Courage. The Soldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and
he that ſerv'd <hi>Lucullus,</hi> were bold only while
they were hurt; no ſooner were they cured,
but they would no more expoſe themſelves ſo
freely to Danger. The Voluptuous are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Courage as well as without Steadineſs;
<hi>Venus</hi> is as unconſtant as the Element ſhe came
out of: She, to be ſure, will not ſtay long
there, where any thing is to be endur'd; no
ſooner had <hi>Diomedes</hi> wounded her, but ſhe fled
from the defence of the beſieged <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I declare then, That if there are ſome who
deſtroy themſelves when Fortune is contrary
to them; there are yet a great many more that
debauch themſelves when ſhe is favourable.
They ſay Fortune has two Hands with which
ſhe fights us; but it muſt be confeſs'd, That if
there falls one thouſand by the left Hand of
Affliction, there falls ten for it by the right
Hand of Proſperity. Alſo experience daily
ſhows us, That Proſperity needs much leſs
time to conquer us than Adverſity: This latter
laid ſiege a long time to <hi>Troy</hi> without being able
to take it; but the other in one Night made a
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61440:163"/>
Prey of it. This City preſerv'd its ſelf under
all the Calamities of a ten Years ſiege, and at
laſt loſt her ſelf in one Night of Mirth and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch.</p>
            <p>Pleaſure corrupts all. Whatever there is of
greateſt ſtrength in the World, it grows effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in the Boſom of this Wanton: She
weakens the ſtrongeſt, and blinds the wiſeſt
Perſons. Even they ſometimes who have for
a long while reſiſted Grief, have let themſelves
be vanquiſht in a moment by Pleaſure. She
does not careſs but to deceive us; ſhe does not
lift us up but to precipitate us with the greater
fall. And to ſay ſhe does us no harm when ſhe is
kind and ſoothing, is as if one ſhould ſay, That
a Flatterer is not an Enemy, and that he who
kills one with a perfumed Poiſon is no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.
However it be, there are very few that
can defend themſelves from it; and for my
part, I eſteem much more thoſe that uſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in their Pleaſures, than thoſe that
practiſe Patience under Sufferings: It ſeems to
me that there is more eaſe in rendring ones
ſelf Victorious over Grief than over Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>They who have read in S. <hi>Jerom</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of a young Man, who was laid bound
upon a Bed of Roſes, and expoſed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt
Allurements of a Beautiful Curtezan,
who endeavour'd to corrupt him: Would
they not own to me that he endur'd more evil
upon this Bed of Flowers, than if he had been
thrown upon a heap of Thorns? and that he
had ſuffer'd leſs under the Hands of an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61440:164"/>
than he did from the Filthy Embraces
and profane Aſſaults of this Lewd Woman?
This was new kind of Martyrdom; others
ſuffer'd under Torments, he ſuffer'd under
Pleaſures. He was more impatient at the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of Pleaſure, than others in the endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Pain.</p>
            <p>How powerful is this Example! This Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Soldier was in part a Conquerour, and
partly conquer'd. His Reaſon carried away
the Victory which his Senſe loſt. But that we
may well comprehend this matter, we need
but to repreſent to our ſelves, how difficult it
is to defend our ſelves from an Enemy that
pleaſes. In the combating Pain or Adverſity
our Senſe joins with the Spirit; but when we
muſt make War with Pleaſure, the Senſe takes
part againſt the Reaſon. The Man whole and
entire reſiſts Pain; there is but half of him
that makes any reſiſtance to Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>See how difficult it is to all to maintain an
Equal Mind in all opportunities of Pleaſure;
and eſpecially is it ſo to the Ladies: For it
ſeems that Moderation in what pleaſes them
is much harder to them, than Patience under
Evil; the delicacy of their Conſtitution ſeems
to render them an eaſie prize to Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Joy ſeems to put them in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than Sorrow: They ſay that Sex have
Moiſture to maintain this withal, but not Heat
enough for the other; that their Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
depriv'd of Blood, upon every little
Joy that makes it dilate its ſelf. And in truth
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61440:164"/>
it has been ſeen that many Women have died
with the exceſs of this Paſſion. <hi>Polycrita</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the City of the <hi>Naxians</hi> was ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with Joy after having raiſed the
Enemies ſiege from it, that ſhe ſuddenly died
amidſt the publick Acclamations. This has
ſometimes happened to Men, but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to Women; becauſe they are more
capable of reſiſting Affliction than Proſperity,
they are more liable to Inſolence than Deſpair,
and their Spirit becomes more unequal in Joy
than Sadneſs. And how can it be ſaid that an
exceſſive Joy does not diminiſh the equality of
the Mind when it is able even to take away the
Life? How can it be ſaid to make no change,
when we ſee it can kill?</p>
            <p>HERE I MUST REPROVE the
Levity of too many: If we conſider their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
well, and the unevenneſs of their
Humour, we may compare them to the Beaſt
called the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> of which it is ſaid, That it
is not of a certain Sex, but is ſometimes Male
and ſometimes Female: Theſe Perſons are like
the Lake of the <hi>Troglodites</hi> where the Water
is ſaid to change its taſte every moment, being
one while ſweet and after bitter. There is
nothing certain neither in their Actions nor
in their Thoughts. They have their Feet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
upon the Boul of Inconſtancy as well as
Fortune, who is of the ſame Sex with them,
and are always ready to alter as ſhe is, and to
overturn that which they have ſet up. Of all
the Vertues it ſeems as if there were none to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61440:165"/>
which they have leſs Inclination than to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.
One may ſee them changing every
moment, either their Affection or Opinion,
there is no certainty in their Eſteem or Love.</p>
            <p>They cannot deny this: And if they would
give themſelves leiſure ſometimes to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon their Unſteadineſs, they would
confeſs that when the Poets invented their
Chimera, they had a deſign to draw their
Picture; ſince, to ſpeak the truth, there is as
prodigious a variety in their Sentiments as in
the feigned Body of this Monſter. In truth
it is juſt matter of wonder, that the ſame
Mind ſhould be capable in ſo little time of ſo
different Thoughts, even to contrariety ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
If many of theſe Women had a Painter
hired to take every day a Draught of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their different Reſolutions; I aſſure
my ſelf, that there would appear every night
under their Hands a meer Landskip of a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>We may ſee ſome of them that will on this
day appear mighty Chaſt, and on the next
they are Lewd; now they ſhow themſelves
Covetous, and anon Liberal. It would be well
for them that they could forget this ſhameful
variety, and that they were without Memory
as well as without Steadineſs: For the little
Memory they have, however little it is, will
make them aſhamed of their Judgment. I
could wiſh to them, that which <hi>Epictetus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in a Wiſe Man; that is, That they
knew the Art of Regulating their Opinions,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61440:165"/>
and of Subjecting them to Reaſon. They
would herein have conquer'd many of their
Enemies, and appeaſed thoſe Winds which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
cauſe all the Tempeſts of their Life.</p>
            <p>But when is it that theſe Women are more
ſubject to this Ridiculous inequality, than
when they are elevated with a High Fortune;
ſince from that time every one worſhips their
Opinions, even the moſt Extravagant of them,
and their Imperfections are praiſed, and their
very Vices term'd Vertues; ſince alſo they
have then all things, ſo much at their Wiſh,
and are ſometimes ſo weary even of Delight,
that their own Diſguſt, which ariſes from
their being cloy'd, cauſes their Inconſtancy?
Having tired themſelves with true Paſtimes,
their ſickle Minds buſie them with Imaginary
ones. It is for this Reaſon that Proſperity
and Levity are very often lodged together.</p>
            <p>Let none deceive themſelves in this Matter,
nor think that to render any Steady in their
Minds I have a Mind to make them Obſtinate:
It is not always blameable to change, there are
Seaſons wherein this is not contrary to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
It is as great a fault altogether, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to an Opinion, when it is an ill one, as
to change from that which is good. Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
and Inconſtancy both are equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Election; becauſe the one is Immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
when it ought to change, and the other
changeable when it ought to be fixed. That
we may be Steady or Conſtant, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more required than that we perſevere in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61440:166"/>
Truth and Equity. Beſides, I know very well
that the Minds of the wiſeſt Perſons may be
moved at the firſt in ſome Re-encounters: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Gellius</hi> ſays, That the Stoicks themſelves
do not deny but their Wiſe Man is capable of
ſome change; becauſe, ſay they, the Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not in our Power, but the Conſent to it
is. And, to ſpeak in the Terms of their Sect,
the Viſions do not depend upon us, but only
the Approbations. I blame then the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs
which proceeds from our ſelves,
and not at all that which is join'd to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Sence, and is not in our own
Power.</p>
            <p>I HAVE a Mind to diſcover yet other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Unevenneſs of the Mind. I ſuppoſe
then, that even knowing Perſons may have
ſometimes their Mind uneven, and, as it were,
irreſolute; becauſe the greatneſs of their Light
does, as it were, dazle them, and make their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
waver; and while they look upon the ſame
Object under various Appearances, they cannot
eaſily determine themſelves; but do find ſome
probability, as it ſeems to them, even on all ſides.
Nevertheleſs it muſt be own'd that this Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is yet more common to the Ignorant,
for that while they know not the true Nature
of Good or Evil, there is more of Hazard than
Aſſurance in their Choice; and by ſo much the
more as their Spirit is weak, they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
            <p>SEE AGAIN a Cauſe of this of another
Kind: There are ſome who have truly ſome Wit
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61440:166"/>
and Knowledge; but they have nevertheleſs
alſo, I know not what natural Eaſineſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that renders them ſuſceptible of all ſorts
of Opinions. Their Spirit has ſome Light, but
it has nothing of Force; it knows how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but has need of Aſſiſtance towards the
making a good Concluſion. There are but too
many of this Sort, who ſee the Truth, but are
not able to follow it: Who ſet ſail towards the
right Port; but, every the leaſt Tempeſt caſts
them upon another Coaſt; and who ſuffer
themſelves to be carried away with a Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Ships are by the Winds, and Stream
of the Tides. As they are Credulous, they
are Unſteady.</p>
            <p>AND IN TRUTH, may we not ſee
ſome that have a certain Diſtruſt of their own
Sentiments, though they are not bad; and that
cannot go without a Guide, though they are
not blind? <hi>Paſchalius</hi> ſays, that Women ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
believe very lightly when they are in
great proſperity; and that it is from hence that
they appear ſo uneven. He brings the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Procris,</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi> to ſhow, that they very
eaſily believe what they fear, or what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
ſince ſhe her ſelf was ſo credulous to the
Reports of Slanderers, and yielded ſo readily
to the Offers of <hi>Cephalus</hi> her Husband, when he
was diſguiſed, that ſhe became as lightly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as ſhe was Amorous. And in truth, thoſe
that are in a great Fortune let themſelves eaſily
be catch'd with Flattery, or moved to Revenge.
And as there is no injury ſo ſmall, for which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61440:167"/>
they will not inſiſt upon a Satisfaction; ſo there
is no praiſe or Commendation of them ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
as that they will not receive it. It is their
conſtant Misfortune to give Credit to Flatterers
and Slanderers.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, to find out the more ordinary,
and dangerous Source of Unevenneſs, we may
obſerve, that we ſhall find none more capable
of this, than thoſe Women who have no Deſign,
or thoſe that have bad ones. There are ſome
careleſs Wretches, that do not propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any end at all; who live in I know not
what ſort of Indifference; like thoſe Archers
that let fly their Arrows into the Air without
aiming at any Mark; or as Mariners that
ſhould let themſelves wander upon the Ocean,
without ſteering towards any Port. It cannot be,
but ſuch muſt be very unconſtant. But thoſe that
have any ill Deſign, muſt needs be yet more ſo,
becauſe the frequent Remorſes that gripe them,
cauſe their minds almoſt every moment, to
change their Opinion, as they do their Faces
to change Colour.</p>
            <p>So that, to have a ſteddy conſtant mind, there
is nothing more requiſite than to keep it Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
And to this purpoſe, I have a moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rule, which I took from a Perſon very
knowing and religious. To preſerve (ſaid he)
an Equality of Mind in all our Deſigns, and in all
our Sentiments, without giving our Conſciences
any Reaſon ever to reproach us; we ought to
take care in all our Pretenſions, that Juſtice do
ſeek, Prudence find, Strength revenge, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61440:167"/>
do poſſeſs. There ought to be Juſtice
in the Affection, Prudence in the Underſtanding,
Courage in the Effects, and Temperance in the
Uſe. The Practice of this excellent Advice
would confirm the moſt unconſtant Thoughts,
and happily determine thoſe that are moſt true:
For, that none may flatter themſelves, it muſt
be ſaid, that the true Evenneſs of Mind is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
join'd to Purity of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>LET US FINISH this Diſcourſe too with
that which is of Importance, Whatever it is that
happens to us, that is ſtrange or deadly, what
need is there that it ſhould mightily trouble us?
Certainly there would be many more that
would endure well, and conſtantly, the Evils
that befall them, if they could repreſent to
themſelves, that 'tis God who tries us; and that
Patience is a Vertue ſo lovely, that, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of this, Men are apt to think well of ones
Actions, though they are none of the beſt. There
are many more would defend themſelves from
Sadneſs, if they would but conſider, that this
Paſſion is no leſs unprofitable than dangerous.
If, I ſay, they would conſider, that in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Extremities, either there is a Remedy, or
there is none: If there be one, why ſhould we
not employ all poſſible means, without admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſo great a Trouble of Mind, till we ſee how
they ſhall ſucceed: If there be no Remedy, we
muſt reſolve to ſuffer, as we muſt to die; ſince
as the one is inevitable according to the Laws
of Nature; ſo we ſee the other to be ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of Neceſſity. After all,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61440:168"/>
How ſuperfluous is Sorrow and Grief! It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find again, that which is loſt; nor call to
life, what is dead; it cannot hinder, but that
Evils will come, nor can it cauſe the good things
that are gone away, to return. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as if this fatal Paſſion could not do us
harm enough alone, we help it to perſecute us:
There are ſome that do not put forth the leaſt
Endeavour towards the helping of themſelves,
who ſeek Solitude, for fear they ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from their Grief; and who fly from
Comforters as if they were Murtherers. What
a Blindneſs is it to do ones ſelf ſo much Miſchief
without any appearances of Advantage! If we
examine this Caſe well, we ſhall find that we
are not ſo unhappy in any thing elſe, for the
moſt part, as we are in our Grief and Trouble
of Mind: Or that we are not ſo truly ſad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are unhappy, as we are unhappy in
that we are ſorrowful and ſad.</p>
