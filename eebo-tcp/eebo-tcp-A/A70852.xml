         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or,
A ready way to lead men to Heaven.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ear and beloved Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
I would have you
thus much to underſtand,
that all thoſe that have a
deſire to goe to Heaven,
muſt well and wiſely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
themſelves to follow this
Path-way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37308:3"/>
Firſt, you muſt truly and unfeignedly
labour to ſerve God, and obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
which is a duty that ought
to be done without any grudgings, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings,
or delays; for he that is alive
to day, may be dead before to morrow:
and then it will be too late to look after a
way that they never ſought for in their
life time: and therefore I daviſe you all
(good Chriſtans) to ſéek the Lord while
he may be found, for he his a God of truth
of Iuſtice, of Peace, of Mercy, of Love
and ſuch a one as would have all Men
and woman to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is another duty to be
preformed by all Men that will find the
ready way to Heaven: as your brother is
your ueighbor, even ſo is your neighbour
is your brother, &amp; therefore ought every
man and woman to love, cheriſh, and
comfort each other, and to live in peace
and unity one with another, and not to
wrangle, brabble, fight, ſcold, and go
to Law, until they have undone one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for they that do ſuch things are
gone far out of the way to Heaven. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
therefore what our Saviour
Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel. <hi>A new
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37308:3"/>
Commandment give I unto you, ſee that you
love one another, for if you love not your
neighbour whom you ſee every day how can
you love God whom you never ſaw,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider and take heed in time what
you do: he that hateth his neighbour,
hateth his brother, and he that hateth his
brother hateth God, and he that hateth
God, will never find the way to Heaven
and therefore I deſire all them that are
called by the name of Chriſtians to
ſhew themſelves like Chriſtians, laying
aſide all hatred, ſpight, envy, malice,
lying, ſlandring, backbiting, hypocriſie,
and diſſimulation, and withall to break
ſuch bread as you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld have broken;
and likewiſe to do unto all men as you
would they ſhould do unto you. This be
ſure is the readieſt way for to pleaſe
God, and the neareſt way to Heaven:
Yet more then this is to be done before,
you come to your journeys end: You
muſt repent you of all your former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;
you muſt be good to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> have
done evil to you: and muſt forgive
them their treſpaſſes, as you look to be
forgiven at the hands of God. And ſo
farre muſt your mindes and your hearts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37308:4"/>
be given to quietneſs, that you muſt not
ſo much as to let the ſun go down while
you are in wrath, <hi>For vengeance is mine
ſaith the Lord, and I will repay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, every chriſtian ought
at all times very early and late, to pray
unto the Lord, that he will add a bleſſing
to their endeavours, and the better to be
imployed, let them follow after Gods
Preachers, and heare them Preach and
Teach, that are both able and willing to
declare the word of God unto them, and
ſo by degrées they ſhall find the mercies
of the Lord redoubled unto them, and
thereby they ſhall be brought to ripeneſs
of underſtanding, whereby to know and
diſtinguiſh betwéen good and bad, which
may be great furtherance to them in the
way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>True knowledge is of ſuch an excellent
vertue that it is ſufficient to bring us
acquainted with the principall things
that are to be had in this life, and after
this life ended, it ſhall bring our Soules
into everlaſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>True knowledge wil make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that God the Father Created us,
that God the Son redéemed us, and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37308:4"/>
God the holy Ghoſt ſanctified vs, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
all thoſe that faithfully believe
that our Lord &amp; Saviour Ieſus Chriſt
ſuffered death upon the Croſſe, to ſave
our ſouls from the tyranny of the divel,
and from the torments of Hell; as you
may read in the 13 Chap. of the Goſpel
written by St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Matthew,</hi> where it is ſaid,
<hi>Bleſſed be your eys for they ſee, and your
ears for they hear, and your hearts for they
underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to be brief, true knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
may very well be termed a
<hi>Key to open the gates of Heaven,</hi> Then
what man or woman will be ſo wilfully
blind as to neglect the ſéeking for ſuch an
excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vertue; yet there are ſome, and
too many in theſe ſinful &amp; wicked times,
that are ſo careleſſe and regardleſs, that
they had rather chooſe to follow the vain
delights and pleaſures of this wicked
world, than to ſéek for the Redemption
of their ſouls, and the joyes of Heaven
hereafter, whom our Saviour Chriſt
bought and paid for with his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood.</p>
            <p>Some there are likewiſe; that bear a
ſhew of Godlineſs, &amp; yet they cannot or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37308:5"/>
will not ſpaire an hour in a day to hear a
good Sermon, or to ſerve God in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Others
their are, that do utterly deny, and as it
were to make a ſcoff of the Scriptures,
and the word of God; but I wiſh that all
ſuch perſons may ſpéedily amend their
lives, leſt at the laſt day the righteous
Iudge of all the world, Ieſus Chriſt ſhal
ſay unto them, <hi>Depart from me ye work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now beloved Chriſtians I would
have you to conſider and think on this
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of vengeance is near at hand,
and every ſoul ſhall ſtand at the Barr of
Araignment before the righteous Iudge
to tender up an account of al their déeds
and actions good and evil: and then ſhall
the good be ſevered from the bad, and the
one ſort with joy and triumph be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into everlaſting happineſs, &amp; the reſt
be caſt into utter darkneſs, where is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to be heard or ſéen, <hi>but weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
howling, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover I would have you to conſider
that at the generall judgement there are
none to be excuſed from comming to
their anſwers, and every one ſhall be
forced to appear in their perſons; the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37308:5"/>
rich and the poor, the King and the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
the ſtrong and the weak, the bound
and the frée; all muſt come whether they
will or no: <hi>for God hath no reſpect of
pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſons:</hi> and at that great and notable
day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord our God, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
to be made, there ſhall be no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to plead a cauſe for another man or
woman: for he ſhall be ſure to have
work enough to do of his own, neither
ſhall there be any bribes accepted of,
therefore look wel about you, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the wrath of the Iudge while you
may; and provoke not God to Anger,
leſt your ſoules periſh in diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Yet furthermore I would have you
remember this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the Saints of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are crowned with glory, and the
wicked ſent unto the gulph of miſery,
there is no returning from neither of the
places, but where ſoever they are ſent
by the Iudge, <hi>there they are to continue
world without END.</hi> Oh! what a
heavy ſight will it be to the Wicked?
when they ſhall ſée the godly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Heaven among the glorious
Saints and Angels of the Lord, and they
themſelves to be caſt into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37308:6"/>
for ever, where they ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the brightneſs of the Sun, nor the
glory of Chriſt again: alas dear friends
what a ſad thing it is to think upon? but
ten thouſand times worſe to them that
ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be baniſhed
from the preſence of Chriſt for ever.</p>
            <p>Such curſed wretches as are here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, are them who have loſt their way
to heaven, and can never find the <hi>Key to
open Heaven Gate withall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt thing that I have to put you in
mind of is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>every one ſhould remember
his End,</hi> and think upon the day of his
death while he is alive on the Earth. To
this purpoſe the wiſe man <hi>Solomon</hi> hath
taught us our Leſſon, and to the Life;
when he ſayes, <hi>Remember thy end, and thy
Creator in the days of thy youth,</hi> as much
as if he ſaid, <hi>Remember thy end to day,
to morrow, and the next day, &amp; all the days
of our lives.</hi> And alſo that every night
before we ſléepe, we make our peace with
God, by way of humble Petition and
prayers unto his heavenly Majeſty, that
he will be pleaſed that if wée never live
to ſée the morrow morning, to forgive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37308:6"/>
all our ſins &amp; receive our ſoules into his
heavenly Kingdom: if every one will
make uſe of what is here ſet down, and
conſtantly practice it in their lives and
converſations, they néed not fear death
let him come early or late, ſléeping or
waking, or what time ſoever it be, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the gates of Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the power
of Divels prevail againſt them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> have
found the right way to Heaven. And to
conclude this point; let all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ever mean
wel to their own ſouls, take good notice of
what is ſaid, it may be a means through
Gods great mercy to bring them that are
gon aſtray, in the right and perfect way
to Heaven, where at the firſt entrance,
our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt will be ready
to welcome us in with theſe ſwéet and
comfortable gréetings and imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with words as followeth: <hi>Come ye
bleſſed Children of my Father, receive a
Crown and Kingdom of Glory, which was
prepared for you at the beginning.</hi> To
which kingdome, The Lord in his good
time bring us all. There ſhall the bleſſed
ſouls of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous behold the celeſtiall
Saints of the Lord, &amp; be partakers with
them of the everlaſting felicity which is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37308:7"/>
unſpeakable, <hi>then ſhall they that mourned
here, be converted there.</hi> And they that
ſuffered reproachfull words, abuſefull
ſlanders, ſhamfull diſgraces, and preſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
for Chriſt and the Goſpels ſake
ſhall have a full reward, and ſwéet ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in the Sanctuary of the moſt high
God, &amp; al thoſe which have béen wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Earth, ſhall be righted in Heaven,
which conſideration may very wel ſerve
to comfort all ſuch as have béen or are
any ways afflicted, derided, or oppreſſed,
and falſly accuſed in this preſent life;
ſince there is a Crown of glory laid up
for them in the life to come, then let all
true and faithfull Believers be valiant-hearted,
and never be diſmaid for all that
can be done againſt them by the world
the fleſh, and the Devill.</p>
            <p>And for your further inſtruction, I
would wiſh you all to be well adviſed,
and to follow the Doctrine and Counſell
of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, who biddeth, you
to put on the whole armour of God, Having
your loynes girt about with the truth, putt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the breſt-plate of righteouſneſs, and
feet ſhod with the preparation of the
Goſpel of peace, taking up the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of faith, and helmet of ſalvation,</hi> And
being thus armed you need not fear
all the Enemies that ever can aſſault or
come againſt you; as you may read in
the 6 <hi>Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17,
<hi>verſes,</hi> how to come by this Armour, and
how to uſe it, you muſt learn that of our
Captain and Leader Ieſus Chriſt, who
ſuffered many perſecutions when he was
upon earth, as hunger, cold, baniſhment,
ſcorns and taunts, whippings, &amp; buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſpitting on the face, and at laſt
nailed on the Croſs, and pierced to the
heart with a bloody ſpear; in all which
afflictions he was never ſeen to look upon
Enemies with a frowning Eye, nor to
give them ſo much as an angry word,
but at the very point of death he took all
things patiently, and prayed for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſaying, <hi>Father forgive them, they
know not what they do.</hi> And when he
fetcht his laſt gaſp at the yielding up of
the ghoſt, he cryed with a loud voice, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thy hands I commit my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt
made a ſufferer for our ſakes, &amp; all thoſe
torments did he undergo while he was
on earth, to teach us the way tr Heaven,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37308:8"/>
and this hath he purchaſed with his moſt
dear and precious blood, to ſave us from
the torments of Hell; and after that
Chriſt had ſuffered the ſharpneſs of death
he aſcended into heaven, where he hath
made already interceſſion for all them
that are his followers. And ſéeing that
our Saviour hath led the way, why ſhould
not we be as willing to come to him? he
hath promiſed he will never leave us nor
forſake us, if wée do not leave nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him: Therefore let us looke to our
ſelves, if wée will not find the way to
Heaven, the fault is our own.</p>
            <p>Therefore to finiſh up all, I once more
deſire you all, that you wil never leave
Practiſing to find the way to Heaven.
<hi>For bleſſed are they that continue to the
END.</hi>

               <p>O Moſt mighty Lord God full of mercy
and compaſſion to all that call upon thy
holy Name, and ſeek after thy Heavenly
Kingdome: Wee thy poor diſtreſſed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Children, doe upon the bended
knees of our hearts, proſtrate our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, with all humility both of ſouls &amp;
bodies; deſiring that of thy infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
thou wilt be pleaſed to teach us the
way to come unto thee, for we are not able
to do any good thing of our ſelves, without
thy powerfull help; we are weak, but thou
art ſtrong; and therefore draw us, and wee
will follow thee; direct our wayes to come
unto thee, ſo that when the time comes
that our ſouls ſhall be ſeparated from our
bodies, we may be received into the Joyes
of Heaven, and that for the ſake of Jeſus
Chriſt our Saviour, to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and
Glory, Power and Praiſe, both now, and
for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
