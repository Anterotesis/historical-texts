         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Publick undoubtedly cannot be better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, than by the following Relation, of one of the moſt notorious Cheats as has been known in an Age, which has already made a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Noiſe in the Town; and the Particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be no diſacceptable Entertainment.</p>
            <p>A Perſon not over-well Clad, was ſeen ſtanding ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing about him in the Streets, over-againſt <hi>Arundel</hi>-Buildings in the <hi>Strand;</hi> but the gravity of his Age (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon between 50 and 60) invited the Curioſity of Mr. <hi>Cullin</hi> the Baker, to ask this unknown Perſon what he wanted? To which he replied, He wanted a Lodging. Upon this, Mr. <hi>Cullin</hi> very courteouſly made anſwer, He ſhould be welcome to his Houſe; which he very eaſily and readily accepted; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was received very kindly. Now having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Stock of Money, <hi>viz.</hi> but Two Shillings in his Pocket, he was expoſed to the neceſſity of making uſe of ſome Romantick Narrative of his Quality and Condition, to make good his Quarters with ſo ſlender a Purſe, to hold out payment. Accordingly the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of his Landlady enquiring what Country-man he was? He replied, Of <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> that his Name was <hi>VVickham,</hi> a Perſon of a good Eſtate near <hi>Banbury;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29731:3"/>
and that the occaſion of his coming to Town, was only to avoid the payment of 500 l. which he ſtood engaged for by Bond, in behalf of a Perſon that was run away, and had left him to pay that Money, and which truly he had made an Oath to himſelf he would never pay; not that the Summ was ſo conſiderable to a Man of his plentiful Fortune, only he was reſolved to keep his Vow; and that had made him retire a little from being arreſted for it.</p>
            <p>The Affability and good Language of this Perſon of imaginary Quality, ſoon found Credit with his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Landlord and Landlady, and no Gareſs was thought kind enough to a Perſon of his eminent Figure and Extraction. His firſt entrance into this indulgent Family was about a fortnight before <hi>Christmaſs,</hi> where he gained that daily ground, that no Reſpect could be ſufficiently paid him: His little Pocket Strength ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing, for his Hoſt was not a little exalted with the Honour of ſuch a Gueſt under his Roof.</p>
            <p>But, as Providence was pleaſed to order it, his Reign was ordain'd to be but ſhort; for he ſoon fell into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Sickneſs, in which time neither Doctor, Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, Nurſe, or any other Aſſiſtance was wanting.</p>
            <p>Now our pretended Captain, whatever other Faults he had, was reſolv'd not to be guilty of Ingratitude, and accordingly made an ample Laſt Will and Teſtament, and moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liberally gave extraordinary large Donations and Legacies to his kind Landlord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was very remarkable, that during his Sickneſs, his Landlord, being Overſeer of the Poor, had requeſted a kind Brother in Office, the Church-Warden, to pay a ſmall Office of Chriſtian Duty to this poor languiſhing Gentleman; who making him a condoling Viſit, with wet Eyes and uplifted Hands, was ſo kind as to wiſh his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29731:3"/>
Worſhip's Soul everlaſting Reſt, which was ſeconded by manly a repeated Sigh from the reſt of the Condolers about him: And one more eſpecially, having heard of this great Wind-fall, lamented much his Unhappineſs, in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not viſiting this Gentleman, ſaying, <hi>He was never born to do himſelf good, having loſt by his Negligence at least 1000 l</hi> Alſo another eminent Man of the Pariſh, being diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that he did not come in for a Share with the reſt of his Neighbours, went and told them, <hi>That the Coroner ought to be ſent for, and an Enquiry made how he died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Care and Application ſignified but little, for his laſt <hi>Exit</hi> was drawing on; in which time, not in the leaſt to ſhrink from his Character of Quality, he ſtill kept up the Honourable Figure he had ſo long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and accordingly made moſt prodigious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Good-will and Acknowledgments to the Family, avowing that the few Hundreds he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed them, was nothing to what he would do for 'em, if pleaſe God to lengthen his Life to ſerve them and theirs.</p>
            <p>And now having performed the Part of a good Patron and Friend, as his laſt Legacies do ſufficiently teſtifie; he was reſolved to be as good a Chriſtian too, and thereupon requeſted the taking the Sacrament: To which, being admitted (with what Integrity you'll find by the Sequel) with a grave Countenance to the very laſt, he was very ready to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and upon ſo ſerious an Undertaking, was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put a Caſe of Conſcience to the Miniſter, <hi>viz.</hi> having made a Vow never to pay the 500 <hi>l.</hi> he ſtood engaged for, Whether he was obliged to keep his Vow, or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which being anſwered in the Negative, That he was obliged to pay his Debts, notwithſtanding his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29731:4"/>
raſh Vow. He made anſwer, That truly now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near Heaven, he conſidered the point, and acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſced with his Ghoſtly Monitor; and thereupon incerted the 500 <hi>l.</hi> into the Will.</p>
            <p>This piece of extraordinary Juſtice being perform'd with a very compoſed and ſetled mind he left this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom World on <hi>Sunday</hi> the Third Inſtant, ſeeming very well contented to part with his great Riches and Lands, for the more valuable conſideration of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt do the Family this Right, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Sums they gain'd by ſo ample a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch bounteous Legacies, however their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the lamented Departure of ſo worthy a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was very hearty and cordial: Nay, ſome are of Opinion, that inſtead of diminiſhing (as Sorrow generally wears off) theirs, on the contrary is daily encreaſing.</p>
            <p>But perhaps nothing was ſo unkind as excluding the poor Prentice from viſiting the ſick Gentleman. For, alas, the poor Boy has been heard moſt dolefully to bewail the unkindneſs of his Maſter; for undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worthy Gentleman would have left him enough to have ſet him up, had he been amongſt the Throng of Viſitants, who all taſted ſo highly of his extravagant Liberality.</p>
            <p>Now to aſſure you that the Kindneſs of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors continued beyond his Death, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far indebted to his Memory, that not only the Embalmer was ſent for, but likewiſe a Coffin, price <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29731:4"/>But before theſe Honourable Exequies could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, an unhappy Letter from the True <hi>Humphrey Wickham</hi>
