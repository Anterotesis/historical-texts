         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How can you say you love God, and follow the lusts of your flesh? for whom you love, him you follow. Christ saith, if you love me, follow me, keep my Commandements: and those who follow him, he leads them out of all the waies of sin, into the waies of purity and holyness, and so he is the way to the Father, <hi>For without holiness none can see God, for he is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, and no unclean thing can stand in his sight.</hi> Where will you, where will you appear, you blind creatures, whom the Devil hath deceived, you that follow the Prince of the aire, who rules in the children of disobedience, bringing forth fruits of sin and unrighteousness, having your conversation in the earth, and earthly things, following your corrupt wills and pleasures: and yet you will profess you love God, draw near him with your lips, own him in words, but the Devil in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.

How wilt thou witness his death in thee, or thy self dead with him? How hast thou put on Christ, who art clad with sin, the Saints who was dead with Christ? and saith <hi>Paul, How can you that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</hi> and saith, <hi>Those that are dead with Christ, are free from sin; and become servants of righteousness</hi>: and saith he, <hi>Now being made free from sin, and become servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life:</hi> but while thou livest in sin, thy fruit is unholy, and the end is death; who are Redeemed by Christ, are Redeemed from the earth and earthly things, up to God again, from whence they are fallen; out of every kindred tongue and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Nation, are made unto God Kings and Priests, to reign above sin on earth, and are made conformable unto his Image again, which they had lost by sin; but what conformity is there in thee, while thou livest in sin? thou art not like him, but like the Devil; for every sin is the Image of the Devil, who sinned from the beginning; and while thou committest sin, thou holdest out his Image in thee, who is thy Father, and thou his son, begotten in his own likeness. And Christ told the Scribes and Pharisees, who professed themselves the children of God, but lived in sin, <hi>That they were of their father the Devil; for his work they will do, for every sin is the worke of the Devil.</hi> And saith <hi>John, He that commits sin as of the Devil</hi>; and saith, <hi>for this purpose was the Son of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, to destroy the works of the Devil</hi>: whosoever can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Son of God manifested in them, can witness sin De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; but if thou say thou canst witness Christ manifested in thee, and yet commit sin, thou art a lyar: For, saith <hi>John, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever abideth in him, sinneth not</hi>; whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, neither known him; <hi>For he that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And faith the holy Ghost, <hi>Whosoever is born of God, sinneth not,</hi> for his seed remaineth in him; for he that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

God in all ages hath known his by their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but thou sayest, thou must live in disobedience, or else thou canst not live in the world, and yet thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est he accounted one of his too.

Now thou that canst conform to the worlds waies, words, and worship, and yet would be accounted one of God's too; O thou deceiver, thou deceiver, thou deceivest but thy self, and men like thee; thou canst not deceive the Lord. Take heed, repent, halt no longer between God and the world; if thou wilt owne God, thou must disowne the world, and the world will disowne thee; thou canst not have both, for whilst thou art striving with both, thou hast right to neither; for all things were made for the Son, both in Heaven and Earth, and he is Heir of all, even the fulness of all, and in him are the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdome laid up, and there is no receiving any thing without him; witness the Son, and witness all; but no further then thou canst witness him, no further canst thou witness real possession, but seedeth on wind, words, shews, and shadows, and art deceived by the Devil, that old Serpent, who makes large promises, but hath nothing to perform, but deceit: for all the promises are yea and amen in Christ, they are all to the seed which is the Son, and to him are all the Promises in the Scriptures; For he that hath the Son hath the Father also, and such are made Free by the Son: but while thou art a servant to thy lusts, tho art in sin, and art farre from a Free man.

But woe from the Lord will follow the careless slothful disobedient, rebellious one, who causes offences, so all in the presence of the living God, to the witness of God in you I speake, to feare the living God of life and Power, and in it dwell, that in it you may be preserved; low and tender your minds to the measure of light; which manifests darkness, and what out of it ariseth, which is contrary to the light, drawes from the light, and so draws from God, that in the light this may be seen, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned: and here you are kept in your measures and daily growth, out of the world, self, flesh, or whatsoever is of the same, that all things may be given up into his will who is God over all, and creator of all, whose owne all is, and here you are kept single and free, Just upright and pure every one in your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, in the continuall exercise in a growing condition, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being kept waking: but I do you all warne to take heed of setting up a false rest out of light in the carnality, in the form, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the life and power, painted with the word of truth; catched in the comprehension &amp; talked of, such feeds death in whom death raign, and such with the light which they are turned from, are seen Judged and condemned, Ignorance not to be pleaded. So all tender ones, who feare the living God, and abide to the light which opens, manifests, and discovers within, that upon it you may wait for teaching, and direction, looking out at any, but every one in particular, mind the light of the Lord Jesus; which hath convniced you to be your guide and teacher in all things, bringing all your thoughts, words, and actions, to the light, by it to be tryed and proved, at it to ask councel and direction, and here God alone is teacher, orderer, and mighty counceller, who is the everlasting Father and Prince of peace and joy; and here true Judgement is set up, which keeps in the watch and the cross, and

here true peace is preserved, which stands in obedience through the Cross; and herein true favour you grow, and in the discerning and the pure wisdome you grow, in your measures, received from the fountaine which orders all, and distinguishes between the precious, and the vile, and the two seeds, and what is of the one, and what is of the other, and what to owne, and joyne with, and what to deny &amp; cross, as in particular, so in general, and here self is kept out, and Judged out, and the false voice and false Language; or any thing which separates and leads out of the obedience, out of the cross, and out of the oneness; so here in the cross you all are kept watching over one another, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up one another, in that which stands out of the will, and out of words; and puts an end to words, and here is the Blessing, and in your meetings the Lord will be seen present, manifesting himself by his Power, and so you will know of a truth he is among you; so all as tender your eternal happiness, and prise the love of God, take heed of setting up a rest or peace out of the cross, out of the obedience, for there you settle upon the lees, and crucifies the Just one in you; and all this is but in time, and will be destroyed by that which is out of time and done away, take heed of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to the earthly spirit, or hearking to the earthly voyce which draws the mind from the pure eternall into the earth and earthly things; and visible fading created objects which adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terates the heart from God, and leads away the mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the eternall, and cumbers the same, begetting earthly care for store of fading things, which are in time and which time perisheth; which keeps out of the obedience, smothers the light, and involves in darkness, darkning the understanding, and inslaves the creature, and brings into bondage to the earth and earthly things, and captivates and covers the seed in the earth, and here is the curse and wrath and Plagues which to <hi>Egypt</hi> and to <hi>Egypt</hi> King is due, and all this comes by carelesness, not obeying in the measure of light, which leads the affections from below out of time to God the beginning and end of all time: in whom is full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the living fountain of all goodness, eternall Riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, &amp; here is the liberty of the children of God, who from the earth are redeemed, and this liberty you come to know every one in your measures abiding in the cross, so that which is not

So God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty of wisdom and power keep you in the pure feare and awe of himself the powerfull Father, all of you tender and faithfull in your measures your minds up to him, he to be your guide in all things, who leads out of the way of error, that he in all things may be glorified praised and honoured, to whom all is due, even God over all Blessed for ever.
