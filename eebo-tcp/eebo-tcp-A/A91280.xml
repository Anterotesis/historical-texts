            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in this ſad poſture of publick diſtractions?</p>
            <p>3. Whether this their diſdainfull, uncivil, unbrotherly Treating of their fellow-Members (deſiring nothing elſe but a brotherly aſſociation with them,
to compoſe the manifold Diſtractions, and make up the wide Breaches of our Sinking, Dying Nations, by their United Councils and Endeavours, and to
Regulate all Exorbitances, occaſioned by their heady Councils and Miſcariages) in not allowing them the Privileges of Porters and Footboyes to enter
into their outward Lobby, in taking no notice of them, and putting this freſh affront upon them, after ſo many former Indignities, in the midſt of their
and our Domeſtick Confuſions and fears from forein parts, be not an evident Demonſtration; that they intend neither the publike Peace, Unity, nor ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Government, Laws, Liberties, or Nations, but their unjuſt ſupport of their own private Intereſts, Rapines, ambitious Tyrannical Uſurpations
and Exerciſes of Supreme Parliamentary Civil and Military Authority over our three Nations; to imbroyl them in new Wars and Confuſions, to prey upon
the ſmall remainder of their Real and Perſonal Eſtates, by the power of the Sword, now gotten into their hands, out of the Army-Officers; who abuſed it
likewiſe to the oppreſſing and enſlaving of the people, and created them a Parliament without the ſecluded Members, and Houſe of Peers?</p>
            <p>4. Whether their diſdainfull, Injurious forcible ſecluſion of the Members, by their own ſpecial Orders and Commands to their Gards and Officers
now, be not a ſhrewd Evidence, that their former ſecluſions, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 6. and 7. 1648. and <hi>May</hi> 7. and 9. 1659. (acted by, and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

Orders and ſubſequent approbation of it; and that at their very firſt re-aſſembling, after their own late forcible ſecluſion, by <hi>Lamberts</hi> and <hi>Hewſons Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
now Entertained and Imployed in their ſervice, to ſeclude, and keep out their old honeſt fellow Members, of Untainted Integrity and merit? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not a greater breach of Privilege, Truſt, Duty, Tyranny, Perjury, and Treaſon in them, againſt all former Declarations, the Proteſtation, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, taken and Subſcribed by them, with hands lifted up to the moſt High God, thus to ſeclude their fellow Members; than it
was in <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Harriſon, April</hi> 20. 1653. or for <hi>Lambert October</hi> 13. laſt to ſeclude and turn themſelves out of doors, after their declaring and voting
it <hi>Treaſon, Perjury</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in them? Whether this their ſecluding of the Members by Col. <hi>Okey</hi> himſelf, and others who appeared moſt active againſt
their Excluſion by <hi>Lambert,</hi> will not draw a ſelf-condemnation on them, as acting by their commands, againſt their Conſciences; and juſtify both <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi>
and <hi>Lamberts</hi> ſecluſion of themſelves? And juſtly encourage all their newly reduced Soldiers and others, to ſhut and turn themſelves out of the Houſe
again upon any emergent occaſion or diſcontent, with greater boldneſs and impunity than before, ſince they juſtified their laſt ſecluſion, by their former
<hi>underhand encouragements of them to ſeclude the Majority of the Members, who over-voted them in</hi> Decemb. 1648. and give them Orders to ſeclude them now again
upon the ſame account in the ſame month of <hi>December, for fear they ſhould over-vote them if re-admitted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whether their printed <hi>Vote,</hi> Decem. 27. <hi>To take the buſineſs of their abſent Members into debate on the</hi> 5. <hi>of January next;</hi> inſtead of giving admittance, or
any anſwer to the 22. ſecluded Members waiting for an anſwer in the Lobby above 2. hours, be not a meer dilatory <hi>Cheat</hi> put upon the <hi>ſecluded Members,</hi>
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and whole <hi>Nation;</hi> to delay their admiſſion till they have put new Gards on, and drawn up all their forces to <hi>London,</hi> to over-awe the
City, and hinder their long-delayed <hi>Militia</hi> for their own ſecurity; and ſetled the Militia of every County under their own commands, to enſlave the
whole City and Nation to their Tyranny and uſurped <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Power; and then they will not only forcibly keep out all the Members, but abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eject them, unleſſe they will take their new Oath and Ingagement: As is evident by their <hi>Speakers</hi> prohibiting the Lord Maior and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
on Saturday laſt to ſet up their Chains and <hi>ſettle their Militia;</hi> and their Order and Vote on <hi>Munday</hi> night againſt all forces raiſed without their

            </p>
            <p>6. Whether the City, or Engliſh Nation, can expect the leaſt juſtice eaſe or redreſſe of their inſupportable Burdens, Taxes, and Impoſitions from theſe
new Tax-maſters, who (though they are not yet the Tenth part of a full <hi>Commons Houſe</hi>) preſumed to paſs and print a New <hi>Act of Parliament, to continue their</hi>

of a Parliament; when all Laws, and Lawbooks reſolve, their own Conſciences and the whole Nation infallibly know them to be no Parliament,
nor Commons houſe, hath not brought them within the compaſſe and penalty of this Clauſe in their own laſt Act, before their Diſſolution by <hi>Lambert,
October</hi> 11. intituled, <hi>An Act againſt raiſing of Money upon the people without <hi>their Conſent in Parliament:</hi> And be it further enacted, That no perſon or perſons

any ſum or ſums of money, or other Impoſitions whatſoever, upon the People of this Commonwealth, without their conſent in Parliament, or as
by Law might have béen done before the Third of November,</hi> 1640. <hi>And be it further enacted and declared, <hi>That every perſon offending againſt this
Act,</hi>
               </hi> (therefore every of themſelves who paſſed this new Act, Decemb. 27. and thoſe who ſhall put it in execution) <hi>ſhall be and are hereby adjudged to
be guilty of High Treaſon, and ſhall forfeit and ſuffer as in caſe of High Treaſon.</hi> Whether the people of this Commonwealth (the thouſand part
whereof knew not of their new ſitting) did ever conſent to this ſudden extemporary new Act, made the firſt morning of their ſitting in leſſe than two hours
ſpace, when there were but 42. Members in the Houſe; 22. ſecluded Members at the door, and near 250. more Members yet living, (beſides the whole
Houſe of Lords, who muſt ſtand for <hi>Cyphers</hi>) abſent, and not privy to their Seſſion, or this Act? If not, (as is unqueſtionable) whether by this their
own Law and Act, <hi>they be not adjudged to be guilty of High Treaſon, and to forfeit and ſuffer as in caſe of High Treaſon,</hi> for this their impoſing and continuing of
Cuſtoms and Exciſes on the people; as well as for their <hi>ſecluſion</hi> of their Members; which they voted to be <hi>Treaſon in Lambert?</hi> And whether the
Offices and Common Soldiers can upon this acccount expect any pay from the <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> or <hi>Indemnity</hi> for ſecluding thoſe Now ſitting, if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
