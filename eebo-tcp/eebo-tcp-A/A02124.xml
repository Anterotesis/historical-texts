            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here dwelled in the City of <hi>Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> a certaine Duke called <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes,</hi> who through his proweſſe in all martial exploits wared ſo proud and tyrannous, vſing ſuch mercileſſe crueltie to his forraigne enemies, and ſuch moodleſſe rigor to his natiue Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, that it was doubtfull whether hée was more feared of his foes for his crueltie, or hated of his friends for his tyrannie: yet as the worſt weed ſpringeth vp more braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the wholſommeſt hearbe, and as the crookedſt trée is commonly laden with moſt fruite, ſo this rigorous duke was ſo fauoured and foſtered vp by fortune, his eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eſtabliſhed with honor, &amp; ſo beautified with wealth, ſo deckt with the Diadem of dignity, and endued with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate proſperity, hauing in warres ſuch happie ſucceſſe againſt his foes, and in peace ſuch dutifull renerence of his friends, (although more for feare than fauour) as he ſéemed to want nothing that either fortune or the fates coulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, if one onely ſore which bred his ſorrowe, coulde haue béen ſalued. But this griefe ſo galled his conſcience, and this curſed care ſo cumbred his minde, that his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was greatly ſurcharged with heauineſſe, to ſée the cauſe of his care could by no meanes be cured. For this <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> was indued with two children, the one a daughter named <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> and the other a ſonne called <hi>Gwydonius:</hi> this <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> was ſo perfect in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
<pb facs="tcp:6139:4"/>
of her bodie, and ſo pure in the conſtitution of her minde, ſo adorned with outward beautie, and endued with inward bountie, ſo poliſhed with rare vertues and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite qualities, as ſhée ſéemed a ſéemly <hi>Venus</hi> for her beauty, and a ſecond <hi>Veſta,</hi> for her virginite: yea, Nature and the gods had ſo beuntifully beſtowed their gifts vpon her, as ſame herſelfe was doubtful whether ſhe ſhould make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter report of her excellent vertue, or exquiſite beautie. But his ſonne <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> was ſo contrarie to his ſiſter <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippa,</hi> (though not in the ſtate of his bodie, yet in the ſtaie of his mind) as it made al men maruaile how two ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſtemmes could ſpring out of the ſelf ſame ſtock: His perſonage indéed was ſo comely, his feature ſo wel framed, each limb ſo perfectly couched, his face ſo fair, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſo amiable, as he ſéemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcaſſe.</p>
            <p>But his minde was ſo blemiſhed with deteſtable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo ſpotted with the ſtaine of voluptuouſneſſe, that hee was not ſomuch to bee commended for the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bodie, as to bee condemned for the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his minde. Hee was ſo endued with vanitie, and ſo imbrued with vice, ſo nurſed vp in wantonneſſe, and ſo nulled vp in wilfulneſſe, ſo careleſſe to obſerue his fathers commaund, and ſo retchleſſe to regard his counſell, that neither the dread of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fathers diſpleaſure, coulde driue him to deſiſt from his deteſtable kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact ſo filchy, which hée would not commit, no miſchiefe ſo monſtrous, which hée would not enterprſſe: no danger ſo deſperate, which hée woulde not aduenture: no perill ſo fearefull, which hée would not performe: nor no action ſo diueliſh, which hée would not execute. So immodeſt in his manners, ſo rude in his geſtures, yea and ſo prodigall in his expences, as mines of golde were not able to maintaine ſuch witleſſe prodigalitie. This loathſom life of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> was ſuch a cutting coraſiue to his Fathers carefull conſcience,

and ſuch a hapleſſe clog to his heauic hart, that no ioy could make him enioy any ioy, no mirth could make him merry, no proſperity could make him pleaſant: but abandoning all delight, &amp; auoiding all companie, he ſpent his doleful daies in dumps and dolors, which he vttered in theſe words.</p>
            <p>NOw (quoth hée) I proue by experience, the ſaying of <hi>Sophocles</hi> to be true, that the man which hath many children ſhall neuer liue without ſome mirth, nor die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſorrow: for if they be vertuous, he ſhal haue cauſe whereof to reioyce, if vicious, wherefore to be ſad: which ſaying I trie performed in myſelfe: for as I haue one child which delights me with her vertue, ſo I haue another that deſpights me with his vanity, as the one by dutie brings me ioy, ſo the other by diſobedience bréeds my anoy: yea as the one is a comfort to my minde, ſo the other is a fretting coraſiue to my heart: for what griefe is there more griping, what pain more pinching, what croſſe more comberſome, what plagne more pernitious, yea, what trouble can tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me worle, then to ſée my ſonne, mine heir, the inheritor of my Dukedom, which ſhould be the pillex of my paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to conſume his time in royſting and ryot, in ſpending and ſpoiling, in ſwearing and ſwaſhing, &amp; in following wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the furie of his own frantike fancie. Alas, moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and lamentable caſe, would to God the deſtinies had decreed his death in the ſwadling cloutes, or that the fates had preſcribed his death in his infancie. Oh that the daie of his birth had béen the daie of his buriall, or that by ſome ſiniſter ſtorme of fortune he had béen ſtifled on his mothers knées, ſo that his vntimely death might haue preuented my enſuing ſorrowes, and his future calamities: for I ſie that the young frie will alwaies proue olde frogs, that the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked twig will proue a crabbed trée, that the ſower bud will neuer be ſwéet bloſſome, how that which is bred in the bone will not eaſily out of the fleſh, that he which is careleſſe in youth, will be leſſe carefull in age, that where in prime of
<pb facs="tcp:6139:5"/>
yéeres vice raigneth, there in ripe age vanity remaineth. Why <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> if thou ſéeſt the ſore, why doeſt thou not apply the ſalue? and if thou doeſt perceiue the miſchief, why dooſt not preuent it with medicine? take away the cauſe &amp; the effect faileth: if <hi>Gwydonius</hi> be the cauſe of thy ruth, cut him off betimes, leaſt hee bring thee to ruine: better hadſt thou want a Son then neuer want ſorrow. Perhaps thou wilt ſuffer him ſo long, til he fall ſick of the Father, and then hée wil not only ſéek thy lands and liuing, but life and all, if thou preuent not his purpoſe: yea, and after thy death he will be through his laſciuious life the ouer throw of thy houſe, the conſumer of thy Dukedome, the wracke of thy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and the very man that ſhall bring the ſtate of <hi>Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> to miſchief &amp; miſerie. Sith then thy Son is ſuch a ſink of ſorrowes, in whoſe life lies hid a loathſome maſſe of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched miſhaps, cut him off as a graceleſſe graft, vnworthy to grow out of ſuch a ſtock. Alas <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> ſhalt thou be ſo vnnaturall as to ſeek the ſpoile of thine owne childe, wilt thou bee more ſauage then the brute Beaſtes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch crueltie? no, alas, the leaſt miſfortune of our children dooth ſo mooue vs, that as the Spider féeleth if her web bee prickt but with the point of a pinne, ſo if they bée toucht but with the leaſt trouble, we féele the paines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with pricking grief to pinch vs. Why hath not Nature then cauſed loue to aſcend as well as to deſcend, and placed as dutifull obedience in the childe, as louing affection in the father: and with that he fetcht ſuch a deep ſigh, that it was a ſigne of the extreame ſorrowe he conceiued for his ſonnes witleſſe folly. But as hée was readie againe to enter into his dolefull diſcourſe, to aggranate his griefe the more, and increaſe his care, certaine complaints were brought him by ſundry Citizens, of the outragious behauiour of his Sonne <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> which béeing attentiuely heard he in great choller called for his ſonne, againſt whom hée thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out ſuch threatning reproaches, laying before his face the miſery that would enſue of ſuch reckleſſe miſchiefes,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:5"/>
and promiſing that if hee directed not his courſe by a new compaſſe, and leuelled his life by a new line, hee would not onely repay his folly with the penalty of the law, but alſo by conſent of his commons, diſinherite him of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: that <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> greatly incenſed with the ſeuere cenſure of his father, broyling with furious rage, ſturdily burſt forth into theſe ſtubborne tearmes.</p>
            <p>SIr, (quoth hée) if <hi>Terence</hi> his <hi>Menedemus</hi> were aliue, and heard theſe your fond and fantaſticall reaſons, hee would as readily condemn you of crabbedneſſe, as he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Chremes</hi> of curriſhneſſe: for as he by too much auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie procured his ſonnes miſhap, ſo you by too much ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſéeke to bréed my miſfortune. You olde men moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, or rather iniuriouſly, meaſure our ſtayleſſe moode by your ſtayed minds, our yoong yeares by your hoary haires, our floriſhing youth by your withered age, thinking to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our doings by your doatings, our wils by your wits, our youthfull fancies by your aged affections, &amp; to quench our fierie flames by your dead coales and cinders: yea, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Leueret ſhould be as skilfull in making of a head, as the olde Hare, that the yoong Cubs ſhould aſſoon tapiſh, as the old Fox, that the yoong Frie ſhould as well auoid the net as the old Fiſh, and that the yoong wantons ſhould be as warie as the olde wiſards. But this ſir, is to make fire froſt, to chaunge heate to colde, mirth to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſinging to ſadneſſe, pleaſure to paine, and to tye the Ape and the Bear in one tedder. Sith then young ſtemmes will not bee ſet on a withered ſtocke, that the yoong twig lieth not vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old trée, that the toyiſh conceits of youth are vnfit for the teſtie cogitations of age: I mean for your ſatiſfaction and my ſolace, to depart fram the Court, and to ſpend my dayes in trauell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerophontes</hi> no ſooner heard this determination of his ſonne <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> but his ſorrowe was halfe ſalued, and his care almoſt cured, thinking that by trauell hée
<pb facs="tcp:6139:6"/>
ſhould eyther end his life, or amend his lewdneſſe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both heartned and haſtened his ſonne in this his new courſe, leaſt delay might bréed danger, or time by ſome toy cauſe him turn his tippet, furniſhing &amp; finiſhing all things neceſſarie for his ſonnes iournie: who readie to goe (more willing to trauell, than his father to intreate him) had this friendly farewell giuen him by <hi>Clerophontes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOnne (quoth hee) there is no greater doubt which doth more déeply diſtreſſe the minde of a young man, then to determine with himſelfe what courſe of life is beſt to take: for there is ſuch a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of contrarie conceits in yong wits, that whiles they look for that they cannot like, they are loſt in ſuch an endleſſe labyrinth, as neither choice nor chance can drawe them out to their wiſhed deſires: for ſo many vaines ſo manie vanities: if vertue draweth one way, vice driueth another way: as profit perſwades them, ſo pleaſure prouokes them: as wit weigheth, will wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, if friendes counſell them to take this, fancie forceth them to chooſe that: ſo that deſire ſo long hanges in doubt, as either they chooſe none, or elſe chance on the worſt. But in my opinion, the fitteſt kind of life for a young gentleman to take (who as yet hath not ſubdued the youthfull conceits of fancie, nor made a conqueſt of his wil by wit) is to ſpend his time in trauell, whearin hee ſhall finde both pleaſure and profite: yea, and buy that by experience, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with all the treaſure in the world he cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. For what changeth vanity to vertue, ſtayleſſe wit to ſtayed wiſedome, fond fantaſies to firme affections, but trauell: what repreſſeth the rage of youth, and redreſſeth the witleſſe furie of wanton yéeres, but trauell: what tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a ſecure life to a carefull liuing, what maketh the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wiſe, yea, what increaſeth wit and augmenteth skill, but trauell? inſomuch that the fame <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> wonne, was not by the tenne yéeres he late at <hi>Troy,</hi> but by the time he ſpent in trauell. But there is nothing <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:6"/>
which in ſome reſpect is not perilous, nor nothing ſo pleaſant which may not be painfull: The fineſt Golde hath his droſſe, the pureſt wine his lees, the braueſt Roſe his prickles, each ſweete hath his ſower, each ioy his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, each weale his woe, and cuerie delight his danger.</p>
            <p>So trauaile, <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> is a courſe of life verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and yet very perillous, wherein thou maieſt practice vertue if thou take heed, or purchaſe diſcredit if thou béeſt careleſſe: where thou maieſt reape renowne if thou béeſt vertuous, and gaint reproach if thou be vicious: whereout do ſpring wiſedome and folly, fréedome and bondage, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and traſh, fame and diſcredit, honour and ſhame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſpoſition of him which either vſeth it to his profit, or abuſeth it to his diſcemmoditie. Sith then thou ſhalt beare ſaile in ſuch perillous Straightes, take heede leſt thou daſh thy Ship againſt moſt dangerous Rockes. It is a ſaying <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> not ſo common as true, that he which will heare the <hi>Syrens</hi> ſing, muſt with <hi>Vlyſles,</hi> tye himſelfe to the maſt of the ſhip, leaſt happily he be drowned. Whoſo means to be a ſuter to <hi>Circes,</hi> muſt take a Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatine, vnleſſe he will be inchanted.</p>
            <p>He that will fiſh for the <hi>Torpedo,</hi> muſt annoint his hand with the oyls of <hi>Nemiphar,</hi> leaſt he be charmed, and whoſo meaneth to enter combat with vanitie, muſt firſt ſurelie defence himſelfe with the target of vertue, vnleſſe he meane to be a captiue to care or calamitie. I ſpeake this <hi>Gwydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> by experience, which afterward thou ſhalt know by proofe: for in trauell thou ſhalt finde ſuch ſubtill <hi>Syrens,</hi> as will indanger thée, ſuch ſorcering <hi>Circes,</hi> as will inchaunt thée, ſuch poyſoned <hi>Torpedos,</hi> as will not only charme thy hand, but thy heart, if by my experience and other mens pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils thou learne not to be ware. Firſt <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> be not too ſumptuous, leaſt thou ſéem prodigall, nor to couetous, leaſt they count thee a niggard: for by ſpending in exceſſe, thou ſhalt be thought a vaine glorious foole, &amp; by too much ſparing, a couetous pelant. Be not wilfull in thy doings,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:7"/>
that they count thée not witleſſe; nor too raſh, that they think thée not deuoid of reaſon: be not too merry, that they count thée not immodeſt; nor too ſober, leaſt they call thée ſullen, but ſhew thy ſelf to be an old man for thy grauitie, and a yoong youth for thy actiuitie: ſo ſhall all men haue cauſe to praiſe thee for thy manners, and commend thee for thy modeſty. Be not too curious <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they déem thée not proud, nor too curteous, leaſt they call thée coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite. Be a friend to all, and a foe to none, and yet truſt not without tryall, nor commit anie ſecret to a friendly ſtranger, leaſt in too much truſt lie treaſon, &amp; thou be forced by repentance to crie <hi>Peccaui.</hi> The ſwéeteſt Muſke is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be taſted, the fineſt Pilles moſt bitter to be chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the flattering friend moſt tickle being tryed: then beware leaſt faire wordes makes fooles fayne, and glozing ſpéeches cauſe Had I wiſt to come too late. Lend not, <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi> a liſtning ear to the alarums of Loue, nor yield not thy fréedome to the aſſault of luſt, be not dazeled with the beames of ſading beautie, nor daunted with the deſire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euery delicate damſell: for in time ſuch bliſſe will proue but bane, and ſuch delightfull ioy, but deſpightfull annoie. Luſt <hi>Gwydonins</hi> will prooue an enemy to thy purſe, and a foe to thy perſon, a canker to thy minde, and a coraſiue to thy conſcience, a weakner of thy wit, a moleſter of thy minde, a beſofter of thy ſenſes, and finally, a mortall bane to all thy body; ſo that thou ſhalt finde pleaſure the pathway to perdition, &amp; luſting Loue the load ſtone to ruth and ruine. Séek not then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> gréedily to deuoure that bait, wherein thou knoweſt a hurtfull hooke to bee hidden: frequent not that pleaſure which will turne ſo thy poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor couet that companie which will conuert to thy confuſion, leaſt through ſuch folly thou haue cauſe in time to be ſad, and I to beſorrowfull. Now <hi>Gwydonius</hi> that thou haſt heard the aduertiſment of a louing Father, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my aduiſe as a dutiful childe: and the more to bind thée to perform my former precepts, that this my counſaile
<pb facs="tcp:6139:7"/>
be not drowned in obliuion, I giue thée this ring of golde wherein is written this ſentence, <hi>Praemonitus, Praemuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> A poeſie pretie for the words, and pithie for the matter, ſhort to be rehearſed, and long to be related; inferring this ſenſe, that he which is forewarned by friendly counſaile of imminent dangers, is forearmed againſt all future miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap and calamitie, ſo that he may by forewarning prenent perils if it bee poſſible, or if by ſiniſter fortune hee cannot eſehew them, yet hée may beare the Croſſe with more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and leſſe griefe. Keepe this King <hi>Gwydonius</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that thou mayeſt ſhew thy ſelfe to reſpect thy owne caſe, and regard my counſaile: and in ſo dooing thou ſhalt pleaſe me, and pleaſure thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CLerophontes,</hi> hauing thus ended his diſcourſe, em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bracing his ſonne with fatherly affection, and giuing him his bleſſing, went ſecretly into his Chamber, the more to couer his griefe which hée conceiued for his ſonnes departure: vnwilling his ſonne ſhould perceiue by his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row how vnfeinedly he both liked and loued him.</p>
            <p>VVEll: <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> hauing taken his leaue of his Father, furniſhed both with counſaile and coine, with aduiſe of wiſedome and ayde of wealth, paſſed on his iourney very ſolemnly, vntill hee was paſt the boundes of his Fathers Dukedome: and then as merry as might be, he trauelled by the ſpace of ſeauen weekes without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie reſidence, vntill he came to a Cittie called <hi>Barutta,</hi> where (whether hee were delighted with the ſituation of the place, or deluded with the perſwaſion of ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiticall perſons) hée ſecurely ſettled himſelfe by the ſpace of a whole yeare: in which time he ſo careleſly floated in the ſeas of voluptuouſneſſe, and ſo reckleſly raunged in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and laweleſſe libertie, thinking himſelfe a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant if he were not prodigall, counting nothing comely, if not coſtly, nothing ſeemely if not ſumptuogs, vſing ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:6139:8"/>
monſtrons exceſſe in all his actions, that the Citizens of <hi>Barutta</hi> noted him for a myrrour of immoderate life, and a very patterne of witleſſe prodigalitie: yea, his exceſſiue expences daily ſo mercaſed, that mines of gold had not bin ſufficient to maintaine his pompons magnificence; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the Magiſtrate of <hi>Barutta.</hi> not only maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led where hee had coine to counteruaile his expenſes, but alſo began to ſuſpect him eyther for ſome skilfull Alcumiſt, or that he had ſome large commiſſion to take vp thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that fell into lapſe, for want of ſufficient defence: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon béeing called before the Magiſtrates and ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what trade hee vſed, why he ſtayed ſo long in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and how hee was able to maintaine ſo princely a port as he carried: <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> vnwilling to haue them priuie to his parentage, began to coine a ſcuſe, yet not ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but hee was trapt in his own talk, and ſo caſt in priſon, where he lay clogged with care and deuoid of comfort, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not ſo much as one truſtie friend, amongſt all thoſe trothleſſe flatterers which in proſperitie had ſo frequented his companie: the ingratitude of whom ſo perplered his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted mind, as ſurcharged with ſorrow, he burſt forth into theſe tearms.</p>
            <p>ALas (quoth hee) now haue I bought that by hapleſſe experience, which if I had béen wiſe, I might haue got by happy counſell: Now am I taught that with pain and peril, which if ſelfeloue had not beſotted my ſenſes, I might haue learned with profit and pleaſure, that in the faireſt Sandes is moſt fickleneſſe, out of the braueſt Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome moſt commonly ſpringeth the worſt fruite, that the fineſt floure ſeldome hath the beſt ſmell, that the moſt gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering ſtone hath oftentimes the leaſt vertue, and that in the greateſt ſhew of good will, lyes oft times the ſmalleſt effect of friendſhip, in moſt flatterie leaſt faith, in the faireſt face the falſeſt heart, in the ſmootheſt tale the ſmalleſt truth, &amp; in the ſwéeteſt gloſes, moſt lower ingratitude: Yea, I ſée
<pb facs="tcp:6139:8"/>
now (quoth he) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in truſt lies treaſon, that fair words make fools fain, and that the ſtate of theſe fained friends are like to the Marie-gold, which as long as the Sunne ſhineth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her leaues, but with the leaſt cloud beginneth to cloſe, like the Violets in <hi>America,</hi> which in ſommer yéeld an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous ſmell, and in winter a moſt peſtilent fauour: ſo theſe Paraſites in proſperitie profeſſe moſt, but in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie performe leaſt: when Fortune fauoureth, they laugh, when ſhee frowneth, they lowre; at eueryfull ſea they flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but at euery dead Neape they fade: like to the fiſh <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerna,</hi> which being perfectly white in the calme, yet turneth paſſing black at euery ſtorm: to the trées in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſarts of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> that flouriſh but while the South winde bleweth, or to the <hi>Celedonie</hi> ſtone, which retaineth his vertue no longer than it is rubbed with gold.</p>
            <p>Sith then <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth hée) thou findes ſuch falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in friendſhip, and ſuch faithleſſe déedes in ſuch paynted ſpéeches, ſhake off theſe fawning curs with the flag of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and from henceforth trie ere thou truſt I, but (quoth he) it is too late to apply the ſalue when the ſore is incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to crie alarum when the Citie is ouerrunne, to ſéeke for couert when the ſtorme is paſt, and to take héede of ſuch flattering mates, when alreadie thou art deceiued by ſuch fawning merchaunts: now thou wilt crie <hi>Cave</hi> when thy coin is conſumed, and beware when thy wealth is wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: when thou haſt nothing wherof to take charge, thou wilt be charie, and when follie hath alreadie giuen thee a mate. thou wilt by wiſedome ſéeke to auoide the check: but now thou tryeſt it true that thy father foretolde thee, that ſo long thou wouldeſt be careleſſe, as at laſt repentance would pull thee by the ſléeue, and then Had I wiſt would come too late.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> ſith that which is once paſt can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be recalled againe, if thou haſt by folly made a fault, ſéek by wiſedome to make amendes, and heap not care vppon care, nor adde not griefe to ſorrowe, by theſe pitifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:9"/>
but chéere vp thy ſelfe and take heart at graſſe, for the ende of woe is the beginning of weale, and after mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie alwaies inſueth moſt happie felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> hauing thus dolorouſly diſcourſed with himſelfe, remained not aboue ten dayes in priſon, but that the Senate taking pittie of his caſe, and ſéeing no accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were inferred againſt him, ſet him frée from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and gaue him good counſel, that hereafter hée ſhould beware by ſuch witleſſe prodigalitie to incurre ſuch ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. <hi>Theſeus</hi> neuer triumphed more after he had eſcaped the danger of the perillous Labyrinth, than poore <hi>Gwydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did when he was ſet frée from this pernitious <hi>Limbo:</hi> now the bitterneſſe of bondage made his fréedome ſéeme farre more ſweete, and his danger ſo happily eſcaped, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his deliuery ſéem farre more delightfull. Yet he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch diſcurteſie againſt the Citizens, for repaying his liberal good will with ſuch loathſome ingratitude, that the next morning he departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Barutta,</hi> not ſtored with too much mony for moleſting his minde, nor ouercharged with coine for cumbering his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience with too much care: but hauing remaining of all his treaſure onely that ring which his father gaue him, trauelled very ſolemnely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where at that time ther raigned a certaine Duke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Orlanio,</hi> who was ſo famous and fortunate, for the peaceable gouernment of his Dukedome, adminiſtering iuſtice with ſuch ſinceritie, and yet tempering the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the law with ſuch lenitie, as hee both gayned the good will of ſtrangers in hearing his vertue, and wonne the harts of his ſubiects in féeling his bounty, counting him vnworthy to hear the name of a Soueraigne, which knew not according to deſert, both to cheriſh and chaſtiſe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>Fortune and the fates willing to place him in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of earthly proſperity, endowed him with two children,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:9"/>
the one a ſonne named <hi>Therſandro,</hi> and the other a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called <hi>Caſtania,</hi> either of them ſo adorned with the gifts of Nature, and be antifled with good nurture, as it was hard to knowe whether beautie or vertue helde the ſupremacie. But leaſt by this happie eſtate <hi>Orlanio</hi> ſhould be too much puffed vp with proſperitie, Fortune ſparing him the mate, yet gaue him a ſlender checke, to warne him from ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for before his daughter came to the age of fouretéene yeares, his wife dyed, leauing him not more ſorrowfull for the loſſe of her whom he moſt intirely loued, than carefull for the well bringing vp of her whom hee ſo dearely liked: Knowing that as his <hi>Court</hi> was a ſchoole of vertue to ſuch as bridled their mindes with diſcretion, ſo it was a nurſs of vice to thoſe tender yeares that meaſured their willes with witleſſe affection, eſteeming libertie as perillous to the ſtaie of youth, as precious to the ſtate of age, and that nothing ſo ſoone allureth the minde of a young maide to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to paſſe her youth without feare in ſecurity. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the conſideration of theſe premiſſes, to auoyde the inconueniences that might happen by ſuffering <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to leade her life in lawleſſe libertie, hee thought it beſt to chooſe out ſome vertuous Ladie to kéepe her companie, who might direct her courſe by ſo true a compaſſe, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel her life by ſo right a line, that although her young years were verie apt to be intangled in the ſnares of vanity, yet by her counſaile and companie, ſhee might ſteadily tread her ſteps in the trace of vertue: and none he could find more fit for the purpoſe, than a certain olde widow, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Melytta,</hi> honoured for her vertuous life throughout all <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who being ſent for to the Court, he ſaluted on this manner.</p>

In ſomuch that, incenſed by this thy ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commendation, I haue ſelected thée as the onely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whome I meane to commit my chiefeſt treaſure: I mean, <hi>Melytta,</hi> my daughter <hi>Caſtania,</hi> to whom I will haue thee bee both a companion and a counſellour, haping thou wilt take ſuch care to traine her vp in vertue, &amp; trace her quite from vice, to winne her minde to honeſtie, and weane her quite from vanitie, that ſhe in her ripe yeares ſhall haue cauſe to thanke thee for thy paines, and I occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian to regard thée as a friend, and reward thee for thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>FIrſt <hi>Melytta,</hi> ſee that ſhe leade her life both charily and chaſtly. Let her not haue her owne will, leaſt ſhee proue too wilfull: or too much libertie, leaſt ſhee become too light. The palme tree preſſed downe, groweth notwithſtanding but too faſt. The heath <hi>Spattania,</hi> though troden on, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verie tall: and youth although ſtrictly reſtrained, will proue but too ſtubburne.</p>
            <p>The veſſell ſauoureth alwayes of that licour wherwith it was firſt ſeaſoned and the minde retaineth thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in age wherein it was trained vp in youth. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twig is ſonner broken than the ſtrong branch, the yong ſtem more brittle than the old ſtocke, the weake bramble ſhaken with euerie wind, and the wanering will of youth toſſed with euerie paſte of vanitie, readie to bee wracked in the waues of wantonneſſe, vnleſſe it be cunningly guided by ſome wiſe and warie Pilot.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Melytta,</hi> ſith youth is ſo eaſily entrapped with the alluring traine of fooliſh delights, and ſo ſoone entangled with the traſh of pernitions pleaſure, ſuffer not my daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to paſſe her time in idleneſſe, leaſt happily being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at diſcouert, ſhee become a careleſſe captiue to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for whan the minde once floateth in the ſurging ſeas of idle conceits, then the puffes of voluptuous pleaſures and the ſtifling ſtormes of vnbrideled fancy, the raging
<pb facs="tcp:6139:10"/>
blaſtes of alluring beautie, and the ſturdie gale of glozing vanitie, ſo ſhake the Shippe of reckleſſe youth, that it is dayly in doubt to ſuffer moſt dangerous ſhipwracke. But let her ſpend her time in reading ſuch auncient authors as may ſharpen her wit by their pithie ſayings, and learne her wiſedome by their perfect ſentences. For where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is vicious, by learning it is amended, and where it is vertuous by skill it is augmented. The ſtone of ſecret vertue is of greater price if it be brauely poliſhed, the gold though neuer ſo pure of it ſelfe hath the better colour if it be burniſhed, and the minde though neuer ſo vertuous, is more noble if it be enriched with the gifts of learning. And <hi>Melytta,</hi> for recreation ſake, let her vſe ſuch honeſt ſports as may drine away dumps, leaſt ſhe be too penſiue, and free her minde from fooliſh conceits, that ſhee bee not too wanton.</p>
            <p>Thus (Madame) as you haue heard my fatherly aduiſe, ſo I pray you giue my daughter the like friendly aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement; that hereafter ſhe may haue both cauſe to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence me, and to reward thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melytta</hi> hauing heard with attentiue héed the minde of <hi>Orlanio,</hi> conceiued ſuch ioy in this new charge, and ſuch delight in this happy chance, as with cheerefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhe repayed him this anſwere.</p>
            <p>SIr (quoth ſhe) although in the largeſt ſeas are the foreſt tempeſts in the broadeſt waies moſt boiſterous windes, in the higheſt hilles, moſt dangerous happes, and in the greateſt charge the greateſt care: yet the dutie which I owe you as my Soueraigne, and the loue I beare you as a ſubiect, the care I haue to pleaſe you as my Prince, and to pleaſure you as a Potentate, the truſt you repoſe in my trueth without ſufficient tryall, the confidence you put in my conſcience without ſure proofe, the curteſie your Grace doth ſhewe me without anie deſert, haue ſo inflamed the forepaſſed fire of dutifull affection, and ſo incouraged
<pb facs="tcp:6139:11"/>
me to encounter your Graces curteſie, with willing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, that there is no hap ſo hard which I woulde not hazard, no danger ſo deſperate which I woulde not aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no burthen ſo heauie which I would not beare, no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill ſo huge which I would not paſſe, no charge ſo great, which both willingly and warily I woulde not performe. For, ſince it hath pleaſed your Grace to vouchſafe ſo much of my ſimple calling, as to aſſigne me for a companion for your daughter <hi>Caſtania,</hi> I will take ſuch care in the charie performance of my charge, and indenour with ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence both to counſaile &amp; comfort <hi>Caſtania,</hi> as your Grace ſhall perceiue my dutie in pleaſing you, and my diligence in pleaſuring her.</p>
            <p>THe Duke hearing the friendly &amp; faithfull proteſtation of the good Lady <hi>Melytta,</hi> tolde her that although it were great trouble for one of her age to frame her ſelf as a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch yong youth, and that ſome care belonged to ſuch a charge, yet hee would ſo counternalle her painful labour with princely liberalitie, that both ſhe and all <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> ſhould haue cauſe to ſpeak of his bountie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MElytta,</hi> thanking the Duke for ſuch vndeſerued curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſetting her houſhold affaires in good order, repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Court as ſpéedily as might be. But leauing her with <hi>Caſtania,</hi> again to <hi>Gwydonius:</hi> who now being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> pinched with pouerty, &amp; diſtreſſed with want, hauing no coine left wherewith to counteruaile his expences, thought it his beſt courſe, if it were poſſible, to compaſſe the Dukes ſeruice: repairing therfore to the court hée had not ſtaied there thrée dayes before he found fit opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to offer his ſeruice to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> whom very dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaluted in this manner.</p>
            <p>THe report (right worthie Prince) of your incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curteſie and pearleſſe magnanimity is ſo blazed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb facs="tcp:6139:11"/>
throughout all Countries, by the golden trumpe of Fame, that your Grace is not more loued of your ſubiects which taſt of your liberall bountie, than honoured of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which only heare of your princely vertue. Inſomuch that it hath forced me to leaue my natiue ſoile, my parents, kindred, and familiar friends, and pilgrimlike to paſſe into a ſtrange Country, to try that by experience héer, which I haue heard by report at home. For it is not (right worthy Sir) the ſtate of your Country that hath altured me (for I deeme <hi>Bohemia,</hi> wherof I am, no leſſe pleaſant than <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria)</hi> neither hath want of liuing or hope of gain intiſed me, for I am by birth a Gentleman, and iſſued of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as are able with ſufficient patrimonie to maintaine my eſtate: but the deſire, not onely to ſée, but alſo to learne ſuch rare curteſie and vertuous qualities as fame hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be put in practice in your Court, is the onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this my iourny. Now if in recompenee of this my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trauaile, it ſhal pleaſe your Grace to vouchſafe of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I ſhall think my ſelf fully ſatiſfied, and my pains ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently requited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orlanio,</hi> hearing this dutifull diſcourſe of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> marking his manners, and muſing at his modeſtie, noting both his excellent courteſie, and exquiſite beautie, was ſo inflamed with friendly affection toward this yoong youth, that not only hee accepted of his ſeruice, but alſo preferred him as a companion to his ſonne <hi>Therſandro,</hi> promiſing that ſince hee had left his Country and Parents for this cauſe, he would ſo counteruaile his dutifull deſert with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and friendſhip, as he ſhould neuer haue cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> repaying heartie thankes to the Duke for his vndeſerued curteſie, being now brought from woe to weale, from deſpaire to hope, from bale to bliſſe, from care to ſecuritie, from want to wealth, yea, from helliſh miſery, to heauenly proſperitie, behaued himſelfe ſo wiſely and warily with ſuch curteſie in conuerſation, and modeſtie in
<pb facs="tcp:6139:12"/>
manners, that in ſhort time hee not onely purchaſed credit and countenance with <hi>Orlanio,</hi> but was moſt intirely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and loued of <hi>Therſando.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, there remained in the Court a young knight, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Signior <hi>Valericus,</hi> who by chance caſting his glancing eies on the glittering beautie of <hi>Caſtania,</hi> was ſo fettered in the ſnare of fancie, and ſo entangled with the trap of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſo perplered in the Labyrinth of pinching loue, and ſo inchanted with the charme of <hi>Venus</hi> Sorcerie, that as the Elephant reioiceth greatly at the ſight of a Roſe, as the Bird <hi>Halciones</hi> delighteth to view the feathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi> and as nothing better contenteth a Ro-Buck, than to gaze at a red cloth; ſo there was no obiect that could allurc the wauering eyes of <hi>Valericus,</hi> as the ſurpaſſing beautie of <hi>Caſtania:</hi> yea, his only bliſſe, pleaſure, ioy, &amp; delight, was in féeding his fancy with ſtaring on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Heauenly face of his goddeſſe. But alas her beautie bred his bane, her lookes his loſſe, her ſight is ſorrow, her exquiſite perfections, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paſſions, that as the Ape by ſéeing the Snaile is infected, as the <hi>Leopard</hi> falleth in a traunce at the ſight of the Locuſt, as the Cockatrice dyeth with beholding the Chriſolito, ſo poore <hi>Valericus</hi> was pinched to the heart with viewing her comely countenance, was griped with galling griefe, and tortured with inſupportable torments, by gazing vpon the gallant beauty of ſo gorgeous a dame: yea, he ſo framed in his fancie the forme of her face, and ſo imprinted in his hart the perfection of her perſon, that the remembrance therof would ſuffer him to take no reſt, but he paſſed the day in dolour, the night in ſorrow, no minute without mourning, no houre without heauineſſe, that falling into penſiue paſſions hee began thus to parle with himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Why how now <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth hée) art thou haunted with ſome helliſh hagge, or paſſeſſed with ſome frantike furie? art thou inchaunted with ſome magicall charme, or charmed with ſome bewitching Sorcerie, that ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
<pb facs="tcp:6139:12"/>
thy minde is perplexed with a thouſand ſundry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, alate frée, and now fettered, alate ſwimming in reſt, and now ſinking in care, erewhile in ſecuritie, and now in captiuitie, yea turned from mirth to mourning, from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to paine, from delight to deſpight, hating thy ſelfe, and louing her who is the chiefe cauſe of this thy calamitie. Ah <hi>Valericus,</hi> haſt thou forgot the ſaying of <hi>Propertius,</hi> that to loue, howſoeuer it be, is to loſe; and to fancie, how charie ſo euer thy choice be, is to haue an ill chance? for Loue though neuer ſo fickle is but a <hi>Chaos</hi> of care; and fancie, though neuer ſo fortunate, is but a maſſe of miſerie: for if thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the beautie of <hi>Venus,</hi> thou ſhalt finde it ſmall vantage: if thou get one as wiſe as <hi>Minerua,</hi> thou maieſt put thy winnings in thine eye, if as gorgious as <hi>Iuno,</hi> thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts being caſt, thy gain ſhalbe but loſſe: yea, be ſhe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſhe chaſt, be ſhe curteous, be ſhe conſtant, be ſhee rich, be ſhe renowmed, be ſhee honeſt, be ſhee honourable, yet if thou be wedded to a woman, thinke thou ſhalt finde in her ſufficient vanitie to counteruaile her vertue, that thy happineſſe will bée matcht with heauineſſe, thy quiet with care, thy contentation with vexation: that thou ſhalt ſowe ſeede with ſorrowe, and reape thy corne with ſadneſſe, that thou ſhalt neuer liue without griefe, nor die without Repentance: for in matching with a Wife there are ſuch miſchiefes, and in marriage ſuch miſeries, that <hi>Craterus</hi> the Emperour wiſhing ſome ſiniſter fortune to happen vpon one of his foes, prayed vnto the gods that hée might hée married in his youth, and die without iſſue in his age, counting marriage ſuch a cumberſome croſſe, and a Wife ſuch a pleaſant plague, that he thought his foe could haue no worſe torment, than to bée troubled with ſuch noyſome traſh. Oh <hi>Valericus,</hi> if the conſideration of theſe premiſſes bée not ſufficient to perſwade thee: if the ſentence of <hi>Propertius</hi> cannot quench thy flame, nor the ſaying of <hi>Craterus</hi> coole thy fancie, call to minde what miſeries, what miſchiefes, what woes, what wailings,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:13"/>
what miſhaps, what murthers, what care, what calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue happened to ſuch, as haue béell beſotted with the balefull beautie of women, enioying more care than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, more paine than profite, more coſt man comfort, more griefe than good: yea, reaping a tunne of droſſe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery dramm of perfect gold.</p>
            <p>What careleſſe inconſtancie ruled <hi>Eriphila?</hi> What cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh crueltie raigned in <hi>Philomela?</hi> How inceſtuous a life led <hi>Aeuropa?</hi> and how miſerable was that man that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Sthuolea?</hi> VVhat gaines got <hi>Tereus</hi> in winning <hi>Progne,</hi> but a loathſome death for a little delight. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> in poſſeſſing the beautie of <hi>Creſida,</hi> cauſed the Greeian armie moſt grieuouſly to be plagued. <hi>Candaules</hi> was ſlaine by his murthering wife, whom ſo intirely hée loued. Who was thought more happie than the husband of <hi>Helena,</hi> and yet who in time leſſe fortunate? What hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe chaunces inſued of the chaſtitie of <hi>Penelope?</hi> What broiles in <hi>Rome</hi> by the vertue of <hi>Lucretia?</hi> The one cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſutors moſt horribly to bée ſlaine, and the other that <hi>Tarquine</hi> and all his poſteritie were rooted out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignities. <hi>Phaedra</hi> in louing killed her hapleſſe ſonne <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> and <hi>Clitemneſtra</hi> in hating ſlewe her louing husband <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> Alas <hi>Valericus,</hi> how dangerous is it then to deale with ſuch dames, which if they loue, they procure thy fatall care: and if they hate thee, thy finall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie?</p>
            <p>But ah blaſphemous beaſt that I am! thus reckleſly to raile and rage without reaſon, thus curriſhly to exclaime againſt thoſe, without whom our life though neuer ſo luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, ſhould ſéem moſt loathſome? thus <hi>Tymon</hi> like, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe heauenly creatures, whoſe only ſight is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſalue againſt all helliſh ſorrowes: Is this right, to conclude generally of particular premiſes? Is it iuſtice to accuſe all for the fault of ſome? Is it equitie to blame the ſtaie of vertuous women, for the ſtate of vicious wantons? Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Valericus</hi> to ſhake off the ſhackles of
<pb facs="tcp:6139:13"/>
fancie with this follie? Or to eſchue the baite of beautie, by breathing out ſuch blaſphemie? No, no, aſſure thy ſelf, that theſe thy raging reaſons, will in time be moſt rige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly renenged, that the gods themſelues will plague thée for braying out ſuch iniurious ſpéeches. Alas, Loue wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deſire, maketh the minde deſperate: and fixed fancie bereaued of loue turneth into furie. The loyall faith I beare to <hi>Caſtania,</hi> and the loathſome feare of her ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the déep deſire which inforceth my hope, &amp; the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpaire which infringeth my hap, ſo toſſeth my minde with contrarie cogitations, that I neither regard what I ſay, to my harme; nor reſpect what I doo, to my own hurt: yea, my ſenſes are ſo belotted with pinching loue, and my minde ſo fretted with frying fancie, that death were thrice more welcome, than thus to linger in deſpairing hope.</p>
            <p>And with that to paſſe away thoſe penſiue paſſions, hée flung out of his chamber with his Hawke on his fiſt, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by ſuch ſport to driue away this melanchollie humor, which ſo moleſted his minde.</p>
            <p>But as hée was paſſing through the Court, hee was luckilie encountred by <hi>Melytta</hi> and <hi>Caſtania,</hi> who minding to haue ſome ſport with <hi>Valericus</hi> before hée did paſſe: had the onſet thus pleaſantly giuen him by <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II is hard Signor <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth ſhee) to take you eyther without your Hawke on your fiſt, or your heart on your halfepenie: for if for recreation you bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing the Partridge with dogges, you are in ſolemne meditation driuing awaie the time with dumpes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caring for companie to ſolace your ſadneſſe, norplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantlie diſcourſing of ſome amorous <hi>Parle:</hi> which makes the Gentlewomen of this Court thinke, that you are either an Apoſtata to loue, as was <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> or haue diſplayed the flagge of deffance againſt Fancie, as did Tyanaeus. If theſe their ſurmiſed coniectures bèe true,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:14"/>
               <hi>Valericus,</hi> I warne thée as a friend to beware by other mens harmes, leaſt if thou imitate their actions, thou bée mangled with the like miſerie, or maimed with the like miſfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hearing his Saint pronouncing this ſuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red harmonie, feeling himſelfe ſomewhat toucht with this quipping talke, was ſo rapt in admiration of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and ſo rauiſht in the contemplation of hir beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that hée ſtood in a maze not able to vtter one word, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laſt gathering his wits together, hée burſt forth in theſe ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth he) what it pleaſeth the gentle women of this court to ſormiſe of my ſolitarines I know not: but if they attribute it to curiouſnes, or coineſſe, to ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſtatelineſſe, either that I am an enemy to loue, or a foe to fancie, that I deteſt their bountie with <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> or contemne their beautie with <hi>Tiancus,</hi> they offer me great iniurie ſo raſhly to coniecture of my diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightly they haue caſt my water. But to put your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhip out of doubt what is the cauſe of my dumpes, ſo it is, that of late raunging the fieldes, my heart (my hawke I ſhould ſaie Madame) houered at ſuch a princely praie, and yet miſt of her flight, that ſince ſhee hath neither pruned her ſelfe, nor I taken anie pleaſure. Marie if the fates ſhould ſo fauour mee, or fortune ſo ſhroud me vp in proſperitie, that my deſire might obtaine her wiſh, I would not onely change my mourning to mirth, my dolor to delight, and my care to ſecurity, but I would thinke to haue gotten as rich a praie as euer <hi>Caeſar</hi> gayned by conqueſt.</p>
            <p>SVrely Signor <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth <hi>Melytta)</hi> no doubt the praie is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:6139:14"/>
nor you of fooliſhneſſe for want of pleaſure. And if your heart (your Hawke I ſhould ſay, Signior <hi>Valericus)</hi> hath reacht farther with her eye, than ſhe is able to mount with her wing, although I am no skilfull Fawlkner, yet I think you had better kéep her on the fiſt ſtil, and ſo féede her with hope, than let her miſſe againe of her flight, and ſo ſhe turnetaile and be foiled.</p>
            <p>Indeede Madame (quoth <hi>Valericus)</hi> your counſaile is very good, for as there is no better confect to a crazed mind, than hope, ſo there is no greater coraſiue to a careful man, than deſpaire, and the Falkners alſo iumpe with you in the ſame verdite, that the Hawke which miſſeth her pray, is doubtfull to foare aloofe and proue haggard. Yet if ſhe were ſo tickle, as ſhe would take no ſtand, ſo ramage as ſhe would be reclaimed with no lure, I had rather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely hazarde her for the gayning of ſo péerleſſe a pray, though I both loſt her, and wanted of my wiſh, than by keeping her ſtill in the Bines, to proue her a kite, or mee a coward.</p>
            <p>Indéed Sir (quoth <hi>Caſtania)</hi> Fortune euer fauoureth them that are valiant: and things the more hard, the more haughtie, high and heauenly: neither is any thing hard to bee accompliſht, by him that hardily enterpriſeth it. But yet take heede that you fiſh not ſo faire, that at length you catch a Frogge, and then repentance make you mumble vp a maſſe with <hi>Miſerere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Madame (quoth he) it is neuer ſéene that hée which is contented with his chance, ſhould euer haue cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his choice.</p>
            <p>And yet (quoth ſhe) he that buies a thing too deare, may be content with his chaffer, and yet wiſh he had been more charie.</p>
            <p>Trueth Madame (quoth <hi>Valericus)</hi> but then it is traſh and no treaſure, for that which is pretious is neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and a bad thing though neuer ſo cheap, is thought too chargeable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6139:15"/>
Oh Sir (quoth <hi>Melytta)</hi> and is it not an olde ſaying, that a man may buy golde too deare, and that iewels though neuer ſo pretious, may be ſet at too high a price? I ſee if you had no better skill in manning of a Hawke, than in making of a bargaine, you would proue but an ill Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But ſince we haue ſo long troubled you with our talk, we will nowe leaue you to your ſport, and ſo bid you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> with a courteous <hi>Conge,</hi> repaying their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and with a glauncing eye giuing his goddeſſe the dolefull <hi>A dio,</hi> went ſolitarilie into the ſecret woodes, where laying him downe in the ſhade, he fell into theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing meditations:</p>

            <p>MAdame (quoth hee) for that I ſée you ſitting thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie in dumps, I am the bolder to preaſe in place, although the moſt vnworthy man to ſupply it. Hoping you will pardon my rudeneſſe for troubling thus raſhly your muſing meditations, and count my company the leſſe offenſiue in that I ſée you buſied with no ſuch ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whereunto my preſence may be greatly preiudiciall. <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Philoſopher, Madam, was of this minde, that when the gods made beautie, they skipt beyond their skill, in that they framed it of greater force than they themſelues were able toreſiſt. If then there is none ſo wiſe or worthy whom beauty cannot wrack, nor none iſſued of ſuch prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth whom beauty cannot bend, though I haue béene intangled with the ſnare of fancie, and haue liſtned to the lure of beauty, I am the more to be borne with, and the leſſe to be blamed. For I muſt of force confeſſe Madame, that the gifts of nature ſo aboundantly beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, your excellent beauty and exquiſite vertue, haue ſo ſcaled the walls of my fancie, and ſacked the fort of my fréedom, that for my laſt refuge I am forced to appeale vnto your curteſie, as the onely medicine which may cure my into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable diſeaſe. Nay incurable I may well call it, for (I ſpeake with teares outwardly, and drops of blood inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) vnleſſe the mizling ſhowers of your mercie mittigate the fire of my fancie, the droppes of your princely fauour quench the flame of my affection, and the guerdon of your good will giue a ſoueraigne plaiſtor for my ſecret ſore, I am like to paſſe my life in more miſerie, than if I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the internall torments. But I hope it is not poſſible, that out of a ſugered Fount would diſtill a bitter ſtreame,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:17"/>
out of a fragrant flower a filthhy ſap, and from ſuch diuine beautie ſhould procéed hate and helliſh crueltie.</p>
            <p>It is Madame, your beautie which hath wrought my wo, and it is your bountie which muſt work my weale. It is your heauenly face which hath depriued me of libertie, and your curteous conſent muſt bee the meanes to redéeme me from captiuitie: for as he that eateth of the Brain leaſe, and is infected, can by no meanes be cured, vnleſſe he taſts of the ſame roote: as hée which is wounded of the Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins, can neuer bee healed vnleſſe his wounds bée waſht with the bloud of the ſame beaſt: as there is nothing better againſt the ſtinging of a Snake, than to be rubbed with an Adders ſlough, and as he which is hurt of the Scorpion ſéekes a ſalue from whom he receiued the ſore, ſo loue onely is remedied by loue, and fancie by mutuall affection: you Madame, muſt miniſter the medicine, which procured the maladie, and it onely lies in your power to applie the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which inferred the paine.</p>
            <p>Therfore I appeale to your good grace and fauour, and at the barre of your beautie I humbly holde vp my hands, reſting to abide your ſentence, either of conſent vnto life, or deniall vnto death.</p>
            <p>CAſtania hearing this ſolemne diſcourſe of <hi>Valericus,</hi> was driuen into a maze with this vnlookt for motion, muſing that hee would ſo farre ouerſhoote himſelfe, as to attempt ſo vnlikely a match, and therefore with diſdainfull countenance ſhe gaue him this daunt:</p>
            <p>AS your preſent arriuall Signor <hi>Valericus</hi> dooth not greatly preindice my muſes, ſo I think it will as litle profit your motion: and as your company pleaſeth mée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the perſon, ſo it much miſliketh me, reſpecting the <hi>Parle:</hi> that your counts being once caſt you ſhall find your abſence might haue more pleaſured you, and better conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me.

<pb facs="tcp:6139:17"/>
to that Lure wherin the pens of a <hi>Chameleon</hi> are pricked, becauſe ſhe doth deadly deteſt them, it is hard to traine the Lyon to that trappe which ſauoureth of Diagredium, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loatheth it. And it is as impoſſible to perſwade me to enter league with fancie, which am a mortall foe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to vow my ſeruice to <hi>Venus,</hi> which am alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die addicted to <hi>Diana.</hi> No, no ſir, I mean not to loue, leaſt I liue by the loſſe, nor to chooſe, leaſt my skill being ſmall, I repent my chance. Shee that is frée and willingly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into fetters is a foole, and whoſo becommeth captiue without conſtraint, may be either thought wilfull or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. It is good by other mens harmes to learn to beware, and to looke before a man doth leaps, leaſt in skipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his skill, he light in the mire. Whoſo conſidereth the fickleneſſe of mens affections, and the fléeting fondneſſe of their fading fancie, who carefully looketh at the lightneſſe of their loue, and marketh the inconſtancie of their waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring minde, who readeth the records which make mention of their deepe diſſembling, faithleſſe proteſtations, falſe vowes, periured promiſes, fayned loue, and forged flattery: how poore <hi>Ariadne</hi> was abuſed, how <hi>Medea</hi> was mocked, how <hi>Dido</hi> was deceiued, how <hi>Oenone</hi> was reiected, and how <hi>Phyllis</hi> was forſaken, and yet would be allured to the traine with ſuch filthie ſcraps, I would count her chaunce too good, were her choice neuer ſo bad. But leauing theſe neceſſarie doubts, <hi>Valericus,</hi> I tel you for troth, if I meant to loue, it is not you I mean to like: if affection forced me, it is not your perſon I mean to fancie, your patrimony is not ſufficient to counteruaile my parentage, nor your bringing vp my birth, and therfore I would wiſh you to ſow the ſéede of your ſute in a more fertile ſoile, for in me you ſhall finde no grafts of grant to growe, nor no conſent to be cropped, for I neither like of your vnlikely loue, nor mean not to be framed to your fancie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> beeing puſhed with this pike, thought it a ſigne of ſmall courage to yeeld at the firſt foyne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:6139:18"/>
looking more narrowly to his ward, and gathering himſelfe within his weapon, he ſtood to his tackling with this reply:</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth he) if you condenm me of folly for clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a ſtaffe too high, or accuſe me of fondneſſe far lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my loue on a perſon of ſuch princely parentage, it I ſeeme to make an ill market in cheaping ſuch precious chaffer, as the price thereof is far aboue my reach, yet my offence is too ſmall to beare anie waightie penance, ſith where the fault proceedeth of loue, there the pardon inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of courſe, but your beautie ſhall beare all the blame, as the onely ſpurre of this my raſh enterpriſe. For as it is impoſſible for the yron to reſiſt the operation of the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, or the ſilly ſtrawe the vertue of the ſucking teat, ſo as impoſſible it is for a louer to withſtand the brunt of beautie, to freeze if he ſtand by the flame, or to peruert the lawes of Nature. So that Madame if you knew what a breache your beautie hath made into my breaſt, and bow déepely I haue ſhrined the idoll of your perſon in my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe heart, I aſſure my ſelf though my perſon and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, my birth and bringing vp be far vnfit for ſuch a mate yet you would deeme my loue and loyaltie to deſerue no leſſe. Loyaltie I call it Madam; for as all things are not made of one mould, ſo all men are not of one minde: as the Serpentine powder is quickly kindled, and quickly out, ſo the Salamander ſtone once ſet on fire can neuer bee quenched: as the ſoft ware is apt to receiue euerie impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo the hard metall neuer changeth form without mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>Iaſon</hi> was neuer ſo tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:6139:18"/>
mée ſo farre into your fauour, as that I may fréely enioie the ſight of your ſweet face, and féed my fancie in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of your beautie; in liewe therof, I will repaie ſuch dutifull ſeruice, as the betrothed faith of <hi>Eraſta</hi> to his <hi>Perſida,</hi> ſhall not compare with the loue of <hi>Valericus</hi> and <hi>Caſtania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAſtania</hi> hearing theſe perplexed paſſions proceed from wofull <hi>Valericus,</hi> pricked forwarde to take ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of his torments, felt within her minde a carefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwéen fancie and the fates, loue &amp; the deſtinies: fancy perſwaded her to take pittie of his paines, the fates forced her to giue him the repulſe: loue wiſht her to return his good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wil with gaine, the deſtinies draue her to deny his requeſt: toſſed thus with contrary cogitations, at laſt ſhe burſt forth into theſe doubtfull ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VAlericus,</hi> as I am not altogether to reward thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will with hate, ſo I cannot repaie it with loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fancie denies me to like: to marry I meane not, to retaine ſeruants I may not. Marie, to let thee eyther to loue, or looke, take this for an anſwere, I neyther can nor will.</p>
            <p>And with that ſhée went her way, leauing <hi>Valericus</hi> greatly daunted with this doubtfull anſwere, with feare and hope ſo fiercely aſſayled, that being left alone, he began thus to conſider of his amorous conceits.</p>
            <p>IF euer wofull creature had cauſe to complain his wofull eaſe, then vndoubtedly may I preace for the formoſt place: for there is no ſorrow more ſower, no torment more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no grief more grieuous, no heauineſſe more hurtfull, than to haue deſire requited with deſpight, and good will with hate, then to like vpon hope of curteſſe, and to finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hate and helliſh crueltie.</p>
            <p>Alas poore <hi>Valericus,</hi> is thy true loue thus triflingly
<pb facs="tcp:6139:19"/>
accounted of, is this the guerdon for thy good will? Deoth thy deepe deſire merite no better deſert, then haſt thou no choice, but eyther to dye deſperately, or elſe to liue loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly? Why fond foole doeſt thou count her cruell, that at the firſt giues not a frée conſent? Doeſt thou think her coie that commeth not at the firſt call, wouldeſt thou haue the match made at the firſt motion? She that is wonne with a word will bee loſt with a winde, the Hawke that bates at euery caſt of the Lure, will neuer bee ſtedfaſt on the ſtonde, the woman that frameth her will to euery wiſh will proue but a wilde wanten. No, no, <hi>Valericus,</hi> let not her denials daunt thée, let not the ſower taſte of her talke quat thy queaſte ſtomacke, conſter all things at the beſt, though her cenſure was very ſeuere, yet ſhee knit vp her talke with a curteous cloſe. The hound which at the firſt default giueth ouer the chaſe, is called but a curre. The Knight that finding the firſt encounter comberſom, giueth ouer the queſt, is counted but a coward, and the louer that at the firſt denyall is daunted with deſpayre, is neyther worthy to obtaine his deſire, nor to enioy his deſert. And with that he flung out of his Chamber, both to auoid the melancholy which tormented his minde, and ſée if he could haue a ſight of his goddeſſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caſtania</hi> altogether vnwilling to <hi>parle</hi> with her new patient, kept herſelfe out of his ſight: which <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> eſpying, was no whit amazed, but like a valiant ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gaue the fort a freſh aſſault with a new kinde of batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſéeking to obtaine that with writing, which he could not gaine with words, and therefore ſpéedily framed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to this effect.</p>

               <hi>VAlericus</hi> his heart was ſo hardened with hate, as he was nothing diſmaied with this rigorous reply, but thought himſelfe halfe ſatiſfied, that hee had thus kindly toucht her to the quicke, praying the gods, that ſith it was not in his poſſibilitie to make any ſufficient reuenge, they would by ſome ſiniſter meanes requite her cruelty. But leauing him to his dumps, at laſt to <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the beautie of his body, and the bounty of his minde (wherat all <hi>Alexandria</hi> wondered) had by good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfect practice, obtained ſuch a dexterity in all things, as in feates of arms no man more forward, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe none more actiue, in play none more politicke, in parle none more pleaſant: amongſt the Auncients verie wiſe, amongſt the youthfull who more merry? ſo that there was no time, perſon, nor place, whereto aptly hee applyed not himſelfe: inſomuch that hee entred into ſuch fauour and familiarity with <hi>Therſandro</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſtania,</hi> that he was the onely man whoſe company they deſired to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.

felt a certaine reſtraint of libertie in her affections, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of minde, and as it were a ciuile aſſault within her ſelfe: but hauing ſmall practice in the panges of loue, ſhe could not coniecture the ſecret cauſe of theſe her ſodain paſſions, thinking that as it was a toye lightly taken, ſo it would as lightly be left: and vpon this, ſtill ſhee reſted, conceiuing onely an ordinary kinde of liking towardes <hi>Gwydonius.</hi>

            <p>Doeſt thou thinke then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> in winning ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a péece, to purchace thy fathers diſpleaſure? nay aſſure thy ſelfe hee will not onely be content with thy chance, but hee will thinke thou haſt runne a happier race, than <hi>Hyppomanes</hi> did in winning <hi>Atlante.</hi> Content thée w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thy chance.

Nay <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> if thou weigh thy caſe in the equal ballance, thou haſt more cauſe of feare than of hope; of doubt than of aſſurance, of miſſing thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, than of obtayning thy purpoſe.</p>

            <p>Beſides, alas, Fortune her ſelfe denieth me any ſuch fauour: my good will as yet hath deſerued no ſuch guerdon, my deſire is farre aboue my deſertes, my ambition aboue my condition, and the poor ſtay of wandering <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> farre vnfit for the princely ſtate of worthy <hi>Caſtania.</hi> But put caſe ſhe did will as I did, wiſh that ſhee were pricked in the ſame veine, caught in the ſame ſnare, trapped with the like traine, and fired with the like fancy, yet the Duke her father will neither condeſcend to her minde, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my motion, neither thinke well of her liking nor of my loue: nay if he ſhould but once heare of ſuch reckleſſe folly, as he hath wrought my promotion, ſo he would work my confuſion, as he hath béen my friend, ſo he woulde bée my foe, and in troth <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> not without cauſe. For art thou ſo voyd of vertue, or vowed to vice, ſo nurſed vp in vanity, or nulled vp in villany, as to require his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie with ſuch diſloyaltie, to returne the truſt which he repoſeth in thée, with ſuch treaſon. Tuſh, Loue is aboue Lord or Lawe, friend or faith. Where Loue leadeth, no maiſter is made account of, no king cared for, no friend forced of, no duty reſpected, but all things done according to the qualitie that is predominant. Why <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> what doubts are theſe that thou thus dreameſt on? Why doeſt thou caſt beyonde the Moon, and fear before thou art in daunger to fall? knowing that Loue and fortune deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not them that are daſtards, nor careth for them that are cowardes. The Captaine that retyreth from the walles before hée hath the repulſe, ſhall neuer returne a conquerour, the Souldiour that fainteth before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile be fought, ſhall neuer vaunt himſelfe of victorie. Hée that feareth euery tempeſt is not fit to be a trauailer. Hée that doubteth euery waue ſhall neuer proue a perfect Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and he that in loue dreadeth euery chip of miſchaunce, may well encoounter, but neuer obtaine the conqueſt.
<pb facs="tcp:6139:24"/>
Sith then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> hardy venturing is a ſigne of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py victory, ſound out the march with the trumpet of truſt, begin the aſſault, giue the onſet. Laie the battering pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Loue, againſt the bulwarke of beautie, and no doubt thy ſucceſſe ſhall be ſuch as thou ſhalt triumph with <hi>Caeſar</hi> and ſay, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi> And art thou ſo preſumptuous fond foole, as to promiſe thy ſelfe the conqueſt? knoweſt thou not that the path of loue is perilous? And with that he fell into ſuch melancholie paſſions, ſuch contrary cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſuch doubtfull thoughts, ſuch fearefull ſuppoſes, that as hée which eateth of the Goorde roote loſeth his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and as the Elephant when he eateth of the Helitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion leafe, is then very ſléepie; ſo <hi>Gwydonius</hi> was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with theſe vnacquainted paſſions, that contrarie to his cuſtome he had driuen myrth into mourning, pleaſant conceits into painfull cares, laughing into lowring, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging into ſorrow: and being thus beſotted, to ſolace himſelf he went into a Parke adioyning to the Dukes Palace, where ſitting vnder the ſhade of a Béech trée, leaning his head on his hand, he lay as one in a ſlumber. But Fortune willing ſomewhat to fauour this young nouice, brought it to paſſe, that <hi>Therſandro, Valericus, Caſtania,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytta,</hi> with diuerſe other Gentlemen, were for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſake ranging in the ſame Park: who eſpying ghoſtly <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> ſitting as one in a trance, <hi>Caſtania</hi> paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt, pulling him by the ſléeue, draue him thus out of his dump.</p>
            <p>VVHy how now <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth ſhee) are you dreaming or doubting, or is your mind muſing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſom metaphyſicall motions, that you ſit thus as a man half mortified?

<pb facs="tcp:6139:24"/>
with brutiſh teares, as his outward plaints did ſufficiently bewray his inward paſſions. In truth <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> I had taken thee for <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> if thou hadſt had tears, as thou wert in a trance; for thou doeſt not greatly differ from him neither in countenance nor colour: well if it were but a dreame <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that thus cumbred thy conſcience, or a doubt that made thée thus dumpith, I will diuine the one if it be not too dark, or decide the other if it be not too ſecret: marry if the caſe bee cumberſome, I leaue it to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Gentlemen.</p>

               </hi> (quoth ſhee) I haue liſtened to thy drouſie dream, with déep deuotion; by ſo much the more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous atttentiuely to heare it, by how much the more I find it ſtrange and wonderfull: yea, ſo ſtrange, as if I my ſelfe had not wakened thee out of thy ſlumber, I would eyther haue thought it a fained viſion, or a fantaſticall inuention: but ſith theſe Gentlemen here preſent, and mine owne eyes are witneſſes, and thine owne tongue a teſtimony of thy talk; ſuffice I beléeue it, though I cannot diuine it: to giue a verdite where the euidence is not vnderſtood, is vanity: to yéeld a reaſon of an vnknowne caſe, is meere folly: and to interpret ſo ſtrange a dreame without great practice, is but to skip beyond my skill, and to lie faſt in the mire. Yet, leaſt I might ſéeme to promiſe much &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing, I wil decide your doubt, if you pleaſe to take my doom for a cenſure.</p>
            <p>It is a ſaying <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> not ſo common as true, that the haſty man neuer wants woe, and that hee which is raſh without reaſon, ſeldome or neuer ſloepeth without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. To venture amidſt the Pikes when perilles cannot bée eſchewed, is not fortitude but folly: to hazarde in daungers, when death inſueth, is not to bee worthily minded, but wilfully mooued. Vertue alwaies conſiſteth betwéen extreamities, that as too much fearefulneſſe is the ſigne of a quaking coward, ſo too much raſhnes be tokeneth a deſperate Ruffian. Manhood <hi>Gwydonius</hi> conſiſteth in meaſure &amp; worthineſſe, in fearing to hazard without hope.
<pb facs="tcp:6139:26"/>
But to giue a verdit by thine owne voyce, I perceiue thou art guilty of the ſame crime: for when the brittleneſſe of the bridge portended, and the ſurging ſeas inferred loſſe of life, yet deſire draue thée to aduenture ſo deſperate a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Better it is <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> to liue in griefe, then to dye deſperately without grace: better to chooſe a lingering life in miſery, then a ſpéedy death without mercie: better to be tormented with hapleſſe fancy, then with helliſh fiends: for in life it is poſſible to repreſſe calamity, but after death neuer to redreſſe miſery. <hi>Tully Gwydonius</hi> in his <hi>Tuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> queſtions, diſcourſing of the happineſſe of life and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe of death, ſayth, that to liue we obtaine it of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gods, but to dye, of the vnlucky deſtinies: meaning hereby, that life though neuer ſo loathſome, is better then death, though neuer ſo welcome: whereby I conclude <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that to liue earefully, is better then to die de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Caſtanias parle</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, and that ſhée toucht not that point wherof he deſired moſt to be abſolued, but meant to ſhake him off with a ſléeueleſſe anſwere, began to drawe her to the Trap with this traine.</p>
            <p>MAdame <hi>Caſtania</hi> (quoth hée) I confeſſe that raſhneſſe neuer raigneth without repentance, nor haſtie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding without hapleſſe harmes, that hée which aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth deſperate dangers is a foole, and he that paſſeth ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perils is worſe then an Aſſe: yet from theſe ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules, Madame, I exempt theſe particular exceptions, namely Loue and Neceſſitie, which two are tyed within no bounds, nor limited within no law, for whom the diuell driues hée muſt néedes runne, be the paſſage neuer ſo peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: and whom Loue or Neceſſity forceth, hee muſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee the daunger neuer ſo deſperate: for as there is no enterpriſe ſo eaſie, which to an vnwilling man ſeemeth not

very hard to be atchieued, ſo there is no encounter ſo cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome where will wiſheth, that ſéemeth not paſſing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to bee performed: now this will is with nothing ſooner pricked forward, than eyther with the force of loue, or ſting of neceſſity. So that whoſoeuer aduentureth in a daunger, though neuer ſo deſperate, is not to be blamed, if inforced by fancy, or incouraged by affection; and eſpecially where the perill is in poſſibility to bee paſſed without death, and in the performance thereof, the poſſeſſion of ſuch a prize as the paſſionate perſon more eſtéemeth than lands, limbs, or life it ſelfe, be it neuer ſo ſwéet. In which caſe (Madame) my cauſe conſiſteth. For the Lady who was an heauenly obiect to my gazing eyes, was ſo beautified with the giftes of nature, and ſo perfectly poliſhed with more than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfection, that with the onelie view of ſuch diuine beautie, my ſenſes were ſo beſotted, my wit and will ſo inueigled, my affection ſo inflamed, and my fréedome ſo fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: yea, loue alreadie hath made ſo great a breach into the bulwarke of my breaſt, that to obtaine ſo gorgious a Goddeſſe, I thought death no daunger, though neuer ſo direfull, nor loſſe of life no torment, though neuer ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Indéed <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> (quoth <hi>Therſandro)</hi> I agrée with thée in this point, that there is no carpet Knight ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that would not paſſe more perillous pikes to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe ſo liuely a Dame as thou doeſt decipher, nor no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde ſo daunted with dreade, which woulde not greatly indanger himſelfe to enioy ſo louely a damſell, in the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whome conſiſteth nothing but ioy, bliſſe, reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of minde, delight, happineſſe, yea, all earchly felicity.</p>
            <p>And yet Sir (quoth <hi>Gwydonius)</hi> your Siſter <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> condemnes me of folly, in venturing for ſo precious a prize; when as hope perſwaded me, that no hazard could be hapleſſe, and aſſured me that Loue and Fortune fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them that are bolde: that the gods themſelues ſeeing
<pb facs="tcp:6139:27"/>
my perplexed paſſions, wold of pitty defend me from thoſe perilous daungers. For if <hi>Theſeus</hi> by Diuine power, were ayded againſt the force of the monſtrous <hi>Minotaure;</hi> or if <hi>Iaſon,</hi> who conſtrayned with a couetous deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the golden Fléece, arriuing at <hi>Colchos,</hi> was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the gods, from the dint of the deadly Dragons, no doubt <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe would eyther haue made the flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering bridge more ſtrong (conſidering that no hope of wealth, no deſire of riches, no gréedineſſe of gaine, no loue of luere, but beauty her ſelfe was the victorie I meant to vaunt off) or elſe if I had ſowled in the roaring Seas, hee would haue prouided ſom happy Dolphin, that <hi>Arion</hi> like, I might arriue at the deſired Rock: and then my daungers ſhould haue béene turned into delight, my perils into plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, my hazarding into happineſſe: yea, I ſhould haue poſſeſſed that heauenly paragon, and enioyed the loue of that louely <hi>Venus,</hi> whoſe onely ſight were a ſufficient ſalue againſt all forepaſſed ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>Stay there, Maſter <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> quoth the Lady <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytta:</hi> for I ſée, to graunt one falſe propoſition, is to open a doore to innumerable abſurdities, and that by ſuffring you too long, of theſe ſuppoſed premiſes you will inferre ſome cauilling concluſion to your former reaſons: thus I reply, That I confeſſe neceſſity to haue no law, but I grant not the ſame of Loue: for if it be lawleſſe, it is lewde: if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limits, laſciuious: if contained within no boundes, beaſtly: if obſerued with no order, odious: ſo that lawleſſe Loue without reaſon, is the very Load ſtone to ruth and ruine.</p>
            <p>Sith then Maſter <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> as your ſelfe affirme, this was the pricke that puſht you into perill, how can the effect be good, when the cauſe was naught? or how can you clarkely defend your deſperate motion, proceeding of ſuch a fond and fooliſh occaſion. But it was the perfection of her comely perſon, her exquiſite feature, and rare beautie, that ſo kindled thy deſire, and ſo bewitched thy ſenſes: for who
<pb facs="tcp:6139:28"/>
is ſo fearefull, that beautie will not make bolde? who ſo doubtfull, that beauty will not make deſperat? yea, what ſo hard that a man will not hazard, to obtaine ſo diuine a thing, as beauty.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> haſt thou not heard that the Fiſh <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> liſtening to the ſound of a Trumpet is caught of the Fiſhers, that while the <hi>Porcupine</hi> ſtandeth ſtaring at the glimmering of the ſtarres, hée is ouertaken with dogges, that the Deere gazing at the bowe is ſtriken with the bolt, that the Leopard looking at the Panthers painted skinne, is taken as a praie, and that hee which taketh too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to gaze vpon beauty, is oftentimes galled with griefe and miſery? Yea, his pleaſure ſhall inferre ſuch profit, and his good will ſuch gain, as if he reapt the beautifull apples of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> which are no ſooner toucht, but they turne to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Beauty, <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> no ſooner flouriſheth but it fadeth, and it is not fully ripe before it begin to rot: it no ſooner bloſſometh, but it withereth, and ſcarcely being toucht it ſtaineth, like to the <hi>Guyacum</hi> leafe, that hath the one halfe parched, before the other halfe be perfect: to the bird <hi>Acan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi> which hatched white, yet turneth blacke at the firſt ſtorm: or like to the ſtone <hi>Aſtites,</hi> that chaungeth colour with the onely breath of a man.</p>
            <p>If then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> beautie bée ſo fading, ſo fickle, ſo momentary, ſo mouing, ſo withering, ſo waning, ſo ſoone paſſed, and ſo ſoone parched: is this the Iewell, which you count more deare than life? and the Gemme which you think worthy to bée purchaſed with the danger of death? No doubt <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> if you won the victory, you might vaunt of a great conqueſt, and if your long hope were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed with a great hap, it ſhould be much like to his, which thinking to embrace <hi>Iuno,</hi> caught nothing but a vaniſhing cloude.</p>
            <p>You do well Madame (quoth <hi>Caſtania)</hi> to put an If, in it, becauſe he that vaunteth of victory before he hath wonne
<pb facs="tcp:6139:28"/>
fielde, may proue himſelfe a foole: hee that brags of gaines before the accounts be caſt, may perhappes put his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in his eies: and he that bloweth the Mort before the fall of the Buck, may verie well miſſe of his ſées: ſo he that countes himſelfe a ſpéeder before hee be a wooer, ſheweth himſelfe a vaine perſon or a vaunting patch.</p>
            <p>Might it not be I pray you Maſter <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that paſſing the bridge, ſcaping the dangerous ſeas; and happily arriuing at the deſired Rocke, yet you might miſſe of your purpoſe? Yes forſooth: for many a man bendeth his bowe, that neuer killeth his game, layeth the ſtrap that neuer catcheth the fowle, pitcheth the Net that neuer getteth the fiſh, and long time are heauie wooers that neuer proue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſpéeders.</p>
            <p>So perhaps <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> you might be croſſed with a chip of the ſame miſchance, and the gorgious Dame whom you adore for a Goddeſſe, might repaie your liking with loathing, your loue with hate, your good will with deſpite, and your fixed fancie with ſmall affection, either that ſhee liked you too little, or loued another too much. All theſe doubtes <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> are carefully to be caſt, &amp; wiſedome it is to feare the worſt, and finde the beſt: but you ſir, like a luſtie champion, thinke a Ladie wonne at the firſt looke, and the good wil of women gained at the firſt glance, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gods themſelues are to be accuſed of iniuſtice, if they be not ayders to your enterpriſe, inſomuch that if in ventring ouer the perillous paſſage, you had by diſaſter Fortune fallen into the dangerous Seas, you doubtes not but that <hi>Iupiter</hi> would haue ſent a Dolphin; that <hi>Arion</hi> like, you might eſcape the fearefull ſurges: but <hi>Gwydoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> be not ſo ventrous, leaſt though you harpe verie long, you get not the like hap. Theſe premiſſes conſidered, if my cenſure might ſtande for a ſentence, I déeme it better to be counted a daſtardly coward, than a deſperate caitife, better to forſake your Goddeſſe, than your God, better to liue pinched with a fewe momentarie paſſions, than with
<pb facs="tcp:6139:29"/>
deſperate death to deſtroy both ſoule and bodie: for there is no ſore ſuch, which in time may not be ſalued, no care ſuch which cannot be cured, no fire ſo great which may not be quenched, no loue, liking, fancie, or affection, which in time may not either be repreſſed, or redreſſed.</p>

            <p>Madame (quoth he) I ſée you will ſit nigh the walles cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>you be thruſt out for a wrangler, and that you will ſpeake againſt your owne conſcience, but you will haue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: for my owne part Madame, howſoeuer I ſéeme to like it, I will not ſaie I miſlike it, but I am ſorie you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Melytta</hi> ſhould ſo blaſphemouſly imblaze the armes of beautie, and ſo reckleſly raile againſt the ſacred lawes of loue: take héed for croſſing <hi>Cupid</hi> ſo crabbedly; for thogh he forgiue and forget, <hi>Venus</hi> is a woman, and will ſeeke reuenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth ſhée) take no care what daunger I incurre for ſpeaking the trueth. If I chaunce to bee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is mine owne miſhappe, and for <hi>Venus</hi> reuenge I care for it the leſſe, becauſe I feare it not: if I ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelfe, you may ſée I am the fitter to be a Iudge, becauſe I am not partiall, nor haue any reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

            <p>And whereas you condemne me of vanitie in vaunting before the victorie, I ſaie, that if Fortune had ſo fauoured me, that I had gained the preſence of my Goddeſſe, I wold neuer haue doubted to haue obtained my deſire: for if ſhee had ſéene the deſperate daunger which I aduentured, and the fearefull perils which I paſſed for her ſake, ſhee could not but of conſcience, repaie my loue with vnfained loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and my good will with trobble gaine. And in troth I thinke it vnpoſſible, that ſuch heauenly beautie ſhould bée eclipſed with crueltie, and ſuch perfect comelineſſe bee ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſht with curious coyneſſe.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth ſhe) doeſt thou call it crueltie not to condeſcend to the requeſt of euerie one that wooeth? or doeſt thou tearme it coyneſſe, not to yéeld to the aſſault of euerie flattering louer? Then in my iudgment, it were good for euerie woman to be both cruell and coie, that by crueltie ſhe might auoide the traine of trothleſſe wooers, &amp; by coyneſſe eſchue the troupe of faithleſſe ſutors.</p>
            <p>And ſo Madame (quoth <hi>Valericus)</hi> ſhe ſhould reape ſmall comfort and leſſe credit.</p>
            <p>Tuſh Signor <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth <hi>Gwydonius)</hi> it pleaſeth her thus merilie to ieſt, whereas I know ſhe doth account more of a curteous dame, than of a curious damſell, and that her Ladiſhip ſo deteſſeth the name of crueltie, that ſhe would be loth to be thought to haue a mind deuoid of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

For <hi>Caſtania</hi> hearing the ſugred eloquence, which ſo ſwéetly flowed from the ſappie wit of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in her fancie the form of his face, and printing in her heart the perfection of his perſon, was ſo intangled in the ſnares of loue, as ſhe could by no reaſon redreſſe her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but wil ſhe, nil ſhe, fell into theſe bitter complaints.</p>
            <p>ALas witleſſe wretch (quoth ſhée) that I am, what flry flames of fancie doo frie within mée? VVhat deſire, what luſt, what hope, what truſt, what care, what deſpair, what feare, what furie? That to be pained with theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed paſſions, to me that neuer felt the force of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is no leſſe dolour than death it ſelf, be it neuer ſo dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. O gods, where are now become thoſe lofty lookes I vſed to <hi>Valericus?</hi> Where is the diſdainfull dealings, the coy countenances, the curious congies, the cauſeleſſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, yea the hard heart, which ſo rigorouſly reiected the loue of him, which ſo intirely liked mée? Coulde I fond foole that I am, valiantly withſtand the aſſaultes of a worthie Gentleman, and ſhall I cowardly yeeld to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne ſtranger? Did I loath him, whoſe parentage was
<pb facs="tcp:6139:31"/>
little inferiour to mine, and ſhall I loue another of baſe and vile birth? Did I diſdaine to looke at the lure, and ſhall I now ſtoope without ſtall, come without call, yea and to ſuch an emptie fiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O lawleſſe Loue, O witleſſe will, O fancie, fraught full of frenzie and furie! Alas if I ſhould be ſo careleſſe as to conſent to this frantike toie, what will they ſay, that praiſed me for my vertue? Will they not as faſt diſpraiſe me for my vanitie? Will not my father fret, my kinsfolkes crie out, my friends be ſorrie, my foes and eſpecially <hi>Valericus,</hi> laugh me to ſcorne, and triumph of this my miſhappe? Yea, will not all the world wonder to ſée me alate giuen to chaſtitie, and now ſhake hands with virginitie, to yéeld my deareſt iewell and chiefeſt treaſure into the hands of a ſtragling ſtranger, who came to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers court without countenance or coine, wealth or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, credit or calling: yea, who by his owne report is but a perſon of ſmall parentage, Seek then <hi>Caſtania</hi> to aſſwage this flame, and to quench this fire, which as it commeth wthout cauſe ſo it will conſume without reaſon. For the greateſt flowe hath the ſooneſt ebbe, the ſoreſt tempeſt hath the moſt ſodaine calme, the hotteſt loue hath his coldeſt end, and of the deepeſt deſire oft times inſueth the deadlieſt hate: ſo that ſhee which ſettles her affection with ſuch ſpeede as ſhe makes her choiſe without diſcretion, may caſt her corne ſhe knowes not where, and reapes ſhe wot not what, and for her haſtie chooſing, may perhaps get a heauy bargaine. Alas, I know this counſaile is good, but what then? Can I deny that which the deſtinies haue decréed? Is it in my power to peruert that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Planets haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Can I reſiſt that which is ſtirred vp by the Starres? No: what neede I then make this exclamation? ſich I am not the firſt nor ſhall not bee the laſt, whome the frantike frenzy of flickering fancy, hath with more wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; greater vantage pitiouſly oppreſſed. What though <hi>Gvvydonius</hi> be not wealthy, yet hée is wiſe: though hee be not of great parentage, yet he is of comely perſonage. It is not his
<pb facs="tcp:6139:31"/>
coine that hath conquered me, but his countenance: not his vading riches, but his renowmed vertues, and I far more eſtéeme a man than mony. I, but the Duke my father is not ſo baſe minded, as to beſtow me vpon ſo meane a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he neuer will conſent that poore <hi>Gwydonius</hi> ſhold inioy that which he hopeth ſome péereleſſe Prince ſhall poſſeſſe. What then? Shall I preferre my Fathers will before mine owne will, his liking before mine owne loue? no, no, I will chooſe for my ſelfe whatſoeuer my choiſe be. Why but perchance <hi>Gwydonius</hi> wil no more eſtéeme thee than thou didſt <hi>Valericus,</hi> and repay thee with as ſmall fancie, as thou him with affection. Tuſh, doubt it not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtania,</hi> thou art the dame which hee ſo deciphered in his dreame, thou art that <hi>Venus</hi> which hee ſaw in his viſion, thou art that Goddeſſe, whoſe beautie hath ſo bewitched him thou art that iewell to poſſeſſe, the which there is no hap ſo hard which he would not hazard, no danger ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate which he would not aduenture, no burthen ſo heauy which he would not beare, nor no perill ſo huge which hée would not paſſe. And ſhall not then <hi>Gwydonius</hi> be my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, ſith I am his Saint? ſhal not I like him which loueth me? ſith he is my ioy, ſhal I not inioy him? yes, <hi>Gwydonius</hi> is mine, and ſhall be mine in deſpite of the fales &amp; fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtania</hi> hauing thus pitifully powred out her plaints, would gladly haue giuen <hi>Gwydonius</hi> intelligence (with modeſtie if ſhe might) of her good will towards him, and God knowes how fain <hi>Gwydonius</hi> wold haue diſcouered his ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if too much feare had not aſtoniſhed him, and too great baſhfulnes ſtaied her.

               </gap>nd carefull cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that by couert concealing of her inward ſorrow, the flame ſo furiouſly fried wthin her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was conſtrained to kéep her bed.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, thought to fift out the occaſion of her ſorrow, that by this meanes ſhe might apply a medicine to her malady,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:32"/>
and finding fit opportunitie, ſhée brake with her in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Madams <hi>Caſtania</hi> (quoth ſhée) ſince I haue by the Duke your father béen aſſigned to you as a companion, I haue in ſuch louing wiſe both comforted me counſailed you, as I hope you haue iuſt cauſe to ſay, that I haue moſt carefullie tendered your eſtate: for perceiuing how willing you were to follow my direction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I counted your wealth my weale, your pleaſure my profite, your happineſſe my ioy, and your proſperitie my felicitie. Which freindly care if it were not to be conſidered if I ſhould ſhew you what great ſorrow I ſuſtaine by your heauineſſe, you would iudge my wordes to procéed either of folly or flattery: but if your ſore be ſuch as it may be ſalued, if your care may bee cured, if your grief may be redreſſed, or your maladie mitigated by my meanes, commaund me good <hi>Caſtania,</hi> in what I may to pleaſure thee, &amp; thou ſhalt find me ſo charily to perform my charge, as my willing minde ſhall euidently bewray my well meaning. I ſee <hi>Caſtania,</hi> of late, ſuch a ſtrange me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis in thy minde, as for pleaſant conceites thou doeſt vſe penſiue cogitations, thy chéerfull countenance is cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into lowring looks, thy merry deuiſes into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dumps, and yet I cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture the cauſe of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain alteration. If want of riches ſhould worke thy woe, why, thou ſwimſt in wealth: if loſſe of friends, thou baſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of noble parentage, which loues thée moſt intirely. If thou meaneſt no longer to leade a ſingle life, no doubt thy father will prouide thee of ſuch a princely match, as ſhall content thee for his perſon, &amp; countenance thee with his parentage. But if in all theſe ſuppoſes I haue miſſ ſhe marke, and haue not toucht the caſe of thy calamitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold vnto me <hi>Caſtania,</hi> what the paine is that thus doth pinch thee, and aſſure thy ſelfe I will be ſo ſecret in thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as euer <hi>Lampana</hi> was to her Ladie <hi>Cleophila.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtania</hi> hearing this friendly diſcourſe of <hi>Melytta,</hi> thought for all this faire gloſe, the text might hee too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:32"/>
and that theſe painted ſpéeches would proue but rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pillers: fearing therfore the fetch, and doubting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worſt, if ſhe bewray her mind, ſhe framed her this anſwere.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth ſhe) the incomparable curteſie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained friendſhip which ſince your firſt comming I haue found in you by experience, will neither ſuffer mée to ſuſpect your Ladiſhip of flattery, nor my ſelfe willingly to be accuſed of ingratitude: for your diligence hath béene ſo great, and my deſertes ſo ſmall, that if I might but liue to requite ſome part of your good will, it were the ſecond feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie I looke for in this life. But touching the penſiue paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which thus diuerſly perplexed me, I anſwer that as he which is wounded of the Bores tusk, if his ſores take aire is very hardly healed, as hee which is ſtriken with a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, if his wound take wind can neuer be cured: ſo Madam many inward maladies carry this nature, that if they bee once diſcouered, they are far y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more hardly recouered, that it is better to conceale them with griefe, than reueale them in hope of releefe.</p>
            <p>Not ſo <hi>Caſtania,</hi> your principle is not true: for if your paſſions procéeded of loue, which of all other inward ſores requireth greateſt ſecrecie, yet vndoubtedly the more it is diſcouered, the ſooner it is cured. For as the ſtone of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> being couered with Sand, burneth moſt extreamely, and no ſooner taketh aire, but it cooleth: ſo the firie flames of loue raked vp in ſilence, fry moſt ſuriouſly; but being by diſcourſe diſcloſed, they ſoone conuert from flame to fume and ſmoke. Wherfore good <hi>Caſtania</hi> impart vnto mée the matter which doth import thée ſo néere, and I ſweare vnto thee by the ſacred rites of <hi>Ceres,</hi> which is ſo honoured in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that if thou doeſt loue where thy friends doe not like, and thy wiſh be contrary to their will, yet I will ſake all meanes poſſible to redreſſe thy ſorrowe.</p>
            <p>Alas good Madame, rather than you ſhould thinke mee ſo incredulous or ſuſpicious, as not to beléeue your oath, or
<pb facs="tcp:6139:33"/>
doubt of your ſecret dealing, I will without delay make you priuy to the cauſe of my paine, what perill ſoeuer I incurre by reuealing it. So it is <hi>Melytta,</hi> that the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> his exquiſite qualities, &amp; excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, haue ſo fiercely aſſaulted the fort of my fancy, as I am perforce conſtrained to reſigne my liberty captiue vnto his curteſie, &amp; to make his perſon the priſon of my heart. This luckleſſe &amp; vnlikely loue, Madam, is the cauſe of my care, &amp; the ſum of my ſorrow, this frantike affection hath driuen my drooping heart to ſhew forth theſe drouſie leekes, this is it which hath made me an enemy to myſelfe, a foe to all good company, and to delight in nothing but ſorrow and ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: yea, this is the ſore, which if in time it be not ſalued, will preuent by death all other miſeries.</p>
            <p>And is this (quoth <hi>Melytta)</hi> the pain that ſo greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth you? Is this the care that ſo cumbers your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Is this the danger which driues you into ſuch déepe diſtreſſe? Do you think ſo ſuperſtitiouſly of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> or ſo abiectly of your ſelfe, that you déem this matter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be brought to paſſe? no, no, doubt not <hi>Caſtania,</hi> I my ſelfe dare abſolutely promiſe thee, that thy loue ſhall ſort to ſuch happie ſucceſſe, as thou thy ſelfe doeſt ſéeke for.</p>
            <p>And with that <hi>Melytta</hi> ſtayed by a ſodaine ſight ſhe had of that Saint that <hi>Caſtania</hi> ſo hartily ſerued: for <hi>Gwydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was entring in at the chamber deere with a diſh of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates, which <hi>Orlanio</hi> hearing his Daughter was ſo ſick, had ſent her. <hi>Melytta</hi> ſéeing that <hi>Cupid</hi> began to ſauor the cauſe of his Clients, in giuing them ſuch fit opportunitie to diſcouer their cares, went her waie, leauing <hi>Gwydonius</hi> the firſt man to play his part in this tragicall comedy, who ſéeing his goddeſſe thus ſurpriſed with ſickneſſe, was ſo gallen with griefe, ſo pinched with helliſh paſſions, and ſo tortured with extreame torments, that his colour began to change, &amp; he fetcht a déep ſigh or two, which <hi>Caſtania</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſhe perceiued without touching his pulſes, the cauſe of theſe his ſodain paſſions. In fine, ſuch melancholike mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:6139:33"/>
ſo amazed his minde, that he was almoſt mute in his meſſage, yet at length incouraging himſelfe, hée preſented it vnto her in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Madame (quoth he) the Duke your Father hearing of your ſodaine ſickneſſe, in token of his fatherly affection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all his dainties, hath ſent you this diſh, which hee thinks moſt méet for your diet, wiſhing your Ladiſhip to let no doubtfull motions diſtreſſe your minde, nor no care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts cumber your conſcience: for you ſhall lacks nothing if you reueale to him your want, which either your will or wiſh can deſire. And truly Madame, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my willing duety (if the praiers of a poore Gentleman may be heard of the heauenly Gods) I wiſh that before you taſte of this feede it may turne to <hi>Nectar,</hi> whereby not only your ſickneſſe ſhould be ſalued, but your diuine beautie and vertue according to deſert ſhould be crowned with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtania</hi> perceiuing with what fernent affection <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> vttered thoſe wordes, began to chéere vp her ſelfe, in hope that her good will ſhould not be repaied with ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: taking therefore the preſent at his handes, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it neuer the worſe for his ſake that brought it, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him this replie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth ſhe) as I haue cauſe moſt reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accept of my fathers louing curteſie, and to repay his naturall affection with moſt dutifull obedience, ſo I haue cauſe to thanke thee for thy paines, and to thinke well of thée for thy wiſh, promiſing in recompence of thy good wil, if in any reſpect I may pleaſure thee, to ſéeke and ſue to my father for preferment.</p>
            <p>Madame, I account the performance of my meſſage no paine, but pleaſure, and I thinke my ſelfe as much honored by this office, &amp; thrice more happy than if I ſhould in <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> place preſent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cup to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But Madame, ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ſtop the ſtreame, is to make the floud flow more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to repreſſe the fire, is to make it flame more furiouſly,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:34"/>
and to reſtraine the force of loue, is to kindle a greater flame, leaſt too long delaie ſhould bréede too great daunger, and by concealing my ſorrow I ſhould make the ſore incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I thought good either preſently to heare the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentence of my life, or the cruell doome of my death. So it is Madame, that too long gazing vppon the beames of your heauenly beautie, and too narrowly conſtruing ouer your vertuous conditions, I remaine ſo caught in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſnare of your bountie, and ſo thralled in the thréede of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that the ſtaie of my life hangeth in your hands, either to driue mee downe to helliſh miſcrie, or to boiſt mee vp to heauenly felicity. For although I haue not heretofore by dutifull ſeruice made manifeſt the loyaltie of my loue, yet ſince I firſt framed in my fancie (as in a mirrour) the ſhape of your ſurpaſſing beautie, my heart hath béene croſſed with ſuch cruell Camizados for your ſake, as if with the Target of hope I had not wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hſt ſtood the furious force of ſuch raging furies, I had by deſpaire béene daſhed againſt moſt dangerous rockes. Sith then Madame, the ſight of your ſwéete face hath faſt fettered my fancie in the links of loue, ſo as without your means I can neither be redreſſed nor releaſed: I humbly deſire you neither to reſiſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my well meaning, nor to reiect the deuotion of my good will, but to accept your poore <hi>Gwydonius</hi> as a faithfull ſeruant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtania</hi> hearing diligentlie the faithfull diſcourſe of diſtreſſed <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> perceiuing by his ſighs the pinching ſorrow of his thoughts, and ſéeing him ſo faſt fettered in follie, on a ſodaine to giue her the ſlip had that ſhee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and now her louing lookes were turned to lowring glances, her delightfull curteſie, to diſdainfull coineſſe, and ſhe thought to repaie the ſwéete meate wherewith before ſhe fed him, with moſt ſowre ſauee: not that ſhe miſliked of his loue, for it was the onelie thing ſhe deſired, but to make him the more feruent in affection, vttering theſe or ſuch like words to her ſelfe ſecretly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6139:34"/>
And is not <hi>(Caſtania)</hi> the victorie moſt accounted of, where the conqueſt is moſt doubtfull? Is not the Caſtle which abideth the longeſt batterie, thought the richeſt boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Are not thoſe pearles which are ſcarcely founde and hardly gotten, euer of greateſt value: whatſo is gained by perill, is thought alwaies precious, hardly come by, wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept. The maide that by long ſute and much trauell is obtained, by how much the more ſhe was hard in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by ſo much the more ſhe will be ſwéet in the wearing: ſhe which in her virginitie is charie of her chaſtitie, in her mariage wil be as warie of her honeſtie: therfore I wil qualifie the hotloue of <hi>Gwydonius</hi> with a colde potion, and with that ſhe made him this waſpiſh anſwere.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> ſhall the old Prouerbe be verified in thee, that the Prieſt forgets himſelfe that euer hee was a clarke, that too much familiaritie bréedes contempt? I ſée well if <hi>Apelles</hi> that cunning painter ſuffer the greaſie Souter to take a view of his curious worke, he will grow ſo malapert, as to meddle with his picture: if the proude Centaure <hi>Ixion</hi> be bidden to the feaſt of the Gods, no leſſe than <hi>Iuno</hi> her ſelfe will ſuffice him for his choiſe.</p>
            <p>Set a beggar on horſebacke they ſaie, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer alight. Extoll one of baſe ſtocke to any degrée of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d who ſo proude and haughtie? I ſpeake this <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> to thy reproofe: is thy ſtomake alate waxen ſo quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that no dyet will downe but my fathers owne diſh? Wil no meaner mate ſuffice thee, vnleſſe thou match with a Princeſs? Is there no Ladie wil like thee, but my loue? Is there no courſer Dame to couet, vnleſſe thou court vnto me? Did my father promote thée to this thou art, from the ſtate of a beggar, and wilt thou now preſume to be my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Haue my lookes béene ſo louing, my countenance ſo curteous, my glaunces ſo full of good will, as to promiſe ſo much as thou doeſt preſume? No: but one onely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce in a ſeruile minde is too much incouragement. Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that I account ſo meanly
<pb facs="tcp:6139:35"/>
of my perſon, as to match with a man of thy pitch? Shall I ſo far cracke my credit, as to cumber my ſelfe with one of thy calling? Shall I ſo ſtraine my ſtate, as to ſtoope to thy lure? No. Where is thy coine to maintaine my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? Where is thy wealth to vpholde my worſhip? Where is thy patrimonie to counteruaile my perſonage? But put caſe I accepted of thy ſute doeſt thou thinke euer to gaine my fathers good will? Doeſt thou thinke it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to compaſſe his conſent? Doeſt thou hope euer to take him in ſuch a vaine, as he will bee willing to giue his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite on thy ſide? No <hi>Gvvydonius:</hi> but if he were priuie to this thy preſumption, he would repaie thy follie with too much furie, he would vnplume thee of all his feathers, that like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Crow thou mighteſt receiue the reward of thy raſhneſſe. If therefore thou loue thine owne welfare, kéep thy ſelfe within thy boundes, and ſtriue not farther than thy ſléeue will ſtretch, leaſt in climing too high, thou catch the ſorer fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtania</hi> hauing thus ſharply ſhaken vp my yong youth <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> thought ſhe had giuen him a ſufficient cooling Card: but he no whit diſmaied with this deniall, like a luſty champion entered pell-mell with her in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Madame (quoth he) the poore ſhoomaker was not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for viewing <hi>Apelles</hi> picture, but becauſe in finding fault he went beyond his ſhooe: the Centaure <hi>Ixion</hi> was not reproued for his familiaritie with <hi>Iuno</hi> as he was a gueſt, but in that his ſute tended to the ſacking of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie: familiaritie neuer bréeds contempt in a good mind, neither am I to be accuſed of that crime: for the moſt ſeruile ſlaue in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (I call the heauens as witneſſes of my words) doth not with more louing dutie reuerence &amp; honor your perſon &amp; parentage, than doth your poore ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>donius.</hi> Well Madame, though my nature and nurture be ſuch in your ſight, as they bewray my bringing vp and birth to be ſo baſe, as if I meane to drawe my deſcent, I muſt (as you ſay) imblaze mine armes in the beggars coat,

yet thus much I anſwere in reſpecte of my Parents, and without arrogancie thus farre I ſtand on my pantofles, that the credite I haue in your fathers Court, is not coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the calling I haue in mine owne Countrie, if I did not count it more greater credite and honour, in that I haue ſometime enioyed a curteous countenance of your ſwéete ſelfe ſince my comming.

The Moule depriued of ſight hath a wonderful hearing: the Hare being very fearefull is moſt ſwift: the Fiſh hauing no eares, hath moſt cleare eyes: ſo though want of dignitie diſgrace me, though want of coin diſcountenance me, though lacke of wealth impaires my credit, yet Nature hath giuen me ſuch a loyall and louing heart, as I hope in the perfection of that, ſhee hath ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the want of all the reſt: So that Madam though I want coine, I do not want conſtancy, though I haue no lands, yet I lack not loyaltie, though I want wealth yet I want not will to end my life to do you good, or ſpende my time to do you ſeruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> hauing thus pithily replyed, draue <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> into a great doubt, whether ſhee ſhould preſently conſent to his demand, or ſtill driue him off with delayes, whether ſhee ſhould yeelde the fort at the firſt skirmiſh, or ſtand to the doubtfull euent of battayle: at length leaſt ſhee
<pb facs="tcp:6139:36"/>
ſhould digreſſe from the courſe of woman kind, ſhe thought beſt to deuie that ſhee moſt of all deſired, and therefore then gaue him this anſwere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> (quoth ſhée) in what ſtate you came to my fathers Court I knowe, what you are by diſcent I knowe not, nor I care not, and if I did it auaileth not: but this I ſay, that it is hard taking of Fowle, when the net is deſcried, and il catching of fiſh, when the hook is bare: impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> to infer beléefe, when no credit will be giuen, and to deceiue her that ſpieth thy fetch: when the ſtring is broken, it is hard to hit the white, and when a mans credit is called in queſtion, perſwaſions can little preuatle. It is a religion amongſt louers to ſweare and forſweare, to promiſe mountains, and to perform moule hils, to be ripe without and rotten within, to carrie a ruſty blade in a vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet ſcabberd, and a ſiluer bell with a leaden clapper. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> I had rather miſtruſt too ſoone, than miſtike too late, I had rather feare my choice than rue my chance, I had rather ſtop at the brim, than at the bottom: for the ſignet being ſet, it is too late to break the bargain, and fancy being once fixt it is too late to reclaime affection. For the loue of a woman is like the Oyle of Flint, which being once congealed will neuer be diſſolued: like the Diamond, being once rubbed with the gum of a Pine trée, will neuer be broken: ſo if I fancy any, ſith I mean not to fléete, it ſhall be ſuch a one, as I néed not repent mée.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that in deſpight of Fortune, Nature hath giuen you a louing heart, I my ſelf ſurely did neuer déem any leſſe, but thought you of the crue of thoſe louers that loue too much, hauing as manie Ladies as they haue wits, and that is not a fewe, who count that euery face muſt haue a newe fancie, and if they ſée a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand they muſt be all viewed with a ſigh: which conſidered <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> I mean not to like nor to loue neither you nor any other.</p>

            <p>Yet Madame (quoth hée) where ſhe debt is confeſt, there remaineth ſome hope of recouery: for though the creditor bee neuer ſo vnwilling to pay the debt being due, hée ſhall by conſtraint of law and his own confeſſion, (maugre his face) be forced to make reſtitution.</p>

My cunning is too ſmall to enterpriſe the compoſition of any ſecret ſimples, and my calling too great to become a Phyſition to ſuch a paltering patient, ſo that I neyther can nor wil cure another mans harm by mine owne miſhap. To loue him whom I cannot like, were but to wreſtle againſt mine owne will, to flatter him whom I mean not to fancie, is but a méere tricke of extream folly. What the cauſe is <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that thy good will reaps ſo ſmall gain, and that ſo rigorouſly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paie thy loue with hate, I know not, vnleſſe the conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Starres by ſome ſecret influence haue ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it in the calculation of our natiuety.

likes of thy loue, that the verie remembrance of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes me fall into moſt hatefull paſſions. Ceaſe then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> to condemne me of crueltie, and leaue off at laſt to appeale to my curteſie: for thou ſhalt alwaies be ſure to féele the one, and neuer to finde the other.

               <hi>CAſtania</hi> hauing receiued this letter from <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> perceiuing the conſtant mind of the yong Gentleman, that theſe his proteſtations were not vanitie, but veritie: not trifling, but troth: no ſignes of fléeting fancie, but of a firme affection: ſtanding a while in a dumpe, at laſt ſhe fel into this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I now (quoth ſhée) both ſée and trie by experience, that there is no fiſh to fickle, but will come to the bayt: no Doe ſo wild, but will ſtand at the gaze: no Hawke ſo haggard, but will ſtoope at the lure: no Nieſſe ſo ramage, but wil be reclaimed to the Lunes: no fruite ſo fine, but the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller
<pb facs="tcp:6139:41"/>
will conſume it: no Adamant ſo hard but will yéeld to the file, no metall ſo ſtrong, but will bende to the ſtampe: no mayd ſo frée, but loue will bring her to bondage and thraldome. And doo I call it bondage, fond foole, to be bound vnto beauty? is it ſlauery to bee ſubiect vnto vertue? is it thraldome to liue in league with him who will like mee in my youth, and loue me in my age, in whom I ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pleaſure and contentation? who will be the hauen of my happineſſe, wherein I may reſt: &amp; the port of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity wherein I may bee ſafe harboured from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of froward fortune, and ſhroud meee from the bitter blaſts of bale? Shal I repent me, ſith my bargain is good? or complaine of the loſſe of libertie, ſith I haue a chaunge for farre more worthy chaffer? Shall I grudge when the gods are agréed? or deferre it, when the deſtinies driue it? or frowne at it, ſith fortune frames it? No: <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> is my Saint, and him will I ſerue; hee is my ioy, and him will I inioy. He hath laid the ſiege, and hee ſhall ſacke the Citie: he hath abode the batterie, and he ſhall haue the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of my breaſt: he hath fought the combat, and he ſhall be victor in the conqueſt. For I cannot be ſo vnnaturall, to reward his loue with loathing: ſo without reaſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud him of his right: ſo diueliſh, for his déepe deſire to giue him a dolefull diſh of deſpaire. No, no, I haue ſettled with my ſelfe, that if euer I marry, <hi>Gwydonius</hi> ſhalbe the man I will match with. And therefore as I haue driuen him off with delayes, and fed him with folly, ſo nowe I wil ſend him a ſettled anſwere of my good will and fauour: as I haue giuen him cutting corraſiues, ſo I will ſend him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of comfort. As I haue béene fearefull to ſhewe my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the better tryall: ſo now I will be bolde to ſhewe my loue in token of a better truſt.

But ſince thou haſt kept thy courſe ſo rightly by thy compaſſe, amidſt moſt daungerous rockes, and haſt ſtoode to thy tackling againſt all the bluſtering blaſtes of Fortune; Aſſure thy ſelfe, in lieu of this thy loue, thou haſt not héeretofore found mée ſo diſdainfull, as hèereafter thou ſhalt finde me dutifull, neither did I euer reiect thée ſo curriſhly, as I will accept thée curteouſly, béeing ready to reſtore the iniury I haue offered thée, with any curteſie that thou mayeſt either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly require, or I iuſtly affoord.

Yea, <hi>Gwydonius</hi> was driuen into ſuch an extaſie for ioy, that he was in doubt, whether this Letter was preferred to him indéede, or preſented to him in a viſion: whether he were rapt into a traunce, or rauiſhed with ſome drowſie ſlumber: but at laſt perceiuing it to be no fained fantaſie, ſuch a déep deſire inforced his affection, as he thought eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie moment a moneth, euerie houre a yeare, euerie day a thouſand, vntill he might fréely enioy the preſence &amp; ſight of his loue and Ladie <hi>Caſtania.</hi> Fortune meaning to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance him to the toppe of her inconſtant whéele, brought it ſo to paſſe, that before the wéeke was ended, he ſpied <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtania</hi> walking alone in the garden: which ſodain ſight ſo reuiued his ſenſes, that without any dread or doubt, he ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> liſtening attentiuely to this ſugred harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, was ſo rauiſhed with the ſight of her ſwéete face, and ſo rapt into a traunce with the contemplation of her beauty, that as the Lyon taſting of the gumme Arabicke becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſenſeleſſe, as the Bull by browſing on the barke of a Iuniper trée falleth aſléepe, as the Camell ſtandeth aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſight of a Rat: ſo <hi>Gwydonius</hi> ſéeing in his armes the Saint whome in heart he did honour, and imbracing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Goddeſſe whom with moſt déep deuotion he did adore, was ſo amazed, that he was not able to vtter one word, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his happineſſe, vntill at laſt gathering his wits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he began thus to reply:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAſtania</hi> (quoth he) it is an axiome in Philoſophie, that the colour ioyned hard to the ſight, hindreth the ſenſe: the flower put into the noſethrill, ſtoppeth the ſmelling: the Wine veſſell being full, lettes paſſe no Wine, though neuer ſo well vented: the waterpot being filled to the brim yéeldes forth no licour, though hauing a thouſand holes: ſo where the minde is ſurcharged with ouermuch ioy, or too much pleaſure, there the tongue is both tyed, and the ſenſes ſo reſtrained, that the heart is neither able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ioy, nor the tongue able to expreſſe the pleaſure.
<pb facs="tcp:6139:43"/>
Which, <hi>Caſtania,</hi> I now ſpeak by proofe, and know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for I am ſo drowned in delight by enioying that Princely Gemme, which I eſtéeme the rareſt and richeſt Iewell, not onely in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but in all the world, and ſo puffed vp in pleaſure by thy diuine preſence: Yea, thy faithfull and vnfeined affection, the promiſe of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and the hope of thy loyaltie, the report of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and the renowme of thy modeſtie, the force of thy beautie, and the fame of thy vertue: But aboue all thy prodigall bounty, in beſtowing theſe heauenly perfections on thy poore <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> béeing by perſon and parentage moſt vnworthy to poſſeſſe them, ſo ſurchargeth my ſillie heart with exceſſiue ioie; that my tongue not being able in part to expreſſe the extreame pleaſure of my minde, I am with <hi>Philiſtion</hi> the comicall Poet, conſtrayned by ſilence to vnfolde that affection, which in words the filed phraſe of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were not able to decipher. But this aſſure thy ſelfe <hi>Caſtania,</hi> that if <hi>Iuno</hi> would aduaunce me to hée Monarch of the worlde, if <hi>Pallas</hi> would preferre mée to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede hautie <hi>Hercules</hi> in valour, if <hi>Venus</hi> would preſent me with ſome princely peece of heauenly perfection, yet would I not ſo gladly receiue their proffers, as I do grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept the promiſe of thy loue and loyaltie. No: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the treaſure of <hi>Cioeſus</hi> but traſhe, in reſpect of the guerdon of thy good will: I account the fortune of <hi>Caeſar</hi> but follie, reſpecting the fruites of thy fauour: I eſtéeme the dignities of <hi>Priamus</hi> as dregges, in reſpect of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine perfection. Yea, <hi>Caſtania,</hi> I am ſo ſnared with thy beautie, and ſo intangled in the trappe of thy bountie, as I ſhall neuer leaue to loue thée, nor euer begin to like anie other.</p>
            <p>IT is eaſie <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth <hi>Caſtania)</hi> to purchaſe cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dite, where the partie is alreadie perſwaded, and to infer beléefe, where euerie word is counted an Oracle. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitting theſe frinolous proteſtations, thus much I
<pb facs="tcp:6139:44"/>
ſay touching the purpoſe. <hi>Cecillius Metellus</hi> was wont to ſay, that as it was neceſſary that old men ſhould be graue in counſaile, ſo it was expedient yong men ſhould be ſecret in loue: and therfore when the contract was made betwéene <hi>Fuluius</hi> and his daughter, hée ſealed vp their lips with his ſignet, meaning that to violate the ſecret conference of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, was to commit a ſecond ſacriledge. I ſpeak this <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> as one careful of thy ſtaie, and my ſtate: for if <hi>Orlanio</hi> my father ſhould but once heare of our loue, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our liking, it would bréed thy miſhap and my miſerie: yea, no doubt hee woulde ſpéedily preuent our pretence, which would be thy care and my calamity. Diſpoſe our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires at thy pleaſure, but diſouer not our purpoſe: if thou haſt wonne the Caſtle, vaunt not of the conqueſt: if thou haſt made a good market, bragge not of thy gaines: leaſt by boaſting of thy bootie, thou looſe thy preie, &amp; be thought a pratler. And <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> aboue all men beware of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericus,</hi> leaſt vnder the ſhape of a friend, he proue in time thy mortall foe, leaſt his fained amitie prooue faithleſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: that in truſting too much without tryall, thou finde not treaſon: and then though thou repent, yet Had I wiſt commeth too late, and ſo thou wiſh thou hadſt neuer loued, and I neuer liked.</p>
            <p>TVſh <hi>Caſtania,</hi> (quoth <hi>Gwydonius)</hi> he that is afraide to venture on the Buck, becauſe he is tapiſht in the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhall neuer haue hunters happe, and hée that puttes his doubt in loue for euery chaunce, ſhall neuer haue louers lucke. Cannot the Catte catch Mice, without ſhee haue a bell hanging at her eare? Cannot the Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie ſeize on his preie, but hee muſt checke? Cannot the Spaniell retriue the Partridge, but hee muſt queſt? And cannot wée deale ſo warily but all the world muſt wonder as it? Yes, it is a ſubtile bird that bréedes among the aerin of Hawkes, and a ſhifting ſhéepe that lambes in the Foxes denne, and be ſhall looke narrowly that ſpies me halting.
<pb facs="tcp:6139:44"/>
Let <hi>Orlanio</hi> not onely weigh our workes, but our words, and let <hi>Valericus</hi> both deeme our déedes and diuine our thoughts, and yet we hope I will dealt ſo ſecretly in our affaires, as neither the one ſhall haue cauſe to ſuſpect our familiaritie, nor the other to detect our affection. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caſtania,</hi> leaſt (if we be ſpied) the time and place giue occaſion of miſtruſt, I will leaue you as I found you, and ſo farewell.</p>
            <p>VVEll, theſe two louers placed thus by Fortune in the palace of earthly proſperitie, floated ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in the ſtreames of bliſſe, as they thought no chippes of milchance might change their preſent happineſſe to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture heauineſſe, as long as their priuy contract was kept ſo ſecret to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But as they which cannot ſée fire in the ſtrawe are ſtone blinde: ſo hee that cannot ſée the flame of fancie is a foole. It is hard to couer ſmoake, but more hard to conceale loue: which theſe two louers in tract of time tried true. Who as cloſely as they kept their cloake, yet it was moſt eaſie to eſpie the lining: for fancie ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, is like the ſparke couered with aſhes, which at length bruſteth into a great flame. For there paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Gwydonius</hi> ſuch amorous glaunces, ſuch louing lookes, ſuch curteous congies, ſuch countenances, and ſuch friendly familiaritie, ſuch often meetings, ſuch open gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſuch ſighes, ſuch ſobs, and ſuch ſtrange paſſions, as not onele <hi>Valericus,</hi> but all the Court (though they poore ſoules thought to daunce in a Net and not be ſéene) percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued how entirely they loued and liked each other. Which as it did not diſpleaſe many which loued <hi>Gwydonius</hi> as their friend, ſo it greatly deſpighted <hi>Valericus</hi> which was his foe, to ſée one of ſmall countenance preferred before one of his calling, that <hi>Guydonius</hi> ſhould win the bulwarke which he ſo long had battered: that hee pitching the fielde, another ſhould obtaine the conqueſt: that hee laying the ſiege, another ſhould vaunt of the victorie: that while hee
<pb facs="tcp:6139:45"/>
beate the buſh, another ſhould catch the birds, and that the méede of his merite, ſhould be giuen to one of ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. Being cumbred with theſe cholericke cogitations, and perplexed with theſe deſpightfull paſſions, inflamed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrathfull furie, he fell into theſe tearmes:</p>
            <p>O Gods (quoth he) what curteſie is there to be found in ſuch Kites of <hi>Creſſids</hi> kinde? Or what conſtancie is there to bee hoped for in ſuch daintie diſdaining Dames? Whoſe wauering willes and ſtaileſſe wittes both waxe and wane with the Moone, whoſe lunatike minds change with euerie ſodaine motion: yea, whoſe lightneſſe and leaudneſſe is ſuch, as they delight with the Rauen to féede on the moſt loathſome fleſh, with the ſhee Woolfe to chooſe the ſonieſt Make, with <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cocke to prefer the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corne before a moſt precious Pearle, and with <hi>Glaucus</hi> to make a chaunge of his golden armour for braſen Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Did not <hi>Euphinia</hi> forſake moſt famous Princes, and embrace a moſt infamous bondſlaue? Did not <hi>Sirithia</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Denmarke</hi> reiect a poore peaſant? Yea, did not <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe, with the Béetle, diſdaine all day to light on the moſt fragrant flowers, and at night voutchſafeth to lodge in a filthie cowſheard: I meane, did ſhee not refuſe the renowmed Gods, and chooſe a moſt deformed Smith?</p>
            <p>Why, but <hi>Valericus,</hi> is it fancie that forceth them to follie? Doth loue leade them? Do the deſtinies driue them? Doth beautie allure them? Is it their countenance that conſtraineth them? No, they are clownes: Is it their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or parentage that perſwadeth them? No, they are pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. But like craftie <hi>Calipſos,</hi> they thinke by theſe vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall matches to rule the roaſt after their owne diet, to be ſoueraigne miſtreſſes of their owne mindes, with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to let <hi>Vulcan</hi> poſſeſſe the trée, &amp; <hi>Mars</hi> enioy the fruit, to haue their huſbands ſéed the ſhéep, and ſome other reape

But <hi>Valericus,</hi> why doeſt thou thus reckleſly raile and rage againſt womankinde? It is not <hi>Caſtania</hi> that thus croſſeth thée with care, but <hi>Gwydonius</hi> that brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy griefe.

            <p>VVHile thus <hi>Valericus</hi> ſought opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his wrath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guiltleſſe <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune minding to bewray her mutability, brought it ſo to paſſe, that wheras <hi>Orlanio</hi> was accuſtomed to pay a yéerly tribute to the Duke of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> which ſurmounted to the ſum of 30000. Duckets, eyther wilfully or willingly hée withhelde this debt, which <hi>Clerophontes</hi> claymed as his due, inſomuch that being demanded by Embaſſage for the payment of this tribute, he flatly anſwered, that he would not from henceforth diſburſe one denyer, and hee was
<pb facs="tcp:6139:46"/>
ſorrie that in paying it heretofore hée prooued himſelfe ſuch a foole. Whereupon <hi>Clerophontes</hi> being fraught with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fury, was ſo incenſed againſt <hi>Orlanio,</hi> that taking counſell of his Nobility, he determined with as much ſpéed as might be, to wage battaile againſt him, and to obtaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint, which he denied him of curteſie. As thus he was muſing with himſelf whom he ſhould appoint captain generall of his army, becauſe he meant not in proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to abide the hazard of the battell, the remembrance of his ſonne <hi>Gwydonius</hi> came into his minde, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed him, but ſo moleſted him, as he was driuen into moſt diſtreſſed dolor: now he called to mind his mercileſſe cruelty in correcting his faultes, and his moodleſſe rigour in rebuking his folly: now he bewailed his long abſence, and wiſhed his ſpéedie preſence: yea, hee was ſo diuerſly perplexed, as hée began thus dolorouſly to diſcourſe with himſelfe:</p>
            <p>ALas (quoth hee) now I ſée the ſaying of <hi>Cicero</hi> to be true, that who ſo wilfully peruerteth the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſéemeth to proclaime himſelfe an enemy to the gods, for that Nature neuer framed any thing amiſſe, wherein I haue moſt gréeuouſly offended: for in beaſtly rage I haue ſurpaſſed the bruite beaſtes and in crueltie, the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures: I haue beene more deuoyd of pitie than the Fowles of the ayre, and more vnnatural than the Fiſhes of the ſea. The Bird called <hi>Apis Indica,</hi> ſéeing the veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Viper readie to deuoure her yong ones in the neaſt, preſenteth her ſelf to death, to preſerue them from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion The Eagle is ſo carefull ouer her yoong, that if it hap by her default one of them doo periſh, ſhe willingly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her ſelfe in many places with her owne beake. The Lyon ſo louingly foſtereth vp her whelpes, that ſhee neuer faſteth of the preie vntill they bee fully ſatiſfied. The Foxe is ſo carefull ouer her cubbes, that ſhee willingly falleth into the Hunters handes to defend her yoong from harme.
<pb facs="tcp:6139:46"/>
But I vile wretch, as though I had drunke of the Riuer <hi>Lincellis</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which preſently turneth whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it toucheth, into ſtones. In ſteade of friendly courteſie haue abuſed mine own ſon with frowning cruelty, in lieu of mercy I haue brought him to miſery: the fatherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue ſhewed him, hath béen raging furie: yea, my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous nature, nay rather my vnnaturall rage hath béene ſuch towardes him, as hee liueth a baniſhed exile in a ſtraunge Countrie, perhappes pinched with penurie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with pouertie, wandering in the wilde deſartes, in daunger of deuouring, in perill of ſpoyling, afflicted not onely with the maladie of the body, but the miſerie of the minde: ſo that no doubt he wiſheth that I had neuer béene Father to ſuch a ſonne, or hée neuer ſonne to ſuch a Father.</p>
            <p>Alas what ioy can I now inioy when I want mine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioy? What comfort can I haue to ſée my childe in cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie? What pleaſure can I take while he toyleth in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, who now in mine age ſhould be the ſtaffe whereon to ſtaie, that by his valiant courage and warlike proweſſe (wherwith from his infancie hée hath béen indewed) might defend me from mine enimies, and reuenge me of my foes. But alas, I lament too late: the calme commeth out of time, when the Shippe hath ſuffered already Stipwrack, and the pittifull plaintes little preuaile, where the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is already puſhed into perill. No, no, my rage hath béene too great to heare of his haſty returne, my peruerſe furie hath béen ſuch, as hée dare not abide my preſence: and ſurely my ſorrow is too great euer to be ſalued.</p>
            <p>And with that <hi>Clerophontes</hi> ſtart vppe, minding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge theſe his cholericke cogitations by bloudy battaile vpon the confines of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and therfore in great haſt muſtered all his men, made great prouiſion for the warre, and cauſed his Nauie to be rigged, for that he meant to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney his army by ſea into <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhile thus there was no worde through the whole
<pb facs="tcp:6139:47"/>
Dukedome of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> but warre, warre, and no newes but of the cruell conflict that ſhould inſue betwéene the two Dukes; certaine Merchantes of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which then roade in the Hauen durſt not goe a ſhoare to ſell their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but as faſt as winde and weather woulde ſerue them, highed them out of the harbour, and coaſted ſpeedily into their owne Countrie: where they no ſooner arriued, but they made report thereof to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> who driuen into a dumpe with this noyſome newes, whether he doubted of the puiſſant power of <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> who was ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy warriour, and in battaile ſo bold, that no man durſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide him, or whether he feared his owne force was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt the furie of his raging enemy; Hee preſently ſummoned all his Lords to a Parliament, where after ſome conference, it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that <hi>Therſandro</hi> ſhould bee ſent Embaſſadour to <hi>Mitylene to parle</hi> of peace with <hi>Clerophontes:</hi> which determination was no whit defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but with as much ſpéed as might be, the Bark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hée ſhould paſſe was prouided, the charge of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was giuen him, and he accompanied with a traine of braue Gentlemen, departed.</p>
            <p>But if this newes was dolefull to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> no doubt it was death it ſelfe to <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> who hearing that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woulde bend his force againſt the place, wherein hee was, ſawe all poſſibilitie taken away from obtayning his purpoſe, for he feared death if he were knowen to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> and hée doubted deſpightfull hate at the leaſt, if he bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to <hi>Caſtania.</hi> Which double dolour ſo diſtreſſed him, as hée felt himſelfe diuerſly perplexed with dumpiſh paſſions, his myrth was turned to mourning, his pleaſant conceits, to painefull cogitations: his wanton toyes, to wayling thoughtes: now he abandoned all good companie, and delighted onely in ſolitary life, the wildeſome woodes were his walkes, and the ſecret ſhades the couert he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coueted. In fine, hée ſéemed rather a <hi>Tymon of Athens,</hi> than a Gentleman of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſo that all the Court
<pb facs="tcp:6139:47"/>
marueiled at this ſo ſodaine a chaunge, but eſpecially <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtania,</hi> who coniecturing his dolefull heart by his drouſie lookes, was aſtoniſhed at this ſtrange ſtate, caſting in her minde whether ſhe had giuen him anie cauſe of this care, or whether by her occaſion he was croſſed with this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. But alas poore ſoule, howſoeuer ſhe aymed, ſhe miſt the marke, for <hi>Gwydonius</hi> kept his diſeaſe ſo ſecret, as he knew none could but himſelfe diuine the cauſe of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie: which no doubt was ſuch, that it would haue infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red preſent death, if hee had not hoped for ſome happie newes by <hi>Therſandro:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who no ſooner luckely arriued at <hi>Mitylene,</hi> but <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes</hi> was certified that the Dukes ſonne of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was come to impart with his Grace, ſome waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance. Now at this inſtant when the meſſage was brought him, his daughter <hi>Lewcippa</hi> was by, who (as the nature of women is, deſirous to ſee and bee ſéene) thought ſhe ſhould both heare the <hi>parle,</hi> &amp; view the perſon of this young Embaſſadour, and therefore found fiſh on her fingers, that ſhe might ſtay ſtill in the chamber of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whither preſently <hi>Therſandro</hi> was ſent for, who curteouſly and curiouſly doing his obeylance to the Duke, deliuered his Embaſſage in this maner:</p>
            <p>VVHereas (right worthy ſir) <hi>Orlanio,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> more vnwittingly then wilfully denied certaine tribute, which he confeſſeth both hee and his predeceſſours haue payd to you and your aunceſtors: Hearing that héereupon your Grace meaneth rather to wage battaile, then to loſe any part of your due, although he feareth not your force, as one able euery way to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, nor paſſeth of your puiſſance, as a Potentate ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reſiſt your power: Yet, the care he hath of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſafetie, and the loue he hath to preſerue the life of his Commons, the regard he hath to pay and performe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and cuſtome requireth: and laſtly meaning with
<pb facs="tcp:6139:48"/>
               <hi>Tully, Iniquiſſimam pacem iuſtiſſimo bello anteponere.</hi> He hath ſent me both to ſue for conditions of peace, and to paie the tribute: which if your Grace ſhall refuſe, of force he muſt put his hope in the hazard of Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THerſandro</hi> hauing thus pithily performed his charge, <hi>Clerophontes</hi> tolde him that vpon a ſodaine he wold not diſpatch ſo waightie a matter, but meant firſt both to conſult and take counſaile of his Nobles: which done, within thrée dayes he ſhoulde haue an anſwere. In the meane time he commanded <hi>Lucianus</hi> the Steward of his houſe, verie courteouſly to entreate both <hi>Therſandro</hi> and his traine, and to feaſt them with ſuch ſumptuous fare, as they might haue cauſe moſt highly to extoll his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>But leauing <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> to conſult with his learned counſailours, and <hi>Therſandro</hi> to accompanie with the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie Courtiers, againe to <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> who while this yong youth was telling of his tale, neuer markt the matter, but the man: nor regarded not the <hi>parle,</hi> but reſpected y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: neuer noted the contentes, but viewed his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: In ſuch ſort, that ſhe was ſo ſcorched with the fire of fancie, and ſo ſcalded with the flame of affection, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with his beautie, and ſo inueigled with his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as he was the onely man that made her checke at the pray, bate at the lure, and willingly yeelde to the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of fancie. And on the other ſide, Fortune ſo fauoured, that <hi>Therſandro</hi> printing in his heart the perfection of <hi>Lewcippas</hi> perſon, felt his fredome ſo fettered by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> view of her heauenly face, and ſo ſnared in the beames of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous glaunces, that he wiſht that either this diſſenſion had neuer growen, or that he had not béene the deliuerer of the meſſage: for hee felt his heart alreadie ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen with good will, towardes this young Princeſſe, as no ſalue but her ſelfe was able to mitigate his ſorrow, no medicine but her curteſie was able to cure his calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:48"/>
and he thought to preferre his ſute to his profeſſed foe, was folly: to linger ſtill in loue, was death and miſery: to ſéeke for helpe at her hands, neither would the preſent ſtate permit him, nor time ſuffer him to proſecute his purpoſe: daunted with theſe diuerſe doubtes, to auoyde the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike motions that moleſted his mind, he preſently went from his lodging to the Court, that by company hée might driue away theſe dumpes: where, hee founde in the great Chamber diuerſe Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen, paſſing away the time in pleaſant <hi>parle,</hi> amongſt whom was that peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Paragon, princely <hi>Lewcippa:</hi> who (after due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence done to the Gentlewomen in generall) was ſingled out by <hi>Therſandro,</hi> and courted in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>MAdam (quoth he) if any creature hath iuſt occaſion to accuſe eyther nature or the gods of iniuſtice, man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the greateſt cauſe to make this complaint: for there is none other ſo depriued of reaſon, or deuoyde of ſenſe, which by ſome naturall inſtinct dooth not skilfully preſage of perils before they come, and warily preuent ere they bée paſt.</p>
            <p>The Goates of <hi>Lybia,</hi> know certainly when the Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular dayes beginne, wherein commonly they fall blinde, and therefore by eating the hearbe <hi>Polypodium,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently preuent their diſeaſe. When the Lyon leaueth his Lawnes, and raungeth in forraigne deſartes, hée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies foreſheweth a drouth. When the Fiſh called <hi>Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcopos</hi> ſinketh downe to the bottome of the Sea, hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth great tempeſtes to bee imminent. But man is ſo farre from this ſecret foreſight, that not onely hee cannot diuine of theſe enſuing daungers, but rather wilfully or willingly, puſheth himſelf into moſt manifeſt perils: which Madame, I ſpeake, as féeling my ſelfe diſtreſſed with this want. For if I had béen indued with this ſacred preſcience, perfectly to preſage of inſuing perils, I had not béen croſſed with ſuch cares as I am like to incurre, nor had cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb facs="tcp:6139:49"/>
this my preſent arriuall. But ſith lacke of ſuch skill hath procured my loſſe, and that when the hurt is had it is too late to take héed, though reuealing of my miſhap cannot heale my miſery, nor repeating of my paines redreſſe my ſorrow, yet I mean to participate my paſſions to your good grace, that though you cannot or will not mitigate my maladie, yet you may pitie my eſtate, which wil ſome what eaſe my heauineſſe. I came to your Fathers Court Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a free man of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and am like to return a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of <hi>Mitylene:</hi> I arriued deuoyd of care, and am like to depart drenched with calamity: I landed frée from affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but fear to paſſe hence fraught with fancy: my charge was only to parle of peace, but my chance is to diſcourſe of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yea, your beauty hath ſo fettered my fréedom &amp; ſo ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my heart in the linkes of your loue, that it ſhall neuer be raced out by any ſiniſter means of Fortune, although I ſée it is almoſt impoſſible to obtain it.</p>
            <p>For I doubt, our Parents are like to proclaime them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues profeſſed foes, and the vrgent neceſſitie of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires forceth mée to depart ſo ſpéedily, as want of time wil not ſuffiſe to make triall of my loue, whereby I might claim a ſufficient guerdon for my good will: yet howſoeuer the matter ſhall hap, whether my hope bée voyde, or my hap be vaine, I meane Madame to remaine yours for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewcippa</hi> took ſuch delight in hearing <hi>Therſandro</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo louingly, as ſhée could ſcarcely kéepe her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from bewraying the pleaſure ſhe conceiued in this <hi>parle,</hi> ſéeing that her loue was requited with liking, and hir fancie incountred with the like affection. Yet, leaſt <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandro</hi> ſhould think her too courteous if ſhée ſhould come at the firſt call, and very light of loue, to like at the firſt looke, ſhée framed him this anſwere:</p>
            <p>SIR (quoth ſhee) if of your ſute for Conditions of peace there inſue no better ſucceſſe than the reuealing of
<pb facs="tcp:6139:49"/>
your paſſions ſhall reape pittie at my handes, or if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie for truce be as lightly reſpected by my Father, as either your perſon or petition is regarded by me, you are like to carrie home colde newes to your countrey, and to vaunt that you bad faire, but bought little, that your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt was long, but your corne not worth the cropping: that your venture was much, but your gaines ſuch, as if your winning proue no better, you are like to liue by the loſſe. For ſir, do you ſuppoſe mee ſo ſottiſh, as to thinke euerie one that flatters doeth fancie, or ſo addicted to ſelfe loue, as by a few filed phraſes to be brought into a fooles Paradiſe? knowing that it is the faſhion of men by their fained ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie to deceiue our fathfull ſimplicitie? No, for if you meane to counterfaite, take this for a rule, it is ill halting before a créeple. But ſir, this your ſodaine liking bewraies the lightneſſe of your loue: this your fond affection, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes the ſickleneſſe of your fancie: for ſoone hote, ſoone colde: eaſilie inflamed, as quickly quenched: like to the Apples of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which beginne to rot, ere they behalfe ripe. And if I meant to loue, had I none to like but my Fathers foe? ſhould I deſire him whome my Father doth deteſt? And if I ſhould ſo farre forget mine owne ſtay, or my Fathers ſtate, as to conſent, it were impoſſible either to appeaſe his wrath, or to get the grant of his good will. So that to deſire that which I can neuer inioy, were to driue my ſelfe whollie into deſpaire, which would ſmally profite you, and greatly diſpleaſure me: and therefore ceaſe to ſue for that, which may well be wiſht, but neuer obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therſandro</hi> although hée heard <hi>Lewcippa</hi> decide the caſe ſufficiently, yet hee was ſo wilfull that hee would not take her doome for a verdite, but returned her this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth hee) where in lieu of hate there inſueth loue, it is alwaies the ſigne of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:6139:50"/>
affection: and that it is a thing either confirmed by the Fates, or appointed by the Gods. <hi>Tereus</hi> the Prince of <hi>Thrace,</hi> being ſent by his father to defie <hi>Pandion</hi> the king of <hi>Athens,</hi> was enamoured of his daughter <hi>Progne,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by betwéene the Parentes in ſtéede of fatall enmitie, there inſued friendly amitie. When as the bloudie warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <hi>Atis</hi> the king of <hi>Libia,</hi> and <hi>Lycabas</hi> the Prince of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> was moſt hot, young <hi>Admetus,</hi> béeing ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour into <hi>Libia,</hi> was ſo ſtroken in loue with <hi>Alceſt,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Daughter to his fathers foe, and ſhee repayed his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with ſuch loialtie as death it ſelfe could neuer diſſolue their amitie. If Madame, theſe premiſes may perſwade you to take pittie of my paſſions, or theſe examples induce you, not to let the hatred of our parentes, bée a hinderance of our loue, whether your father reiect mee as a foe, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mée as a friend, I doubt not but the deſtinies will drine the bargaine through, in deſpight of them and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Sir (quoth ſhée) I confeſſe, <hi>Progne</hi> poore wench loued <hi>Tereus,</hi> but how wretchedly did hee reward her loyaltie? and <hi>Scilla</hi> was enamoured of <hi>Minos</hi> her Fathers foe, but howe tyrannouſly did hee repay her loue with trecherie? <hi>Tarpeia</hi> betraied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tower of <hi>Rome</hi> to one of the <hi>Sabines</hi> whom ſhe moſt entirely loued, but the méede of her merite was extreame miſerie. Shall I then <hi>Therſandro</hi> ſée the traine and yet fall into the trap? ſhall I ſpie the nettes, and yet ſtrike at the ſtale? ſhall I ſée the miſhap, and yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully incurre the miſchance? no, I meane not for an inch of ioy, to reape an ell of annoy, for a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of mirth, a month of miſerie: for a dramme of pleaſure, a whole pounde of paine, and by procuring mine owne delight, to purchaſe my fathers death and deſtruction. But let this ſuffice <hi>Therſandro</hi> to ſignifie howe I pittie thy paſſions, and thinke well of thy perſon, that if my Fathers will might bee framed to my wiſhe, if hee woulde condeſcend as I would conſent, thou onely art the man who in the way of
<pb facs="tcp:6139:50"/>
marriage ſhould diſpoſe of me at thy pleaſure. But ſith the frowning ſtate of Fortune denies our loue to haue ſuch happie ſucceſſe, hope well, and reſt vpon this point, that I will alwaies like thée as a friend, though not loue thée as my phéere.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Therſandro</hi> was ready to replie, and to ſeale vp the bargaine of their loue vpon her ſwéete lips, <hi>Cleropho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> came in, who marred all their market, and turned their ſwéet to ſowre: for he gaue <hi>Therſandro</hi> his anſwere before <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> which was this; That he neither meant to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the conditions of peace, nor to receiue the tribute, but to claime his due by the doubtfull euent of battaile: That he ſhortly pretended in perſon, to viſite <hi>Orlanio,</hi> and within the walles of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to demand his debt, and that he would beſtow his fathers Dukedome vpon a Lord of his called <hi>Lucianus,</hi> in dowrie with his daughter <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therſandro</hi> was nothing amazed with the firſt part of the meſſage: but when he heard how <hi>Clerophontes</hi> meant preſumptuouſly both to depraue him of his liuing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him of his loue, hee was ſo puffed vp with wrath and choler, as happe what happe would, he fell into theſe tearmes.</p>
            <p>I remember (quoth he) that <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding a mightie armie to ſubdue great <hi>Britaine,</hi> when hée was come to the ſea, ready to poſte ouer his ſouldiers in his Nauie, he left off his endleſſe enterpriſe, and ſet them to gather Cockles. <hi>Siphax</hi> boldly boaſting that hee would beſtow the kingdome of <hi>Numidia</hi> vpon his ſecond ſonne, was by <hi>Maſſiniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a</hi> ouerthrowne, and ſold as captiue to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> I dare not ſir inferre compariſons, becauſe they be odious, nor apply the examples, ſith time and place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids mee: but this I ſay, that to fiſh before the net, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies counted folly, and to vaunt before the victorie, is but
<pb facs="tcp:6139:51"/>
vanitie. Yea, and if I had as good right to your daughter <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> as I haue to the ſuppoſed dowrte which you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne her, I would in deſpight of <hi>Lucianus</hi> and the diuell himſelfe, diſpoſe her at my pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerophontes</hi> hearing the cholerike concluſion of <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandro,</hi> could ſcarcely bridle his frantike furie from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging without reaſon againſt this young youth: yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mitigating his moode, hee breathed out theſe cruell threatnings.</p>
            <p>IF the law of armes (quoth he) did not both ſafely protect thée, and ſurely forbid me to hurt thée in that thou art a meſſenger, I would with ſuch ſeueritie chaſtice theſe thy preſumptuous ſpéeches, as thou ſhouldeſt learne hereafter to anſwere with more reuerence: yet I wiſh thée not to ſtand too ſtiffe vpon this point, leaſt if thou bee ſo reckleſſe as to breake the bondes of reaſon, I be ſo forgetfull as to paſſe the limits of the law. Thou haſt receiued a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate anſwer for the Embaſſe, and heere I charge thée this preſent day to depart out of my dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therſandro</hi> fearing the tyrannie of this cruell <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes,</hi> preſently paſſed out of the chamber of Preſence, taking his leaue of Ladie <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> onely with louing lookes, which ſhe requited with ſuch glaunces of good will, that they were ſufficient ſignes what inſupportable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhe receiued by his ſo ſodaine departure: yet knowing that her fancie was incountered with mutuall affection, ſhe draue away the myſtie cloudes of deſpaire, hoping that the Gods ſéeing their faithfull amitie, would take pittie of their paſſions, and in time redreſſe their miſerie.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Therſandro</hi> hauing with ſpéede diſpatcht his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires (all his traine being ſet aboord, and they coaſting the ſtraights with a luckie gale) was ſo combered with care, and ſo ouer-growne with griefe, that he paſſed no houre, minute, nor moment, without wofull wailing, ſorrowfull ſobs, and far fetcht ſighs: ſo that the Gentlemen his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:51"/>
ſuppoſing that hée was thus painfully perplexed for feare of <hi>Clerophontes</hi> puiſance, began both to comfort and incourage him, not to doubt or dreade the force of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſith his father was able to repulſe him, without anie daunger to himſelfe, or anie great damage to his ſubiectes. But theſe their perſwaſions coulde no whit preuaile to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage his paſſions, this their incoragement could not cure his care.</p>
            <p>But as there is no greater bane to the bodie, than trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the minde: ſo <hi>Therſandro</hi> ſo long continued in theſe penſiue paſſions and carefull cogitations, concealing his griefe ſo couertly, which ſo much the more furiouſly flamed within him, that he was conſtrained to kéep his Cabbin till his arriual at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Where being ſet on ſhore, and preſently conueied to the Court, he remained for the ſpace of thrée dayes ſo ſtrangely perplexed, as he was not able to make report of his meſſage: which ſo griped <hi>Orlanio</hi> with ſuch inſpeakeable griefe, as he wiſhed rather to haue died valiantly with the force of his enemy, than to put the death of his ſonne in hazard by paſſing ſo perillous a iorney. But <hi>Therſandro</hi> ſéeing that ſorrowe would not ſalue his ſore, but rather increaſe his ſickneſſe: that mourning woulde not appeaſe his maladie, but rather augment his miſery: began to take heart at graſſe, and within fewe daies began to recouer his former health. And then hee declared to his father what he had in charge from <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> how hée meant ſpéedily to wage war againſt him, &amp; by force of arms to driue him out of his Dukedom, which he had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to one <hi>Lucianus</hi> in dowry with his daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orlanio</hi> hearing this proude preſumption of this brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Duke, thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt barkers were not alwaies the ſoreſt biters, and that it was far more eaſie with wordes to obtaine the victorie, than with déeds to attaine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Yet, leaſt he might he taken at vnawares, he made a generall muſter throughout all his Dominions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding in euerie place neceſſary munition for the defence
<pb facs="tcp:6139:52"/>
of his Countrie. And aſſembling his Nobility to giue their verdit, who were fitteſt to be Captains in this skirmiſh; after ſome conſultation had in this cauſe, they concluded, that ſince <hi>Clerophontes</hi> meant to ioyn battaile in his own perſon, that likewiſe he ſhould be Generall of the field, and <hi>Gwydonius</hi> who ſurpaſſed all the reſt in martiall exploits, ſhould be Lieutenant, and conduct the armie, which he no ſooner heard but he was tormented with inſpeakable grief, he began to pull downe his Peacockes feathers, to hang his wings, and crie creake: euerie man hoping to win fame was merry, but he alone mourning: euery man laughed and he alone lowred: inſomuch that he was generally ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be a fearefull cowarde, and that dread of danger draue him into theſe dolefull dumps. But as they raſhly coniectured the cauſe of his ſorrowe, ſo they miſt the nature of his ſickneſſe: for <hi>Gwydonius</hi> ſéeing that of the cruel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his calamity ſhould inſue, and that this bloudy broyle would bréed his bane, he fel into ſuch ſolitary ſurmiſes, and ſuch muſing meditations, that <hi>Valericus</hi> his opén friend, and yet his ſecret foe, ſought by ſundrie meanes to ſearch out the cauſe of his care: but not beeing able to wring out any thing, either by flattering promiſes, or fained proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he ceaſed from his importunate ſute. But froward fortune brought it ſo to paſſe, that <hi>Valericus</hi> comming by the chamber of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> heard him thus deſperately diſcourſing with himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Alaſſe (quoth he) I ſée the Sunne being at the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, the Sea being at the full tide ebbeth: calme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not long without a ſtorme, neither is happineſſe had long without heauineſſe, bliſſe without bale, weale without woe, mirth without mourning. For who alate ſo floated in the flouds of felicitie as I, which now by the ſiniſter meanes of frowning fortune am ſowſed in the ſeas of ſorrow, eralted alate to the higheſt degrée of happines, am now driuen to the greateſt extremitie of euill: alate
<pb facs="tcp:6139:52"/>
puffed vp with proſperity, and now puſhed downe with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: yea, alate placed in Paradiſe, and now plunged in perplexity.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> if thy Fathers friendly precepts might haue perſwaded thee, if his aduice had béene thy aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou hadſt carefully kept his counſaile, then by his fore-warning, thou hadſt béene forearmed againſt all miſhap and miſerie, The force of fickle fancy had not then giuen thee the foyle, Loue had not ſo lightly procured thy loſſe, nor the painted ſhewe of beautie had not ſo ſoone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured thy bane. My bane? Why fond foole, beautie hath bred my bliſſe: fancie hath not giuen me the foile, but hath yéelded me the fort: Loue hath not wrought my loſſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me with treble gaine.</p>
            <p>Hath not <hi>Caſtania</hi> requited my loue with loyaltie, and repaied my good will with mutuall affection? Is ſhée not my Saint, and I her ſeruant? Are we not contracted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by loue, and ſhall continue together by law? May I not diſpoſe of her in the way of marriage at my pleaſure? Yes, but what then? The more is my griefe, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my care. For if her preſence procureth my delight, will not her abſence bréed my deſpight? If her conſent preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my life, will not her contempt inferre my death? Yes. For alas, ſince the deſtinies meane to diſſolue that fancie hath decréed, ſince the frowning fates ſéeke to vnlooſe that which loue hath linked, ſince froward fortune meanes to breake the bonds wherein beautie hath bounde vs, ſince theſe bloudie broyles will cauſe <hi>Caſtania,</hi> (where before ſhe accepted me for a friend) now to reiect me for a foe: What better lucke can I looke for than a loathſome life, or what better hap can I hope for than horror and heauineſſe? Yea, which way ſo euer I turne mee I ſee nothing but woe and wretchedneſſe. For if <hi>Orlanio</hi> perceiued our liking, how would he ſtorme at our loue? If he knew my chance, how would he fret at his Daughters choice? Woulde hée euer conſent, that <hi>Caſtania</hi> ſhould match with ſo meane a mate,
<pb facs="tcp:6139:53"/>
that her Princely perſonage ſhould bee diſgraced with my baſe parentage, that her calling ſhould be crazed with my ſlender countenance: no, he would no doubt firſt baniſh me out of all his dominions. Tuſh <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> would God this were the worſt, and then thou mighteſt hope in time, by ſome means to redreſſe this doubt. But if <hi>Orlanio</hi> ſhuld know thou wert heire apparant to the Dukedome of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylene,</hi> and only ſonne to <hi>Clerophontes</hi> his fatall foe what torment were there ſo terrible, which thou ſhouldeſt not trie? What paine ſo pinching, which thou ſhouldeſt not paſſe? What hap ſo hard, which thou ſhouldeſt not hazard? Yea, what death ſo direfull, which at his cruell hands thou ſhouldeſt not ſuffer? And what if <hi>Caſtania</hi> were priuy to thy ſtate, doeſt thou thinke her ſo conſtant as to conſent to her Fathers foe? Doeſt thou thinke ſhee would wiſhe the ſonnes weale, when the Father wiſheth her miſhap? No, aſſure thy ſelfe if thy ſtate be once knowen, that <hi>Caſtania</hi> will moſt deadly deteſt thée, which will bee more gréeuous to thée than death it ſelfe, be it neuer ſo terrible. Sith then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> thou muſt ſhortly either go in arms againſt thine owne Father, or elſe loſe both thy loue and thy life, let not delay bréede daunger, but ſtrike on the ſtith while the yron is hot. <hi>Caſtania</hi> hath promiſed to forſake both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friends, and her owne Countrie, to paſſe where and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſeth thée, ſhee doubteth no daungers, ſhe forceth of no miſfortune, ſhe careth for no calamity, ſhe paſſeth for no perils, ſo ſhe enioy thy deſired companie: and therefore as ſpéedily as may be, conuey her cloſely into the confines of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> before either ſhe know thy ſtaie or thy ſtate. And ſhall I ſo practice her with policies? Shall I ſo ſifte her with ſubtiltie? Shall I put ſo little truſt in her troth, and ſo ſmall confidence in her conſtancie, as to conceale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her any ſecret? No, come woe, come wretchedneſſe, come death, come daunger, hap what hap will, I will preſentlie impart vnto her my preſent ſtate, and my pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <hi>Valericus</hi> hearing this doubtfull diſcourſe of <hi>Gvvydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> was driuen into an extaſie for ioy, to ſée that hee had found ſuch fit meanes, whereby hee might not onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Dukes fauour, aſpire vnto honour and dignitie, but alſo obtaine the loue of <hi>Caſtania:</hi> for he meant ſpéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preuent the pretence of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> by vnfolding to the Duke the ſum of his ſecret purpoſe, aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that after <hi>Orlanio</hi> knew his parents and parentage, that hée was ſonne and heire to <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> no price though neuer ſo precious, no ranſom though neuer ſo rich, might redéeme him from the moſt deſpitefull death that could be deuiſed. And of theſe premiſſes he inferd this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that if the cauſe be taken away, the effect faileth: that <hi>Gwydonius</hi> beeing reiected, hee ſhould be receiued: that he béeing deſpighted with hate, hee ſhould be requited with loue: and vpon this hope he went preſently to bewray this matter to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> whome hee found with his ſonne <hi>Therſandro,</hi> and diuerſe other noble men conſulting what courſe they had beſt take againſt <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> whoms <hi>Valericus</hi> ſaluted in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PLato</hi> (right worthy Prince) that graue and wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, whoſe ſentences in all ages haue béene holden as moſt diuine Oracles, portraieth out in his bookes of his Common wealth, the picture of a perfect Citizen: whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaments béeing firſt leuelled, hée tricketh vp with theſe colours, that he loue his Prince loyallie, kéepe the lawes carefully, and defend his Country valiantly, in which thrée pointes (ſaith hée) conſiſteth the chiefeſt dutie of a truſty ſubiect: This ſaying of <hi>Plato</hi> throughly conſidered, and calling to minde the ſundrie good turnes which without deſert your Grace hath beſtowed vppon mee, I thought if I ſhoulde not repaie your fauour with faithfulneſſe, and your truſt you repoſe in mee with inuiolable troth, I might bee counted a vicious vaſſall deuoide of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

a trecherous citizen, rather then a truſty ſubiect, a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſlaue, then a carefull gentleman: yea, a graceleſſe mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, miſled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ingratitude. I am come (right worthy ſir) not to betray my fo, but to bewray my frend, not to diſcouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falt of my enemy, but to diſcloſe his offence which liueth with me in perfect amitie, in whoſe company hitherto hath béene all my ioy, pleaſure and delight: but ſince his pretence is greatly preiudiciall to your Graces perſon, I thought to prefer your profit before mine own pleaſure, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of my country, before mine owne priuate conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. So it is, that <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> whom your Grace hath honoured, and all the Court eſtéemed, is ſonne and heire to <hi>Clerophontes</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mitylene.</hi> who by the péeuiſh policie of his Father, vnder the pretence of ſeruice, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to procure your fatall death, and the finall deſtruction of your Dukedome. And the better to performe this diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh practiſe, hée hath contracted himſelfe to my Lady <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtania,</hi> who blinded with his beautie, and inueigled with his wit, hath conſented not onely to kéep his counſaile to your confuſion, but alſo cloſely to conuey her ſelfe with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Countrie. Which pretence if your Grace doth not ſpéedily preuent, you ſhall find that delay bréedes danger, &amp; that procraſtination in perils is but the mother of miſhap.</p>
            <p>And haue I (quoth <hi>Orlanio)</hi> brought vp the bird that wil picke out mine owne eies? Haue I foſtered vp the Serpent in my boſome that will bréede my bane? Haue I giuen her life, that ſéekes to yéeld me death? Haue I cheriſht her bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, and will ſhe conſume mee béeing older? Was there none to chooſe but <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> nor none to loue, but the ſonne of her fathers foe? Will ſhee preferre her luſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my life? her priuate pleaſure, before the ſafetie of my perſon? Well, as ſhe forgets the duetie of a childe, ſo I wil forget the naturall affection of a father, and therefore <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericus</hi> goe ſpéedily with theſe noble men to <hi>Gvvydonius</hi> chamber, and apprehend him, that I may requite his hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trecherie with moſt helliſh torments.

            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hauing this commiſſion giuen him from the Duke, made no delay, but paſſed to <hi>Gvvidonius</hi> lodging with as much ſpéede as might be: but fortune who after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie chip of miſchance, ſendeth ſome lot of good lucke, and after euerie ſtorme of aduerſitie, ſendeth a quiet calme of proſperitie, ſo carefully prouided to frée <hi>Gwydonius</hi> from miſhap, that he was newly gone towards <hi>Caſtania,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto her this his pretence: but before hee came to her chamber, he was encountered by <hi>Therſandro,</hi> who ſtearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking <hi>Gvvydonius</hi> by the boſome, pulling out his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier commanded him as a traitour to ſtand, or elſe without any farther doome he ſhould féele the dint of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gvvydonius</hi> amazed with this ſodaine motion, ſtoode as one in a traunce, neither being able to defend himſelfe with worde or weapon, but yéelded himſelfe into the handes of <hi>Therſandro,</hi> who ſhakt him vp with theſe bitter ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>THou traiterous wretch (quoth he) as it is impoſſible for the flame ſo cloſely to be couered, but it will be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo it is impoſſible, but that treaſon, though neuer ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſhould in tract of time be diſcloſed, which now by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is verified in thee: for although thou haſt hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to falſely fained thy ſelfe to be a ſtranger of a forraigne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou art now known to be ſonne and heire to <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes</hi> that cruell tyrant my Fathers foe, by whoſe pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh policie thou hadſt not onely brought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth to confuſion, but didſt pretend to be preiudiciall to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſon, if thy deadly practiſe and diueliſh purpoſe had not by <hi>Valericus</hi> his meanes béen preuented. Haſt thou béene ſo trained vp in trecherie, or is thy minde ſo ſpotted with villanie, as to repay my fathers good will w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ingratitude, &amp; to deuiſe his deſtruction which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply foreſought thy preferment?

               <hi>Caſtania,</hi> not onely to conſent to thy deſire, but to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death?

Well, ſince I haue happily attached thee as a traitour, and as a villanous rebell, both tranſgreſſing humaine and diuine lawes, thou ſhalt abide the paine and puniſhment due to ſuch diuelliſh offenders. Now let thy cruell ſire <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes,</hi> free thee from thoſe torments which thou art like to ſuffer for thy trecherie, and let the Lordes of <hi>Mitylene</hi> deliuer thee from his handes, who meanes in moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſe to martyr thee.

            <p>
               <hi>THerſandro</hi> (quoth he) as I meane not to affirme that which is falſe, ſo I will not deny that which is true: but come dolor, come death, come miſerie, come martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, come torture, come torments, I will neither accuſe myſelfe vniuſtly, nor excuſe myſelfe by periurie.

<pb facs="tcp:6139:55"/>
confuſion, I not onely deny, but I will proue by combats that <hi>Valericus</hi> moſt villanouſly doth accuſe vs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are altogether ſackleſſe.</p>
            <p>VVHy <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> (quoth hée) wilt thou ſéeke to proue thyſelfe loyall, when the hearers deeme ſhee a lyer? or to make a tryall of thy troth, when thy words can haue no truſt? Dooeſt thou think my fathers fury will ſuffer thée to fable? Dooeſt thou thinke his wrathfull rage wil abide thy reaſons, or that he wil be ſo patient as to hear thée plead thine owne cauſe? No, if thou wert as cléer from theſe crimes alleadged againſt thée by <hi>Valericus</hi> as I am: yet in that thou art ſon to <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> the coine of <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and Kingdoms of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were not ſufficient ranſome to redéem thée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death. But <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> ſince thy health hangeth in my hands, and thy life or death is in my power, I will neither bee ſo bloudy minded as to bréede thy bane, nor ſo cruell, as to be the cauſe of thy confuſion. The guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Gwydonius</hi> I craue of this my good will, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence I claim for this curteſie, is that when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to <hi>Mitylene,</hi> thou certifie thy ſiſter and my loue and Lady <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> that for her ſake I haue procured thy ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that her perfection hath preſerued thée from perill, the loue I beare her hath ſaued thy life, the dutifull deuotion I owe vnto her, hath redéemed thée from death and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And in token of this my vnfeined affection, I will lift my hand againſt none that commeth from <hi>Mitylene,</hi> but againſt <hi>Lucianus</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Therſandro</hi> was able ſullie to vnfolde his mind, or that <hi>Gwydonius</hi> had time to yéelde him thankes for the ſafegard of his life, they heard a great noiſe, which made <hi>Gwydonius</hi> flie, and <hi>Therſandro</hi> hie him haſtily to <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> lodging. Now the companie which came, was <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanio</hi> himſelf, who certified by <hi>Valericus</hi> that <hi>Gwydonius</hi> could not be found, laid not only watch &amp; ward throughout all his Dukedom to attache him, but went in proper perſon
<pb facs="tcp:6139:56"/>
with his Gard to apprehend <hi>Caſtania,</hi> and lay her in cloſe priſon, whom he found all blubbered with teares, for that ſhe had vnderſtood the cauſe before of her brother <hi>Therſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro: Orlanio</hi> no ſooner ſpied her thus wéeping, but hée ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt her in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>HAth the force of lone, nay rather the furie of luſt (vile wretch) ſo blinded thine vnderſtanding, that to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, thou paſſeſt not to peruert both humane and diuine lawes? Doth laſciuious affection and fleſhly fancy ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly frie within thée, as thou wouldeſt procure thy fathers death to purchaſe thy diueliſh deſire?

            <p>BY that time <hi>Orlanio</hi> had ended his Oration, the armies met in a plaine, within thirtie leagues of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Where both of them ordering (as became good Captains) their people, there began in the breake of the daie the moſt cruell and terrible battaile that earſt was heard of, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the number on both parts, their experience and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, with the valiant proweſſe and courage of the captains.

For firſt he fréed <hi>Caſtania</hi> out of priſon, then made generall proclamation throughout his Dukedome, that what Lord ſo euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his land would trie the combat with <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> if he remained victor in the conqueſt, hee would not onely giue him his daughter <hi>Caſtania</hi> to wife, let him poſſeſſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the Dukedome of <hi>Mitylene</hi> as her dowris, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to acknowledge him as his liege, &amp; pay him tribute, as he was wont to <hi>Clerophontes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he lingred and liſtned how this proclamation would preuaile, <hi>Caſtania</hi> hearing this ſeuere ſentence, and dolefull doome pronounced, ſeeing that ſhe ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be forced to forſake <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> but be conſtrained to match in mariage with one whom ſhe ſhould neither loue nor like, burſt forth into theſe bitter complaints.</p>
            <p>ALaſſe (quoth ſhe) how pinching a paine is it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with diuerſe paſſions, what a noyſome care it is to be cumbred with ſundrie cogitations, what a woe it is to hang betwéene deſire a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

there is no ſalue can cure his ſorow, ſo to him which feares to die, and yet hopes to liue, death were thrice more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come than to linger in ſuch doubt.

            <p>If my father <hi>Orlanio</hi> win y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conqueſt, I doubt my deſire ſhall reuer haue happy ſucceſſe: if <hi>Clerophontes</hi> triumph as victor, I greatly feare his cruelty is ſuch, as I ſhall not eſcape moſt hopleſſe death.

But alas, wil <hi>Clerophontes</hi> ſuffer him to match with his mortall foe, wil hée not rather preuent it by my perill? Yes no doubt: if he returne with triumph my father ſhall ſerue him as a ſubiect, my brother ſhall become his vaſſall, my friendes ſhall bee forelorne, my Citie ſackt, and my natiue Countrie brought to vtter confuſion. And ſhall I for the loue of a Stranger wiſh theſe ſtraunge Stratagems?

            </p>
            <p>Who ſéeing that his proclamation coulde not preuayle, and that his Nobles preferred their owne ſafetie before his ſecuritie, was perplexed with ſuch helliſh paſſions, &amp; gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with ſuch pinching griefe, as the Ghoſtes tormented with griſly fiends, felt no ſuch hapleſſe furie.

Combred thus with this cureleſſe care, and ſitting ſolitarily in ſorrow, ſéeing the diſmall day drewe on, and hearing that <hi>Fernandus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was lately

If it pleaſe thee to truſt me without tryall, and to giue any confidence to my words, I héere promiſe both to make manifeſt my loyall loue to <hi>Caſtania,</hi> and to repaie thy courteſie; that I wil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thy perſon, and diſguiſed in thy armour, enter combat with my father <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> eyther intending by winning the victorie to obtaine my will, or by loſing the conqueſt to want my wiſh: if this my profer pleaſe thée, I will paſſe priuily to the Court: if not, good <hi>Therſandro,</hi> let me go as I came.</p>

Who ſéeing, that forced by the fond allurements of Loue, he was to fight, not with his mortall foe, but with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall father, he fell into theſe doubtfull dumps:</p>

battaile againſt his owne father? who ſo cruell as to enter combat with his owne ſire? Alas, dutie perſwades mee not to practice ſo monſtrons a miſchiefe: but the deuotion I owe <hi>Caſtania,</hi> drines mee to performe the déede, were it thrice more dangerous or deſperate. The honour I owe to my father, makes mée faint for feare, but once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſo brutiſh a fact: the loue I owe to <hi>Caſtania,</hi> conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me to defend the combat, if <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe made the challenge. And is not (fond foole) neceſſitie aboue nature? is not the lawe of loue aboue King or Keyzar, Father or Friends, God or the diuell? Yes. And ſo I mean to take it: for either I will valiantly winne the conqueſt and my <hi>Caſtania,</hi> or loſe the victory, and ſo by death end my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>With that the Trumpets ſound, and <hi>Gwydoniu;</hi> lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily leaping into the liſts, fell preſently into furious fight with his Father, driuing not onely <hi>Fernandus</hi> and <hi>Orlanio</hi> but alſo both the armies into a great doubt.

In fine, what beautie or brauerie is in the apparell, either of man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, all procéedeth of Loue. Shall I ſay that Muſicke was
<pb facs="tcp:6139:72"/>
onely inuented by loue, yea truly: for either it mitigateth the paſſions wherewith men are perplexed, or elſe aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth their pleaſure, ſo that daily they inuent diuerſe kindes of inſtruments, as Lutes Citrons, Violls, Flutes, Cornets, Banderas, wheron they play Madrigalls, Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netts, Pauins, Meaſures, Galliardes, and all theſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Loue, as he for whom men doe more than for any other. What cauſeth men to iuſt, tourney, runne at tilt, and combat, but Loue? Who cauſed Comedies, ſhews Tragedies and Maſkes to be inuented, but Loue? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth it that men delight to rehearſe their amorous chaunces and ſtraunge paſſions, and to relate them to their companions? ſome praiſing the curteſie of his Lady, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemning his miſtreſſe cruelty: yea, recounting a thouſand miſhappes which happen in their Loues: as Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſcloſed, euill reports, ſuſpicious iealouſie, ſometimes the husband comming home ſooner than either the louer would, or the wife doeth wiſh: ſometimes coniecturing without cauſe, and otherwhiles beléeuing nothing, but truſting vpon his wines honeſty. To be ſhort, the greateſt pleaſure after Loue, is to tell what perillous dangers are paſſed. But what maketh ſo many Poets in the world, is it not Loue? The which ſéemeth to bee the plaine ſonge wheron all Poets doe deſcant: yea, there are fewe which write vppon any ſerious matter, but they cloſe vp their work with ſome amorous clauſe, or elſe they are the worſe accepted. <hi>Ouid</hi> hath celebrated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame of <hi>Cupid, Petrarke</hi> and <hi>Virgill, Homer</hi> and <hi>Liuius, Sappho,</hi> yea, &amp; that ſeuere <hi>Socrates</hi> wrote ſomewhat of his loue <hi>Aſpaſia.</hi> Tuſh, who rightly can denie, that Loue is not the cauſe of all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, honor, profit, and pleaſure which happeneth to man, and that without it hee cannot conueniently liue, but ſhall run into a thouſand enormities?</p>
                  <p>All this happy ſucceſſe came by Loue, aslong as hee had his eies: but now béeing depriued of his ſight, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with Folly, it is to be feared, nay certainly to be
<pb facs="tcp:6139:72"/>
beléeued, that he ſhall be the cauſe of as many diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, miſchiefes and miſhaps, as hetherto he hath béen of honour, profite, and pleaſure. The noblemen which loued their inferiours, and the ſubiectes which dutifully ſerued their Lordes, ſhall be marueilouſly changed by the meanes of Follie: for the maiſter ſhall loue his ſeruant onely for his ſeruice, and the ſeruant his maiſter onely for commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. Yea, there is none ſo addicted vnto vertue, but if once he loue, he ſhall preſently commit ſome fooliſh touch: and the more ſtraight and firme Loue is, the greater diſorder there ſhall be by the meanes of Folly. There will returne into the world more than one <hi>Biblis,</hi> more than one <hi>Semy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis,</hi> than one <hi>Myrrha,</hi> than one <hi>Canace,</hi> than one <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra.</hi> There ſhall be no place in the world vnſpotted. The high walles and trelliſſed windowes ſhall not kéepe the Nunnes and Veſtall Virgins in ſafegard. Olde age ſhall turne her aged affections into fond fancies and wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Shame ſhall liue as an exile. There ſhall be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwéene the noble and peaſant, betwéene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell and the Moore, the Turke and the Iewe: the Lady, the Miſtreſſe, and the handmayd. But there ſhall inſue ſuch a confuſed inequalitie, that the faire ſhall not be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the well featured, but ſhall bee oft times ioyned with foule and deformed perſons. Great Ladies and noble Dames ſhall fall in loue with them whome before they would diſdaine to accept as their ſeruants. And when the loiall and faithfull louers haue long languiſhed in the loue of ſome beautifull Dame, whoſe mutuall good will they haue gained by deſert; then Follie will cauſe ſome fickle and falſe flatterer to enioy that in one houre, which in all their life they could not attaine. I paſſe ouer the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all debates and quarrels that ſhall inſue by Follie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall ſpring woundes, maſſacres, &amp; moſt fearefull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And I greatly feare that whereas Loue hath inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many laudable ſciences, and brought foorth ſo many commodities, that now he will bring great idleneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb facs="tcp:6139:73"/>

How manie other ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are there in the worlde, which are altogether fooliſh? and yet the profeſſours of them had in high reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt men. They which are Calculators of Natiuities, makers of Characters, caſters of figures, are they not fryers of this fraternitie. Is it not follie to be ſo curious, as to meaſure the heauen, the height of the ſtarres, the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the ſea? and yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors héereof are highly eſtéemed, and onely by the means of follie. Nay, how could the world continue, if the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, troubles, calamities, and diſcommodities of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age were not couered by folly?

To commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the mercy of the winde and the waues, to liue in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of fearefull ſurges, and perilous rockes, to traffique with ſauage and barbarous people, onely incenſed by the meanes of Follie. And yet notwithſtanding, by this meanes the Common-wealth is maintayned, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning augmented, the properties of hearbes, ſtones, Birdes, and beaſtes, perfectly ſearched out. What folly is it moſt daungerouſly to paſſe into the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth to digge for yron, and ſéeke for gold? How many artes and occupations ſhould bee driuen out of the

How ſhould ſo many Aduocates, Procurators, Sergeants, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneis, Scriueners, Imbroderers, Painters, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumers liue, if Ladie Follie were vtterly exiled? Hath not follie inuented a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deuices to draw a man from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as Tragedies, Comedies Dancing ſchooles, fencing houſes, wraſtling places, &amp; a thouſand other fooliſh ſports?</p>
                  <p>Hath ſhe not made men hardie and venturous to fight with Lions, Bores, and Buls, onely to gaine honour and to paſſe other in follie?

What cauſed <hi>Caeſar</hi> lament that he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to trouble the world in that age, wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> had conquered the greateſt part? Why did diuerſe ſéeke to fill vp the valleyes, to make plaine the mountaines, to dry vp Riuers, to make Bridges ouer the Sea, as <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour did? What made <hi>Rodope</hi> builde the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides, and <hi>Artemiſia</hi> frame the ſumptuous ſepulchre, but Follie. In fine, without this Goddeſſe, man ſhoulde bee carefull, heauie, and whollie drowned in ſorrow: whereas Follie quickeneth his ſpirits, maketh him ſing, daunce, leape, and frame himſelfe altogether to pleaſure. It is not poſſible that loue ſhould bee without the daughter of youth, which is Follie. For Loue ſpringeth of ſedaine and ſundrie cauſes, by receiuing an apple, as <hi>Cidippe:</hi> by looking out at a windowe, as <hi>Scilla:</hi> by reading in a Booke, as the Ladie <hi>Francis Rimhi:</hi> ſome fall in loue by ſight, ſome by hearing, but all liuing in hope to obtaine their deſires. And yet ſome haue loued without anie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſe, as <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who fell in loue with his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble picture: and I pray you what <hi>Sympathie</hi> could there be betwéene a liuely youth and a dead ſtone? what was it then but follie that kindled this flame? What forced <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> to fall in loue with his owne ſhaddowe, but Follie? Yea, what aduenture is paſſed in loue without Follie?
<pb facs="tcp:6139:74"/>
For the Philoſophers define Follie to be a depriuation of wiſedome, and wiſedome is altogether without paſſions: of the which when loue ſhall be voide, then no doubt, the Sea ſhall be without waues, and the fire without heats.</p>
                  <p>Conſider but a young man which onely placeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in amorous conceites, decking, dreſſing, and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelfe moſt delicately, who paſſeth out of his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fraught with a thouſand ſundrie fancies, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with men and Pages, paſſing to the place where hee may haue a ſight of his Miſtreſſe, obtaining for his trauell no gaine but perhaps ſome amorous glance, making long ſutes, ſpending his time and his treaſure, conſuming his wit, and waſting his wealth, and yet reaping nothing but diſdaine and diſcredite. But if it chance that his Miſtreſſe condeſcend vnto his requeſts, ſhe appointeth him to come at ſome ſuſpicious houre, which he cannot performe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great perill. To come with company, were to bewraie his ſecrets: to go alone, moſt daungerous: to goe openly, too manifeſt: ſo that he muſt paſſe diſguiſed, ſometime like a woman, other times like a peaſant or ſome vile perſon, ſcaling the walles with ladders, climbing vp to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes by cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follie did not hold him vp by the hand. It is not alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto you how many ſundrie paſſions do perplexe the poore paſſionate Louers, all which procéed of Follie: as to haue ones heart ſeparated from himſelfe, to be now in peace and then in warre, now couering his dolour, blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing one while, and looking pale another, fraught whollie with feare, hope, &amp; ſhame, ſeeking that carefully which hée ſéemeth to flie, and yet doubtfully dreading not to finde it, to laugh ſildome, to ſigh often, to burne in colde, and freeze in heate, to be croſſed altogether with contraries, which be ſignes not onely of follie, but of phrenſie. Who ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>Hercules,</hi> handling ſo carefully the diſtaſte of <hi>Omphale,</hi> or <hi>Salomon</hi> for combring himſelfe with ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, <hi>Anniball</hi> in ſubmitting himſelfe to his Loue,

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in obeying <hi>Hermia,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> in yéelding to <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> and many other which we ſée daily to bee ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as they know not themſelues: and what is the cauſe hereof, but follie? ſo that we ſee that it is ſhe which maketh Loue to be ſo feared and redoubted, it is ſhe that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and cauſeth him to be counted as a God. Further, whoſoeuer loueth, muſt apply himſelfe to the affection of his miſtreſſe, although it be contrarie to his naturall conſtitution: if he be quiet, wiſe, and diſcréete, yet if his louer pleaſe to haue him chaunge his ſtate, he muſt turne his ſtearne, and hoiſe his ſaile, to goe with another winde. <hi>Zethius</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> could not agrée, for becauſe the delight of the one was a deſpight to the other, vntill <hi>Amphion</hi> left his Muſicke. If the Ladie whom thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt be couetous, thou muſt chaunge thy ſelfe into golde, and ſo fall into her boſome: if ſhe be merrie, thou muſt bée pleaſant: if ſullen, thou muſt be ſad. All the ſeruants and ſutors to Atlanta were hunters, becauſe ſhe delighted in that ſport. Many Gentlewomen to pleaſe their louers which were Poets, left the rocke and the néedle, and tooke in hand pennes &amp; books: now tell mee if theſe ſtraunge Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes be not méere points of follie? Doe you thinke that a Souldier which goeth to the aſſault, marketh the trenches, thinketh of his enemies, or of a thouſand hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes, wherof euerie one is ſufficient to deſtroy him? No, he onely hopeth to win the conqueſt, and doth not ſo much as once imagine the reſt. He which firſt inuented ſayling, doubted not of the perillous daungers: and hee that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, neuer thinketh to become a looſer, yet are they all thrée in daunger to be ſlaine, drowned, and vndone. But what then? they neither do ſee, nor will ſée what is hurtfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. So we muſt coniecture the like of louers: for if they did ſée the dreadfull dangers, and the fearefull perits wherein they are, how they be deceiued and beguiled, they would neuer honour loue as God, but deteſt him as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and ſo ſhould the kingdom of loue be deſtroyed, which
<pb facs="tcp:6139:75"/>
now is gouerned by ignorance, careleſneſſe, hope &amp; blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which are all the handmaids of Folly. Remaine in peace then fond Loue, and ſéeke not to break the auncient league which is betwéen thée and Folly. For if then doeſt, thy bowe ſhal be broken, thy darts ſhal be of no force, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptęque iacent &amp; ſine luce faces.</hi>
