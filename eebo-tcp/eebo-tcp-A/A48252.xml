            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To your Grace she doth freely open and unbowel her self, fearing to be branded with incivility if she should deny; Your Grace only amongst Women owes nothing to Nature: for how much soever she hath graced you with an incomparable lustre in your Feature, or pregnancy of Wit, your Grace hath returned all of it in these Elegancies of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and Poesie, with a most excellent retaliation.

               <p>HOw great and serious a joy doth arise to us from Your Excellencies Condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though we cannot otherwise make it appear; yet hence chiefly it may be shewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this most pleasing Duty of expressing our Thankfulness, we have been somewhat tardy, and are yet solicitous; for such is the nature of a good turne that it calls for a requital; but your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Fortune and Greatness doth neither require nor brook it, whence it comes to pass that we who are otherwise Bountiful, and are wont to return as much as we have received, because we may seem to render persons in other things most approved by our testemony, such as it is, more allowable; at length being endowed with your most excellent Gift, we do freely acknowledge our deficiency. In the mean time we may justly pride our selves in this, that your Excellency, as well as our Learning, is so much the cause of our Happiness, that none can commend your Gifts, or express their worth, but will himself thereby grow more commendable: therefore have we Praise and Duty joyned, that we may not avouch how much we owe being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, nor understand what we have received unless Learned: Your Excellency doth not only bestow Gifts worthy your Nobleness, but also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make way that we our selves may, in time, be worthy of your so great Favors: which is a reason of well-deserving, proper only to your self: neither
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56934:7"/>
indeed doth your Excellency only afford Patronage to Learning (which you only can do) but also make Arts more famous; and whatsoever there is any where of Sciences you do happily promote and adorne. Pardon us most Illustrious Marchioness if we often wonder to whom, at length, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and we our selves, do so much owe those excellent Arts, and your Excellencies Endowments; how it came to pass that Eloquence, Poetry, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, things otherwise most different, should without the help of a Tutor, without the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of an University, at length, agree in a Woman: Indeed we who wonder that the Antients should adore the same tutelar Godess both of Arts and Arms, what shall we think of your Excellency, who are both a <hi>Minerva</hi> and an <hi>Athens</hi> to your self, the <hi>Muses</hi> as well as an <hi>Helicon, Aristotle</hi> as well as his <hi>Lycaeum?</hi> Indeed such is our condition that we can sooner understand our own happiness then express yours, which is so far beyond the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of our expressions, as this present Description, such as it is, is beyond the necessity of a Fiction. We think it concerns us very much (who have the happiness to understand so much of your Excellency) some way to testify, according to our genius and that of this place, then which none can admire you more, with what mind, withwhat desires, with what real affections we do receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace your most Excellent Works; which part of our duty we do as sincerely perform as it doth truly tend to the great honour of this florishing So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citey, that we enjoy your Excellencies undeserved favour, whom all Learning doth commend, and all degrees of the Learned adore and honor. So much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56934:8"/>
beyond Expectation it was (most Excellent Lady) that you the first of all, by your own example, should make it appear that even Women may be Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. One thing we wish for, the enlargement of the fame of your Excellent name, and more signal vertues, that your most learned Works may appear in such a language in which we read and admire <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Maro</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans, Plato</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> amongst the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Which if it ever come to pass, we hope and also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (your Excellency being willing) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our desires, and the greater increase of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in a short time, by the very augmentation of Sciences the World may be sensible what Eternity of Glory your Excellency hath obtained.</p>

               <p>WE lately received, with abundance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Complacency, those two tokens of your favour, with which your Grace hath been pleased, to honour us; Your Poems, and Philosophical Letters, both which we entertain and embrace with that careful respect, which is due to those high and noble undertakings, which will procure in all ages (while men have any humanity) condigne fame and renown to their Authors. In your Poems we admire that Life and Spirit, as also that Native, and Even Fancie, which, every where, is Conspicuous. Your Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con is neither Pond nor Sea, but like a fair and deep River gently slides, and flow's in upon your Readers. In your Philosophy there appears, every where, a clear and searching acuteness of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing forced, or Mysterious: All is plain and genuine, meer and natural Nature. We men find Nature and Truth very coy and sullen, alas how we vex, persecute, and chase her, who yet still outruns us: Some imagine her to be in Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools and Quick-sands, like another <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi> and they find Her so now and then, in their shipwract Credit and Reputation. Some grope for her in Vacuums and empty spaces, with a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess not unlike their supposals. Some fancy her among Daemons and Spirits, as if she were a Witch: Others torment her in the Fire, or Rack her, and force her rather to Belie, then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess her self. But she willingly shews herself all bare and naked to your Grace; Madam, you are one, if not the only one of your Sex, that owe Nature
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56934:12"/>
nothing; for whatever lustre and beauty of body or mind, she hath deckt and enriched you withal, your Grace has largely recompensed her, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quit with her in these your elegant Poems, and Philosophy. In a word, to be no longer troublesom to your Grace, we would we could but express what thankful acknowledgements we, in mind and thought, do conceive, for this twin-pledge of your Love, full of all Muses and Graces; then we should fall less, though still continually, short of so high a favour. May you live long, most Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Heroick Lady, to adorn, maintain, and nourish Learning, and Learned men, and Us, who are, in all offices of Honour and observance.</p>

               <p>THat incomparable and most desired Book of your Grace's, containing the History of his Grace's Actions, in the late War, we have not only readily received but also perused and read over, as we are wont to do with whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you write; yet in reading it we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we stop'd often, because we could not but admire, every where, both the lostiness of the argument, and elegancy, and spruceness of the Stile,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56934:14"/>
and Composition; and in regard that at so great a distance we could not be admitted to the favour of kissing your Hand, we cease not to bestow ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand embraces upon every page of that Book, which hath so noble and immortal a subject as is his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcastle;</hi> although your Grace can neither dictate nor publish any Work which the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will not own, and esteem, yet for this last Essay of your Graces we retain a most singular affection, and, in testimony thereof, lodge it in the richest Cabinet that we have, our publick Liberary; for the perusal of the present, and succeeding generation, long therefore shall the most valiant, and renowned General live, and your Grace too with him, seeing you have written his enterprises with as great a spirit as he himself per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd them; hereafter if generous and high born men; if men of War search our Library for a Model of a most accomplished General, they shall find it expressed to the life, not in <hi>Xenophon's Cyrus,</hi> but in the Dutchess of <hi>Newcastle's William.</hi> Most Excellent Princess, you have unspeakably obliged us all, but not in this respect alone, for whensoever we find our selves non-plus'd in our Studies we repair to you, as to our Oracle, if we be to speak you dictate to us; if we knock at <hi>Apollo's</hi> doore, you alone open to us; if we compose an History you are the Remembrancer; if we be confounded and puzled among the Philosophers, you disentangle us, and assoil all our difficulties: in a word, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we attempt your Grace now vouchsafe's to stand by us, and suggest as a Lady of a most Princely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, and of an inexhaustible vigor; and thus you do not only exercise, but oppress us with your noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

               <p>WE have received your Excellencies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable and most beneficial books with such grandure and reverence of mind, as it is very fit we should, as a pledge and warant of our future security; for seeing we are to Contend in a bruitish world for life, much more for honour, with the reproaches of an illiterate age, as it were now desparing of attaining to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in our weighty affairs, lest <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Philosophy, and Learning should grow infamous, Your Excellency hath only brought it to pass, that we have hopes yet to live; the memory of our name being perpetuated in your Excellencies Books, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56934:15"/>
will not only survive our Universities, but hold date even with Time it self; and doubtless we shall live, for as much as it pleaseth you, most Excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, so long as either Name or Honour remains, either to Virtue or Books; and incontinently this age, by the reading of your Books, will loose its barbarity and rudeness, being made tame by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy both of your stile and matter: and moreover it will not judge us to be no-bodies whom such an accomplish'd Princess hath not refused to make not only the Perusers, but even the Moderators, and Judges of her Works. So as the very worth of your Excellencies Books, hath brought us, being willing, altogether perswaded and convinced into a just admiration of your Excellency. However your Grace may see how much your Praises are impaired, not so much by the default of our Wit (though that be very great) as because you have the hap to live in such an unfortunate age. Antient <hi>Greece</hi> it self, the sole Governness of all just merits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the cause of such unparallel'd vertues, would have spent her self in ten years Panegyricks; neither would there be any cause why <hi>Isocrates</hi> should prefer his <hi>Athenians</hi> (though they were <hi>Minerva's</hi> Scholars) before <hi>Cambridge;</hi> to whom your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (for such honour doth your Grace procure) doth kindle a new, yet never perishing, Light: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Rome</hi> it self would have resolved all your Praises into Statues and Monuments of your name, by which there might arise continually <hi>Cornelia's,</hi> and if there were any other, therefore the Glory of their Age, and the Honour of your Sex, because your Excellency had not then a being, but reserved by the Author of all things, and born in after times
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56934:15"/>
for the honour, and ornament of this age in which we live. The Titles and Triumphs are long since obsolete, and worn out, the honour of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> lives only in a little slender fame, and those Marbles inscribed with the names of so many of the Learned, are mouldered into dust, and yet all these live, and flourish in their due Praises, and are the survivors of all their admirers, and this Glory is only common to your Excellency, with those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Worthies, that as neither the famous Statues, nor the applause of their admirers, nor the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vote, but the solid Grace of their Works, and Virtue which is its own best Herauld, doth declare their merits: So your Excellencies most unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld worth, and our thankful acknowlegment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the furniture of tumultuous applauses, hath set apart a place in our Library, that faithful Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Wits, for your Grace, where, according to our slender provision, which also the Custome of our Ancestors, by whom we are the better enabled, and our own ingenious confession, we do with great earnestness desire; we henceforth with acclamations that such an Illustrious Princess (reason being now restored, Philosophy confirmed, Envy conquered) doth esteem that in others which she honours in her own person; We will therefore that this, whatsoever it is, be the argument of a Grateful mind.</p>

               <p>OUr opinion is not in any wise altered; of all your Books in general we judge, as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and equity we must of every one of them: and what unspeakable esteem we have for every one of them, neither are you ignorant, nor may we (as we did, or hereafter shall receive any of them severally) forbear to publish to the World. This we think, and this, upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, we profess to be a return, that your Graces affection to the Commonwealth of learning (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your Personal advancement in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56934:17"/>
of Knowledge) hath, long ago, called for from all ingenious Scholars: This is a debt, which men of several professions pay you daily, in consideration of the pleasure and profit they reap from your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, your Epistles, your Comoedies, and your Grounds: but especially we of <hi>Cambridge</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and, with exceeding delight, peruse (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Honour that of late hath been done by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to this Community) your most judicious and elaborate Observations upon Experimental Philosophy. For although we nothing doubt, but the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will flourish, whilest there is any regard in the World had to Learning, and Modesty, yet to the Perpetuity of so famous, and antient a Corporation, we cannot but hope for an addition from the Eternity of your Labours. It is not therefore for nothing (most learned Princess) that far beyond what we can express, we renown and admire your Grace, looking ever and anon upon, and glorying in that immortall stately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of Contemplation, which you have erected for the Wonder, as well as for Instruction of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It's true, our eyes are almost dazled, when we presume to look up to that height of National honour, wherein you shine above most of your Sex. But (which is yet far more noble and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the lustre of your Wit hath so surpassed the greatness of your Fortune, in glory, that we may now very plausibly throw away our other Greek, and Latine Authors, and be content to learn only, what you teach in proper and good English. For, when you retire to Study, you take (as we see) nothing at all upon trust; you sit down at no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Feet, but enquiring into the Mysteries of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56934:17"/>
every Sect, you most exactly weigh, distinguish; and correct whatsoever <hi>Democritus</hi> laughed at, or <hi>Heraclitus</hi> wept, or <hi>Epicurus</hi> raved, or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or <hi>Aristotle</hi> understood, or <hi>Arcesilas</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. Nor do you neglect, or omit, in case the <hi>Lord Verulam,</hi> or <hi>Harvey,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus</hi> hath pretended to add to the atchievements of the Antients. This indeed, this it is (most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dutchess) to study, to resolve, to determine, like a Royal and Impartial Professor: But whither on the sudden have you transported us: For that Principality (which is yours) in Learning admits (it should seem) of no bounds, but in your happy and pregnant imagination alone. Nature is infinite; and you your self, having nothing further to know in this, first discover, and then travel into another, World. we mean your Blazing World, which you enlighten with your own lustre, and describe to us far more accurately, then ever <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Critias</hi> attempted. After this manner in all sorts of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if your Eminency proceed, <hi>Margaret</hi> will shortly pass, not only for the name of the Dutchess of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi> but also for the Cognizance of Philosophy. So we dare, as it were, before hand, hope, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise our selves, who study continually to be more and more (if it be possible) then we are already.</p>

               <p>BY the Bounty of several Benefactors, our Liberary is furnished with many large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; yet we have none we so highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and are more proud of, then those written &amp; given us by your Graces own hand. Jewels have their value crowded in a little room. The <hi>Sybills</hi> Leaves as they became fewer advanced their price. Among pieces all so perfectly excellent, we dare not otherwise offer at a Comparison, then as the Subject leads and determins us. The Greatness and Miracle which hath appeared in the Life of the most Incomparable Duke of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> could not but raise, in your Grace thoughts answerable to so glorious a Theame, and give us at the same
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56934:20"/>
time, both Wonder and Delight, to read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of that full-blown Vertue and Glory, which with us appeared first in their bud and Blossome. The next Glory to that of having done such Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is to have writ them so well and exactly. And, had the Sex allowed it, Your Grace had done the same Actions, and left Despair to any other Pen to have reached, their height. A grateful mind, which we desire to Express, is the Prologue to our new Request: but our chief Trust and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is in your own ready and natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all Acts of Bounty and Charity. They that are cunning in the Art of Begging, are so well versed and studied in Faces, that among an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they know which to let pass, and where to fix: they read at first sight the Characters and Dispositions of a ready and willing Goodness: and will sometimes pitty them they Beg of, as carrying Faces apt to undo them into as low poverty as they themselves suffer. Though perhaps we have not so particular knowledge af those outward Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which might encourage this confident ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress; yet the general Fame, besides our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will not suffer us to be ignorant, of those of your great and generous Soul, which stayes not for opportunities offered, but seeks them, and to know where it is wanting, is all the argument necessary to your noble Bounty. We are so unhappily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Building, that we can neither leave off, nor go on without the help and assistance of others. Yet we could be content to change our designe, and wholly leave what we have in hand, to erect a Statue to your Graces Name and Memory. That as one <hi>Margaret</hi> stands with us famous to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

for her Zeal to promote the growth of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was then upon its recovery from a long and dark ignorance: so now your Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with fairer advantage, being your self, to the shame and reproach of our Sex, the great pattern and example of Learning. We despair of raising any more lasting Monument to your Name, then what already your Grace hath left with us. But, you will oblige here very many Beads-men and Votaries, who will make it a great part of their study, that the famous Acts of your Charity and Bounty, may be read not only in Stones, but Men, who shall for ever bless your Memory, and pray for your Happiness.

'Tis true, we here have lodged hitherto with Conveniences, enough to attest the Generosity of your thrice noble Family, above as well our Expectations as Merits; and beyond what Learning durst promise it self from this Barbarous Age. Our Colledge Walls are as strong, as our Noble Foundresses Designes were generous: and the Sun looks upon us still, but as he should, through no Crevices or Chinks, nor makes more day than we permit him to our melancholy Retirements. Nor would your Grace's Illustrious Aunt be now ashamed of that fair addition she made our Colledge, if the durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the work can reflect any honour upon that generous Effort of her Charity.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56934:22"/>
Learning. Yea, my Lord, your Grace hath now instructed us, and may undeceive-others: and the Statue of your Illustrious Aunt shall now encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Studies, and superintend over our Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency as her own Deputy: and we shall be ashamed to have lived unprofitably, and unanswerably to so noble a Benefaction; or that the Illustrious Countess of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> should, amidst the Joys, wherein She is surrounded by a blessed Immortality, have the dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have loved Learning in vain, and have built us a Synagogue, and so nobly seconded the designes of the late most Serene Mother of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh: 'Tis true we ought to have owned the Honour to have set up ere now the Statue of the most Noble Countess of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> but that which excuses all Immoralities, that which involved Kings, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, your most noble Family, and Learning, in one Common Desolation, the late Rebellion, hindred us till now: We could only look on with Sorrow, the place designed for the Effigies of your Grace's most Noble Aunt, and sigh that the barbarous wickedness of the times, which allowed no visible remembrance of Saints or Kings, should be able to defeat our Designe, to perpetuate, in this nature, Her Memory, and our Acknowledgements: But, we dare be bold humbly to conceive, this our late thankfulness will be no disadvantage to her happy Memory, and that the Inscription of St. <hi>John's</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon her Statue, will hold even with the latest Date of time: and that it may not be the only miraculous Priviledge of some Rivers, after they have enricht their neighbouring Banks, to dive suddenly into the Earth, for the space of some miles, and rise again into their former greatness,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56934:22"/>
and acquire a newer, and more lasting glory, by being, so long, undiscovered: thus shall the most Noble Countess of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> be not disadvantaged (as far as our weak pretences can reach) by this our post fact Acknowledgements, but, like Majesty, by this distance of Years, command a greater Veneration. But if we dare pretend so much to honour the Memory of the Blessed now in Heaven, how shall we pay the Living, those that by so great Obligations have deserved all that we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to of Gratitude and Esteem, amongst which, your Grace's Favours to our Colledge hath entitled you the Principal. My Lord, to such we are poor in every thing but Prayers: and that your Grace may long live to be (as you are) the honour of this Age, your most Noble Family, and (which we take the boldness to be proud in) this Colledge: that, by that Civility, whereby you have made even your misfortunes Illustrious, and Crown'd Heads your Admirers, you may long unteach this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Age that bruitish disaffection to Learning; that you may survive that envy which your Grace's Excellent Accomplishments as well as our little Learning hath attracted, is the Desire of</p>

               <p>ON whom to father the rare, and admirable Method of Horsmanship, that singular, and useful Invention, which hitherto so many Nations, and so many several Societies of men, and so many Commanders in chief, have earnestly desired, though Strangers peradventure may, yet of all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live We of the University cannot be to seek; because every single line, that <hi>Apelles</hi> draws, serves us for a sufficient Character, and Cognizance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer: But in regard of our unfeigned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Zeal for the Duke of <hi>Newcastles</hi> honour, We did heretofore (if your Highness remember) now and then entreat, and beseech you not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any longer (than necessity required) so learned, and useful, and compleat a Work. In that humble petition of ours whether we did as became us, or no, we determine not: only (with leave) we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the reasonableness alone of our importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity prevailed at length with, and overcame a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral otherwise absolute, and altogether invincible. Whereupon at this day (by your Princely favour) we see and with exceeding delight (as occasion is) peruse a second demonstration of your abilities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed now to publick view, for the benefit of all generous and high-spirited men in <hi>Europe,</hi> so that no man hereafter may dream of any Person in any Place whatsoever, more Noble, or (in what part of Learning you please) more an accomplished Master, than your most Excellent self: for, as if in the former Volume you had only vouchsafed us a tast to whet our Stomachs, you now spread, and furnish a Royal Table with all sorts of Delicacies;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56934:27"/>
you now gratify the appetite of your Countrey-men; you now encounter, and answer the enquiry of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Philosophers, in whose judgement your last adventure seems always to be the most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If they will enter the Lists, and compare, we challenge not only these old Professors, <hi>Bellerophon, Sesostris,</hi> and <hi>Sarmenes,</hi> but also the later Authors of greatest account in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italy, Pignatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Labrovius,</hi> and <hi>Grison.</hi> Let them altogether appear, and either they must immediately vanish, or else ingenuously blush that they are but once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the same day with matchless <hi>Cavendish.</hi> And although they may seem, at first, somewhat more than ordinarily concerned, to be thus at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet as soon as ever they hear the Name of Duke <hi>William,</hi> they bow to your Sovereignty, and falling infinitely short of your Glory, they confess you the most absolute and only Master, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves your Pupils. But why do we mention these several Dressers, when as (if we look abroad) we may daily see both Kings and Princes resorting to your Palace, condescending to sit at your Feet, and intreating you as their Oracle to declare unto them, first where and of what Race to chuse a Horse for the Mannage, and then how to Feed, and Order, and Mount, and to Work, and Raise, and Stay, and Ride in all Voltoes, and Corvetts, Forward, Backward, Side-ways, on both hands, just as the Rider directs. For this same purpose, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only to be Matriculated into the Duke of <hi>Newcastle's</hi> Academy, the renowned Cavaleers of all Orders attend, whether they be Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or the Knights of of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or the Knights of the

                  <hi>Annunciation</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> or the Knights <hi>Batchelors,</hi> the Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and the Knights of the <hi>Garter,</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> for all agree to learn of you, to Back, to Sit, and Ride, as you direct; and whensoever at a loss, or puzled, or in dispute to acknowledge you the only Governour, and Dictator, and Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and such a Master of Horse, as can (when you please) infuse sense, and reason not only into Men, but also into Brutes. Most deservedly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall you (Great Sir) in your Book entertain, and exercise the Studies not only of this, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of succeeding Generations, as we confidently presage, and promise our selves, who are</p>

But whilest in this manner you regard Learning, and embellish Virtue, you give the World to know, that you are neither a Stranger to, nor unacquainted with the direct Road to Honour, and Glory; And thither indeed only you march with such expedition and conduct, that you have already (beyond what an University can write) enriched our publick Treasury with some last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monuments of your Skill and Gallantry. Shall we beg leave to remember your Book of Horsmanship, which we love to peruse and boast of to Strangers?

Therefore I will not adventure upon that impossible task, but shall reduce my self into my own Orbe of Humility and thankfulness, for this great Honour you have been pleased to do me, assuring your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency with all, that you could not have deigned it to any man living, who is more than I am,</p>

               <p>I received (a fortnight ago) your Honours Letter, and the Books you sent; one to the University Library, one to the Vice Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and another to my self. Mr. Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor received your Book (as indeed he ought) with very much thankfulness, and sense of the great Civility you had done him, and commanded me to return his respects, and hearty Thanks, which he would have done himself, but that both he and his Family hath been fore visited with Sickness (for almost a whole year) so that he has not been (nor now is) in a condition to write. The like thanks, and (if possible) infinitely more, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in behalf of the University, and my self; being amazed at your goodness, and undeserved Kindness, that a person so Illustrious, and (for place and parts so) Eminent, should look upon so unconsiderable, and impertinent a thing in black, as I am, but that I know the Sun doth shine on Shrubs, as well as Cedars, and Princes many times cast their Favours upon persons infinitely below them; whence they can expect no return but gratitude; and when I fail to pay that Tribute (so justly due to your Honour) may I have your hate, which will be the greatest curse I am capable of. I have as yet only read one Story in your Book, and the Language, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of it, to me seems such, that I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the famous Monsieur <hi>Scudeny</hi> would wish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Author of it.

               <p>THat I have not long e're this made at least some slender return of the meanest Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, a verbal acknowledgement, I take the greater boldness now at length to Apologize; for that it is in no small measure justly chargeable upon the Chain of those grand Favours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Lady of old, with Bracelets and Jewels) I have been, by your Excellency, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed into an Extasy. The truth of which is too much evidenced by an undeniable argument, that like such as are newly rowsed out of a Trance, not yet fully returned to my self, I now begin to talk Idly. Indeed I could not but deplore my own unhappiness; as equally rack'd between two hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful extreams, Ingratitude and Presumption, that can neither be silently grateful to so Noble a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factress,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56934:38"/>
without too palpable and disingenuous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, nor verbally thankful to so Illustrious a Princess without a Solaecism; but that I am well assured your Excellencies Heroick Candor will at least connive at the most rude, if cordial and humble, expressions of a most devoted mind. And such (Madam) is that, I here with all submission pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto you, loaded with such various Instances of your signal Favours, as never can (except we could suppose your Illustrious self may) find out a Parrallel. That so mean, so obscure a Person should have the Honour of receiving first into his custody so rich a Treasure, as the genuine Product and Issue of so Noble a Mind; and then be commanded to divulge this his Glory, by presenting them to a whole University in so Glorious a Name; that this Honour (a high Reward it self) should yet be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enhaunced by a splendid Gift, truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Grandure of the Donor, and that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by that Golden Pen, which hath enricht the World with such excellent variety of inimitable Writings; that a poor scanty Study should swell into a Library, and become a Repository for such rich Volumes; — Pardon me (Madam) if at these reflections I wax proud, and be transported beyond the narrow compass of my contracted self. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies Bounty (a true Transcript of the Divine) creates, what it cannot find, a worthiness in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and ennobles him, whom it makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of generous Beneficence.</p>
               <p>What Honourable reception your Excellencies former Works (in the possession whereof each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Colledge-Library, as well as that publick one of the University, justly prides it self, and boasts its

riches) found amongst us, as (indeed) by very few Acknowledgements then signified: How much more acceptable these latter Volumes are, silence alone can best tell. Few durst before adventure upon so difficult a Task: and the Reason since that is more apparent and confirmed (if I may without prophanation make use of the most Illustrious Lord Marquess his Expression) — <hi>None now dares write a Letter.</hi> —</p>

               <p>YOu have convinced the World, that your Sex can as well propagate Learning as our Species, and taught us justly to own all, from our Mother-Wit; 'Tis without the help of Classick Authors, Schools, or Languages, that you Madam, have composed your most excellent Poems, Playes, Fables, The World's Olio, Opinions Philosophical and Physical, which are the greatest Prize the Invention of Printing can boast of: That Admiration and Praise, which your Excellency merits, must be the study of Ages to come; which, by your Works, may be made more knowing. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the stolen Tales of Learning, which Scholars, painfully disingenious, have, in several Ages, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from lost Languages, and entitled themselves
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56934:41"/>
the Authors, are not Rules to try the truth of your notions, nor means to clear them to us, but skreen them from our captivated Apprehensions. Who means to Improve, Madam, by your discoveries, must study them alone, and freeing themselves of the Pains of Grammar Rules, tedious Methods, and the Fallacies of unproved Maxims, may arive early at Truths, may know and be able to discourse things, not senceless Distinctions; and Philosopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, your way, from the visible effects of Nature, may soon know more than the Schools, make their Learning useful, and Bankrupt the Trade of Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: That you have received, Madam, a Tribute of Applause from the Persons of most fame this Age affords; that Universities have done you Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as the Queen of Sciences, will be the least of your Glory, whilest you instruct not them, but the Universe, not this alone, but succeeding Ages; and will have your Fame as oft renewed, as fresh Generations come to spy this World, by the light you leave them; which cannot be traduced, for it's Parentage, being sprung from your Rational Soul alone, that borrowing nought from others, can have no Rivall in Renown, but may challenge that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Honour which all Ingenious Persons publish, and will be made Sacred to your memory, by the most learned, while I among the meanest shall live and dye,</p>

               <p>I have, according to your commands, read your Excellencies Orations, and will not disobey your Excellence, in concealing my Opinion of them. Was it to condemn any thing, either in matter or the language, having your Excellencies Warrant for it, I would freely express it, and if it be otherwise, I beg your Excellencies Favour, that Truth may not pass for Courtship, as being to so great a Lady from so mean a man, it is in danger to be suspected, which your Excellence hath been pleased to foresee and forbid. I am, I confess, no great reader, of late, of new Books, having tried formerly, that to find in them the least Jewel it must be sifted out of a great deal of Rubbish, and the worst is, that their Authors take up Errors upon trust one from another, which the better they adorn with new dresses, the greater injury they do to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. To make up such Volumes out of Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Bees gather Hony from this and that Flower, is rather laborious Industry than fine Wit; But to spin out of one's own Bowels, not Cobwebs as Spiders do, but rich Tissues of Gold and Silver, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a great Fancy well improved, with much thinking. As every man is not capable of so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Productions, so is not every Woman; but that Women are naturally as capable of it as Men, if not more, may easily be proved by making an exact comparison of both their Temperaments and Organs, which would be a discourse too long to be inserted in a Letter, and your Excellence hath so clearly decided that Question by your unimitable Works, that it saves sufficiently that trouble. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56934:42"/>
greatest Masters in Oratory having been necessitated to acknowledge, that the best art consists in hiding of it, it may be inferred, that it is yet better to have none at all, as a natural Amble is to be preferred to that which is got with Tramells, or the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Walking of a Gentleman more esteemed than the affected Demarch of a Dancer: and it is truly a very rare thing to be a great Scholar without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the Universities, and Learned without the help of Teachers. As there is variety of Sciences, so there are several sorts of Capacities to acquire them, some proving excellent in one kind, some in another; but to be capable of all, as well Philosophy as Playes, and Poems as Orations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to a very few, whose Statues should be erected in all the eminent Places in the World, for their Glory, and our Admiration. I can hardly stop my Pen from describing what I have marked in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for to set down my particular Observations, they are of so many extraordinary Things, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Terms (and I am capable of no other) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them to be understood, and I am extreme sensible, that even what is commonly called Defect, here becomes comly, like some Moles in a beautiful Face, and that what seemes strange at first, because it crosses the usual Methods of our Studies, gives at last occasion of amazement, to see your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency go so far in the way of knowledge, with stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still, in a manner, and that others should run continually like Squerils in a Cage, without advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing forwards; which happens, I believe because they dare not, or cannot go one step without Stilts, and your Excellence trusts to the goodness of your Legs, having been pleased to allow me the

               <p>HAd I returned you this Letter of Thanks, for the great Honour you did me in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me your Plays, before I had read them, it would have lookt like a peece of Flattery, and my Praise of you would have made me like a Blind man, who fell in love with a Beauty which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw. But having taken time to read them all over, and some of them more than once, I can now upon a clear Judgement assure your Ladyship, that my entertainment was so great, that I know not whether I read them or saw them Acted. For though the Plots, Acts, and Scenes, be drest in several shapes, and have that which is the life of Pleasure, a musical variety, yet the Wit, and rich Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of them is so much every where the same, that I fancied my self a Spectator in the perusal, and was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56934:43"/>
doubtful, whether your Ladyship with your Book had not sent me the new Theater too. I never in any Dramatick Writings met with more Honour and Virtue matcht with more Sharpness and delight. Which had it come from such a Pen as <hi>Ben Jonson's,</hi> who was always powring Oyle into his Lamp, and owed most of his Excellencies to his laborious Industry and Art, I should the less wonder. But coming from a Quill held by a Ladys Hand, who made it not her Toyl but Recreation to do rarely, confirms me in an Opinion which I have long held, That the best Art is nothing but the best Imitation of Nature; and that your Books are the true face, and others but the painted. Madam, as I look upon you as a great Princess, (for you are so) so that which renders you to be the Glory and happiest of your Sex, is that you can bring forth such Children of your Mind in a Wilderness, and in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Walks can chuse all the Muses to be your Maids of Honour. And, truly, when I consider one part of your happiness more, which is, That you have a Noble Lord to be your Fellow-Poet, whose Harmonious Soul and Wit, is exactly tuned to yours, I have nothing left to wish, but to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to remain</p>

               <p>IN obedience to your Commands sent me by your Servant in his last Letter, I have put your Book of Tales into the Hand of a fit person to translate them into <hi>Latine</hi> as I think either Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity can afford. Being an exact Master of both Languages, and enabled with a <hi>Genius</hi> fit for such an undertaking.

But your Excellent Fancy expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it self sometimes in Terms of Art, and Words only known to Philosophy, he tells me the hardest part of his Task will be how to find out current <hi>Roman</hi> Words to match them.

               <p>I Am very sorry that my unhappy Fate hath necessitated an unbecoming Slowness in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a Favour, that requires all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of Gratitude, and exceeds them. But yet, had I nothing else to say in excuse of my no ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier return to the last Noble effects of your Graces goodness, it were sufficient; That my sence of that mighty Honour was too big for my Pen; and when I began to speak my resentments of it, I found my self as unable to express them, as to deserve their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Bet yet, Madam, this is not all the reason, for I was from home when your Grace's Present came, and have been so almost ever since; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I had not added to my want of merit on other accounts, that also of appearing insensible, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in endeavours of acknowledgment; I must say endeavours, for my Gratitude can rise no higher. Since my receipt of your Grace's ingenious Works, I have, as my occasions would permit, cast my Eyes again into them, and I am sorry they cannot dwell there, where I find so pleasing, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive an entertainment. And though I must crave your Pardon for dissenting from your Grace's Opinion in some things, I admire the quickness, and vigor of your Conceptions, in all: In which your Grace hath this peculiar among Authors that they are, in the strictest sense, your own, your Grace being indebted to nothing for them, but your own happy Wit, and Genius; a thing so uncommon even among the most celebrated Writers of our Sex, that it ought to be acknowledged with wonder in yours. And really, Madam, your Grace hath set
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56934:51"/>
us a patern, that we ought to admire, but cannot imitate. And whereas you are pleased sometimes to mention your being no Scholar, as an excuse of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, your modesty supposeth; By that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment you shew our imperfections that pretend we are so, rather than discover any of your own. </p>
               <p>As for the last Trifle I was bold to present to your Graces Eye, it is much indebted to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging reception you were pleased to afford it; and the re is nothing that sets such a lustre on your Graces great Wit, and Intellectual Perfections, as that sweet candor of your Spirit that renders you so accessible, even to your meanest admirers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your Grace is pleased to object against some part of the design of my Discourse, that it sets the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the sense higher than that of Ratiocination; I humbly desire that your Grace would consider, that there are two sorts of Reasoning, <hi>viz.</hi> Those that the Mind advanceth from its own imbred <hi>Idaea's</hi> and native Store, such are all Metaphysical Contemplations. And those natural researches which are raised from experiment, and the objects of sense. The former are indeed most perfect when they are most abstracted from the grosness of things sensible, but the others are then most compleat when they are most accomodated to them; and when they are not, they are Aery, and Phantastick. Now what I have said about those matters is to tie down the mind in Physical things, to consider Nature as it is, to lay a Foundation in sensible collections, and from thence to proceed to general Propositions, and Discourses. So that my aim is, that we may arise according to the order of nature by degrees from the exercise of our Senses, to that of our Reasons;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56934:52"/>
which indeed is most noble and most perfect when it concludes aright, but not so when 'tis mistaken: And that it may so conclude and arrive to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it must begin in sense: And the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments our reasons have to work on, by so much they are the more likely to be certain in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, and consequently more perfect in their actings. But Madam, I doubt I begin to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore, at present dare add no more, but that I am, </p>

               <p>I Received a fresh obligation from your Grace in the excellent History you were pleased to order for me. In which your Grace hath done right to one of the most Illustrious Hero's of our Age, and erected a lasting Monument to his Virtue. And in it, Madam, your Grace hath sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wonderfully twisted the Faithfulness of an Historian, with the Affections of a Wife; And your Illustrious Lord hath in this an Honour beyond the other great Subjects of History, That his Grace hath not only as much deserved to be Celebrated as they, But hath moreover the happiness of the nearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to an Heroine, whose Pen is as Glorious as his Sword. And 'tis not easy to say which is really the greater Wonder, the Famous Loyalty of that great Person, or the uncommon Excellence of the Pen that described it. But I must take up from a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which, when I have said all I can, I shall be defective; and return to the last Letter wherewith your Grace was pleased to Honour me. For the business of Witches upon which your Grace reflects again in this, I have spoken many things more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it in some Additions to my Considerations, which I am now sending to the Press. As soon as that Discourse is extant, I shall beg your Graces acceptance of it. In the interim those things may be superseded.</p>

As to the rest, I acquiesce in your Grace's Determinations; And whereas your Grace is pleased
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56934:54"/>
to Excuse the liberty of Arguings; 'tis Madam with me that which least of all things needs to be excused. For I profess the largest freedom of Discourse and Inquiry. As for violent and captious Disputes and Oppositions, I indeed much dislike the immodesty, and immoralities of them; But for free and ingenious exchange of the Reasons of our particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 'tis that which discovers Truth, improves Knowledge, and may be so managed as to be no disinterest to Charity.

There is a Discourse of mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon a Subject not very ordinary, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Notions which some excellent Persons have not despised, and are not usually met with in other Writings.

               <p>IT was most fit and equal that as your great Name and Merit transcends the glories of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons; it should be also as singular in its Description; and have an Historian some way proportioned both in Honour and unparallel'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to its self: which just felicity having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to your Grace, by the Pen of your Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princess, it remained that one narrow dialect, should not confine that Relation to this our Island, which was to give Example to the Heroes of all Nations. And now that in this respect also, your Name is happily Consecrated to Eternity, We of this Place, are to look upon it as a signal Honour, to be made Sacrists to it: and to think it a particular Reward of our suffering in that cause, which you so gloriously asserted, and accompanied in its fall, to be judged a proper repository, for the Noblest History of its greatest and most busy transactions, and of the Person most gloriously concerned in them. And certainly while <hi>Oxford</hi> is an University of Loyalty, as well as Learning, which I hope it will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to be, your Graces virtues and atchievements, will be their equal argument of Study, and Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as now your Favours are of their most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recognition and acknowledgment: which in their behalf, with all possible Devotion, are laid at your Graces Feet, by</p>

               <p>IT was my misfortune to be abroad in <hi>Kent</hi> when the Letter wherewith your Grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to Honour me, came to <hi>London.</hi> And therefore as I came late to taste the Pleasure of so high a Favour, I hope your Grace will permit me to plead that delay in excuse of this slow return of my most humble Acknowledgments and Thanks for it. My most Noble Lord (were it not known by experience that great Persons, and great Minds, are most apt to stoop from their own height, and own mean and inconsiderable services offered to them) I should say it was too low a Condescension in your Grace, to take notice of my readiness to comply with your Desires: Wherein (beside the discharge of my Duty) I did likewise serve the ends of my Ambition; it having ever been the Vanity of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to think themselves dignified by the Honours done to their General. This made me with great Delight employ my self in Designing that for your Grace, which I should be sorry to live to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, being already unhappy enough, in Burying too many Princes. For the thing it self I am glad to see the King do that which is so decent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, as to order your Grace a Tomb among the Kings, who have always been so near to him, and who stood up so close to his Father in extremity of Danger, and so bravely, that had not God designed to restore the Crown, in his own Miraculous way, it had certainly been done before by your Hand. However your Grace hath prepared for your self a more Noble, and more lasting Monument, in the Fame of your Heroick Actions, of some of them I

               <p>AMong many other things, by which your Grace is pleased to distinguish your self from other Writers, this seems to be not the least remarkable; that whereas they imploy only their wit, labour, and time, in composing Books, You bestow also great summs of Money in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Yours: and not content to enrich our Heads alone, with your rare Notions, you go higher, and adorn our Libraries, with your elegant Volumes. To that general Charity, which disposeth you to benefit all Mankind, you have added a singular Bounty, whereby you oblige particular Persons: and out of a Nobleness peculiar to your Nature, you cause your Munificence to Rival your Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
               <p>This, <hi>Madam,</hi> among many other your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, Gratitude commands me to acknowledge; Your Grace having been pleased to number me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56934:56"/>
those, whom you vouchsased to honour with such extraordinary Presents. For which I know not how to shew my self duely thankful, otherwise than by celebrating your Generosity, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you some account of the good effects they wrought in me, while I perused them. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Noble End for which you wrote them, and my inability to make you a more proportionate retribution; will not, I hope, be unacceptable to you. To this purpose, therefore, I am bold to send your Grace this rude Paper. Which yet I design, not as a Panegyric of your worth (for what affects us with admiration, strikes us also with dumbness: and Stars are best discerned by their own lustre) but as a short Scheme of my own grateful Sentiments. And if I be not so happy, to deliver them in Language agreeable to the dignity of the Subject, I humbly beseech you to consider, that such occasions offer themselves very rarely; and that nothing is more difficult, than to make the Pen observe <hi>Decorum,</hi> where Reason is put into disorder, Justice, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> requires you should pardon the effects of that astonishment, whereof your Wonders are the cause.</p>
               <p>They tell us, that the End of all Books is either profit, or pleasure: but I think that distinction (as many other in the Schools) might well be spared: because, in truth, profit supposeth pleasure; and pleasure is the greatest profit; nor am I ashamed to profess, that in all my reading I have no other aim but pleasure. It will not then, I hope, <hi>Madam,</hi> be thought derogatory to the Profitableness of your Grace's Books, If I acknowledge my self to have received very great pleasure in reading them. And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56934:57"/>
this pleasure was so charming, it so far transported me, as often to make me wish, you might never entertain a resolution of causing your works to be Translated into any other Language: that so all Ingenious Forreigners, invited by the Fame of your most delightful Writings, might be brought to do Honour to the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, by learning it on purpose to understand them. For I am zealous for the Reputation of my native Language, and of so communicative a temper, as to desire all men should participate of what I find delectable. Besides, I could not but remember, that I had known a great Man of our Nation, who studied <hi>Italian,</hi> only to acquaint himself with the Mathematiques of <hi>Galileo,</hi> in his <hi>Del Movimento,</hi> and <hi>Saggiatore;</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi> meerly out of love to the Incomparable History of <hi>Don Quixot:</hi> and was thereupon the more apt to promise my self that your Grace's Works, no less admirable in their kind, than either of those, would have the like influence upon some of the <hi>Bons Esprits</hi> beyond Sea. But this, <hi>Madam,</hi> was only my Wish: it is not now my Counsel. Should I here particularly recount to you, what the things were, that raised this so great delight in me, I should both offend by prolixity, and tacitly cast disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the rest. For,</p>

                  <hi>Pauperis est, numerare Pecus,</hi>

               <p>He is but poor, who can account his Wealth:</p>
               <p>And what the witty <hi>Roman Stoic</hi> said of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sayings of <hi>Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus</hi> and other Princes of that Sect, may be conveniently accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the delightful Remarks every where occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in your Books, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>no choice can be made,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56934:57"/>
where all things are equally Eminent.</hi> However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no satisfaction in Generals, and that Order is necessary to plainness: give me leave to divide my Text into three parts, your <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> your <hi>Morals,</hi> and your <hi>Poctry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your <hi>NATURAL Philosophy;</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and free, and may be, for ought I know, Excellent: but give me leave, <hi>Madam,</hi> to confess, I have not yet been so happy, as to discover much therein that's <hi>Apodictical,</hi> or wherein I think my self much obliged to acquiesce. But, that may be the the fault of my own dull Brain: and Oracles have been after found true, that were at first Dark and <hi>Enigmatical.</hi> Again I am somewhat slow of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief also; a continual seeker: as conceiving, I have too much cause to be of <hi>Seneca's</hi> opinion, that <hi>Men may, indeed enquire and determine what is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but God alone knows what's true, in the things of Nature.</hi> Nor am I single in this Sceptical Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY</hi> it self (the Tribunal of Philosophical Doctrines) is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution exceedingly strict and rigid in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Theories concerning Nature; no respecter of Persons or Authorities, where Verity is concerned; seldom, or never yielding assent without full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: and that's the Reason why it made choice of these three Words for its Motto, <hi>Nullius in verba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Madam,</hi> can be no discredit to your Philosophy in particular, because common to all others: and he is a bold Man, who dares to exempt the <hi>Physics</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, or of <hi>Democritus,</hi> or <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or any other hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to known. For my part, Seriously, I should be loath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56934:58"/>
to affirm, that they are any other but ingenious Comments of Mens Wits upon the dark and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable Text of the World; plausible Conjectures at best; and no less different, perhaps, from the true History of Nature, than Romances are from the true actions of <hi>Heroes.</hi> Nor will I adventure to determine, which of the two, <hi>Aristotle</hi> or your Grace, hath given us the best definition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul: He, when he calls it <hi>Entelechia;</hi> or you when you say, it is a <hi>Supernatural something, &amp;c.</hi> So difficult is it to make a judgement of what seems incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>Nor are you to be discouraged, <hi>Madam,</hi> If your Philosophy have not the fate to be publickly read in all Universities of <hi>Europe,</hi> as your Grace, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less out of amost Heroic ambition to benefit Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, desires it should. For, while Men are Men, there will be different Interests, and consequently different Opinions: nor is the multitude of Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a certain sign of the Soundness, but of the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of any Doctrine. If, therefore, the World, which is obstinate (you know) and governed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, will not be induced to esteem, what you think useful; the blame lyes not at your Door, and you ought to consolate your self with this reflexion; that you have sufficiently testified your good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and done more than your Duty, in publishing your Conceptions. Befides, the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of our <hi>English</hi> Universities have, of late years, proclamed open War against the tyranny of Dogmatizing in any Art or Science: and as for those of the <hi>Roman Religion;</hi> there is, I fear me, but little hope, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them your Proselites. Because those canting Polititians, called <hi>School-men,</hi> having made a new and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56934:58"/>
party-colour'd Vest for the Church, of a kind of Drugget, consisting of the Thrums of <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Philosophy, cunningly interwoven among the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den threads of the Christian Faith; and prevailed, upon Princes to make it Piacular for any Scholar to appear with his Judgement clad in any other Livery: it is not very unlikely, the Professors there will soon be brought to offend their Superiors, by laying aside the defence of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Maxims, to assume the Patronage of New. So that in my silly conceipt, as the Cabbage is observed to starve the Vine, if set too near: so the Philosophy of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and others of the same mystical Tribe, will hinder the growth of yours, in the same Ground.</p>
               <p>For your <hi>MORAL</hi> Philosophy (for so I take liberty to call your occasional Reflections upon the Actions, Manners, and Fortunes of Men) Your Grace has not, indeed tied up your Pen to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious rules of Method, or the formality of a new Systeme in <hi>Ethics:</hi> but (what is as well) you have opportunely, and under various heads, dispersed many useful remarks, concerning Prudence, as well Civil, as Domestic, in most of your Writings. And this, it may be presumed, you were pleased to do, not for want of Skill to reduce your rules of life into the order of dependence and connexion; but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to shew your plenty, and surprize your Readers with good counsel even where they least expect it. You chose rather to regale us with delicate Fictions, under the veil whereof wholesom instructions are neatly contrived, than to embarass and tire us with the observation ofa long train of Precepts, which are never so effectual, as when naturally flowing from agreeable Instances and Examples. Your very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56934:59"/>
contain adviso's, and your digressions are seasonably instructive: like wise Husbandmen, you plant Fruit-Trees in your Hedge-rows, and set Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries and Rasberries among your Roses and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is a piece of no small art, though not obvious to common Eyes: and if any dislike the course you have taken in thus scattering and disguising your <hi>Morals;</hi> I would have him asked this Question, Whether or no it be folly for a man to refuse to gather Oranges and Citrons, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the trees that offer them, are not ranged in the Order of <hi>Cyrus's Quincunx?</hi> or whether a Nosegay be less fragrant, because pluck'd from Flowers grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dispersedly? To all who have read your <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tales,</hi> with the same purity of Mind, with which you wrote them; and are withal qualified to search into the Mythology of all your imaginary <hi>Dialogues:</hi> to all such, I say, it is evident, that you have drawn the Images of all the <hi>Virtues,</hi> on one hand, and their opposite <hi>Vices,</hi> on the other, so much to the life; that men, beholding them, must be, by grateful violence, compelled to love the Pulchritude of those, and abhor the deformity of these. Now, this, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> you could not have done had you not first had the <hi>Idea's</hi> of all Virtues within your self: it being absolutely necessary for a Painter, first to conceive the form or similitude of the thing he intends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, in his own Imagination; and then to make the resemblance according to that form. So that in strictness of truth, those Pictures we call <hi>Originals,</hi> are but Copies, yea Copies of Copies: as being first drawn from the life in the Phantasy, and after pourtrai'd upon Tables. Besides this, your Grace is further happy, in that the <hi>Morals</hi> of your <hi>Pen</hi> are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56934:59"/>
clearly exemplified in those of your <hi>Life;</hi> in which I have never heard any thing blamed, any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed, unless whether it hath been more <hi>Innocent,</hi> or more <hi>Obliging.</hi> In fine, the Documents of both your <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> seem to be so good, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is able to moderate his Passions, and regulate his Actions by them, needs not to seek further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Happiness:</hi> nor need I fear to pronounce him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at such perfection, that it will not be easy for him to be brought to do ill, either out of <hi>Weakness,</hi> or out of <hi>Design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your <hi>POETRY;</hi> therein your Grace hath more than a single advantage above others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Your Vein appears equally facile, equally free, and copious upon all occasions, in all sorts of arguments. The Buskin and the Sock are equally fit for your Muses Legs. Your Phansy is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to be restrained: Your Invention too nimble to be fettered. Hence it is, that you do not always confine your Sense to Verse; nor your Verses to Rhythme; nor your Rhythme to the quantity and sounds of Sillables. Your Descriptions, Expressions, Similies, Allegories, Metaphors, Epithets, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, all flow in upon you of their own accord, and in full Tides: and Verses stand ready minted in the Treasury of your Brain, as Tears in some Womens Eyes, waiting to be called forth. So that in you is verified the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Io;</hi> that <hi>Poesy</hi> is not a faculty proceeding from judgement, or acquired by labour and industry; but a certain divine Fury, or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> which scorning the controle of Reason, transports the Spirit in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Jove's</hi> Eagle did <hi>Ganymed,</hi> or as Witches are said to be wafted above the Clouds on the wings
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56934:60"/>
of their Familiars. Which is, perhaps, the ground of that old saying, <hi>nemo fit Poeta,</hi> no Poet is made, but born so: as the rage and liberty of a Poetic Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius gave occasion to paint <hi>Pegasus</hi> with Wings, in a flying posture, and without a Bridle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In your whole <hi>Oglio</hi> of Poems, I find nothing which is not intirely <hi>Your own.</hi> Like good Housewifes in the Countrey, you, make a Feast wholly of your own provisions: yea, even the Dressing, Sawces, and Garniture of the Dishes are <hi>Your own.</hi> And were <hi>Perilius Faustinus</hi> revived (he, who out of envy to the Glory of <hi>Virgil,</hi> made and published a large Catalogue of his Thefts from <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi>) he could hardly discover so much as a single Verse borrowed, by you, from any Poet, antient or modern. So circumspect you are to avoid being thought a Plagiary, that you walk not in beaten Paths, but decline even the rules and methods of your Predecessors, and scorn Imitation, as a kind of Theft. A commendation, <hi>Madam,</hi> due to very few, perhaps to none besides your self. As your Grace, therefore, owes all your Poesy to the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your own happy Genius alone; so we owe all the Pleasure we are sensible of in reading your Poems, to you alone. I may have many rivals in these my thankful acknowledgements, you can have no Competitor in the Glory of their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>This double Felicity is augmented by the accession of two others, no less worthy admiration. <hi>One</hi> is, that as you have made your self an <hi>Original,</hi> so are you likewise secure from being <hi>Copied.</hi> You have indeed, given the world an illustrious Example; but you have given what it cannot take, the Example
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56934:60"/>
being of that height, that it is hardly attainable. You provoke our Emulation, and at the same time cast us into despair. Your Poetical Fancies rather brave, than instruct our capacities: and by setting before our Eyes things inimitable, you vex our ambition, and oblige us to an unprofitable trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another</hi> is, that you exceed all of your delicate Sex, not only in this age, but in all ages past. It would puzle the best Historian to find your Parallel among the most famous Women: and in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatness, even while that Glorious Nation held the Empire as well of Virtue and Wit, as that of the World, I cannot meet with an <hi>Heroine,</hi> to whom I dare to compare you. There are, I confess, who tell us of a Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, one <hi>Sulpitia,</hi> who composed a History of <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's</hi> times, in Hexametre Verses, and wrote many Elegant Poems besides; and who hath been highly celebrated by <hi>Martial, Tibullus, Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> and of late by <hi>Scaliger</hi> also, as an eminent Pattern both of a Chast and Immaculate Life, and of a neat Poetical Wit: and once I had some thoughts of drawing a Parallel betwixt that Lady and your Grace. But, upon a second examination of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remarks, wherein I had fansied the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance chiefly to consist; and a more serious review of the Story of her Life, and the remains of her Pen, (extant among the <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Latine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi> and usually annexed to <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi>) I perceived, I could not proceed in that resolution, without disadvantage on your part, by a conference so unequal; and thereupon resumed my former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, that your Grace's Statue ought to be placed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56934:61"/>
alone, and at the upper end, in the <hi>Gallery of Heroic Women,</hi> and upon a Pedestal more advanced than the rest. We read not that Nature hath been so Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of her choicest Largesses, as to produce two <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's,</hi> or two <hi>Virgil's,</hi> or two <hi>Ben Johnson's:</hi> why, then, should we seek after your Equal? It was their glory to be single: and it must be yours, to have no Peer, for ought we know, you are the <hi>First</hi> great Lady, that ever Wrote so much and so much of your own: and, for ought we can divine, you will also be the <hi>Last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, <hi>Madam,</hi> are a few of those swarms of thoughts that crowded into my unquiet Head, when I proposed to my self to express some part at least of the great Honour and Reverence I owe your Grace. If I have so far obeyed the impulse of my Gratitude and Devotion, as to put them into Words, and offer them to your knowledge; it was not, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, out of a vain conceipt, that they were answerable either to your vast Merits, or to my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; but meerly upon Confidence, you would descend to exercise your Goodness and Candor, in receiving them as a simple recognition of both. And if I have suppressed the rest; it was out of good Manners, and a due fear of farther offending your Patience. I am not ignorant, <hi>Madam,</hi> that our Prayers to God, and our Addresses to Princes ought to be short. Resigning you, therefore, to the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own more ingenious and useful thoughts, and to the Tranquill Fruition of those intellectual pleasures, that continually spring up in you from the Virtues of your Life, and the Fame of your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; I most humbly beg your favourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56934:61"/>

               <p>I Owe it to your <hi>Graces</hi> singular condescention, and goodness, that my Letters are not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and I see a great deal of Generosity, in your <hi>Graces</hi> acceptance, of such mean things, as my slender stock of Knowledge can impart. As for your Inquiry about the Plastick Faculties; I Answer, that they are those, whereby the Body is formed at first, and by which the Alimental Juices, are after, through the whole course of Life, orderly distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the purposes of growth and nutrition: But whether, as your <hi>Grace</hi> inquires, they are Faculties inherent, in the Soul, or are only Mechanical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56934:64"/>
of the Body I cannot determine certainly. But I rather incline to the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who will have the Soul to be the Bodies Maker, and they affirm (as is ordinary; though with some diversity in the Names and Presentation) That there are three sorts of Faculties, which they Phancy as Analogous parts, or Regions in the Soul, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The <hi>Mind,</hi> so they call the highest Faculties of abstract Reason, and Understanding, which is the <hi>First.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> they call the <hi>Soul, (Viz.)</hi> as it is united to the Body, and exerciseth the operation of Sense. The <hi>Third,</hi> is the Image of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that are called Plastical, that move and turn the Body, but are devoid of Understanding, or Sense; Now how the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is Immaterial, can manage and order Corporeal Motions is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of which Philosophy as yet hath given no account, as I have particularly taken notice, and proved in my <hi>Sceptis Scientifica,</hi> but yet the thing ought not therefore to be denied, because the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the most obvious sensible things is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; And by this we can only prove, that we have yet nocertain Theory of Nature: And, in good earnest, Madam, all that we can hope for, as yet, is but the History of things as they are, but to say how they are, to raise general <hi>Axioms,</hi> and to make <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> must, I think, be the happy priviledge of succeeding Ages; when they shall have gained a larger account of the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> which yet are too scant and defective to raise Theories upon: so that to be ingenious and confess freely, we have yet no such thing as Natural Philosophy; Natural History is all we can pretend to; and that too, as yet, is but in its Rudiments, the advance of it your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56934:64"/>
                  <hi>Grace</hi> knows is the design and business of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> from whom we may reasonably at last expect better grounds for general Doctrines, than any the World yet hath been acquainted with; but this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is an excursion. I therefore return to your <hi>Graces</hi> Letter, which inquires some things, about my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Souls</hi> Original: As to this I would not be understood to affirm peremptorily a thing, which the greatest part of Men, neither have, nor can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, only I consider it as an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that may be taken up to satisfy those minds that are much troubled at the seeming inequalities of Providence; and whether true, or false, this I will take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be confident in, That the Doctrine of the <hi>Souls Praeexistence,</hi> doth best suit with the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World. And best Answers for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice and Goodness, in all the affairs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; In this Madam, I am a little <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and this step further, I think I may take, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty; That the Doctrine hath so much to say for it self, from Reason, and the highest Antiquity, as to render it fit to be considered, and indeed, since the two other wayes, are confessedly desperate, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there should be no harm in examining this; which is all I pretend to. But particularly to your <hi>Grace's Quaery,</hi> Whether were <hi>Souls</hi> Created or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created? I Answer, no doubt Created: But then I do not see how that follows, which your <hi>Grace</hi> is pleased to infer, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Sin was then Created, For our <hi>Souls</hi> in their State were Spotless and Innocent, as the Angels of God. That Mankind was so first, and fell by a voluntary Transgression, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine; and how we may suppose it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the way of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> your <hi>Grace</hi> will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56934:65"/>
see easily, when I shall have procured that Book of mine, I have mentioned, and promised your <hi>Grace,</hi> but cannot yet light on. The other part also of your <hi>Graces</hi> Division: <hi>Viz.</hi> That if those <hi>Souls</hi> were Eternal, they are Gods; is I humbly conceive a mistake likewise, since though the World, had been Created from Eternity (which even the Schools confess possible) it had nevertheless been a Creature, by reason of its dependence upon another, for its being, and to have been produced, and yet from Eternity, is no absurdity, our Faith affirms it, in the Eternal Generation of the Son, and Procession of the Holy-Ghost, and to take an instance with which we may make more bold: If the Sun had been from Eternity no doubt it would have shone E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and yet it's Beams had been effects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; And whereas your <hi>Grace</hi> saith again, That what is Immaterial is a God: I must here also take the boldness, to enter my Dissent to your Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; Indeed Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> denys all Immateriality to Created Beings, but I think upon grounds preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unsafe, That our <hi>Souls</hi> are Immaterial in their Natures, hath been sufficiently proved by some late Philosophers; particularly by the most learned Dr. <hi>H. Moore,</hi> and I also have done something about this, in my Book of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> If your <hi>Grace</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my Reasons; they shall be ready at the least intimation, of those commands which I shall ever account a singular Honour to observe. For the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> which your <hi>Grace</hi> rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, to be no certain Argument of the truth of it, I humbly say I have not alledged it, for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the thing, but to take off the prejudice we are apt to have against all supposed Novelties,

and to shew that it is not so despicable, an <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> but that several great minds of former times, even in the Ages of the best Antiquity have owned a kindness for it, and consequently that we cannot, without some immodesty, deny it a favourable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, But madam, I forget my self, and the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I ought to have of your <hi>Grace's</hi> Time and Patience, and therefore only add, that I am,</p>

Indeed <hi>Madam,</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity finds her self oppressed herein with so many Obligations in one, that She knows not where to begin her Acknowledgments; as considering, that not only her Repositories are dignified to be the Cabinet of so rich a Jewel, but that She is singled out by your Excellency, and valued above the rest of the World for her Approbation, and (as your Excellency pleases to stile it) to be a Judge of it. Alas, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that is an Office we dare not assume, not only without censure of Arrogance, but even of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; for seeing that every one is to be judged by their Peeres, who shall undertake to be Judge of that that hath no Peer? We may see other things by the Light, but to perceive the Light it self we cannot call for another Light; so neither may this gallant Work be Judged but by its own Innate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the splendor it self carrys in it. No, <hi>Madam,</hi> 'tis Honour enough for us that we are taught by it, we will not usurp upon it; and shall count it our Pride and not our Shame to be out-done by so Transcendent an Example. We acknowledge that we are become instructed in the Sciences which our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56934:69"/>
selves profess; <hi>Philosophy, Oratory, Physick, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,</hi> we write them over our Doors, but we find them herein at a farr cheaper rate sent home to those Doors, and that by a hardiness of Invention which your Excellency first hath shewed unto the World, and that an easy one too, by sending us to that common and neglected Mistress, even Nature her self, to whose Benignity if we would confide (as your Excellency hath done) we should make far greater Progresses in the ways of Knowledge and Wisdom (as likewise your Excellency hath done) than through all the tedious Disciplines wherewith we are detained and vexed in our rugged Nurseries. Two things do justly leave us, <hi>Madam,</hi> under a surprize and admiration of your Excellencies great Production; First, that it should proceed from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of so high Honour and Fortune; for Ignorance in such things as those is appointed by the World unto such Estates, and thought a kind of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive belonging unto Wealth: And next, that it should proceed from a Sex unaccustomed to, and commonly excused from such painful and elevated Inquisitions. For (as your Excellency hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) men do assign to your Sex nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Trifles for their Portion, and under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Courtship do confine them in their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to some inferiour Qualities, and so in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but to a kind of delicate Barbarism: But herein your Excellency hath shew'd great Courage in breaking through that Obstruction, and by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male and unusual Chevalry have rescued your whole Nation and Sex from the oppression and injury in this point, and of that great Giant, the World. For our part of your University, we must needs sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56934:69"/>
to your Excellencies judgment herein, for 'tis the <hi>Muses</hi> were esteemed our best Genius's and Sciences did choose unto themselves for their Deities not Patrons but Patronesses: and our Corporation of Learning, though it consist all of Men, yet when we would express it in the Abstract and in Picture we represent it by a Woman. And in fine, my self, <hi>Madam,</hi> (who am allowed the Honour to be the Custos of your immortal Donary) must be obliged to borrow from a Womans Eloquence exemplified in the Work it self, whereby to express worthily the Resentments due unto it by those that have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed me, and particularly mine own, who am,</p>

               <p>EVer since I had the happiness to see any of your Graces most ingenious Writings, I have felt a mighty Desire to speak my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular gratitude for those singular Composures to all which the World is obliged; And had attempted something towards it more than three years since, but that my acknowledgments miscarried in the way. I am, <hi>Madam,</hi> an Admirer of Rarities, and your Grace is really so great an one, that I cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

I am sensible it can contribute nothing to your Graces great stock of Fame to be acknowledged by inconsiderable Persons; But yet we must be just, and 'tis Religion to celebrate the Virtuous. And I know your Grace is too generous to contemn the offerings of the meanest Devoto's, upon the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of which Belief I am bold to beg Favour and acceptance for a Trifle of mine that was designed for your Grace, as soon as it saw the Light, but could not find it's way into the <hi>North.</hi> I should not have the confidence to present so mean a thing to so deep and Sagatious a Judgement, had I not an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your Graces Candor and Goodness, equal to my apprehension of your other Celebrated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and these are so Illustrious and so great, that our Sex would envy, did they not admire, and your own too, <hi>Madam,</hi> were they not universally concerned in the Honour. For your Grace hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the World, by a great instance, that Women may be Philosophers, and, to a Degree fit for the Ambitious emulation of the most improved Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Spirits.</p>

               <p>THe greatest Favour I could have expected in Answer to my boldness, was but a pardon for the confidence of that intrusion; But that your Grace should so generously accept my Trifles, and make me so Glorious a return as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your most ingenious Letters, this, <hi>Madam,</hi> was an Honour as much beyond my expectation, as desert; and exceeds all my possibilities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. But if ever any thing happen within the reach of my indeavours, by which I may serve or gratify your Grace, I shall then give evidence of the great resentment I have of this condescention, and the Veneration which is due to a Person of so obliging and so unusual a Virtue. Your Grace, I know, is Nobly inquisitive, and hath a rich stock of generous Apprehensions; and Persons of this Character use to be pleased in the persual of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of others Conceptions; And on this account I presume, that those notions I sometimes entertain my self with, may not be unacceptable, being not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the road and common track. And if your Grace please to permit, and pardon my Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I shall take occasion to give you my sense of some things that are not of the meanest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the present I am obliged to answer the particulars of your Grace's Letter, in which your Grace hath very much obliged me by those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you are pleased to excuse; and to them I make this humble return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereas your Grace calls the Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the belief of Witches, <hi>probable Arguments,</hi> I am apt, with submission, to think some of them to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56934:71"/>
be as great demonstrations as matter of Fact can bear; being no less than the evidence of the Senses, and Oaths of sober Attestors, and the critical inquiries of Sagacious, and suspitious Persons; which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Evidence, your grace knows, some of those Relations have to prove them. And there is a particular Story which is sufficiently famous, and of part of which I my self was a Witness, which I think is not subject to just Exception. 'Tis that of the Drum in the House of Mr. <hi>Mompession</hi> of <hi>Tedworth</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire.</hi> Of this, <hi>Madam,</hi> I shall take an occasion to give your Grace a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if you have not yet been acquainted with the circumstances of that unusual disturbance. But to confine my self now to your Grace's considerations on the subject; The second thing I observe, is,</p>
               <p>The intimation of an Argument against the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of Witches, because <hi>they are not mentioned by Christ, and his Apostles,</hi> concerning which I humbly desire your Grace to consider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Negative Arguments from Scripture use not often to be of any great signification or validity. Our Saviour spake as he had occasion, and the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of what he said, or what he did, is not recorded, as one Evangelist intimates. He said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of those large unknown Tracts of <hi>America,</hi> gives no intimations of the Existence of that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, much less any instructions about their Conversion. He gives no particular account of the affairs and state of the other World, but only that general one, of the happiness of some, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of others. He makes no discovery of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi> of Art, or Nature, no not of those whereby the propagation of the Gospel might have been
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56934:71"/>
much advanced; <hi>viz.</hi> The Mystery of <hi>Printing,</hi> and the <hi>Magnet.</hi> And yet no one useth his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in these Instances as an Argument against the being of things, which are the evident Objects of Sense. I confess the omission of some of these particulars is pretty strange and unaccountable, and an argument of our Ignorance of the Reasons and Menages of Providence, but I suppose of nothing else; or if it were, I crave leave to add,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Gospel is not without intimations of Sorcery, and contracts with evil Spirits. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Jews</hi> said our Saviour did his Miracles by their assistance, <hi>He casts out Devils by</hi> Beezebub. And he denys not the supposition or possibility of the thing in general, but clears himself by an appeal to the Actions of their own Children, whom they would not so severely criminate. And besides this,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apostles had intimations plain enough of the being of Sorcery and Witchcraft, as seems to me evident from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Rev,</hi> 22.15.</p>
               <p>'Tis very true as your Grace suggests, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Ignorance of Causes make Men many times to impute the Effects of Art, and Nature, to Witchcraft and Diabolick Contract. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People think God, or the Devil to be in every thing extraordinary. But yet, <hi>Madam,</hi> your Grace may please to consider, That there are things done by mean and despicable persons, transcending all the Arts of the most knowing and improv'd <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and above all the Essays of known and ordinary Nature. So that we either must suppose that a sottish silly old Woman hath more knowledge of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56934:72"/>
the intrigues of Art, and Nature, than the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised Artists, and Philosophers, or confess that those strange things they performe, are done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederacy with evil Spirits, who, no doubt, act those things by the ways and applications of Nature, though such as are to us unknown. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is, I conceive, as much as is necessary to be said to the Argumentative part of your Graces excellent Letter.</p>
               <p>As for the following Periods, I am mostly of the same Opinion with your Grace, in the way that I understand them. Nature is in a continual motion (for there is no such thing as Rest in the World) and perhaps that is not purely Mechanical, but may, in great part (at least as to the beginnings and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it) be ascribed to the Soul of the World, which possibly is the great <hi>Archeus</hi> that formes Plants, Animals, and other more curious <hi>Phoenomena.</hi> And there is no doubt but (as your Grace suggests) that much wickedness is caused by the meer impulse of Lower Nature; and I believe several Men are determined to Actions of Vice by the odness of their particular make and contexture. But whereas your Grace saith that nothing but God himself can be perfect, I cannot so well understand that. <hi>Absolutely so, and in all kinds,</hi> 'tis true, I grant it, but your Grace doth not seem to intend the proposition in that sense. And to be Perfect in a lower kind is but to have all the parts and faculties that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to such a being, in that order, disposition, and all other circumstances which are suitable to its <hi>Idea,</hi> and proper for its respective ends. And in this sense I think all things are perfect in their first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; according to what your Grace saith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56934:72"/>
That [God cannot create any Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being absolute Perfection himself] which appositely fits mine, but I can not see how it so well consists with your Graces former assertion, except it be intended to infer, <hi>That God made nothing;</hi> a Proposition which methinks your Grace should not own; but some things that follow seem to look that way, when you are pleased to say [Neither can I conceive how God could actually make or act any thing, either in a Mechanical manner, or a Free, being not locally moving] To which I humbly say that if your Grace doubts the possibility of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation out of nothing, I think I can speak some things as a Philosopher, that may render it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable. Nor is actual motion in the Deity neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to his actions, since he is Immense and needs not local motion to render him present by his Essence, or his Virtue, to any place of the great Universe, being Eternally there by the Infinity of his being, and his Power. And whereas your Grace is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say, that God is no Mechanick, I consent that He is not so properly, in that he needs not material Instruments to act by. But yet he hath made all things by a kind of Geometry; in Number, Weight, and Measure, saith the <hi>Holy Oracle.</hi> And there is a sort of Mathematics in all the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have made bold with your <hi>Graces</hi> Patience, in confidence of your Candor, and your goodness, which I implore, for the Pardon of this Voluminous Trouble. And in order to it, I have this to say, that I could not well have said less without having been wanting in some of your <hi>Graces</hi> Periods; and there is something else, in which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56934:73"/>
I despair of being ever able to say enough, and that is, to express how much I am,</p>

               <p>I Well know that the Generous never propose to themselves any other End of their Favours, besides Content, which necessarily results from the pursuance of their own Noble Inclinations, but only the Benefit of the Persons, upon whom they choose to confer them: and that therefore they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally select such Subjects, whereon to exercise their Beneficence, that seem more likely to husband it, by a silent Devotion, and modest Acknowledgment, than to abuse it, by attempting a Retribution. And this, <hi>Madam,</hi> both teacheth and assureth me; that though the Favour you were pleased to do me, in sending me one of your admirable Books, newly published, under the Elegant and most accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Title of <hi>The WORLDS OLIO;</hi> be so eminent an one, as to require from me a more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Expression of my Gratitude, than either my Wit, or Fortune, or Interest can ever be able to make: yet none can be more acceptable to you,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56934:73"/>
than this, <hi>That I intend ever to continue your Debtor.</hi> So much, therefore, I here solemnly profess; and most faithfully promise you, that I never will, so much as in a wish for a Capacity of Retaliation, prophane the Freedom of the Obligation your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness moved you to lay upon me.</p>
               <p>But, not to state the Particulars of my Debt, at least in brief; might give you just cause to suspect, that I understand not the Value of what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I say you have benefited me in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;</hi> in that you have declared me capable of so singular an Honour, as to be in the number of those Persons, whom you thought worthy to receive so rich a Present, from so Noble a Hand. For me to have sat among the Multitude, whom your Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner invites to feast upon your <hi>OLIO,</hi> had been proportionable enough to the degree of so ordinary a Judgement, as mine: but to be among those few, whom your self had nominated for your Chief Guests, was a Grace infinitely above my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have benefited my <hi>Understanding;</hi> in that your <hi>Philosophical Phancies</hi> have furnished me with variety of such Novel Conceipts, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sundry the most difficult Problems in Nature; as that if my Memory be but faithful enough to retain them, I shall never be unprovided of somwhat that is poynant and grateful, to entertain Curiosity withall: and whenever my own Reason is at a loss, how to investigate the Causes of some Natural Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56934:74"/>
or other, I shall relieve the Company with some one pleasant and unheard of Conjecture of yours. So that by reading of your <hi>Philosophy,</hi> I have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus much of advantage; that where I cannot Satisfy, I shall be sure to Delight: which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than I dare promise from any other Discourses of the same Title; in so much as they generally leave the Mind in a kind of Anxiety and Regret, when ever they fail to afford it Satisfaction. And, certainly, if it be (as some hold) reasonable to allow, that the Fictions of Poets, and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists do usually take as strong hold of mens Minds, and Charm their Affections as powerfully, as the most Authentique Narrations of Historians; though the Reader well understands the Passages related by these, to be certain Truths, and the adventures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by Those, to be meerly Imaginary; and this, because Delight is equal on both sides: if this, I say, be justifiable, that man can run but little hazard of his Judgement, who shall affirm, that your Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Fayeries in the Brain, and of our Thoughts being their Consults and Suggestions; and your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Fayeries digging for Stones in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Teeth, to repair their decay'd Tenements in the Head, is the Cause of the Tooth-ach; are as worthy the hearing, as the most solid demonstrative Theory of any Philosopher whatever; insomuch as these may yield both as high and lasting a Delight as that. I say Delight as High and Lasting; for, to speak my Thoughts clearly, the Pleasure that ariseth from the comprehension of the most perfect and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Demonstration in <hi>Geometry,</hi> I never could find, either in height or duration, much to exceed that, which I have sometime been affected withall,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56934:74"/>
at the recital of a Facetious Poetical Extravagancy, of which I had not afore heard. Nor do I believe, that the Raptures, and Exultations of <hi>Don Quixot</hi> were much inferior to that famous one of <hi>Archimed,</hi> which transported him out of himself, as well as out of the Bath, into a loud Exclamation, <hi>I have found it, I have found it.</hi> And the Reason of this Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be well enough thought, to consist chiefly in the unsatisfiedness of our Nature, which always hurrying our Minds on to Novelties, causeth us to put an equally cheap rate upon all things we think already in the possession of our Understanding; and to value acquest of a fresh, though perhaps useless, and absurd Opinion, above the calm fruition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and irregular Maxims. But, this <hi>(Madam)</hi> being a Paradox, ought to have more room, than can be spred in a Letter, whose design'd Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Thankfulness: and besides, should I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture further, to avouch it, the same could not but much redound to my disadvantage; insomuch as it might render me suspected for something of a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and consequently incapable of the Honour and Pleasure of sometimes attending you, and hearing your more than ingenious Discourses. For as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in one of your Prefaces, or Epistles to your Readers, you have been pleased expresly to declare; <hi>That you never Conversed, so much as one Hour, with any Philosopher, or Professed Scholar, in your whole Life:</hi> and that, doubtless, must have proceeded from your constant Aversion to such blunt Company; not from your want of opportunities to hear what they could say. Because, being always Educated among the Noblest, and most Knowing Persons of our Nation; you could hardly escape the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56934:75"/>
of the most Learned in all the Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; unless you purposely withdrew your self from their Society, or shut your Ears against their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> among those, who have perused your Writings, I meet with a sort of Infidels, who refuse to believe, that you have alwayes preserved your self so free from the Contagion of Books, and Book-men. And the Reason they give me, is this; that you frequently use many Terms of the Schools, and sometimes seem to have Imp'd the Wings of your high-flying Phansy with sundry Feathers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Universities, or Nests of <hi>Divines, Philosophers, Phisicians, Geometricians, Astronomers,</hi> and the rest of the Gowned Tribe. For instance, of <hi>Divines,</hi> when you speak of <hi>Praedestination, Free will, Transubstantiation, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> when you mention <hi>Quantity, Discrete</hi> and <hi>Continued,</hi> the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> and <hi>First Matter, Attoms, Elements, Motion, Dilatation,</hi> and <hi>Contraction, Rarefaction,</hi> and <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, Meteors, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Physicians,</hi> when you distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of <hi>Choler, Phlegme, Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and speak of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> of <hi>Venricles</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Brain,</hi> of <hi>Veins, Arteries,</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> and expatiate upon <hi>Fevers, Apoplexies, Convulsions, Droqsies,</hi> and divers other Diseases, with their particular Causes, Symptoms, and Cures: Of <hi>Geometricians,</hi> when you touch upon <hi>Triangles, Squares, Circles, Diameters, Circumferences, Centres, Lines,</hi> streight and crooked, and their proportions each to other, and that invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Problem, the <hi>Quadrature of the Circle:</hi> Of <hi>Astronomers,</hi> when you speak of the <hi>Horizon, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, Aequator, Zodiack, Ecliptick, Tropicks, Poles of the World,</hi> and of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and in a manner
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56934:75"/>
run over the whole Doctrine of the Sphere, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the model of the Universe, and cast some transitory glances also upon the Doctrine Theorical concerning the Motions of the Orbs, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. Nor can I, indeed, hope to dissolve the stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these mens unbelief; untill I shall be better able to convince them, that all these Scholastical Terms and Notions may be brought into the World with us, and afterwards drawn forth of the Soul, by solitary Meditation, and the labour of ones own Thoughts; and are not rather instilled into it, and imprest upon it, by often Hearing, or Reading the Discourses of others, who profess those Arts and Sciences to which they belong, and for the more plain and methodical teaching whereof, they were first Invented and Recorded. But I fear me, while I insist thus particularly upon the Reason alleadged by these men, in defence of their Diffidence; I may fall into the same danger, for the avoidance of which, I even now left my Paradox destitute of Assertion: and therefore I lay by that subject, and take up another more opportune and considerable, as to the discharge of my Duty, and confessing how many wayes you have obliged me.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge, therefore, in the last place; that my <hi>Affections</hi> must own you for their Benefactress. For those many Moral Apothegms, and Satyrical Remarques upon the Manners of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which you have frequently inspersed upon the Leaves of your Book, are so pathetically delivered, and with such vigour of proper and familiar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage press'd home to the Bosome of every man; as that that person must be irrecover ably lost in the darkness of Vice, who doth not, through thhm, clearly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56934:76"/>
discern the Lustre and Amiableness of Virtue, and thereupon instantly abominate his former Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and become your perfect Proselite. When a Young, Noble, Beautiful, Witty, and Sprightly Lady, one on whom all the Pleasures of the World seem to be Enamoured, and in throngs offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be accepted and commanded by her; when such an one, I say is heard to Preach up <hi>Temperance, Abstinence, Modesty, Chastity, Solitude,</hi> and the suppression of all irregular sensual Appetites. What <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> is there, who must not blush at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Vicious Acts, and being convinced, that the delights of a Soul, well ordered according to the rules of Virtue and Honour, are infinitely more charming and desirable, than the most magnified Pleasures of the Body, swimming in an Ocean of Luxury, and Laciviousness; firmly resolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, thenceforth to seek for Felicity, not in the short Titillations and Blandishments of the Senses, but in the Purity and constant Serenity of the Mind. Is it possible, that any of our Ladies, should retain her pretences of <hi>Platonick Love,</hi> or continue the practise of her petty Arts of Daubing and Painting, of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, Medisanse, and Detraction: after she hath once read your smart Invectives against them, and solid Arguments to shew, that they may all be justly suspected for Bawds to procure and conceal the fruition of that Pleasure, which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the admiring conversation of Souls, but in the close Conjunction of Bodies, and the satisfaction of that rank Appetite of the Flesh, commonly called Lust? In a word; what Sex, Age, Constitution, Condition is there, whose most secret Ulcers, the sharpness of your Wit and Pen hath not launced
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56934:76"/>
open to the bottom; and afterward prescribed most easy and certain Remedies for the Cure of them? So that I may well conclude this Paragraph with saying that your Moral Essayes contain wise Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts enough in them, for the Reformation of the Age we live in, and that, certainly, is so bad that no Man need ever fear a worse.</p>
               <p>And, now, Incomparable <hi>Madam,</hi> having done my Homage to you, in token of what I hold by the tenure of your Wit and Bounty, it remains, that I humbly beg your Pardon for the rude and tedious manner of it. And that, I hope, you will grant me, when you have considered, that the Devotion may be sincere, where the Ceremonies are imperfect; and I have assured you, that I will never omit to pay you those Dues of Thanks, and constant Observance, that belong to you, from me, as one whom your Goodness hath made,</p>

               <p>SEeing your <hi>Graces</hi> singular Genius, hath long since been experienced, and fully discovered to us; for such as is both accomplish'd with all various Learning, and furnished with a Native Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie; that for its high abilities, it is able; and for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56934:77"/>
its eminent Candor, it usually obtains infinitely upon the favourers of Learning: We obliged on both these accounts, were unwilling to incurr so great a Crime, as not chearfully to Consecrate to your <hi>Grace,</hi> these our Acknowledgments, as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Eternal Observance. Your <hi>Graces</hi> goodness having this, peculiar and above others, that 'tis neither forced by Solicitations of Friends, nor Importunities of Petitions, but voluntary and of its own accord flowes out, and delivers it self. Truely every more than ordinary Spirit is powerfully drawn out to what is like it self, invites, embraceth, and preserves, whatever bears the name of any kind of Excellency, as allyed to it. But how truely Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent is this of your <hi>Grace,</hi> that the Arts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by your <hi>Graces</hi> Example, are render'd more August and Venerable? How shall future Ages stoop under the weight of your <hi>Graces</hi> Fame, that your <hi>Grace</hi> in that Nobility of Extract, and conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Fortune, should yet outvie in the Methods of Learning, even those, whose necessities must prompt them to diligence? Wherein your <hi>Grace</hi> hath made so happy a progress, that never any can more appear, a Devotist to, or Proficient in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: so that your <hi>Graces</hi> teeming Brain is ever bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth some new Miracle: and though a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet hath merited the Diadem of Learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men; though a Courtier, yet before the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks: In a word, wherein any one, is in any thing Excellent, yet is your <hi>Grace</hi> in that thing far more excellent. Nor can we believe, that any mortal Man, no not your <hi>Grace</hi> our Princess (with your <hi>Graces</hi> Pardon) can from Natures instinct, or humane strength be excited and raised to so manifold
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56934:77"/>
and profound Speculations. It must necessary, be that that most capacious Soul of your <hi>Grace,</hi> expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating it self so far into all sorts of Learning, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired; that almost Infinite Comprehension of so many and so great Notions informes us, how great a measure of the Heavenly Spirit hath possest your <hi>Grace;</hi> and that no single Deity hath enlarged this one Soul unto the Immense Tracts of all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. With these happy Omens hath your <hi>Grace</hi> reached unto, whatever in the Arts seemed good unto your <hi>Grace</hi> when some Diviner <hi>Genius</hi> of your <hi>Grace</hi> our Princess, judged the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any clear Truth, would be beneficial. And whereas it was your <hi>Graces</hi> Work, not to give Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but Magisterially to Prononce, as from an Oracle; (yet such is your <hi>Graces</hi> condescention) that all your <hi>Graces</hi> Tenets are asserted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with most Cogent Arguments: as if we did not owe a Belief, and had not a certain Devotion obliging our Assent to your <hi>Graces</hi> bare Assertion. Henceforth therefore do we Destine our spare hours unto these kinds of Studies, and are reaching unto the perfection of Philosophy, seeing your <hi>Grace</hi> hath judged these Speculations such as are worthy your <hi>Graces</hi> Intentions, and nearer <hi>Approximations:</hi> for such an happy clearness of Wit shall render every theng discoverable and fully to be comprehended, and that most free inclinination of your <hi>Graces</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor will communicate every thing discovered to your <hi>Graces Cantabrigians.</hi> Yet lest we should give our selves up to unworthy Ease, and Consecrate our selves to Sloth, your <hi>Grace</hi> hath left us one very difficult Task, namely Thankfulness. Forasmuch then, through your <hi>Graces</hi> Labours, <hi>Minerva's</hi>

                  <l>Into a mortal Body here below,</l>
                  <l>Aspiring restlesly like Fire and Flame</l>
                  <l>To mount again to th'Sphere from whenc it came,</l>
                  <l>So nobly active as it doth by Truth,</l>

                  <l>T'acquit my self, o'th Crime of Flattery:</l>
                  <l>'Tis an Ambition above mortal state,</l>
                  <l>And Mind with Glory never satiate,</l>
                  <l>Without which Glory and Ambition</l>

                  <l>Would be content to die that that might live.</l>
                  <l>But now I'll tell what my opinion is</l>
                  <l>Of Fame (and pardon if I Judge amiss:)</l>
                  <l>Fame's but a shadow of great action,</l>
                  <l>And but the <hi>Eccho</hi> of't when we are gone,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>A Name! All Poetry is mute to hear it,</l>
                  <l>This hardest Marble here doth sweat to bear it.</l>
                  <l>And did not yet the Sacred Ashes live,</l>

                  <l>We could not know that here enclosed lies,</l>

                  <l>Amongst the many Wonders which she writ.</l>
                  <l>If out of those thou canst not spell and frame</l>

                  <l>'Tis Treason against Wit for any one</l>
                  <l>To speak her name at length, but him alone:</l>
                  <l>Seeing in him, and him alone, we find</l>
                  <l>Whatever she of Wit hath left behind.</l>

                  <l>Of all that Nature in one piece can show;</l>
                  <l>Wit might seem larger whil'st in Two it shone,</l>
                  <l>'Tis stronger now contracted into One.</l>
                  <l>VVhilst by his Curtesy she had ingros'd</l>
                  <l>So much, the honour of our Sex seem'd lost:</l>
                  <l>Wit was <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> when One in Twain;</l>
