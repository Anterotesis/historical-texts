            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ADVERTYSEMENT to the Reader, Occasioned by the never enough lamented death of my deare freind the Authour of this Fresh suite.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nderstand Christian Reader, that with the comming forth of this booke into the light, the learned and famous Authour D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ames left the light, or darknes rather of this world. His name for diverse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (not needfull here to be recited) hath been hitherto concealed, and that which generally was but imagined before, (viz. that the Repl. and this fresh suit to D. B. Rejoynder) to be his work, now it is certainly known to be his, that none need to doubt therof. It pleadeth trueth succinctly, yet perspicuously, and with sinewy Answeres to B.M. and D. B. poore Sophisms, as indeed his veinc in all his writings and discourses did most admirably lead him to do. Concerning this matter, I may not keep back what I heard him speake as in the sight of God, that he was in his conscience more perswaded of the evill of these reliques of Popery and monuments of that superstition then ever, and yet he never had seen good in them, or come from them: and that moreover if
<pb facs="tcp:245:3"/>
D. B. or any other of them would yet be daubing with suntempered mortar, and not give over to paint rotten sepulchres, he was by the grace of God resolved still to maintain the cause, and while he liued never let fall the uit commenced this way, not that he sought victorie to himselfe, no; That trueth might returne out of the feild with conquest was the highest pitch of his ambition. And though this worthy of the Lord be with us no more, yetGod (I trust) who is rich in mercy, and hath more then one blessing, will (as need shall require) supply the advantage trueth had, and now hath lost in the losse of this glorious instrument. Together with his life God hath put an end to all his travailes, wherein he shewed himself a pattern of holines, a burning and a shining light, and lamp of learning &amp; Arts, a Champion for trueth, specially while for the space of <hi>12</hi> yeares at least, he was in the Doctors Chaire at Franequer, and having fough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the good fight of faith, whereunto he was called, &amp; professed a good profession before nyamwitnesses, he hath now indeed layd hold on eternall life. His spirit gon to the spirits of just men, and his body committed to the ground, we committ his labours to thy use, wherein he being dead, yet speaketh, and his memorie we hope shall live for ever.</p>

            <head>To the renovvned King, EDVVARD THE SIXT And so To our present Soueraigne King CHARLES his Successor. IOHANNES ALASCO (a Godly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned Polonian Baron and Superintendent of the Church of strangers at London) in the Epistle Dedicatory of his tractate Concerning the Sacraments, printed at London, An<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 1552.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ell doth that Father, and vvithout doubt diserueth praise, vvho having a daughter a Virgin dravvne by the guile of panders into some levvd and dishonest house, and there trimmed after the vvhorish guise doth presently rescue her thence and bring her home
<pb facs="tcp:245:4"/>
to his ovvne house before shee be utterly spoyled. But the same Father (if he be vvise) thinks it not enough for the safty of his daughter, and the honor of his house, that he hath brought her home agayne, vnles he take from her vvholly vvhatsoever he knovves to be accounted in those houses a vvhorish attyre.</p>
            <p>Neyther doth he inquire vvhence such attyre came first: but iudgeth it dishonorable to himselfe, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthy his daughter and vvhole family, that any such thing at all as strompets haue vsed for dressings in their houses, should appeare in his.</p>
            <p>Neyther doth hee giue eare to their persvvasions, vvho beare him in hand that all things are to bee Estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the Fathers mynd in his ovvne house; and so thinke that the Fathers approbation can make that honest, in his ovvne house, for his daughter, and vvhole family, vvhich in another house, is most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, for any daughters that regard their ovvne credits: ascribing so much to the Fathers prerogatiue, that vvhat soever he approues, must be of others vvell li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of, so farre as it concernes his ovvne house. For he knovves full vvell, that although all those things vvhich he hath authorized in his ovvne house be there vvell thought of, yet that is not enough, synce the honor of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his vvhole Family, must not only hee cared for
<pb facs="tcp:245:4"/>
vvithin his ovvne house, but also throughout the vvhole Citie, that he may remoue all evill suspicions from his family among all his neighbours; and is heedfull that the panders haue not the least occasion left them, of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging or laying clayme to the sayd daughter, as hauing some of their vvhor-house-marks upon her.</p>
            <p>Even so in the Church of God, as in a city, Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Ministers are in place of parents, having the pure and right Administration of the Sacraments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them of God, for to be tended, and tendered as their ovvne daughter. It is therfore very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in these parents of the church (as vvee may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me them) if they rescue the lavvfull &amp; pure Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments from the violence and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany of the Romish Panders, by taking it into their ovvne care and Custody.</p>
            <p>But heer they ought to remember (Especially they vvho are called by the holy Spirit, Eminent Ministers of God, and Nursing Fathers of his church <hi>I.E.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings and Monarchs, that it is not enough for them, thus to have brought this daughter out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists stevves, home into their ovvne care and keeping, unles they also put of from her, all that dressing, vvhich they knovv to be vvhorish in the sayd stevves, that no such thing may be seene vvith them, vvhich may be
<pb facs="tcp:245:5"/>
accounted vvhorish: Especially in that citty vvhere there is great Variety of judgments, the ouerruling vvherof by mans Autority is not to bee expected, and vvhere there are so mamy hucksters for the stevves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning.</p>
            <p>Nor let them heare the delusions of those vvho sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, that such kindes of dressing from vvhence soeuer they bee taken may bee made good &amp; honest by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye. For vvell they knovv, they are not set ouer the vvhole church of God, but only one part of it, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in a Citty, and that therfore though they could bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re out such things at home by their Authoritye; yet it is their dutye (as they regard publike Chastity and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) to procure the honor of their daughter and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye not only vvithin their ovvne vvalls but alsoe throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghout the vvhole citty; not suffring any thing to be seene vvithin their house, vvhich they knovv to be held, urged, and maynteyned by the Romish stevves and their instruments as their proper vvhorish stuffe.</p>
            <p>Last of all they must bee vvary, least any signes or tokens bee left upon their daughter, by vvhich shee may bee questioned agayne by these panders as one of theires.</p>
            <p>Novv (if it please your Excellent Majestye) you are one of these nursing Fathers of the Church of God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed bee his name therefore: and in this high calling (by
<pb facs="tcp:245:5"/>
Gods providence) you haue this Ministery of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rescued out of the popish Brothells, and brought into your ovvne care and keeping: Here therfore bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to set before your eyes the foresayd example of a good Father in those things vvhich yet remayne to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>I.

            <p>This is that which all the Godly throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghout the Christian world doe expect from your hand, and that the more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they know that God hath enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched you with such excellent gifts, &amp; placed you in so high a place almost aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; euen to this very end, that you might remoue from the Ministery of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all those popish trinkets, wherewith it hath bin fearfully prophaned, &amp; restore unto it agayne that virgin-like attyre,
<pb facs="tcp:245:6"/>
wherwith it was of old adorned by the high King of Kings, and lawgiver Christ the Lord in his holy Institutions. So shall your faith and fidelitye bee famous throughout the Christian world: and the Church of England grow more honorable under your Gouernment.</p>

            <p>These be the vvitnesses, vvhich I haue to produce out of the Rej. his ovvne vvritings. All that I desire is, that their depositions may be impartially vveighed, &amp; in this desire, &amp; indeavour, ther is no vvrong done to any rule of piety or charity.</p>
            <p>VVe haue also the Rej. his open practise, as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant evidence, to contradict vvhat himself professeth in his Praeface, touching the constancy of his opinion, about the <hi>inconveniency onely</hi> of these Cerem: hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he beares the vvorld in hand to the contrary, &amp; that vvith great confidence: To vvhich purpose, vve intreat the follovving Allegations may be indifferently heard, from those, vvho as vvitnesses can testify his vvalking by their experience.</p>

            <p>In the 19. pag. of the Praeface: The Rej. expresseth him self on this manner, <hi>I doe ingeniously confesse tvvo errors in that my Apology; one that I trusted too much to the quotations of the Abridgement, vvhich then I had in vvriting:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To vvhich M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Hildersham thus replyes in his notes: Hovv false the quotations are in the Abridgement, vvill be seene hereafter. But this is manifestly false that he vvas (before the vvriting of his Apologye) decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therby, or that he had a Copy of it in vvriting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that tyme. For the Abrigdement vvas not made till after he vvas deprived: &amp; therfore no man could haue any coppy of it, either in print or vvriting. Nay the large book (vvhere of it is an Abridgement,) vvas not delivered to his Majesty before that day he vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived; &amp; the Abridgement vvas made sundry months after. He proceeds Ibid: 19. p. Its true that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters vvere resolved to haue chosen him for one of those three, that should haue disputed for them, (such profession he had made unto them of his full consent
<pb facs="tcp:245:36"/>
vvith them in judgement,) &amp; he had beene one of the disputants, if that (not the Deane of the Chappell; but) the King himself, had not expressely (in his message) excepted agaynst him: vvhich also argues, that his Majesty did hold him to be fully of the mynd, that the rest (vvho had sent him the foresayd book) vvere of.</p>
            <p>In his notes of the 20. pag: he hath these vvords. That ther is no colour of truth in this that he sayth here: i. e. (That vvhen he vvas chosen to be one of those, that should mayntaine their cause by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he professed to his Brethren, that he could not speake against the things as unlavvfull; but only as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) may appeare evidently to any reasonable man. For seing they had in their book delivered to his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our Kings Father, stated the quaestion not against the inconveniency, but the unlavvfulnes of these things. VVho vvill imagyne, they Vvould euer haue chosen him to be one of the 3 to dispute for them, if he had professed to them at that tyme, that he had nothing to say agaynst the unlavvfulnes of them? These be the dying vvords of that deare servant of God, as I haue them to shovve in black &amp; vvhite.</p>
            <p>If yet the vvitnes of the dead deserue no credit:
<pb facs="tcp:245:36"/>
The Rej. may vvith some small consideration, recall to mynd, hovv after the Revolt, or change of his former opinion, in an occasionall concurrence &amp; meeting of many fellovv Brethren; vvhen they out of humane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility desired him to take his place according to his yeares &amp; gifts; I say, he may (if he vvill bethink himself) easily recall, vvhat vvords he then openly uttered to this, or like effect: He told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvas unvvorthy to sitt vvith them; to haue respect from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, since he had betrayed them, &amp; <hi>their cause.</hi> Novv the cause vvhich they mayntayned vvas not inconveniency: but unlavvfulnes in these things. If the Rej. his memory serue him not about this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, let him repayre to Bambury syde to his auncient friends there, &amp; they can testify so much to his face. If then the construction that the King, &amp; state, made of his course, the apprehension his fellovv Brethren had of his practise: nay his ovvne profession may be trusted: Lett all the vvorld, &amp; D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Burgesse his ovvne heart judge, vvhether he hath changed his opinion yea, or no?</p>
            <p>In his praeface, ther is not much that expects ansvver. For to omitt his biting language, &amp; devouring vvords, vvhere vvith vve haue cloyed the Reader in the foregoing Catalogue, and unto vvhich ranke many Gibes here may be referred: as That pag. 5. These do commonly call any small company of their party:

All vvhich being justly blamed, it neither hurts the cause against vvhich he vvrites, nor helps that vvhich he defends, since the most glorious Gospell of Christ hath such blotts cast upon it, by reason of the sinfull vveaknesses of some, vvho take up the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof; Leaving (I say) all these, as not vvorthy the consideration, vve shall intreat the Rej. at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to giue some satisfaction to these quaeres.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Proceed vve a little to survay the praeface, &amp; the substance of it may be referred to three heads. 1. He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Non-conformity to be cause of many mischeifes.
2. He debates the cure, &amp; administreth that, vvhich he conceaved most meet for redresse. 3. He makes a defense for himself, &amp; vvriting: Agaynst all vvhich vve eycept thus.</p>

Nay I suppose, I may speake it truly, as I professe, I think it, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Non-conformable minister, hath beene a meanes under God, to bring more soules to grace &amp; heauen; then all the Cloysters, or Cathedralls in all England in the same time, vvhere all Conformity hath beene the dayly diet, &amp; liuelehood, of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:245:39"/>Goe vve to <hi>reason</hi>: the best that either the Rej. or any beside, can make of our Cerem: is, that they are things indifferent. Novv that vveake ones may doubt &amp; stagger about such, That doubting, they ought not to practise them 14. Rom: last vers: is made a duty. That mens vvalking according to conscience, should be the cause of others disobedience; That keeping the lavv, should be an occasion in it self of prophaning the lavv; that stopping the very appearance of the least evill, should sett open a gappe to the greatest; I appeale to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man vvhether it be not a consequence voyd of common sense, unlesse men haue a miraculous skill to soder quicksilver, or tysande together, or make heauen &amp; earth meet!</p>
            <p>Last of all, it is remarkable that Doctor Burgesse himself pa. 8. doth impute these mischeifes unto <hi>civill vvarr about Ceremonies:</hi> vvhich if it be vvell vveighed, it vvill manifest too much prejudice, in his former discourse. For in Civill vvarrs, the mischeifs ensuing on them, are not vvont to be charged upon one part alone, &amp; that poore, passive, overpovvred, obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the suffering of vvhat-soever pressures their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites please to lay upon them, vvhich is the Case of the Non-conformists in these Commotions: Tell us I pray
<pb facs="tcp:245:40"/>
yovv, if in your conscience, <hi>the Praelats Canons, courses, Courts, &amp; proceedings,</hi> haue had no hand in vvorking mischeife? nay diverse of these mischeifes, vvhich you haue affectedly placed on the other syde?</p>
            <p>If <hi>non-residents, double treble beneficed men, unable, perverse, scandalous, half-Popish Ministers,</hi> haue not had a finger in them? If those <hi>trumpetours, &amp; drummers,</hi> vvho proclayme the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, &amp; justnesse of our Prelats proceedings, haue not brought something to the furtherance of these mischeifes? If you speake your conscience, it must needs say, yes; &amp;, so confesse, it vvas your passion, not your judgement, that obtruded all upon Non-conformity.</p>
            <p>The state of this vvarr is this: vvee (as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Christians) stand upon the sufficiency of Christs institutions, for all kynde of vvorship: and that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively, the vvord,</hi> (say vve,) &amp; <hi>nothing but the vvord, in matters of Religious vvorship.</hi> The Praelats rise up on the other side, &amp; vvill needs haue us allovve, &amp; use certayne humane Ceremonyes of Religion in our Christian vvorship. VVe desire to be excused, as houlding them unlavvfull. Christ vve knovv: &amp; all that cometh from him, vve are ready to imbrace. But these human Cerem: in divine vvorship vve knovv
<pb facs="tcp:245:40"/>
not, nor can haue any thing to doe vvith them; upon this they make feirce vvarr upon us, &amp; yet by the penne of D. B. lay all the fault of this vvarr, &amp; the mischiefes of it, upon our backs. Novv all yee that passe by, consider, &amp; judge, vvhat aequity is used, in such dealing? They vvill say, all things are to be done <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently &amp; in order.</hi> To vvhich vve vvillingly consent, but alledge agayne, that vve cannot apprehend these Cerem: to be necessary for order, &amp; decency. They (as our Lords) tell us, it is enough for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that <hi>They</hi> esteeme them so. Our Consciences tell us, this is to usurp the place of God, vvhat can vve say lesse, then that vve vvill follovve our Consciences, rather then their vvills?</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Rej. p. 285. maketh <hi>Circumcision</hi> lavvfull to be imposed, upon the same grounds, that our English Cerem: stand on. Novv if it should please our Prelats in a Convocation to apoynt, that all English men should consent to the cutting of their fore-skins, &amp; denounce vvarr upon those that should refuse this goodly Canon; vvas it not a graue Accusation, to lay all the mischiefes of such a vvarr, upon those vvhich vvould not conforme to such a Ceremony? But the vveakest must alvvayes goe to the vvall, &amp; the Lamb
<pb facs="tcp:245:41"/>
must dye for troubling the vvater, if it please the Lyon so to determine it.</p>
            <p>VVe haue done vvith the disease, &amp; mischeife to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvith the cause of it.

By this reason therfore D. B. might as vvell haue forborne to judge, vvhat they should choose, as to determine so perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thereof. Lastly, I vvould gladly knovv of D. B. vvhether the Scriptures be not able as vvell to make Magistrates, and Governoures, perfect to every good vvorke, as they can do Ministers? vvhether; either Minister, or Magistrate should doe, or ought to doe any thing, vvhich God hath not commanded them? VVhether a faythfull Minister, in his office, ought not to understand, vvhat that vvord reveales: ought not to teache all Magistrates vvhat out of the vvord, he so understands?

And its marvellous to see, hovv conviction vvrests truth from a man, even agaynst his ovvne passion, &amp; purpose. vveigh these tvvo passages, &amp; see if they vvill accord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctor must vvrite, that he may not be vvrought out of the hearts of his people. pag. 11. And yet he confesseth by vvriting, he hath vvrought himselfe out of the hearts of the godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His defense to the 2. obj: is yet more feeble, though more ingenious: For his ansvvere is nothing but yeilding the cause, in some compasse and circumlocution of vvords.</p>
            <p>For (1) vvhen he graunts: that he forbore some yeares this course of vvriting, that he might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate authority: he privily, yea playnly yeilds, the objection had such rationall face in it, that it did not only presse him, but prevayle vvith him also: vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re as 2.<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> he adds: that by this meanes he hath some hope <hi>to persvvade some to conforme, &amp; so to avoyd the lash of authority.</hi> By this he doth not only yeild the objection, but confirme &amp; establish it. For if only those, vvho are persvvaded by his ansvvere, shall avoyd the lash, therfore they vvho vvill not be persvvaded, must expect the blovv, and shall be sure to feele it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:245:44"/>3. He <hi>adds for his ovvne intention: Sure I am that I desire not the vexation of any sober man:</hi> But his ovvne bond vvill not be taken, because he hath so often broke his vvord; he must seek for other sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes: <hi>(Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi>) Little povver have vvords to persvvade any of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, vvhen the practise goes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vvay. Nor yet can I discerne, hovv to judge of any mans desire, but only by his indeavour. Those heavy accusations, uncharitable censures, vvherby he chargeth &amp; that vvith much bitternes, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Non-conformists, from vvhat root they come, &amp; vvhat desire they imply, let any rational man determine: For it cannot be to ingratiate them, or procure favor for them, in the affections of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, vvhen he makes them appeare such as deserve none; nay such as ought to receyve none, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at their hands.</p>

               <hi>Lastly vvhen it is objected: That this course hinders the removeall of these things, vvhich authority othervvise might possibly remove;</hi> His defense is; <hi>That he vvill never beleive, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vvill remove them, vvith dishonor of it
<pb facs="tcp:245:44"/>
self, as yeilding the things to be unlavvfull, vvhich it hath so long mayntayned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In vvhich ansvver: these tvvo particulars offer themselves to consideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To remove Cerem: as unlavvfull, being long mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned is a dishoner to Authority.</item>
               <item>2. D.B. beleives, authority vvill not thus dishonor it self.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Ansvv: The first of vvhich is a most dangerous assertion; &amp; is made a cheife barr to stay Papists, &amp; others from reforming of any thing, that others haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, &amp; they defended: And its usuall in the mouth of false flatterers, &amp; back freinds to all reformation: &amp; I vvould hope that D.B. did utter more in this, by his penne, then he meant in his heart. Beside the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are not so dangerous, but the ground is as vveake For the long continuance, or mayntenance of a thing, if evill &amp; unlavvfull, is so farr from bringing dishonor upon any, for the removeall of it, that retayning therof, encreaseth both his sinne, &amp; shame: &amp; it argues a greater measure of humility &amp; povver of grace to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it.</p>
            <p>Nay, vvere the thing lavvfull, if yet by circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it did appeare, that Gods Honor, the common good,
<pb facs="tcp:245:45"/>
the aedification of our brethren, might more be promoted by the remoueall of it, though it vvere hoary headed vvith antiquity &amp; continuance, it argued greatest love to God &amp; man to alter it, rather then to keepe it in use: &amp; that vvould bring greatest honor to him that should so doe; since by the verdict of Gods Spirit, he is most honorable, that most honoreth God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From these grounds, hovv rotten &amp; unsavory the second particular of the Rej. his defense is, vvill easily be graunted. For if in such a remoueall, the duty of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth consist, the povver of grace doth appeare, the glory of God, &amp; good of the Church &amp; common vvealth, vvill be advanced; To be of that beleife vvith D. B. that Magistrates vvill never be brought to doe vvhat they ought, hovv uncharitable is it thus to lay their honor in the dust? And not to presse them hereunto, vvhen vve may, &amp; by our calling, ought, hovv unconscionable is it? And hovv contrary to that loue vve ovve to the Almighty, &amp; our Governours?</p>
            <p>The crovvd of objections, vvhich he makes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself, I conceyve, as so many Strugglings of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vvhich stood in the vvay, to vvithstand him in his course. His conscience, as it should seeme, gaue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nsett, &amp; let in some such intimations as these to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:245:45"/>VVhy is not Popery coming in fast enough; but you must make a preparation thereunto: yea become a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer, &amp; harbenger to make Roome, &amp; lay in provision for it? Is it not sufficient, that the vvicket is sett open, that the Popish pack may be dravvne in; but you must sett open the great gate, that a Sumpter horse may amble in vvith a load of reliques &amp; Cerem? For if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Church be so enlarged, to appoynt Cerem: at their pleasure, to admonish and teach, and it is in their povver to appoynt vvhat, &amp; hovv many, as seemes good to them; vvhy then let images be erected, let cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; Crucifixes be sett up in every corner. These are lavvfull admonitors, &amp; instructers, &amp; vve cannot haue too many good Companions, to putt us in mynd of our duties.</p>
            <p>Consider beside, hovv many poore Ministers are under pressure, some fled, some imprisoned, many suspended, themselues &amp; families undone. VVhy vvill you not suffer them to lye in the dust, but vvill you trample upon them, even unto death? Is it not enough, they make brick, but must they be beaten also? Oh consider, as before the Lord, to vvhom you must giue an account. Doe you vvell to blovv the fire in the Chymny, vvhyle the flame is in the thach? Is not the fury of the BB.
<pb facs="tcp:245:46"/>
yet feirce enough, their rage sharpe enough, but you must sett them on, and strenghthen their hands, to strike har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der? lastly, is not <hi>Cringing at Altars, bovving at the name of Iesus,</hi> like to be brought in, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised vvith great forvvardnes, &amp; vvill you, dare you encorage, in such courses, yea giue an approbation and commendation to them? For they vvill say, they are but significant Cerem: they place no merit, putt no effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them, only they are admonitors of our dutyes. Thus is the foundation of superstition layd, the Gospell Stopped, and an open vvay made for Popery, and you are the persvvader, the encorager, yea defender of all these: hovv vill you ansvver this at the great day?</p>
            <p>Yet do I not speake this, as though I vvere troubled, vvith the vveight of any thing he hath vvritt. For I professe unfaynedly the vvay of his traverse fynds vvelcome vvith me; vvherin the nakednes, &amp; inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiblenes of his cause I hope vvill be discovered. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing I vvould most earnestly intreat, that he vvould shovv us but fayre play in these proceedings: to vvitt, that he vvould not breake our heads, vvhyle others haue bound our hands: Lett him but graunt us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different termes, euen the common curtesy of the court, an impertiall pleading: vve desire no more favour then the cause by its ovvne credit vvill procure: Lett the larv
<pb facs="tcp:245:46"/>
be open, as the rigour of Iustice allovves: To vvhich pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shall he so far prevayle vvith his Lord BB. that vve may enjoy, the use of our books, the liberty of the presse, &amp; if not the benefit of our charges, yet freedome of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our native soyle, &amp; vvith our poore desolate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; And I dare promise him he shall not vvant those, that vvill joyne issue vvith him, in this traverse, either by vvriting, or printing, &amp; that vvithout any gaudy expressions, (vvherof he accuseth M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Parker) but by playe dynt of Syllogisme: &amp; vve vvill take our oaths, as he in desireth, that each man of us shall vvrite his conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. vvhich I vvonder vvhy the D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> putt in, since its openly knovvne to all that vvill not shutt their eyes, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doeth not liue &amp; dye alone vvith conformable men.

                  </gap>rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> here vented by the Rej. is not to be borne: vvhich is observably sett dovvne in the <hi>14. ob: D. Burges. hath parted vvith more profitt, by taking up

conformity, and a benefice, then any novv in England hath done by his unconformity, and losse of a benefice.</hi> Surely he myndeth not so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately as he should, the affliction of his brethren. VVhat did D. B. part vvith? Nothing but future, contingent, uncertayne profitt: vvhich made him liable to be envied, and opposed by the colledge of phisitions; Profitt, vvhich vvas not necessary to his life &amp; being, depending upon extraordinary paynes: such as in all probability, he could not haue long indured, or at least vvith contentement of mynd. His Pshisick prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise made that change, vvhich Tully commendeth in Merchandize: <hi>Satiata quaestu, vel contenta po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, ut saepe ex alto, in portum, sic ex ipso portu, se in agros possessionesque contulit.

            </p>
            <p>On the other side, vvhat haue not? vvhat do not men loose by unconformity? Even all their meanes of living; all their liberty, not only of providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp; their families; but even of breathing in any ayre, saving onely that, vvhich may be dravven out of stinking prisons. Nay somtyme all the Commodity of

The poore vvidovv (sayth he) that parted but vvith tvvo mites, parted vvith more then they did, vvho out of their plenty, parted vvith many sheckells, because those tvvo mites vvere all that she had.</p>
            <p>If this be true, then many &amp; many a one hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith more profitt for Non-conformity, then D.

in disgrace, as clearly appeareth in his second part, pag. 38. where he stileth not onely the replyer, but many others, for this very cause, Libellers: But it cannot be esteemed any disgrace,<note place="margin">Its lawfull for an author in case, not to set his name to his work.</note> for any writing upon just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to want the name of the author, without invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, many excellent Divines, and divers pennmen also of holy Scripture, in the same blame. As for the terme <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> I understand it, as noting a little contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble writing: But the worth of a writing doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, in <hi>bulk and belly,</hi> but in synewes, veynes, and arteryes, which with good blood and spirits, may be couched into a little body: If he meane by <hi>Pamphlet</hi> the same which after, he expresseth in the terme of <hi>scurrilous,</hi> that is as I take it, ful of jesting, without respect of the persons: he hath to deale with. My answ: is: That if the Rep: had written to the convocation house, an Epistle with this Inscription, <hi>To the superstitious fathers of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: as the Def: entituleth his epistle to us, to his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions Brethren, (and yet this Rej: is not ashamed to adopt, this scurrility, and make it his owne childe, by maintaining of it, even against the very nature of D. Burgesse) there had beene more occasion of such a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then now is found, in all the Replye, as after shall appeare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Repl:</hi> doth not any where to my remembrance, vilifie the person of his adversary, but only his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and answeres, together with the vyle courses of our Hierarchy, in which kynd of jesting the Rej: his scurrility is far greater, then the Repl: saving the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which ariseth out of the outward greatnes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:245:64"/>
and the poore condition of them, which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by them. Now the Repl: is no admirer of B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. persons, nether are disputations acquainted, with such court la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, as they are used unto: <hi>If it please your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship &amp;c.</hi> but such is the condition of those, that have to doe with Prelats, that they are usually censured either for scurrility, or flattery, and there is no doubt, but some will accuse the Rej: as much of flattery in blazing his <hi>Diocesans Admirable wisdome,</hi> as he doth the Repl: of scurrility, though I will not: Those who write against Prelats, are wont to expect such a censure from them &amp; theirs.<note place="margin">Sic Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God hath made all Pastors stewards of his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, and dispensers of his misteries: And if every Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor over his charge, be a steward of Gods mysteries, why hath he not the Key of Iurisdiction over his parish, in as large and ample manner, as the Bishop hath over his Diocesse, or the Pope? seing the Keyes are not given to one, but to unitye, as the fathers teach: why should the Bishops and the Pope have two Keyes, and they but one: resolve these things (sayth he to Allen, and I to D.

               <p>The commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Protestant tenet was alwayes, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fox, Mart. P. 4. expresseth it, that it is reproveable to adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christs intention, new found rites, and Phantasyes of men: And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Burgesse in an Epistle to King Iames, in the beginning of his Raigne, witnesseth, that in those dayes, many hundred worthy ministers thought our cer. unlawfull, and would surely dye, rather then use them: which worthy men, surely were not the first authors, of that Tenet: If they were, why did he call them worthy, who now judgeth otherwise of us, for maintaining the same sentence. 5.

But as now things stand, behold to what narrow streits we are driven, on the one side we feare the words of our Saviour Christ, woe to them by whom scandals and offences come, on the other syde, at the Apostles speech we can not but quake and tremble, if I preach not the Gospell woe unto me, Being thus hardly beset, we see not any other remedy, but to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our soules the one way, that we may the other way indeavour to save them.

Rather then that shall be taken from us, we are resolved to take this filth, and to putt it on, although we judge it to be so unfitt, and inconvenient, that as oft as ever we pray or preach, so arayed before you, we do as much as in us lyes, to cast away your soules, that are weak mynded, and to bring you unto endlesse perdition: But we beseech you brethren have care of your owne safety, take heed to your stepps, that you be not taken in these snares, which we lay before you, and our prayer in your behalf is, that the poyson which we offer you, may never have power to doe you harme.</hi> This is the miserable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of a man, putting on the Surplice, which he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth inconvenient, upon such grounds as the Rej. did hold, and doth not yet condemne; This all such do speake either in deeds or words, that putt on a Surplice in that manner: The state of the quaestion is now chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged saith the Rej. and the Cerem. held unlawfull, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many mischeifs follow: It may be the compasse of our Prelats intention, to which the former tenet had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is varyed by some degrees, towards the Autar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. speaketh in his Apologye, if ther be no other change, but that after more mischeif don by these ceremonies, then was before, they are now more strictly urged then ever (which the Rej. confesseth) they are now at the least more hatefull, if not more unlawfull then before, This is also considerable, beside the change is little or none, the same mischeives which the Rej. imputeth to the new tenet, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker in his preface chargeth that Tenet with, which this Rej, calleth the ould: Yet neither accusations have any force or colour, but upon the supposall, that the ceremonies are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

The plaine truth is, that in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths dayes, and before, in King Edwards tyme, the Cerem: were accounted weeds of popery, as that zealous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous preacher, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

They were not curious of distinguishing of unlawfulnes and inexpediency, but contented themselves to reject and oppose them: Some as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Greenham refused to give their reasons fully, untill they should be constrained: In the meane tyme they utterly refused them, as unlawfull for them to use: This appeareth out of a booke called a part of a Regis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c.

In the following pages spent principally about answering of objections, made or feared, or at least imagined, against the Author of this Rej. few things are found capable of any great dispute: Neither can many passages be touched, without odious grating upon D. Burges personall credit, which I tender so much, that I would wish more added to it, by other works, then is detracted from it by this: I will therfore leave these things to stand or fall, without any paynes or perill of myne, or the cause, and passe forth unto the stile of our Cerem: in giving and maintaining whereof the Def. and Rej. are so tender, as to proclaime them innocent.</p>

That Calvin accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in the most favorable sense <hi>ineptias, fopperyes,</hi> and in proper speech <hi>noxious, pernicious.</hi> To this the Rej. answ: that Calvin <hi>meant not these titles to our Cerem: but to some other things which were in King Edwards, book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, as lights, and crosses at the supper.</hi> Concerning which answ: 1. not only D. B. was wont otherwise to understand Calvin as we do, but the Prelats themselves, for so we read in D. B. his Apologye pag. 44. according to D. Covells disposition of it. The ordinary speeches of the Lordship and other Bishops were, that the Cerem: are trifles, raggs, beggerly rudiments, that in the books were <hi>multae tolerabiles ineptiae,</hi> which if it pleased the King to remove they would be gladd.</p>

If the Rej. say yes, as he must, unlesse he will speake against all reason &amp; truth: I then reply upon his owne grounds: That outward action which is not purposely referred, that is not a Cerem. but this action is not purposely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with any ayme to that end for the party inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no such thing, purposed no such matter, but did it as a thing of-course, as a man should bow his knee for exercise when he is alone. 2.

No: Is it by way of opposition? No: And thus where shall we hould him, or make him stay, Nay

where will he himself fynd footehold to stand: Iust for all the world, as if he should defyne a man to be a <hi>living creature, which is not a byrd, nor a fish, nor a lambe, nor an oxe,</hi> how senselesse and sapplesse would such descriptions be, and yet this of the Rej. in this place is the like.

Amongst the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this difference, the last is to be attended unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath a remarkable note added unto it? <hi>Convening in one set place at an honore appointed unto worship saith the Rej. is in that relation a ceremony of worship: and yet as it is an observance of order it is no Ceremo.</hi> Of this ther can be no doubt, but the observation of tyme and place, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to another thing, is according to the definition of the Rej. a ceremony: But how an observation of this tyme and place, can be considered as an order, without reference to some thing to be ordered in that tyme and place, that so it may be differenced from the same order, as it is a ceremony, this is a metaphisicall abstraction, as I cannot conceave of, let others therfore judge: When the Apost. chargeth the Corinth, <hi>to doe all things in order</hi>: could he be so understood, that he spake of order, and of the ceremony of order, and that by doing of things in order, he meant a Cerem: because there is a relation of order to things: but by doing orderly he meant no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, because there is no relation to things: Order without relation to things ordered, is like the accidents in the Popish Sacrament, without any subject after tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantion: If the doctrine of humaine Cerem. cannot
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:245:82"/>
stand, or be understood, without such miraculous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties let it goe seek for those that will receave it. The note added to the former example is: <hi>that they who oppose matters of order to matters of ceremony, as if the same thing could not be done in double relations, do confound severall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things, and oppose things coincident.</hi> Here first may be marked, how he crosseth that in this conclusion, which he layd for the ground of it: before he sayd <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or relation</hi> to some other matter doth distinguish a cerem. from order, because a Cerem. hath such a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and order as order hath not: but now he telleth us of <hi>double relations</hi> one in order, and another in ceremo. Secondly he fighteth here without an adversary, except he understand by matters of order, meere order, and by matters of Ceremo. such observations, as are significant by institution, for no man doubteth but Cerem. lawfull and unlawfull also may be done in order.</p>
               <p>In the example of this rule, the Rej. is so subtile in his subliming and refining of notions, that he hath these words: <hi>The observance of the order appointed for reading, singing, praying, &amp;c. is in respect of that order of the substance thereof, but referred to divine service is a cerem.</hi> In this (I say) no more good sense appeares then needs must, for putt those words together: <hi>The observance of order, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that order is of the substance thereof:</hi> without all quaestion: as a man in respect of the same man is of his substance: So also the observance of a cerem. in respect of that ceremony is of the substance thereof: Here is no difference, neither indeed can any difference be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligiblely fayned betwixt order of divine service, and

At a word: It is the verdit and voice of the scripture, and consent of all men, to divyde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship into morall, ceremoniall. Whence I gather thus: If ther be a ceremoniall worship, a distinct species from morall or substantiall worship, then is a ceremony in it owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, as such a worship without reference or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration had of morall or substantiall, as a man in his owne nature is a living creature, without any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a beast. Againe hence its cleare, that as well as morall worship hath a compleat nature of it owne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremoniall: So ceremoniall hath its compleat na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without morall, because they are contradistinct spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>Againe hence it followes, divine ceremonies as such, are parts of worship: every <hi>species</hi> as it is a <hi>species,</hi> is part of his <hi>genus:</hi> but divine ceremonies as such, are species of religious worship: whence that is false which the Rej. affirmes in the seventh consectary:<note place="margin">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:245:84"/>
If a man, as he doth referr a religious action to another, doth worship God, then is it a species of worship even in that reference: but as he doth referr a religious action to another, he doth worship God: ergo, that action in that reference is a species of worship: And thus much his owne words in the same consectary seeme to me to evince: <hi>The outward elements and acts in respect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things they do represent and exhibite are cerem.</hi> So the Rej.

it to be, part of our fayth in God, or our constant obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and yet we say as its made a token to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port these, and so made a teacher of these, its a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, yet a reall species of worship in the generall, though false: So that either the Consect. is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, carying only an empty sound of words, or if it be taken in a fayer sense, it will not free our ceremonies, from the charge of false worship: Thus farr we have made a little digression from the Rej. but not from the matter (Christian Reader) nay nor yet wholly from the Rej. because all this, adds still, to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confutation of the desperate feeblenes of his definition, joyned merely out of his owne conceit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The seventh hath beene discussed and confuted before in the substance of it:<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> Pag. 34. onely that strange kynd of expression may here be observed as we passe by: <hi>It is not essentiall to a ceremony simplye, that it be no proper part of Divine worship</hi>: where let it be observed, that to be no proper part of worship, is a bare negation, or not being of worship: now plaine it is, and manifest to all that have but common sense, that a bare negation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be essentiall to any thing, that hath being, neither simply nor comparatively. And by the same proportion, and upon the same ground, he might as well say, <hi>to be no part of worship,</hi> is not essentiall to any thing, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to a Ceremony: now to what profit, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are such expressions, which serve nothing to the cause in hand, but to darken the truth with words, and to dazell the mynds of the ignorant.</p>

                  <hi>which maketh a ceremony to be part of divine worship, or not, but institution: Divine institution maketh any circumstance a part; but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine institution, though to the same end and use, maketh only an adjunct of divine worship, because the observance thereof cannot incurr the act of any proper worship of God.</hi> How this is a consectary following upon the premises it doth not appeare.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rence of necessary or arbitrary will worship. The reason of that is rendered, because relation doth consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Ceremo. And the same reason houldeth here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause relation doth constitute worship: The Institution Divine or humaine doth onely difference the efficient cause, not the matter, forme, and end, wherin the essence of worship doth consist. If Gods institution did make any circumstance of worship to become worship, then the ceasing from worship should be worship, because ther were circumstances of tyme appointed, when men should cease from solemne worship: The reason which supporteth the other part of this assertion viz: <hi>That hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine institution cannot make an action part of worship, because the observance thereof, cannot incurr the act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is just as much, as if it had beene so sett downe: humaine institution cannot make worship; because that which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, cannot be worship.</hi> If men appoint even places, and tymes, in the same manner, to the same ends, that God did, they are worship as well (though not so good) as the other: If this were not so, then wherefore doth the Scripture tell us, of will worship, taken up at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of men, or according to the institutions, doctrines, and traditions of men? For by the Rej. his rule, there can be no such thing, and therfore it is vayne to forbidd it. This may suffice for this consectary, yet because the reflexion of it doth often occurr in the dispute.

A Ceremo. in respect of the <hi>genus</hi> and end is worship, and yet in the consectary immediately going before, it was peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that use and end maketh not a Ceremony part of Divine worship: I take the cause of this crosse Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be, that humaine ceremonies in divine worship, are such a crosse knott, that he who seeks to open the conveyances of it, must needs run crosse in his thoughts and words. To make this crossing more plaine, let us first debate (a little more fully) the truth of this coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect. opened.</note> and then see what followeth therefrom. We here have three conclusions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Ceremonies in their kynd, as they are parts of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and decency, may be acts of religion.</item>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:245:90"/>3. That the particulars are not Divine; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are plainly expressed in the corallary, if they be not contradictious one to another, I must confesse, I must bidd all reason and logick farewell, or else the Rej. hath a new logick, which yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw light: And therfore I reason thus.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If every particular have the whole nature of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in it, then the generall being divine,<note place="margin">1. Contradiction.</note> the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars must be divine; but every particular of order and decency are species to generall nature of order &amp;c. therfore they have the whole nature of order in the generall; &amp; ergo are divine: &amp; to affirme the contrary which here is done, is to say a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath sense, but the species man and beast hath none: Or; the nature of man is reasonable, but the particulars: Thom. or Ihon are not reasonable; and thus the 3. conclusion implyes a contradiction to the first conclusion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe the second also is more grosse, if more may be added, If the generall, give his whole substance &amp; nature to the particulars, then if ther be any substance of order, the particulars have it, but the generall nature of order gives all the substance to the particulars; ergo, they have it: the maintaining of the contrary conceit, is to bidd battell to all reason, and to deny a confessed common, and receaved principle of art.<note place="margin">Genus est to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum partibus essentiale.</note> 
                  <hi>Generall is that kynd of whole, which gives his essence to the particulars.</hi> For now farr should a man be forsaken of common sense, who should affirme, that manhood, or the nature of man in generall, should have the substance of reason: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:245:91"/>
in his species and particulars. Tho. and Ihon, they should be wholly destitute of the substance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And assuredly (good reader) when I considered, the wonderfull confidence of the disputer, arrogating so much subtility and learning, and yet to fall so foule and offend so heavily, against the very rudiments of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and principles of reason, I could not but look up to heaven, and lawfully as I could, and tremblingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,<note place="margin">Isay. 29.14.</note> that of the Prophet: That the Lord is sayd to putt out the understanding of the Prudent.</p>
               <p>Thus we have discussed the falshood of the Coralla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we will now reason from it, for our owne advantage, taking the false graunt of the Rej. in this place.</p>

And by the Rej. graunt, these standing by a commaund of divine worship, and being proper acts thereof: ergo,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:245:91"/>
it must needs follow that the particulars stand by vertue of the commaund of Divine worship, and are proper acts thereof: we see by this tyme whither the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Divinity hath brought him.</p>
               <p>Againe, if they be so commaunded, and be such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acts of worship: of such acts the Rej. confesseth the Negative arg. from Scripture concludeth well.

This the Rej. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hould of in many places, and maketh thus actions religious, which here he calleth civill.

Now upon a short triall, it may appeare, where it waketh: The Rej. tould us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that some ceremonies are mixt, partly civill, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>artly sacred; now he telleth us with the same breath, that any ceremony in religious affayres is meerely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ecclesiasticall: And by proportion any Cerem. in civill affaires must needs be meerely civill, what then is become of the mixt or common sort: here sure is a contradiction from what spirit soever it come. 2. What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n assertion is this, any ceremony used in religious affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

affaires. And surely that which remaining the same may be civill,<note place="margin">Many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are of common use, in things civill &amp; ecclesiastick.</note> is not <hi>meerely and properly</hi> ecclesiasticall, but common to both uses, and rather meerely civill, then meerely ecclesiasticall, because civility is supposed and included in ecclesiasticall affaires, but ecclesiasticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are supposed and included in civill. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iackson in his originall of unbeleef, pag. 337. doth wel observe: <hi>That decent behaviour doth change the subject only, not alter its owne nature and forme, whilest its used in matters sacred: Nor is the habit of civill complement, or good manners, such an unhallowed weed, as must be layd asyde, when we come into the sanctuary.</hi> And indeed there is no more reason, to shutt civility out of the church, or sacred busines, then to shutt religion out of the towne-house or civill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. 3. That which is added of a civill use of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remon. in quaestion doeth nothing agree. If a porter or baker weare a lynnen garment in the Church, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, as at other tymes, no man will except against it, or account it a ceremony, ecclesiasticall, or religious.</p>
               <p>A crosse that is used for a shopp signe, hath no eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall or civill use in religion, except ther be so many temples in one place, that they must be distinguished by signes, as shopps are: As for the examples mentioned before, of the Bishops in their formalities, and the Clerks in their surplices, at a funerall for civill use: I answer, the immediat end of such formalities is religious, even in that, they are characters of ecclesiasticall persons, and their religious office: Are not Rochetts and such like formalities ecclesiasticall ceremonies, being signes of cheif ecclesiasticall officers as such? The furnerall, at
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:245:93"/>
which they are present, doth no more make them ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, then among the Papists it maketh all their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to become a civill order: Nay by this it appeareth that both civill ceremonies may be used in ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires, and ecclesiasticall cerem. in civill affaires, because both may be used in the same affaires. To tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse these notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s more full, I add these considerations: These words, <hi>matter pertaining to religion added in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of sacred cerem. may cary a double sense.</hi>

                  </note> 1. That it is enough to make ceremonies sacred, if this be their end to be serviciceable to some thing, which is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or to some person, in a holy function, or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of an ordinance, and this seemes to be the Rej. meaning for his examples cary this meaning, when wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of blackes, rending of garments, in dayes of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are made by him sacred cer. as also by those words, wherein he is so peremptory, and expresseth his lordly censuring, <hi>even of mens hearts, in lusting after contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they deny ceremonies used in religious affaires to be meerely ecclesiasticall,</hi> but this we conceave to be false, &amp; hope it hath in part, and shall appeare to be more plainly in the following discourse.</p>
               <p>Secondly it may cary this sense: that is truely sacred, when the object is God, and his honour aymed at imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, as when we kneele to God in prayer, we do not kneele to the scripture, or man praying but God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: or when the next object is a holy thing, but so attended as by that, or in the use of that, we tender up honor to God and attaine that end. As the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister preacheth the word to the people, and they heare it preached, but by both and in the virtue of both,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:245:94"/>
according to Gods appointment, the heart is caried in holy affections, and apprehensions to him, and so both hould out Gods honor: So Sacraments given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dispensed, they hould out the spirituall government of God and his honor unto us, &amp; bring our hearts under his hand to give that honour which is due to his power, soveraignty, and holines, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing therin unto us: This only makes a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly sacred, but if things of any nature, only so farr at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a religious, either person, thing, or performance, as that they help not in carying out the act to God, and so tendering honor to him, but stand only in a distance, and subordination as things of necessity, or in some conveniency presupposed to goe before a religious work, in a common way to that, as to other things, in the like proportion, and have the self same work in that sacred as in civill affaires, this is not sacred at all: So <hi>place and tyme, a font,</hi> will do as much to any civill action, as to a sacred: So that only religion applyeth, and takes to it self, that civill circumstance, that it might put forth his owne act, as upon a stage, makes such things do as much for him, as for any politike and naturall work, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion serve its turne upon these occasions.

And this kynd of efficacy our Cerem. have by their institution as they are appointed, and enjoined to be used. The preface to the book of common Prayer, discovering the intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the imposers, hath these words: <hi>Such are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which are apt to stirr up the dull mynd of man to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his duty to God, by some notable and speciall signification, wherby he might aedifyed.</hi>

It was added by the Replyer, that the Hyerarchye, is a creature of <hi>mans making,</hi> and may more lawfully be removed, when it pleaseth man, then ever she was by him erected. To this the Rej. answereth, confessing, that <hi>sundry offices and orders in our church are humaine, and not divine: adding, that accidentall formes of discipline, are not determined in the word of God, but left in the churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

The Rej. telleth us, that there be, but two wayes of considering, the Church of England, as one, either in the convocation house, or in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, which must needs (sayth he) include the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and officers, pertaining therunto: Now in both of these wayes Hierarchicall orders and officers are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and included, so that the Church of England, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these wayes could possibly devise these orders and officers. 3.

It would be worth a little paines of his to declare, how, and in what sense our Hierarchye is accidentall, to the church, and discipline of England? The Bishops are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient causes, even in a high ranke, of our Discipline, they are principall members, of our Diocesan churches, they have an Ecclesiasticall rule, and commaund over the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning edging upon Anabaptists, in this point it may with better reason be objected, to those that maintaine Diocesan Bishops, then to those that oppose them, for it is well knowen, that the Anabaptists, in Holland, Zeland, and Frisland, have their Bishops, which have care of many congregations, within a certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, &amp; in all of them (though ther be others that teach) they only, at their visitations, performe some mayne things belonging to the pastorall office. 7. The posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that our Bishops are humaine creatures of mans making) is not only to us, but to many of themselves, sufficient to condemne their office, some of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving publikely protested, that if it were so, they would not keepe their places one day.</p>

I would be loath to undertake the prooving of such a wilde consequence. Divine, and blessed Bradford refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be admitted unto the Ministery by B.

Ignorance is here againe vainely pretended, as before was declared. Are the Prelates onely ignorant of that which they have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beene warned, and convinced of in many Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Now for the establishing of theis Ceremonies, with the penalty of refusing them by Statute, the Rej: should have done well, if he had named that, or those Statutes where we may finde this done. As for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:245:121"/>
penalty of deprivation for refusing theis Ceremonies, the Rej: confessed before, that the Parliament Anno 1610. pronounced against it, as contrary to Law. If the Ceremonies themselves stand established by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it must be that of Eliz: 1. But that concerneth the booke of king Edward in which this Rej: pag. 54.55. confesseth some vaine Ceremones, now removed, to have beene praescribed.<note place="margin">Tolerabiles inaptiae.</note> Now either those <hi>tollerable fooleries</hi> were established by Statute of Eliz: 1. or not theis; For no difference is found in the Statute; If those, why doe our Opposites refuse them, and yet urge theis vpon that Law which no more established theis than them? The trueth is, though the booke for substance was in some sort confirmed, yet every <hi>rubrick,</hi> and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which was therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined, though it was for a time tolerated, was not established. Why else was subscription, by that Statute, restreyned only to doctrine of Faith, and Sacraments? If any therefore have beene deprived, either at Assises, or other Civill Courts, for mere refusall of theis Ceremonies, (which I much doubt of) that, (without quaestion) hath beene by the Praelates procuring, not by such evidence of Law as iust Iudges require in such wreghty causes. It would also be knowne what kinde of Iudges those were which are sayd to have beene so Ceremonious. Sometime it falleth out, that a <hi>Hales</hi> is put out of Comission by a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and another, a friend of Gardiner being put in his place, strange sentences follow thereon.

B. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will confesse that there was no great good done in the second edition of the Articles concerning Faith, and Religion: Yet be it so, that this was a good worke of our Convocation, what a poore commendation is <hi>one good worke,</hi> of a Mother-Church in a whole generation or age of her children?<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. The second answer is, that <hi>Convocations doe good sometimes, in confirming what was decreed before.</hi> Which is sometime true, viz. If the things decreed before, were of themselves good, and had need of the Convocations confirmation. But sometime such confirmations are onely for fashion-sake; As when the Councell of Trent confirmed the Holy Scripture, the Apostolicall Creed &amp;c. and then there is very little, or no good done, more than was formerly done to their hands. Any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of good, I doe not know our Convocations to be guilty of, nor can I understand, when, whence, and how the Convocation had Commission to confirme any thing, without making of new Canons. A Law of Confirmation is necessary to Canons: but Canons of confirmation are not necessary to Lawes established. Neither can it be shewed that so much hath beene given or committed to the Convocation. Nor if it were, could that be done without Canons (in some respect) new.

               <p n="3">3. The third answer is; That <hi>in the booke of Canons were many good provisions for more plentifull preaching, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edressing the abuses of Ecclesiasticall Courts, which would have done much good, if they had beene as carefully executed as they were made.</hi> But 1. so there was also in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, many Canons of Reformation, at most of their sessions, nay such, as (without any straining) goe farre beyond those that are found in our Canons. As for example, in the fift Session, under Paulus 3. it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that expounding of the Scripture should be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently observed in all Cathedrall Churches, and also in other places where any stipend was, or may be had, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:245:125"/>
that Praebends, for that cause absent from their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, should enjoy their dividents, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And that all Parish Priests should be compelled to teach their people, at the least on the Lords day, and in solemne feasts. In the sixt session, the Auntient Canons are revived which were made against Bishops that buisy themselves in Princes Courts, or other where with secular affaires, and so are either non residents, or non-praedicants. In the seventh, it is ordered that all colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of benefices be upon able men, and such as will be resident upon the same, under great penalties. Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities also are abolished, or made nullities. In the fift ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion under Pius 4. all taking of money for Orders, for letters testimoniall, for seales by Bishops, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as simony: Nay, the Notaries, or Secretaries are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to take any thing except they have no wages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (&amp; then also, not above the tenth part of one Crowne) under great penalties. It is also under like penalties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that none be ordeined (except upon necessity, and then with patrimony, or pension sufficient to live on) which have not an Ecclesiasticall Benefice, or special<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Therfore <hi>immediate</hi> improper worship, is <hi>mediate</hi> by the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> dispute.</p>
               <p>If it be here replyed, that the actions which make up mediate worship, must be actions of the second table, not of the first, as these be: I answer; It is the verdit of the word, and the common consent of all Divines, that all the actions and duties, which concerne our brother as the next object and end, and so determine upon him are required, and regulated by the second table: since therfore these things of comlines and order, are of this nature, by the Rej. his graunt, I do not see, how it can be avoyded with any colour of reason, but they must be commaunded in the second table, and so come under the definition of mediate worship, directly contradictory to the Rej. his determination.</p>
               <p>I might also putt the reader in mynd, of these twice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sod-coleworts, that are sett agayne before us: viz. this misty distinction of properly, &amp; reductively, which like

a <hi>vagrant</hi> wanders up and downe in every coast, and therfore should be whipped home to his owne place: For it is propounded &amp; applyed upon the like mistake, that formerly it was pag. 37. in the division of Cerem. And is here, as it was there, voyd of all art and truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Voyd of Art:</hi> For what reason, or rule, doth allow, any reasonable disputer, to make a distribution and so an opposition of parts, that are in consent, and agreement one with another, such is this here propounded. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is either proper; as Gods ordinances, or improper, as the adjuncts to these ordinances, which appertaine therunto: As if a man should say: Ther be two kynd of byrds, either an eagle, or her feathers.</p>

               <p>A midst these many mistakes, we have a ground of graunt from the Rej. his owne words: That kneeling in the act of receaving, cannot be improper, but proper worship: For we kneele not either, to man or to the bread, but to God directly, and it is to lift up his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>Every act of obedience to the first table, is not only permitted, but required in the first table.</p>
               <p>But the acts of improper immediate worship are acts of obedience to the first table: therfore they are not only permitted but required.</p>

               <p>The mistery is, that no worship is false, which hath any thing in it of the will of God, And ther is some worship true and good, which is not of the will of God as a cause, but only according to it, as not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or forbidding: This is the Papists plea just against our Doctrines for their traditions.

this alone it appeareth, that the example of fasting is abused, when it is paraleled, with crosse and surplice: 2.

Fasting may be called worship by a trope, as being a speciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of some extraordinary worship, and yet not be a speciall kynd of immediate reductive worship, or any other kynd. 4. The truth is that fasting, is such a help to extraordinary humiliation, as moderate fasting, is to extraordinary thanksgiving, and therfore is no more worship, then Christian fasting: And to this purpose do our divines answer, concerning this place, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily objected by every Papist, as here by the Rej.

Moses sheweth that the freest offerings were <hi>to be according as God had blessed them,</hi> from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, it had beene synne for any Israelite, whom God had plentifully blessed, to offer a payre of pigeons in stead of a bullock, or two, upon his owne meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: 2. where that proportion was observed the choice of a goat, before a sheep, or a sheepe before a goat, was no formall worship: 3. That it had beene unlawfull for the Preists out of their pleasure, to institute any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate free offering, either ordinarily to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or upon occasion of a mans forwardnesse to such a duety, i.e. that every free offering should be a goat, or at the least, that a goat should be one part of it, which is the presumption of our Prelats, about the reductive worship of the crosse. 4. It was not left to any mans pleasure, for to appoint an offering not appointed of God, in the speciall or least kynd, but onely to choose among those, which God had instituted, that which did best agree, with his condition and occasion, as it is also now of psalmes, prayers, doctrines, interpretations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, let every man offer, according as God hath furnished him: But from hence to inferr the free choise of offering now to God, a crosse, surplice, holy water, images, this is, as if one should then have concluded
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:245:142"/>
from that freedome, the free offering of certaine butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes, or such like pretty, odd, vermyn not prescribed in the law, nor by name forbidden.</p>

                     <hi>The second example is taken from Salomons worship, at the dedication of the temple, 1. Kings</hi> 8.2. <hi>2. Chron.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>which he thus conformeth to his notions: The number of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks and Sheepe, were worship in respect of the end and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance only, the Cere. of prayer, kneeling upon a Scaffold, &amp; stretching out of hands, were worship reductive</hi> ad modum in genere suo, <hi>having respect to the manner in the generall kynd thereof: The burning of Sacrifices in the floore of the Court, was only lawfull before the brasen altar was consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and upon the present necessity:</hi> But 1. in the number of Bullocks and Sheepe, ther was not a different wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but a different degree of the same worship, as a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger prayer or sermon is not another worship then a shorter, but another degree of extension in the same worship, Surely to pray and prayse God twice, thrice or seven tymes in a day, are no different worships, one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, but onely more or lesse exercise of the same worship. 2. Kneeling &amp; stretching out the hands, were not worship in respect to a generall manner, but speciall externall worship, as being naturall, immediate expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the inward: As for the scaffold that Salomon kneeled on, that was no more worship, then the asse was upon which our Saviour did ride. Lastly, seing none of these things carying the nature of worship, were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ordinary observances, neither might the Preists in any convocation, have made such, these examples are nothing like ours in quaestion.</p>

                  <p>Is it so great a fault to suspect the Def. of some wrong-doeing, or of using Rhetoricke, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in variation of phrases?

                     </gap>he proposition which formerly was sayd to be denied because there is no mention in it of any terme here distinguished) let any man of reason consider the sense of this distinction: Ceremonies are eyther substantiall, Divine, Doctrinall, that is, suche as have particular determination in the worde, or else not substantiall, that is, suche as have no particular determination in the word; the former have particular determination in the word; but the later have not.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:245:155"/>
that by this distinction, God cannot appoint a <hi>mere Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie</hi> in his worship, though man can: for if God appoint any Ceremonie, it is <hi>(eo ipso nomine)</hi> doctrinall, substantiall, morall. No merveyl therfor if God have not appointed <hi>mere Ceremonies,</hi> seing he cannot appoynt any suche, but man onely can doe that.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Concerning Heb. 3.2. it is further answered sect. 4. that the faithfulnesse of Christ, and Moses was aequall, and alike in reall faithfulnesse, because <hi>they both did that which was commanded them of God.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this be true, yet if it were Gods revealed will, that more immediate meanes of worship should be insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Christian Churche, then Christ hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, who was ordeyned to institute the meanes of worship, and Moses (as is here supposed) instituted all suche meanes of worship in the old Testament, as God would have instituted, it followeth, that the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, was not so extended to all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Churche, as Moses his faithfulnesse was.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Concerning faithfulnesse in Rituall ordinances, the Def. mentioned the ordeyning of two essentiall and necessarie Sacraments. Which allegation the Replier esteemed <hi>nothing</hi> to the purpose. <hi>Yes verely</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>it is some thing.</hi> It is in deed <hi>something,</hi> but this <hi>something</hi> is <hi>nothing</hi> at all perteyning to mere Rituals. For so the Defend. and Rejoynder both confesse expresly, that these two Sacraments are not <hi>mere Rituals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Def. addeth, that as Moses appointed Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:245:155"/>
so Christ removed them. Whiche explication of Scripture being blamed by the Replier, the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der answereth 1. That it is <hi>not an interpretation of the text, but an answer to an objection from the text.</hi> And yet the same Rejoynder in his Summe of the Def. his answer that it is <hi>a comparison of the fidelitie of Christ and Moses.</hi> And all the text, and objection, from the text, consisteth in this comparison. 2. It is a proper answer sayth the Rejoynder, for <hi>if Christ was faithfull in removing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, before necessarie, then be neede not praescribe other Ceremonies then simplie necessarie, and so not all mere Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</hi> Is not this a proper consequence? ther is no connexion at all betwixt the first and second part, the appointed Ceremonies are therfore onely called <hi>simplie necessarie,</hi> becaus they were appointed by Divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and yet of suche it is sayd, that Christ <hi>neede not</hi> appoynt other, wheras in deed he could not appoynt other; and that he <hi>needed</hi> not appoynt mere Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that is Humane, which if he should have doen, it had implied a contradiction, mere Ceremonies (in the Def. and Rejoynders opinion being suche as are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by authoritie divine. 3. It is added by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder that <hi>the fidelitie of Christ appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red in removing those Ceremonies of Moses, and the thing compared is fidelitie.</hi> Both whiche are true, but not to the purpose: because the comparison is not in fidelitie abstractly considered, but in fidelitie about the building and furnishing all the howse of God; of whiche, the abolishing of Mosaicall Ceremonies, is no substantiall part.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. About the Repl: his answer to a place cited
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:245:156"/>
out of Calvin the Rejoynder observeth <hi>much irreligious way wardnesse, with falshood, and three grosse untruthes, in one short sentence.</hi> Whiche it pleased him to note also in the <hi>Table</hi> of his principall or most observable <hi>Contents</hi>: the Replier found guiltie of three grosse untruthes together. p. 15. This peal of terrible words make suche a noise in the readers ears, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scarse hear, what may be spoken for the partie accused.

                  <p>The first <hi>wayward, false, irreligious, and grosse untruth</hi> is, that the Def. should have dealt more plainly, if he had cited Bellarmine, and why (trow ye) is it so great a crime, for to say the Def. might have dealt more plainly? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (forsooth) <hi>no dealing could be more plaine, then to set downe the very words of Calvin, with the place, where they are to be found.</hi> Now be it so, yet it is not so hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous an offence to say some dealing, might be playner then that which is most playne, but as the Secretaries and Proctors of our Prelats cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The second way ward, false, irreligious, and grosse untrueth</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:245:156"/>
is, that the same words, whiche the Def. citeth out Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, are found in Bellarmine, de Pontif. l. 4. c. 17. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wherof, the Rejoynder doeth averre <hi>upon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> Now here is to be marked, that the Repl. spake not of every word the same, nor understood <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall</hi> samenesse, but <hi>like</hi> onely, and so did the Rejoynder understand him, when he sayth <hi>upon my credite ther be no suche words any where in Bellarmin,</hi> of <hi>suche</hi> words is the credit pawned.</p>

But the law of the gospel was given to all the world i.e, to the peoples of Sundrie nations, and was moreover to endure to the end of the world, and therefore this law of the Gospel could not so easily Determin all things in particular as did the other, that no other lawes might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed necessarie then what are found in the new Test. Nor is it possible for diverse nations to agree together in the same lawes and rites, and therfore God judged it far better if he delivered in the Gospel the most general and commune lawes, leaving the more speciall things concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and articles of faith to be ordered by the Apostles and their Successours according as circumstances of time and place should require.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin sayth, that the Lord hath both faithfully comprised, and perspicuously declared necessaries.</hi> Bellarmine sayth, that <hi>God in the Gospel hath delivered unto us the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon laws, concerning the Sacraments, and Articles of faith.</hi> Calvin sayth, that <hi>Christ would not praescribe singularly and specially concerning externall discip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine, and Ceremonies, for that he foresaw these thinges to depend on the occasions and opportunities of times, nor did he thinke one forme to accord with all ages.</hi> Bellarminus sayth, that <hi>all speciall thinges could not so easily be determined in the Gospel, so as more laws shold not be necessarie: because ther must be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of laws and ritualls, according to the diversitie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Peoples, places and times.</hi> I doubt not but the Rejoynder upon consideration of this collation, will repent him of pawning his credit for <hi>no suche words in all Bel.</hi> but I esteeme D.B. his credit better, then I will hold it from his person, let onely his Rejoyning <hi>credit be hence esteemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third <hi>wayward, false, irreligious, and grosse untrueth is, that in that place of Calvin, ther is nothing at all, which without grosse aequivocation, will serve the Def. his purpose.</hi> If this were not true, yet I see no <hi>wool</hi> answerable to so great a <hi>crie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us see what the Rejoynder can finde in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines words, for the Def. his purpose. First (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>Calvin differenceth matters meerly rituall, from matters reall, as the Def. doeth.</hi> Whiche <hi>as the Def. doeth,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:245:157"/>
is not true. For the Def. differenceth <hi>Ceremonies</hi> into <hi>substantiall and meerly Rituall,</hi> p: 7. wheras Calvin doeth not difference Ceremonies, nor maketh any mention of mere Ritualls.</p>
                  <p>Take away that <hi>as the Def. doeth,</hi> and then the Repl. doeth so also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Calvin (sayth the Def.) sheweth that <hi>Christ hath left mere Rituals at the Churches choyse under generall rules onely.</hi> Now heare that aequivocation which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epl. spake of, for by Ceremonies, Calvin understandeth no suche thinge, as the Def. and Rejoynder doeth by <hi>mere Ritualls.</hi> The Def. and Rej. (as Bellarmine doeth) comprehend under that name Mysticall Ceremonies, which the Rejoynder calleth <hi>double or treble Ceremonies:</hi> but Calvin meaneth onely <hi>single</hi> matter of order and Decencie. For this cause it was, that the Repl. sayd, the Def. should have dealt more plainly in citing of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, then of Calvin.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. About Calvins meaning the Rejoynder striveth muche, but cannot draw it to his purpose. 1. He gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>Calvin meant not to teache, that men may praescribe at their discretion mysticall signes in the Churche</hi> whiche is all that we desire. 2. His meaning is (sayth the Rej) that <hi>what Ceremonies the nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some toleration of some Ceremonies like unto the Iewish, Calvin is sayd to give, sect. 14. But that which he

He might as well denie the quaestion to be of sacred Ceremonies, or as he calleth them of <hi>double</hi> Ceremonies, but onely of Ceremonies. And thus is that very ambiguous aequivocation wherwith the Def. was charged, by his Rejoynder, confessed. For what is else but to aequivocate, when all men know the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be of one kinde of rites onely, to bring an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which concerne rites in deed, but not of that kinde?</p>

Those that say, the Ceremonies are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, because they are not commanded, though they be not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doe evidently mean, that though they be not specially and by name forbidden, yet they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally forbidden, by that rule which forbiddeth man to adde any thing in Gods worship, unto that which God hath commanded, for suche a shot ther is no need of ordinance: as good may be made out of any bell that hath a clapper in it.</p>

                  <p>THis passage will soon be dispached, if the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion may be cleared. The purpose of David, was eyther <hi>conditionall</hi> onely, if God should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and second the businesse, or else <hi>absolute,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suche suspending condition, as supposing that God did allow, and would prosperously assist him, for the accomplishment of it. If it was of the former sort, and so farr as it was considerable within those limits, ther is no quaestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but it was godly, and worthy of all honour. But if it was absolute, it cannot be excused from some mixture of praesumtion. For whatsoever a man may absolutely intend to doe, that he may doe, but for the doeing of such a thing, as building of a Temple then unto God, the Rejoynder himself confesseth it to have been unlawfull, for David, without further warrant: and so confesseth also, that the absolute intention could not be lawfull. Hence are these speaches of the Rej. <hi>That which may be lawfully purposed, with submission to Gods pleasure, might not be doen without his pleasure knowen, and leave given. Wee grant, that David could not build the House, nor so muche as set out the place for it, without leave and direction from God.</hi>

Now that Davids purpose was absolute, it is more then probable, by that which the Rejoynder confesseth, viz. that Nathan <hi>was unadvised in saying to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If Davids purpose had not been absolute before, yet upon Nathans counsell, from which no dissent of his is any ways insinuated, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came absolute. 3. If David had dissented from Nathan in that poynte, he ought to have admonished Nathan of his sayling, and would also no doubt have doen so or at the least, it would have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concluded betwixt them two, that counsel must be sought, and expected of God; but Nathan not being corrected, but rather confirmed by David, as David was by him, they both were (wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These things being considered, it were but vaine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to prosecute the Rejoynder in particular litigations about this matter, which would be litle else then repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the same things. I will onely therfore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Def. his <hi>retorsion,</hi> and the Rejoynder his <hi>shot</hi> out of this place: which also should have passed, but for the boasting wherwith they are (with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation) advanced above their measure.</p>
                  <p>The Def. his retortion is thus. <hi>This Act of Davids
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:245:161"/>
without speciall warrant were commended by God. Ergo, all institutions of Ceremonies by man, belonging to Gods service, are not therfor to be condemned, because they want expresse warrant. This Act.</hi> (sayth the Def. that is (sayth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder) this conditionall affection not lawfull to be brought into <hi>act.</hi> From suche a conditionall affection, he argueth, to absolute and actuall institutions, by what rule of consequence I know not. The Rejoynder tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us the clean contrary argument, as before was declared.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder his <hi>shot</hi> is thus in short: <hi>David (as M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Cartwritconfesseth) had generall warrant from the word of God, for building the Temple, and had no word to forbid him to doe it (til that by Nathan) therfor for David to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to build (til that forbidding by Nathan, was lawfull.</hi> I answer 1. the conclusion (being understood of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall purpose (as the Rejoynder expounded it) we willingly gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as neyther making, nor ever having made any quaestion about it. 2. David had no generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for his building of the temple, neyther doeth M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Cartwrite say any suche thing, but onely that <hi>it was revealed there should be suche a Temple.</hi> Which was no more warrant for David to purpose the building of it, then other Prophecies were warrant for somme (upon supposition) to purpose the destroying of it. 3. Though ther was no word of God which particularly or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbid David to build the Temple, yet ther was word enough in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nerall forbidding him to attempt any suche thinge, untill he should receyve further Commission. So the Rejoynder before confessed: <hi>the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:245:161"/>
designation of place, manner, man, and time, did belonge to God</hi>: and was therfore forbidden to David, and so the building forbidden, untill that designation should come from God.</p>
                  <p>Now adde unto this shot of the Rejoynder thus repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but a litle altering the charge and turning the pieces mouths. viz. That our questioned Ceremonies have not so muche generall warrant, as that it is any where in Scripture revealed, <hi>ther should be a Crosse, and Sirplice,</hi> and that the places of Scripture which seem to forbid them, could never yet be otherwise cleared; and then see how it maketh for the Rejoynder his cause.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The rest of this 12. section is spent about the Def, his wonderfull wondring, at our symbolizing with Bellarmine and other Papists, because that as they distinguish sinnes into <hi>mortal and veniall,</hi> so wee (sayth he) make a distinction of <hi>against, and beside</hi> the word. About which, the Rejoynder granteth that Chrysostom did well use this distinction, in matters of <hi>doctrine,</hi> yet he sayth it is not to be extended unto matters of <hi>Ceremonie.</hi> But (the question being onely about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction) it is in the Def. and Rejoynder their opinion farr more appliable to ceremonies, then to doctrines: because they holde many Ceremonies lawfull <hi>beside</hi> the word, which are not <hi>against</hi> it, though they holde no suche difference of doctrines. Now this distinction
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:245:163"/>
was used by us, according to their conceit, more then our owne. The like is acknowleged of Iunius, that he distinguisheth well betwixt <hi>beside and against</hi> the Word, in the question of <hi>traditions devised for divine worship, 1. e. essentiall worship, particularly determined by God.</hi> Which is not so, for in that place, Cont. 3. l. 4. c. 17. an 10. Iunius hath no question eyther about <hi>essentialls,</hi> or <hi>worship,</hi> or <hi>traditions,</hi> but onely about <hi>Ecclesiasticall laws, binding the conscience.</hi> And if he had, yet that clause <hi>particularly determined by God,</hi> would spoile all: because in suche thinges ther can be nothing eyther against, or beside the Word. But if it were true, what is the difference, betwixt Iunius and us? The Rejoynder sayth that <hi>wee confounde rites with worship, and yet confesse rites not to be particularly described as the other.</hi> Which is neyther so, nor so, except he meane those rites, which he calleth <hi>double or treble ceremonies</hi>: and therin we have Iunius so for us, that not onely in other places, but also in the words next goeing before this in quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, he sayth generally, <hi>in divine things to coyne new lawes is nothing but to decline.</hi>

to use the same distinction, but in another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Let the distinction therfore passe (for shame) and dispute of the meaning.

Nay in this fashion, the Def. and Rejoynder may accuse our blessed martyrs of symbolizing with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists that were the murtherers of them.

                  <head>SECT. 13.14. Concerning the ancient fathers arguing negatively from Scripture.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. TO diverse sentences of ancient Writers, about this matter alledged, the generall answer is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. that they speak of thinges contrarie to Scripture: which when the Repl. granteth, complaining of the Def. his wilfull mistaking, or mis-interpreting our meaning, the Rejoynder lest he should seem lesse wilfull, repeateth the same imputation, which yet he acknowledgeth to be <hi>contrarie to the Repliers owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What should a man say to suche Rejoyners, that know full well our meaning, and yet will never leave threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping another meaning upon us.</p>
                  <p>Wee never sayd, or thought, that all particular rites pertaining to order and decencie, are punctually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Scripture. Wee never dreamed that all suche rites being beside the particular determination of the Scripture, are against it, wee speak of <hi>double or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> rites as the Rejoynder stileth them, which no mere order and decencie doeth necessarily require, but onely the mere will of man injoine.</p>
                  <p>All this the Rejoynder knoweth: and yet he ceasseth not to beat the ayre, with endelesse repetitions of this imputation, guilded over with some varietie of tanting phrases, that it may be the easlier, swallowed by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:245:165"/>
reader. 2. It is secondly answered by the Def. that the ancient writers speak of doctrines, not of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Wherunto the Repl. granting that to be true for the most part yet answereth, that the trueth of their sayings may be taken so generally, as to include all re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igious Ceremonies. Here the Rejoynder objecteth that limitation <hi>(for the most part)</hi> is onely to <hi>abuse</hi> the simple, and that the ambiguous terme of religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, is a <hi>bush</hi> to hide I know not what in.</p>
                  <p>Now for the former charge Compare here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigment and Def. The later accusation of <hi>hiding-bush,</hi> etc. cannot otherwise be avoyded (as it seemeth) except to avoyd the same, we would upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we are to speak of the questioned kinde of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, repeat the Rejoynder his beadroul of termes: <hi>double or treble significant, sacred by application, mutable, ambalatorie, arbitrarie, reductively sacramentall, morall Ceremonies, immediate worship, in respect of meanes by vertue of some thing else, in respect of the manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductively, in respect of the utmost ende Divine worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whersoever we observe not these termes partly of his owne forging, since the Replie was written he may as well spie a <hi>bush</hi> over our head, as in this place. It is thirdly answered, that a generall proposition may well be extended beyond one speciall conclusion to which it is upon occasion applied. To this (after that out of splen (as I take it) he styleth it <hi>the mans stomacke</hi>) the Rejoynder answereth that it may onely be applyed to other of the like kinde. This therfor is onely the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, whether those Ceremonies which bear all those
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:245:165"/>
titles even now rehearsed, bee not of the like kinde, or have not one common nature, with some of those thinges which the Rejoynder calleth substantiall, and doctrinall, poynts: of which we have disputed before, andshall after, by Gods grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Tertullians wordes: <hi>Prohibetur quod non ultro est permissum: that is prohibited, which is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> the first answer made by the Def. was, that <hi>our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are permitted.</hi> Heerunto it was replied, that Tertullians meaning must needs be of other permission then the Def. can challenge to our Ceremonies, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ther should be no sense in his wordes. The reason is, because the Def. doeth not say that our Cerem. are otherwise permitted, then that they are not forbidden. Whiche kinde of permission if Tertullian understood, then his saying is: <hi>that is prohibited, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder here for resolution of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie sayth, that <hi>Tertullians meaning was to account that not to be permitted by the word, against which any reasons out of the word may be given, though ther be no particular word against it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if he had attended unto the question, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it was onely what Tertullian in this place meant by this phrase <hi>not permitted,</hi> and that his meaning for the word must be the same, with that immediately before opposed: <hi>Quod non prohibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ultro permissum est,</hi> he would not have given that glosse, for then the meaning of this sentence must be: that which hath no particular word

                  <p>The Def. his second answer was, that wee may blush, to speak of Tertullian, because he professeth traditions in the same book. It was answered, that then all may blush, which allege the Fathers for that which they in other places gainesay. The Rejoynder graunting, that those neede not blush, because the Fathers sometime are deafe and hear not themselves speak, and in some particulars left their sound generall principles, yet will needs have us blush (if it be not <hi>unpossible,</hi> as his Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning charitie suspecteth it is) because they never held that which wee allege them for. But how doeth this appear, <hi>because they allowed of sundrie Ceremonies not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the word.</hi> Now except he could prove, they were not as deafe on this the ceremoniall ear, or side, as they were on the other, or that they did not leave their sound generalls, in the particulars of Ceremonies, as well or ill as in other.</p>

                  <p>And that the Rejoynder cannot prove this, D. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton sheweth in his appeal. pag. 324. They that erred in points of doctrine, could not be altogether free from some sprinklings and spots of Ceremoniall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p>Howsoever this doeth neyther prove the replie none, nor yet non-sufficient. 3. He pronounceth it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,</hi> that the question here is not of <hi>mere</hi> Ceremonies and rites: which charge he groundeth upon the word <hi>specially</hi> in the service of God. But that word doeth shew the specialitie of our question to be about the matters of Gods service, or worship, suche as significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are, and mere order is not. 4. Hee is styled <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved man,</hi> that thinketh signification put upon a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, doeth necessarily make it more then a mere Ceremonie.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, that if he that thinketh so, is a deceyved man, then the Rejoynder doeth deceyve, when in his Manuduction, pag. 33. and 39. he teacheth that speciall instituted signification, doeth make a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie <hi>double or treble</hi> more then mere single rites of order.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second quotation is out of D. Mortons Appeal, l. 2. c. 4. sect. 4. where is confessed, he speaketh of Ceremonies, but of <hi>Doctrinall</hi> onely, suche as <hi>sopping in of bread into the cup, etc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherupon question was made, why this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie should be accounted more doctrinall, or more unlawfull, then the Crosse in Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>To the former part of this quaere, the Rejoynder <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:245:168"/>
that the Def. hee himself &amp; all suche, in this question meane by Doctrinall, a thing taught in the word and that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is taught in the word.</hi> As if it had been asked, why the Sacrament is more doctrinall then the Crosse? and not if Sopping be so? But here it is diligently to be observed, how wee are deluded in this wholle argument, and other also, with the shadow of a wordly distinction, betwixt <hi>Doctrinall, and Rituall</hi> Ceremonies. Wee say, God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Ceremonies properly religious, which are to be used. They answer, that this is true of all <hi>doctrinall</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but not of <hi>rituall</hi>: that is to say, as here we are taught, <hi>God hath appointed all Ceremonies that he hath appointed, but not all that he hath not appointed.</hi> Wee say, it is not lawfull for man to adde unto Gods instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in religious worship. They answer, this is true of <hi>Doctrinall,</hi> but not of <hi>Rituall</hi> additions: that is, by this interpretation, <hi>Man may not adde unto Gods institutions, any of Gods institutions, but mans onely.</hi> Let this be borne in minde for all answers that hange on the hinges of this distinction.</p>
                  <p>To the other part of the question, the Rejoynder answers that <hi>sopping of bread in wine is worse then the Crosse. 1. because the crosse maketh no alteration, of what Christ did ordayne saying doe this. 2. it is not substituted in the place of Baptisme, as sops in wine were by those Haerteikes in place of the Supper. 3. it is not esteemed an instrumentall signe of any grace given by the use of it, as they took their sops to be. 4. their sopping destroied the very Sacrament.</hi> And for these differences, the Repl. is bidden to <hi>hang downe his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:245:168"/>
head,</hi> for asking suche a quaestion. But 1. Addition is as evill as alteration. For when Christ sayd, <hi>doe this,</hi> he meant as well, doe this onely, as doe this all. <hi>Fac hoc totum: fac hoc tantum</hi>: as Zanchie expoundeth it. Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also is some alteration, if not of the things institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet of the institution, as making it unsufficient, or incomplete, by it self alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sops and wine were not <hi>substituted</hi> in place of bread and wine, but were bread and wine. Neyther were they first or onely, or (for any thing appeareth) at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> used by <hi>Haereticks,</hi> as the Rejoinder for his advantage, without ground, avoucheth, but by ancient Churches, at least in some cases: as is manifest out of Prosper, <hi>de Promissionibus, Dimidium temporis, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Puella particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam corporis Domini intinctam percepit, etc.</hi> Sopping was so farre from being a matter of Haeresie, that as it seemeth, it was receyved among the Fathers, so longe as infants communicating in the Lords Supper, which was, as D. Morton confesseth, Appeale, lib. 2. cap. 13. sect. 3. for sixe hundred yeers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sopping of bread in wine, considered abstractly from bread and wine, was no signe instituted as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of grace.</p>
                  <p>For so sayth Cassander pag. 1027. out of Ivo: <hi>this custome of Sopping prevailed onely through feare of shedding and not by direct authority.</hi> 4. It is too severe a sentence,<note place="margin">

                     </note> against those ancient Christians, in Prospers time and (which is more) as Cassander and Hospinian judge, in Ciprians, that they destroyed the very substance of Sacrament. The setting forth of Christs death was not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:245:169"/>
excluded, though some part of the bloud was represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively joined unto the body. A man is dead, that lieth in his bloud, though some of it soak againe into his body. The Fathers, sixe hundred yeers together, did not destroy the substance of the Sacrament. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto therfor appeareth no cause for the Repl. <hi>to hang downe his head.</hi> Let us see if more cause be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons he maketh betwixt sopping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and crossing.</p>
                  <p>The first was, the bread and wine (the onely things used in sopping) were ordeyned by Christ: so is not the Crosse. The Rejoynder answereth here nothing to the purpose, save onely, that they were ordeyned to be used <hi>apart.</hi> From whence it followeth onely that it is unlawfull to use them not apart. And so it followeth, that Baptisme must as well be used <hi>apart,</hi> orseparated from the Crosse: because it was ordeyned so to be used, and the Crosse was not ordeyned for any religious use, eyther apart, or with other thinges.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that sopping hath some agreement with reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Crossing hath none. The Rejoynder hence maketh two consequences: <hi>1. Ergo Christ in ordeyning the Sacrament otherwise, hath doen some thing not agreable to reason,</hi> 2. <hi>Ergo the Churche in Crossing hath been void of all reason, fiftee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred yeare.</hi> And upon these groundes, he crieth out of <hi>madnesse.</hi> But so madnesse may be found in any assertion, if it be first put out of the right wittes or sense, as this is. For the meaning was not, that Sopping is agreable to right reason in the Sacrament, but in civill use, where the aeriall Crosse hath none.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:245:169"/>
Yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be added, if it were lawfull for men to adde to Gods ordinances in the Sacraments, then ther would be founde more probabilitie of reason to bring in sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the use of bread &amp; wine as a manner of food, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mysticall aereall crosse into the use of water which is no manner of washing. As for the Churche, it hath not universally used the crosse so longe, except the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and others like unto them, were none of the Churche.</p>
                  <p>The same Churche, that used crossing, used also for divers hundreds of years, to give the Sacrament of of the Supper unto infants, without reason, and the continuation of the Crosse more hundreds of years, addeth no reason unto it, except reason in suche things doeth increase with their age. Many thinges have been used in the Churche without reason: or else ther is reason wee should still use all that have been used, <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi> If ther be any good reason in the crosse, let that be tried by reason, and not by slipperie conjectures taken from the persons using it.</p>
                  <p>The third comparison was, that Sopping was used by Christ, at the very table of the Supper, but Crossing was never so muche honored by him or his Apostles, as to use it at any time. The Rejoynder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that <hi>this argument would prove as well, that the eating of a Paschall lambe before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be better then Sprinkling of water on the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ehead of the Baptized. Because CHRIST did that, and not this.</hi> But this is not <hi>so well.</hi> For that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:245:170"/>
1. Sprinkling of water is no instituted ceremonie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from that washing which Christ and his Apostles used. 2. It is very probable that the Apostles goeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the colder part of the world, did use sprinkling.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning a Paschall lambe, used before the Sacrament, as a Ceremonie morally significant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductively Sacramentall, I see not why it should not be praeferred before the Crosse or any suche invention, even because Christ did use it, if that Circumcision be now a lawfull Christian Ceremonie, as the Def. and Rejoynder professe and mainteyne, pag. 285. It is also crediblie reported a great Bishop, not long since living, that every Easter day, he used to have a wholle lambe, praepared after the Pascall manner, brought to his table. D. B. knoweth well who it was, and of whom he hath heard it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth comparison was, that sopping was no new signe, but Crossing is. The Rejoynder opposeth that <hi>it had been an abomination to eat the Pascall lambe sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but the addition of sitting or leaning on couches (though a new signe added by them selves) was lawfull etc.</hi> Of which speache, the first part is granted, viz. a sodden lambe had been an abomination: neyther isa sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping communion excused. In the second, ther is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable partiallitie, in that he calleth setting an <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Passeover, and yet in the same answer, with the same breath, denieth the crosse to be <hi>any addition</hi> unto Baptisme. The ground of all is rotten, viz. that sitting was a religious significant Ceremonie instituted by men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:245:170"/>These thinges considered, let any man judge what cause the Rejoynder had to talke in this place, of the Repl: his <hi>roome-conscience, contentious spirit, smitten with giddinisse, forsaken of wisdome</hi>?</p>
                  <p>In that which followeth about sopping, ther is no new matter to fasten any dispute on, proper to this place, but only why some ceremoniall sopping may not be used, as neare to the Communion, as the Crosse unto Baptisme? The Rejoynder answereth. 1. <hi>because it is not so safe, to use visible elementarie signes in holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a transient Character. 2. Because suche sopping were worse then the use of any other bodily element, as comming so neer to the very institution.</hi> Where 1. it is to be marked, that a religious Ceremonie, of soppes and wine, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before or after the Communion, is not found unlawfull, but onely <hi>not so safe</hi> as the Crosse. By the same proportion, Ceremonious eating of flesh, and fish, in the solemnitie of the Communion, is onely <hi>not so safe,</hi> not unlawfull. Hath not the Crosse brought us to a faire market? 2. If the Crosse be not a visible elementary signe, what kinde of signe is it? <hi>Character</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a most proper <hi>signe: aereall</hi> is <hi>elementarie</hi>: crossing is eyther <hi>visible,</hi> or else it is no sensible signe: because it cannot be heard, felt, tasted, or smelled.</p>
                  <p>If he meaneth a <hi>permanent substance,</hi> beside that he cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his owne definition of a Ceremonie, <hi>an action &amp;c.</hi> in other places he defendeth <hi>images,</hi> in this very secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he leaned even now, upon <hi>couches,</hi> as upon safe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies amonge the Iews.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The outward neernesse or likenesse of a humane
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:245:171"/>
Ceremonie, to a Divine Sacrament, is allowed on elsewhere by the Def. and Rejoynder both: as when cap. 3. sect 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they mainteyne as Christian, a Ceremoniall sprinkling of men with holy water, wherin, both water and sprinkling, have as great an outward neernesse unto the outward eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Baptisme, as any thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have.</p>
                  <p>If the outward materiall shew of neernesse unto a Divine Sacrament, doeth make a Ceremonie unallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then muche more, suche a formall significant neernesse, as is betwixt Baptisme, signifying our putting on of Christ crucified, and the Crosse signifying our putting on of courage to fight under, and for Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
                  <p>See heer what further is to be sayd of Iuel, and Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, after the Def. and they are conferred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Replier, affecting brevitie, and finding no new matter of dispute about the allegations out of B. Iewel, and D. Whitaker, passeth them over, with this reason: <hi>in excusing of them, nothing is sayd by the Def. which hath not formerly been confuted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Rejoynder doeth not goe about to shew that any new thing is brought forth by the Def. about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the purpose, but onely catcheth up that word <hi>excusing,</hi> and repeating the accusation, of impertinent alledging them for the negative argument from Scriptures, in case of Ceremonies, which they doe except, hee taketh upon him to discover an <hi>undoubted close meaning</hi> of the word <hi>excuse</hi>: and therupon accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not onely the Repl. but I know not how many (<hi>they, them</hi>) of being <hi>scornfull out of pride of spririt.</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:245:171"/>
Who would have thought that one word (used accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary courteous fashion of those which in stead of plaine denying, use the phrase, (<hi>excuse me)</hi> could have stirred up suche a passion, or occasioned suche an injurious surmize? But to <hi>excuse</hi> this, which I hope we may doe without any offense, I will yeeld so muche unto his importunitie and challenge, as breifly to shew, that neythe B. Iuell, nor D. Whit. did excepte suche Ceremonies as ours, when they speak of the Scriptures fullnesse. Iuel in the first article sect. 29. alledgeth for the negative argument, Origen, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that in the Lords supper <hi>the bread is to be eaten, and not reserved unto the morrow, because that Christ did not commande that reservation to the morrow.</hi> Now that this reservation is a ceremonie, and a lawfull one also in D.

                     </gap> of his Appeal, where (lib. 2. cap. 5. sect. 1.) he sayth plainely, that <hi>we may grant a longer time of reservation then two or three days, with a reference unto the intent of participating of it by eating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>D. Morton therfor cannot be defended in saying that Iuel excepted ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>For D. Whitaker his not excepting of significant Ceremonies from the Negative argument, may appear partly by his negative silence, and partly by his expresse assertion, <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> pag. 203. for unto Bellarmine his assertion, that the Churche may institute new Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, for ornament, and for signification, he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that of <hi>ornament</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Another omission, wherof the Repl is accused, for which he is called a <hi>gentle</hi> man, is, that the Def. in the ende of this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, recalleth the state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, distinguishing betwixt <hi>mere</hi> Ceremonies, &amp; <hi>mixt,</hi> by <hi>mere</hi> meaning altogether <hi>indifferent,</hi> and by <hi>mixt,</hi> some way <hi>forbidden,</hi> All which (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>the gentle Replier passeth by.</hi> Now sure he might also him self have passed this by, with more credit of the Def.</p>
                  <p>For what sense is in suche a stated question: <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture doeth condemne suche Ceremonies, as it leaveth indiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet concerning the mixture of ceremonies with <hi>opinion of holinesse, justice, merit, efficacie, or reall necessitie,</hi>

which here the Rejoynder maketh the onely grounds of <hi>forbidding,</hi> he is now, in suche gentle manner as is requisite, answered, in the head of <hi>Difference betwixt popish Ceremonies and ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. After this, the Repl. is charged with <hi>quarrelling,</hi> onely because he sayth the Def. answered nothing to a maine poynt, upon which this first argument, in the Abrigement, doeth depende, namely the rules of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that they should be <hi>needfull, and profitable, for aedification, the more comely and orderly performance of Gods instituted service,</hi> which being wanting in our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies they cannot be innocent, though all were granted which the Def. mainteyneth. And why is this a <hi>quarell</hi>?</p>
                  <p>The Repl. (as it seemeth) can neyther by speaking, nor houlding his peace, gaine so muche favour with the Rejoynder as that in eyther he may passe without some shrewd censorious note. If he holde his peace, he is a <hi>gentle</hi> man, if he speak, he is a <hi>quarreller.</hi> But what are the reasons of blame in this place?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Defender (forsooth) was not tied to the Abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents order</hi> 2. <hi>It were idle to speak of directive rules, if all humane Ceremonies be unlawfull.</hi> 3. <hi>If God hath left rules for direction of his Churche in rites and orders Ecclesiasticall, then he hath not determined of them in his word.</hi> 4. <hi>The Defender hath mainteyned, that our Ceremonies are agreable to the rules of Gods word: so as no Friar dare denie it, nor the Replier professing his name.</hi> In all which there is nothing of any moment. For 1. though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:245:173"/>
it were gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that the Def. was not tied to the Abridg, order, yet he may be tied to their matter, if he meant to give them a full answer. 2. Though it be needlesse to speak of directive rules in unlawfull Ceremonies as they are simplie unlawfull, yet seing rites of order and decencie, which are confessed lawfull, are by the Def. and others confounded with Cerem. by others estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unlawfull, it is very necessarie, that at least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of lawfull Ceremonies should be Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to agree unto suche Ceremonies as are defended to be lawfull. 3. Though God hath left rules for rites of order and decencie, yet he hath determined of all Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies significant by institution. 4. If the Def. had mainteyned our Ceremonies to be agreable unto these rules of Gods word, it had been the most compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way for the Rejoynder to have shewed, where, and how?</p>
                  <p>For that of the <hi>Friar,</hi> I easily beleive it. For not one <hi>friar</hi> of a thousend dare say that any allegation for Popish Ceremonies, though it be out of a leade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> legend, is not as plaine a demonstration as any is in all Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes. As for the Repliers <hi>concealing his name,</hi> that is a poor imputation, For I dare undertake, that the Rejoynder may have names enough for that which is sayd, and upon second thoughtes, he may professe his owne name among them, except he can shew, where and how the Def. hath indevored to prove our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies agreable to those rules about which this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is moved.

                     <p n="1">1. IN the first place, he taketh great exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one rule propounded by T. C. Rep. 2. pag. 62. that Ceremonies <hi>offend not any, especial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y the Churche of God.</hi> To this, D. Witgifts mayne answer was, that it was a rule <hi>for private men,</hi> &amp; not for the <hi>Churche.</hi> Of this the Rejoynder seemeth ashamed: and therfore seeketh after other exceptions. The first is, that the buisinesse for which this rule is given. 1. Cor. 10.32. <hi>was no matter of Churche Ceremonie, but of conversatien.</hi> Where he should have considered. 1. that some Churche Ceremonies had of ould their place in ordinarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so these two are not apposite one to the other. 2. that the eating of thinges offered to idols, was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Ceremonie, and therfor the absteining from it required in Christian Ceremonies. 3. that howsoever this rule is in this place applied, yet Rom. 14.15.20. it is by the same Apostle applied to some kinde of Iewish Churche Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>The second exception is, that this rule is <hi>morall</hi> and <hi>generall,</hi> belonging to all our actions not <hi>particular,</hi> for Ceremonies. But if by <hi>particular,</hi> he meaneth <hi>proper,</hi> then he overthroweth by this exception, all those rules by himself acknowledged for good <hi>(edification, comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:245:174"/>
and order</hi>:) because none of these are proper unto Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>The third is that a negative (suche as not to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous) <hi>may well</hi> be a <hi>caution,</hi> but not a <hi>rule.</hi> About which I will not contende.</p>
                     <p>It is sufficient for our purpose, if it be a caution strictly to be observed in Ceremonies, for suche a rule as is. <hi>Thou shall not murder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another rule urged by T. C. <hi>(that Ceremonies tende to the glorie of God</hi>) is also rejected by the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the former. But no new reason is brought, but onely that it is a comon rule, not proper to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which in many words is inlarged. Now for this (being the same with that formerly objected about not scandalizing) the same answer which before was given is sufficient. Yet this moreover is to be observed for both these rules: that though they be not proper to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, our Divines notwithstanding doe usually apply these and suche like generall rules unto Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, because the breache of these rules is common to (and as it seemeth inseparable from) humane signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies proper to religion, taken from Papists. They tende not in their nature to Gods glorie, but rather to the glory of them from whom they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved their being. They are scandalous both to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Papists, as afterward is declared.</p>
                     <p>So Vrsine, tom. 1. pag. 365. giveth one rule for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that they be not <hi>impious,</hi> which is not proper to Cerem: as Bucanus among the receyved rules of Cer. maketh this one, that they be not <hi>opposite to the analogie
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:245:174"/>
of faith.</hi> Because many of the Popish Ceremonies are impious and opposite to faith. And the same Vrsine addeth among other rules, that they be not <hi>scandalous.</hi> Iunius also in his Hidelberg, theses de tradit. th. 58. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in a good Ceremonie, that it be <hi>to the glorie of God.</hi> So others many. D. Willet in his <hi>Synopsis,</hi> pag. <hi>110.</hi> giveth 4. rules for Ceremonies: two of which are <hi>1. that all thinges be doen to the glory of God.</hi> 3. <hi>that all thinges ought to be doen without offence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet these rules in T. C. are suche as may not passe without the Rejoynder his censure, layd out in divers digressing pages.</p>
                     <p>Lastly the Rejoynder himself when he would give a rule for distinguishing good Ceremonies from bad, useth to make this one, that they be free from opinion of <hi>merit etc.</hi> And yet he will not say that suche opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are proper to Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. H. I. is in the last place brought in, as not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rules of T. C. Whiche (were it true) is litle materiall, or to the purpose. But what is noted out of H. I. repugnant? <hi>He injoineth the same rules to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the determining of mere Circumstances eyther Civill, or occasionall, but denieth the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>nies meerly Ecclesiasticall. And this is in effect to take those rules away, removing the Ceremonies which should be fram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d by them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay rather this in effect, and cause both, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the rules, and onely to point out the true objects to be ruled by them, and to give warning of abusive objects which have crept in under the colours of those

true. Whether this discretion of his betwixt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and properly religious Ceremonies, be justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or no, that question belongeth not to this digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but to three wholle chapters of this dispute. But if the Rejoynder would know who doeth directly take these rules, and the other also which he acknowlegeth, as they are Scripture Rules, it is one to whome both he and the Defend. are muche beholding to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                        <hi>Hooker</hi> by name, whoe p. 95. sayth plainely of one, as well as of other, <hi>they are Rules and Canons of that law, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in all mens hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts. The Churche had for ever, no lesse then now, stood b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>unde to observe them, whether the Apostle had mentioned them, or no.</hi> Neyther sayth hee therin muche amisse, except that same <hi>no lesse bounde.</hi> So that as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, the Defend, and Rejoynder making suche cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of proving our Ceremonies agreable to these Rules can very hardly shew, that they are agreable to light &amp; law of nature. After this light skirmish about 2. rules, the Rejoynder soundeth a retrait, and sayth, he <hi>will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the consideration of the Agreement of our Ceremonies to the true Rules, unto a fitter place.</hi> But a fitter place can scarce be founde, for here it was challenged by the Replier, here it was promised by the Rejoynder when he craved leave to speak <hi>more fully</hi> of rules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:245:175"/>
profitable for the aedification of the people, by the more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly performance of that service, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was not for nothing that he called the challenge a <hi>quarrell,</hi> as insinuating it was not a thing fitte to be medled in. The truth is the Rej. in his Conscience, holdeth our Cerem. incommodious, or inexpedient, though not simplie unlawfull: and therfore can finde no place to shew, that they are needfull, and profitable for aedification. I doubt, whether another speciall Commande from the Kinge, would bringe him to printe a treatise about that question?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>If this place then faileth them, or serveth not their turne, are not our Ceremonies confessed to be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any warrant of the word, at least in the New Testament?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now that it doeth not make to the purpose, it was first shewed, from this, that the Defend. himself concludeth no more from thence, then that <hi>the Churche may by vertue of this permission, ordaine any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that may be fit for the better serving of God.</hi> Which maketh nothing to the purpose, except first it be proved that God is <hi>better</hi> served with our Ceremonies, then without them. The Rejoynder here 1. denieth this to be his Conclusion, and yet they are his owne wordes, &amp; no other conclusion is mentioned by him, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Rejoynder it self, pag. 74. But by this (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>hee undertakes to prove another thing.</hi> Let it be so, yet he must first prove this, which he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately draweth out of the text, which he doeth not.</p>
                  <p>Neyther doeth he so muche as name that <hi>other thing</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:245:176"/>
which he undertaketh to prove, muche lesse performe his undertaking. This was therfore no fitte place for him to vente his phraze, of shooting beside the <hi>Butt.</hi> 2. He accuseth the Repl. of <hi>insult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng,</hi> because he denied the Consequence, and gave a reason of it: and yet refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the answer of that reason, to a fitter place I know not where. Onely he repeateth the often exploded evasion, that the question is whether all lawfull thinges be <hi>particularly,</hi> or expressely commanded in the word, which none of us ever writte, sayde, or thought. Yet we must be troubled with this groundlesse, uselesse repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, over and over againe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The onely backe of the Consequence made out of this place, is that <hi>all Fathers, and all Divines,</hi> (the Rej. addeth, <hi>of whatsoever Religion</hi> not excepting <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor yet <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> whom he useth to acknowledge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to his Conclusion) <hi>doe use this place for one and the same conclusion.</hi>

                     <head>Concerning an Argument against our Ceremonies, out of <hi>1. Corin. 14.</hi> Which is acknowledged to be the onely place in all the New Testament, that can be alledged for their imposing.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Replier, seeing that all the cause (on the imposers part) dependeth on this place of Scripture, &amp; finding nothing by any Logick
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:245:178"/>
could be drawne from it for our Ceremonies, thought good to trie, if there may not, from the same place be formed a better argument against them. This the Rej. calleth <hi>beating up of a new Hare, and loosing the way</hi>: as if all the Def. his <hi>Retortions,</hi> and all the Rejoynder his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per shot which he maketh after the Repl. when he imagineth him ro flie, or runne away, were new <hi>Hares, and exorbitations.</hi> I know not else what privilege he hath, to use a weight and a weight, one for the Defend. with him self, and another for the Replier.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Argument is thus put together, by the Rej. pag. 77. <hi>All that is left unto the Churches libertie, in things pertayning to Gods worship, is to order them in comely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But to appointe and use the Ceremonies as wee doe, is not to order in comely manner any thinge perteyning to Gods worship. Therfore, to appointe and use the Ceremonies as we doe, is not left to the libertie of the Churche,</hi> I. <hi>e. it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> The Rejoynder answereth first to the proposition, and then to the assumption, but so as he mingleth both together, in many words: Yet I will follow his order.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. First of all he denieth the proposition to be found, in the Repl. his meaning. But I can see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this deniall. <hi>1.</hi> Hee sayth, that <hi>Order and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is taken sometime largely, for all discipline, or policie, sometime strictly, for rancking of persons and actions hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely one before, and another after, and so is opposed onely to confusion, as in this place, 1.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from overthrowing the proposition, in the Repl. his meaning. For the Repl. meant <hi>order</hi> in the strict sense,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:245:179"/>
which maketh also for his purpose: and this the Rej. granteth to be the meaning of the Apostle in this place 1, Cor. 14.40. Which place the same Rej. pag, 75. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to be the onely place (in the N. Test.) by which power is given to the Churche to constitute Cerem: Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both which layd together it necessarily followeth that all which is left unto the Churches power under the title of <hi>order,</hi> is ordeyning in the strict sense, 1. e. <hi>rancking of persons and actions handsomely,</hi> as the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der expoundeth it. Yet immediatly after he accuseth the Repl. for saying order to be the right placing and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of thinges instituted, for <hi>time, place, etc.</hi> not shewing why this disliketh him, or wherin differeth from his owne explication. Onely he sayth that <hi>etc. often by the Repl. put to time, and place, is a blind.</hi> Whiche is not so, for by <hi>etc.</hi> is meant all circumstances of like nature with time and place, as <hi>number, measure, vicissitude etc.</hi> How many Psalmes shall be sunge, or chapter read, what, and how muche Scripture shall be at this or that assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie expounded, how one part of worship shall succeed another etc. <hi>without a blinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the next place, the Rejoynder findeth a wrong meaning in the Repl. his use of the phraze <hi>(in comely manner:)</hi> because afterward in the ende of the Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he sayth, that <hi>comelinesse is nothing but the seemeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of order.</hi> For (sayth the Rej.) beside that comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of order, ther is other comelinesse. Now this the Repl. professeth immediatly after the words quoted: <hi>other where comelinesse may conteyne all naturall and civil handsomenesse. etc.</hi> Neyther will I contend about this,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:245:179"/>
but it implieth so muche in this very place. So that the Rejoynder hath not given any reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or first part of the Argument should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Yet after that he hath fathered it upon <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Iacob</hi> and made the Repl. his <hi>disciple,</hi> he commeth to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the proofes of it, though he himself (as is now shewed) hath given sufficient assent unto all conteyned therin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The first proof is, that it is manyfestly collected out of the place in question, 1. Cor. 14. and the Def. seemeth to gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as much. To which the Rej. answereth. 1. that in that place, <hi>three distinct thinges are propounded, Edification, Decencie, Order: and these three cannot be one.</hi> But edification being the ende, Decencie and order the meanes, they may well be conteyned in one: <hi>decent order, tending to edification,</hi> or (which is as much to our purpose) in two: <hi>decencie, and order, for edification.</hi> A holy Sacrament, decently, and orderly administred, for edification, is not fowr distinct thinges, but one. His 2. is, that <hi>these words are the conclusion of the wholle Tract. beginning at the eleventh chap. wherin are handled some thinges onely concerning Decencie, some more properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to Edification, and some which belonge more peculiarly to Order. Ergo more is commanded in these words, then the comely placing of one thinge after another.</hi> Let this be granted, yet it followeth not, that more is left unto the Churches <hi>libertie,</hi> then order, and decencie, unto edification. For all thinges that are <hi>commanded,</hi> are not left unto the Churches libertie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:245:180"/>But that speaking in unknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tongues which the Rej. doeth referre to <hi>edification</hi> as distinct from order and decencie, is by good Divines accounted to offende against the <hi>order and decencie,</hi> spoken of c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>4. and 40. So D. Whitaker, de Script. q. 2. c. 18. disputeth against the use of an unknowen tongue in Gods service, out of this very place: <hi>pugnat hoc vero cum <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> quam maxime.</hi> 1. Cor. 14.40. 1. e. this mightly overthrowes that good order which he so much stands for. His 3. is, <hi>the Defend doeth no way seeme to grant the proposition: because the Repl. undertaketh by argument to rescue this place out of the Def. his hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this nothing at all argueth, that the Def. and the Repl. doe not agree about the proposition, though they dissent about the place, as it is handled in the assumtion. The Papists grant us, this proposition: No phraze is used by Christ, in those wordes: <hi>this is my body,</hi> but a Sacramentall one. Yet because they denie the assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: transubstantiating wordes, are not a Sacramentall phraze, we undertake by argument to rescue this place out of their handes. So the Def. requiring no more, then order and Decencie unto Edification, to be left unto the Churches libertie, for the establishing of our Ceremonies, doeth seem at least to grant, that all which is left to the Churches libertie is order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie unto edification, though he denie these to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne no more then mere circumstances, which is the assumtion. Of Edification ther is not mention made in the proposition, because that as an ende, is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and allways included.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

So that the Rejoynd. forgetteth himself muche, when upon this uncertaine, and momentlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, he compareth the Repl. to a <hi>hungrie creature</hi> (or dogge) <hi>that runneth away with a bare bone.</hi> D.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to that power, which is fetched out of a Patent, invisible, and onely avouched by conjectures.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A reason was given of the foresaid proposition, out of Iun. de Transl. Imp. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. 2. n. 26.27.31. viz. that the Churche hath onely a Ministerie, to observe suche thinges as Christ hath appointed, not authoritie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing new thinges. Here the Rejoynder 1. obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that those words, <hi>(new things)</hi> have no foot steps in Iunius. As if <hi>new things</hi> could be appointed lawfully without <hi>authoritie of appointing.</hi> Surely, he that denieth all authoritie of appointing, and leaveth onely ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall performance of things appointed, he denieth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of <hi>new thinges.</hi> 2. He argueth thus: <hi>If the Churche have a ministerie to appoint and doe suche thinges as Christ hath commanded, then must she needs have a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on legative to appoint and use rites serving to order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie.</hi> Adde to this <hi>onely,</hi> and then it is not onely that, but <hi>all</hi> that which we require. 3. He crieth out of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable perversion, eyther by grosse negligence, or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:245:183"/>And why so I pray? Because (forsooth) all that Iunius sayth is good to prove, that no Ecclesiasticall person hath any power by his calling over temporall Princes. But this is nothing against their delegated dependant power, <hi>by Commission.</hi> But <hi>1.</hi> these are very strange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions: they have not any power by their calling, but some by commission. They have not any power over temporall Princes (though they be members of the Churche) but over the Churche they have. 2. The Rejoynder maketh Iunius onely to denie that which Bellarmine never affirmed, viz. <hi>absolute independent power of Ecclesiasticall persons, as supreme Lords.</hi> Nay Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min answereth to Calvin in the very same manner that the Rejoynder doeth: <hi>The Pope is not the cheife lawgiver but the vicar of Christ,</hi>

                           </gap>e Communion: or kneeling in prayer.</hi> This is strange stuffe. 1. So much is granted, as is desired, viz. that God hath left nothing (about his worship) undertermined in his word. 1. e. uncommanded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forbidden particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ly, save onely that which he could not commande or forbid. Now let any man think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and judge, whether it had not been possible for God in his word, eyther to have commanded, or forbidden the signing of those that are Baptised with the signe of the crosse all so well, as Baptizing of them with water? 2, How can that too too bolde and inconsiderate asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be excused: <hi>if our Lord had fixed (or commanded) any one certain fashion of Ceremonies, he had made rather snares, then laws for his Churche.</hi> If it had pleased God to commande or forbid the signe of the Crosse in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, what snare had it been? When God appointed all the Ceremonies of the olde Testament, he did not (I hope) make snares for his Churche, though he did lay a burthen upon it. 3. Wheras the Rejoynder maketh <hi>sitting at a table,</hi> in the Lords Supper, and <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at prayer,</hi> to be suche thinges as the Lord could not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:245:184"/>
command, but as snares, because <hi>sometime a table</hi> may be wanting, or something to sit on, <hi>or abilitie to sit, and so of kneeling,</hi> this is as poor a snare to cache any man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in, as one sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l lightly see made. For 1. Many affirmative commandements of God ther are, which in extraordinarie cases cannot be fullfilled, and cease to binde: as praying unto and praising of God, with our voyce: which is no snare, to him that cannot speak.</p>
                     <p>The appointing of wine for the Supper, is no snare, though some Countries have it not, and some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wel drinke it. See Beza ep. 2. Pareus and Symb. Sacram. l. 1. cap. 9.2. I would know, whether it had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a snare, if God had appointed sitting at the Table, with exception of suche extra ordinarie cases? if yea, then m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>che more when men appoint kneeling, sirplicing, and crossing, if no, then our Argument may proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kneeling</hi> in publicke prayer, might have been appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without <hi>snaring,</hi> as appearing before the Lord thrise in the yeer, was appointed to every <hi>Male</hi> in Israel. Deut: 16.16. For (without doubt) many men in Israel, were, by accident, more unable to travel up to Ierusalem, then any Christian that hath knees, is to kneel.</p>
                     <p>After this observation, of which the Rejoynder sayth <hi>it may be as we will,</hi> he answereth, that <hi>our Lord hath left nothing absolute to the will of his Officers: but hath left even ambulatorie Rites, under generall rules, which will trie them as perfectly, as if every one had been named, and with lesse cumber.</hi> But 1. this is nothing to the purpose: because so the imperfectest law that is in any nation upon the earth, if it be worthy the name of <hi>Law,</hi> leaveth nothing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:245:185"/>
so absolute to the will of inferior Officers, as that it should be without the generall rules of <hi>justice, common good,</hi> etc. Nay not without the rules of <hi>order &amp; decencie.</hi> 2. Concerning the comparison of <hi>perfection,</hi> betwixt generall and particular rules, though enough hath been sayd before, upon like occasion, yet this I will adde.</p>
                     <p>If he meaneth, that a generall rule if it be perfectly understood and applied, doeth as perfectly trie as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. I grant it to be a trueth. And so was the olde Testament as perfect a rule of Christian faith as the New, <hi>thou shalt love thy neighbour,</hi> as perfect as the six Commandements of the second Table. But if he mean that a generall rule is as fit and full for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of us imperfect men, as particulars are, then I think no man conscious of humane frailtie, will beleiv him.</p>
                     <p>Neyther doe I beleiv, that he himself is so fully perswaded in Crossing the Baptized, by any rule which he hath out of Gods word, for that, as he is for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, by the rule of that.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Repl. having (as he thought sufficiently grounded the generall, that a perfect law leaveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then needs must, unto inferior Officers, goeth on to assume, that in the worship of God, all, but particular Circumstances of order, might easily, be (as in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed they, were) appointed by Christ, and therfore need not be left to the Churches wisdome. Vpon this, it pleaseth the Rejoynder to say litle to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in many words. 1. He sayth, that Circumstances of <hi>order</hi> were not harder to determine, then those of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:245:185"/>
                        <hi>decencie.</hi> Now it is plaine enough, that the Repl. here, naming <hi>Order,</hi> did also understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Decencie,</hi> though he named Order onely. 2. He asketh, what School of Divinitie hath taught the Repl. to say, that our Lord forbore the determining of suche circumstances, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all else was easy.</hi> I Answer, no rule of Divinitie did eyther teache the Repl. to say so, nor yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to impute unto him, which he never sayd.</p>
                     <p>But if he meaneth (as it seemeth he doeth) <hi>because it was not so easie to determine circumstances of time and place as reall worship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I then answer, that this (as I thinke) the Replier learned out of that Divinitie School, out of which the Def. and Rejoynder learned. That which they cite out of Calvin, pag, 15.16. Iunius is cited to the contrarie, out of Cont. 3. l 4. cap. 17. n. 12. (which place the Rej. looked upon, by occasion of the Repl. his former cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.) But hee in that very place, distinguisheth betwixt laws, properly so called, and <hi>cautions,</hi> leaving onely <hi>cautions</hi> to the Churches libertie, which is the very same that the Repl. meaneth. The plaine trueth is, that supposing Gods will to be, we should worship him in any place, and any time fitting, it was necessarie, that the particular choise of fitting time and place, should be left undetermined to any particular time or place, exclusively.</p>
                     <p>Calvin also is cited, as more comely expressing the cause to be, that Christ <hi>would not, then that he could not</hi> determine suche matters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:245:186"/>Now though Calvin, being so excellent in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, may easily be granted to have expressed the same meaning in more comely manner then the Repl. yet here was no cause of noting disparitie. For the Repl in saying, all things but particular order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie may be <hi>easily</hi> appointed, did not say what Christ <hi>could</hi> doe, but what might be easily for us appointed, or with our ease, or with the ease which we doe conceyve of in law giving, or of an ordinarie law giver, having suche authoritie as Christ had. And who doeth not see, that it is not so easie, to appoint every particular place, and time, wherin God shall be worshiped, throughout all the world, then with what worship he shall be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? For that particular description, a thousand books, so great as our one bible, would not have suffized.</p>
                     <p>The world (as Iohn sayth) would not be capable of the Volumes that must have been written. The Rej. himself pag 89. telleth us of <hi>cumber, and much adoe,</hi> that would have been, in naming every particular, is not this as much as <hi>lesse easy</hi>? Yet it pleased him to seek mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or altercation about this phraze, and that (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not) immediatly after he had without reason accused the Repl. of picking <hi>quarrells</hi> pag. 88.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A Second reason, of the Repl. his proposition, was, that whatsoever in worship is above order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, is worship. Bec. whatsoever is acted by him that worshippeth, in that act, beside ordinarie civilitie, must eyther be an act or meanes of worship, or an orderly decent disposing of those acts, or else at the least idle, and so unlawfull. The Rej. answereth 1. that <hi>a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:245:186"/>
Ceremonie for edification,</hi> is lawfull, yet commeth not under any of those heads. But he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth a significant Ceremon: instituted of God, to be essentiall worship, and instituted of man to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, though not in it self, of which distinction, enough hath been sayd, in the head of worship. Yet this by the way: A significant Ceremonie for edification, is the same, <hi>in it self,</hi> by whomesoever it be inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tuted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause institution is extrinsicall to the thing instituted, and alters it not <hi>in it self,</hi> internally. If therfore it be essentiall lawfull worship, <hi>in it self</hi> when it is instituted by God, it is also esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall (though not lawfull) worship, <hi>in it self,</hi> when it is instituted by man. Beside that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie whose proper sole ende is edification, toward God, is properly doen to the honor of God, and so properly divine worship.</p>
                     <p>His 2, answer is, that <hi>comlinesse grounded on civill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane considerations, is not mere civilitie, in sacred actions, and use, but sacred by application.</hi> W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ich is very true if civill application be meant by <hi>mere civill,</hi> but then it is nothing to the purpose. For sacred by <hi>application</hi> is seemly clothing, put on for to goe to Churche in, and yet is in it self mere civill. The question is not of application, but of internall nature.</p>
                     <p>Sacred thinges applied to Civill buissinesse, doe not therfore become Civill, for who will say, that Prayer, at the beginning of a Parliament, is a Civill act, though it were used in the Vpper, and lower house, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that Civill meeting, as it ought to be? And why then shall application of Civill decencie unto
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:245:187"/>
Sacred buisinesse, make it alter the nature or name of it?</p>
                     <p>His 3. answer is, that <hi>all meanes of worship are not worship.</hi> But he knew well enough, that this was meant of <hi>proper</hi> means of worship.</p>
                     <p>His fourth is, that <hi>ordering and manner of disposing,</hi> is ill divided from comelinesse. Neyther did the Repl. intend so to divide, but rather to conjoine them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding by that manner of disposing, comelinesse. But if the Rejoynder had not cached up some shew of confounding comelinesse with order, which was not intended by the Repl. he had been in this argument wholly at a losse.</p>

Thus farre concerninge the Proposition of our Argument: the Assumtion followeth, which is this: To appoint and use the Ceremonies as we doe, is not to order in comely manner, any thing pertayning to Gods worship. The reason is, because order requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the institution or usage of any new thinge, but onely the right placing and disposing of thinges for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly instituted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Rejoynder answer 1. that order requireth <hi>new</hi> time, place, and measure: which is a Sophistrie in the Proposition before abused, and confuted.</p>

                     <p>To this purpose, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:245:189"/>
therby inverting and perverting the holy ordinances of God.</hi>

                     <p>Nothing materiall is added in the rest of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynd. his answer unto this Argument (where our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are observed, to distinguish <hi>order and decencie</hi> from <hi>mysticall</hi> Ceremonies, the context of the chapter. 1.

                     <p>Those that are devoted to the Ceremonies, may shufle up and downe, first to <hi>order,</hi> and when they are beaten thence, to <hi>Decencie,</hi> and from Decencie, when they can defend that no longer, to <hi>Edification,</hi> as the Rejoynder doeth: but all will not helpe.

                     <p>The Def. could frame no Consequence out of any of these words, the Rejoynder sayth ther is one, but he cannot shew it. To the contrarie consequence nothing is answered of any moment.</p>
                     <p>And is not this a miserable cause, which hath no place in all the New Testament, which the best Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates can allege for it, but onely that; out of which it is utterly confounded? To the Defend. and Rejoynders mainteyning such a cause, this testimonie may be given that they would willinglie, so farre as they can, favour thinges which the times favour, and therfore strive to make somthing, of that which maketh nothing for them.

breaketh off, <hi>referring them to a fitter place.</hi> Now here in this place, he was constreined to touche upon them, but so softly and sparinglie, that it appeareth he founde this no <hi>fitter place</hi> then the former, for those reserved considerations.

But if he could keep-in his passion, so longe, as to hear this onely word, that there are no sufficient Records of any suche thing, exstant <hi>from the beginninge,</hi> then he might see that sufficient answer is given, unto the name of <hi>all Fathers, allways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I will adde one conjecture, to shew, that those
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:245:191"/>
observations which seem to have been universall, in the Primitive Churche, were not so in deed, without exception. <hi>Praying toward the East,</hi> hath as ancient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, as any other humane Rite. <hi>Tertullian</hi> Apol. cap. 16. witnesseth, that that was one cause why the Christians were esteemed to worship the <hi>Sunne.</hi> And yet <hi>Socrates,</hi> lib. 5. cap. 22. doeth witnesse, that at <hi>Antioche</hi> which was the first Churche of Christians by name, they used not to place their Mysteries which directed their posture of prayer, toward the East, but rather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West. And why may we not conceyve the like of Easter, as well as of this East observation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was secondly answered, that those, <hi>Feasts,</hi> which the Primitive Churche is sayd to have observed, were not by <hi>Canonicall imposition,</hi> but voluntarie <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi> to the <hi>infirmitie</hi> of some, as appeareth by the varietie of their observation, and Socrates his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Marke now, what a Rejoynder is given? 1. Hee telleth us of a strange conjecture of his, even from this answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. <hi>that the Churches held, it not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but also convenient, to impose upon themselves suche Feasts.</hi> As if occasionall accommodation, were all one with imposition, or voluntarie joining in action for the good that is in it, were always a certaine argument of <hi>holding</hi> that opinion which others doe affixe unto it. But if they had thought them so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet that Arg. would be of litle force. For many Ceremonies were thought then convenient, which longe since are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally thought otherwise of, &amp; therfor left off, though no reason of inconvenience can be shewed, which did
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:245:191"/>
not agree to those times as well as to succeeding times, except further abuse: which cannot be denied of our Ceremonies in question, as religious use of <hi>milke, hony, &amp; absteyning from washing ones hands for certayn days after Baptisme etc.</hi> 2. That which was mentioned of <hi>infirmitie</hi> occasioning this accommodation, the Rej. (after his manner) crieth downe as a <hi>fiction, boldly delivered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof, or colour, meerly for opposition sake</hi>: Wheras not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it is so clear, that the infirmitie of men newly converted from Iudaisme, and Gentilisme, did bringe into Christian Churches customes like unto those in use amonge Iews and Gentils, that Cardinall Baronius, from that ground mainteyneth many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.<note place="margin">

Where also about suche <hi>accommodations,</hi> he hath this remarkable observation. <hi>To outstrip our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in their owne policies, or to use meanes abused by others to a better ende, is a resolution so plausible to wordly wisedome that even Christians have mightilie overreached and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled themselves, by too muche seeking to circumvent or goe beyond others.</hi>

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:245:192"/>About the Varietie which was of olde in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of these feasts, the Rejoynder answereth, that it notwithstanding, the <hi>agreement</hi> for the <hi>thinges themselves</hi> was universall. Which if he would take with a graine of salt, viz. that after some space of time, it was (for ought we know) universall, but not upon any Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall imposition, nor upon any knowne groundes out of Gods word, it is the same that the Repl. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and Socrates lib. 5. cap. 22. laboreth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Mention was further made of the <hi>mischeife</hi> that came in by those humane observations. To which the Rejoynder answereth, that <hi>the Anniversarie solemnities have not obscured, but praeserved that simplicitie of the Gospel. And if they had so doen, by accident Satans malice, and mans frailtie, that is nothing but what may be affirmed of Divine ordinances,</hi> But 1. the Def. his position was in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of universall Ceremonies by humane institution, and not Feasts alone? Now those first Ceremoniall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations are guiltie of opening that gate, for all the humane praesumtions to enter into Gods house, which pressed in after them: which gate could never be shutte from that day to this. 2. Those very Feasts made a <hi>composition or mixture of</hi> humane institutions with divine, and therfore did not praeserve <hi>simplicitie.</hi> They also were from their first rise not onely aequalled unto, but also extolled above the Lords day. Easter brought in a superstitions <hi>Lent</hi> to attend upon it, made Baptisme wayt for her Moon: and conformed our Lords Supper unto the Iewish Passeover in unleavened bread, etc.

                  <p n="4">4.

The Rejoynder here 1. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth that it is very likely, these Feasts, or some of them, were on foot while some Apostles lived: because <hi>Polycarpe praetended Iohn to have taught Easter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On foot indeed was the mysterie of Antichristian corruption in the Apostles times.

Socrat. l. 5. cap. 22. He 2. addeth, under Augustines name that it is <hi>insolent madnesse,</hi> to thinke that not to be well doen, which hath been doen by all the Churche, though it beganne after the Apostles times. Now though I finde no suche saying of Augustines, in the epistle quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

for it, but to the Contrarie, I finde this rule, that <hi>it is lawful or not lawfull to beleeve or not to beleeve other witnesses or testimonies besides that of the Scriptures) so far as you see they beare or do not beare weight to make us give more credit to a thinge.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 18.19. Concerning Protestants witnessing against the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive argument from Scripture.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BEllarmine was brought in by the Def. as an indifferent Adversarie, confessinge that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants holde the Apostles to have instituted some thinges, perteyning to rites and order, which are not written. Which was also granted unto him, as making nothing against us. Onely the vanitie of that allegation was in some particulars declared, which how they are cleared (it being a matter of no moment) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the Readers judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chemnitius was alledged, saying, there be some Ecclesiasticall Rites, which have neyther command, nor testimonie, in Scripture, which yet are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Answer was made, that this in a right sense is granted by us. The Rejoynder taxeth this as an <hi>idle shift</hi>: because 1 <hi>Chemnitius did not intende</hi> suche a restrictive sense. 2. Circumstances of <hi>Order have command and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in Scripture.</hi> But 1. It is no idle shift so to interpret an allegation objected, as that the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be confuted, but barely denied. 2. As Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of order and decencie have their generall command or testimonie in Scripture, so have those Rites which Chemnitius understandeth, or else his sentence is without any grounde out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:245:194"/>3. The same answer is given, and no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder made, about Calvin, <hi>Danaeus,</hi> Whitakers and Zanchie, saving that of Zanchie, it is observed &amp; urged by the Rejoynd. that he sayth <hi>some Ceremonies may help for the furtherance of pietie which have no foundation in the word: giving instance of the solemnities of Easter, etc. Tract. de Sacra. Scriptura.</hi> For whom I answer, that his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence must be understood of <hi>no particular foundation,</hi> or else he should give more then any Papist will require, concerning their humane Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies. As for his instances in the solemnities of Easter, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he reckoned them amonge Ceremonies of order and decencie, because as the Def. and Rej. confesse, that is the onely place authorizing humane institutions in Religion. If he meant otherwise, he did as a man, crosse his owne rules, as after (God willing) shall be shewed.</p>
                  <p>For the present, let that testimonie of Zanchie be well considered, which he setteth downe in Col. 2.8. <hi>It is certayn, that this consequence is very good: this or that is not according to Christ: therfore it is not to be admitted. This ought to be enough to any Christian man: It is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ: therfore</hi> I <hi>admitte it not, in the buisinesse of atteyning to salvation.</hi> Where is to be noted, 1. That <hi>according to Christ,</hi> is opposed (by the Apostle) to <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the traditions of men,</hi> and therfore is all one, with <hi>not appointed by Christ.</hi> 2, that all Ceremonies instituted to teache the doctrine perteyning to salvation, are part of the meanes wherby we are supposed to be helped &amp; directed, in seeking and atteyning salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. About <hi>Iunius,</hi> ther is more adoe, because his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:245:194"/>
wordes are set downe at large on both pars. But as for that which the Def. and Rejoynder cite out of him, pag. 109. I cannot say much more then hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to the other Divines, untill a consequence be framed out of them, more effectuall to the purpose, then is in that which the Rejoynd. onely quaestioneth. <hi>And doeth the rule</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>concerne nothing but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Order? Or can our opposites be accorded with this saying?</hi> For it hath been formerly manifested what that rule doeth require, and how it may be accorded with our tenent.</p>
                  <p>On the other part, this professed, sworne sentence of Iunius is alledged: <hi>If any man, eyther by Civill, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall authoritie, will adde thinges not necessarie, nor agreeable to Order, wee would not pertinaciously contend with him, but desire onely that he would seriously consider of three thinges. 1. By what authoritie, or example, he is led to thinke, that the holy Churche of God, and the simplicitie of the mysteries of Christ (whose voyce onely is heard by his sheep) must be clad with humane traditions, which Christ doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? 2. To what ende he judgeth, that thes thinges should be added unto those that are divine? For if the ende be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with others, it were more aequitie, that other Churches should conforme to those, which come neerest to the Word of God (as Ciprians counsel is) then that these should conforme to the other. If the ende be comelinesse, what is more comely then the simplicitie of Christ? What is more simple then that comelinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there be no other reason beside</hi> will, <hi>then that of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian is to be thought of: The will of God, is the cheif neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:245:195"/>
and that the Churche of God is not tied unto mans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in thinges Divine. The third thinge to be thought on is, what event allways hath followed upon humane traditions, as longe experience doeth shew? Ecclesiastíci, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. This testimonie is so full, and clear, that it needeth no candle of Commentarie, or Consequence, to be set by it. What can the Rejoynder answere?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His first is, that Iunius doeth not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our Ceremonies even because they are not commanded in the Word. But he might have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred out of sect. 2. that the argument is of <hi>warrant and direction from the word,</hi> not of direct and speciall <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</hi> Now Iunius plainely denieth <hi>authoritie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the worde,</hi> or any thinge but mans will, to be the grounde of suche Ceremonies, and for that cause would have them avoyded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His second is, that <hi>Iunius wrote not this of suche Ceremonies as ours: because he speaketh of those that are neyther necessarie, nor according to order, rejected by Christ, added to Divine thinges, which must needs import necessitie and worship a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> fixed unto them.</hi> But had it not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter counsel, for the Rejoynder to have helde his peace, then to let every man see what miserable shifts he is driven to? <hi>1.</hi> Iunius having made this conclusion: that Magistrates may not constitute, and change persons, things, <hi>Ceremonies</hi> at their pleasure, and that those which teli them they may (as our Def. and Rejoynder doe in part) are therin <hi>no well willers</hi> to the Churche, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this question: if it be not in the Magistrates
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:245:195"/>
power, to appointe, or abrogate suche thinges? to which he answereth <hi>negatively</hi>: because all necessaries, and essentialls are appointed by Christ, and as for other <hi>not necessarie</hi> thinges, above the sphere of order, he gives those reasons, which are in the wordes, largely cited. Now <hi>1.</hi> what a wreched evasion is this, that he spake not of <hi>our Ceremonies</hi>?</p>
                  <p>He spake of all not necessarie not appointed by Christ: but yet he spake not of ours.</p>
                  <p>This is as some should denie that rule which some logicians call <hi>de omni &amp; de nullo,</hi> to holde in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: or affirme that to be false of English Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which is true of all Ceremonies. 2. When our Divines speak against Popish Ceremonies, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder his ordinarie answer is, that they speak of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies held <hi>necessarie,</hi> and therfore not of suche as <hi>ours.</hi> Now when Iunius expresly speaketh of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <hi>not necessarie,</hi> the Rejoynder concludeth, that he could not meane <hi>ours or suche like.</hi> How should any man speake, to put suche a Rejoynder from having some thing to speak? 3. Iunius sayd, that those Ceremonies are unlawfully appointed, which are not convenient to, or required by Order: Ergo (sayth the Rejoynder.) <hi>he could not speak of suche as ours are.</hi> And yet the same Rejoynder manud. pag. 33. confesseth our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be <hi>double or treble</hi> Ceremonies and those of order, to be onely <hi>single.</hi> Neyther could he ever yet finde any <hi>fit place,</hi> to shew our Ceremonies agreeable to order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:245:196"/>Nay when the Repl. by this argument, out of <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 14.40. proved these Ceremonies unlawfull, the Rej. fled from <hi>Order,</hi> to <hi>Decencie, and Edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet heer in this place, being beaten out of those coverts by judicious Iunius, he betaketh himself againe to that <hi>halfmoon</hi> of order, which before he had quitted. 4. Iunius sayth, suche Ceremonies are <hi>rejected by Christ</hi>: Therfore (sayth the Rejoynder:) he cannot mean suche as ours. As if he should say, those that affirme our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are rejected by Christ, cannot meane our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. 5. Iunius speaketh of Ceremonies <hi>added to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thinges</hi>: and so (by the Rejoynder his collection, not of suche as ours, because <hi>that must needs import neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and worship affixed to them.</hi> And yet both Def. and Rej. cap. 2. sect. 3. can finde out many additions to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thinges, which are intended onely for praeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fore (by their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) must not needs import necessitie, and worship. Suche turning, winding, and running against walls, you shall seldom see an ingenuous man use in a good cause.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Two thinges yet the Rejoynder noteth in the <hi>by</hi>: 1. Iunius would not resist suche thinges <hi>pertinacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as the Repl. doeth 2. Iunius speaking against <hi>clad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> Gods ordinances with the garments of humane Ceremonies, had another meaning, then the Def. p. 3. Rejoynder pag. 5. where he calleth suche Ceremonies as ours, the <hi>garment of Religion</hi>: because by clothing Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius meant <hi>adorning and hiding of nakednesse, but the Def. opposed garments to members of the bodie</hi>: and therfore the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:245:196"/>
Repl. need not by his marginall note have applied Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius his clothing to the Def. his <hi>garment.</hi> Now for the first of these, ther is difference betwixt <hi>pervicatious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,</hi> without reason and measure, which Iunius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desly putteth from him, and that constant restistance which he himself teacheth here in this place, where he affirmeth that Christs sheep (even in suche Ceremoniall matter) will not nor ought to hear any voice but Christs. For this, hee foreseeing that it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>pervicacie,</hi> disclaimeth that, and yet doeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie resist. So would the Rep. if he may have leave: If not, I see not why he may not doe the same thinge, though he be censured for it, as Iunius feared hee should be.</p>
                  <p>And this I may truly say, I have heard the Repl. more then once professe, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in studying of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, he was something perplexed about Ceremonies and suche like humane institutions, by reason of some ambiguous, and ill consenting passages of some others, this one place of Iunius (so solemnely confirmed with the oath of suche a man, for his synceritie and unparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allnesse in the buisinesse, and alleging suche grave rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for his judgement therin) did very muche affect him, and first setle his minde for suche matter. So that if he be deceyved, Iunius hath deceyved him. But he hath now more cause then before, to esteem muche of this place because, the utmost that the Rejoynder could say to it, is as good as just nothing.</p>
                  <p>As for the difference which the Rejoynder would finde, betwixt that <hi>clothing</hi> of Religion, which Iunius
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:245:197"/>
taxeth, and the <hi>garment</hi> of Religion, which the Defend mainteyneth, I cannot discerne it.</p>
                  <p>For 1. If Iunius meant <hi>adorning,</hi> as the Rejoynder sayth he did, that is one office of a <hi>garment,</hi> and suche a one as the Rejoynder ascribeth to Ceremonies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Religion, pag. 95. where is sayd that they are <hi>comely formalities, suitable to the dignitie and varietie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine actions.</hi> 2. If Iunius meant <hi>hiding of nakednesse</hi> of Religion, he meant it onely in the esteem of those which impose suche Ceremonies. And so all they that adde their Ceremonies to Religion, as usefull gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doe seem to account it (in comparison) naked without them. 3. If the Def. meant to shew, that our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are <hi>not essentiall limbes of the bodie of Religion,</hi> so did Iunius mean to shew, that those which adde their Ceremonies to Gods ordinances, doe pretend, they adde onely <hi>clothing, not members,</hi> to the body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Neyther is this <hi>snaching at words,</hi> as the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der termeth it. For it is, and hath been an ordinarie comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of Ceremonies, that they are as a garment to Religion. Whence it was that a Scottishman (as I remember) at the first comming of King Iames into England, hearing them mainteyned under that name, answered that he wondred then how Religion did live, and thrive, in the colde countrie of Scotland; without suche linsiewoolsy garments?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Vnto this full testimonie of Iunius, the Repl. added the words of Zanchie, ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her witnesse of the Defend. His words in his epistle to Q. Elizabeth, are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:245:197"/>
these: <hi>the Churche must be ordered by the rule of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolcall Churche, as well in Ceremonies, as in doctrine.</hi> The Rejoynder answereth 1. that this is no more contrarie to the Def. then to Zanchie himself, acknowleging (elsewhere) some Ceremonies lawfull, which have neyther commande nor testimonie of Scripture, which he would never say of doctrinals. Now 1. If it be also against Zanchie himself, yet it disableth his testimonie, for the Def. 2. This which is alledged out of him, for Ceremonies without testimonie or foundation in Scripture, hath been answered before, that it must needs be understood of <hi>particular foundation.</hi> And so he might well say the same of doctrinalls. For in this ther is no difference betwixt Ceremonies, and many other thinges, which are not Ceremonies, and yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to Conscience. As the Apostle sayd: <hi>let all thinges be doen comely and in order,</hi> so sayd he also: <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thinges are venerable, or honest, just, of good report, and prayse, let them be doen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the particulars of these latter, are not Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and yet many hundreds of suche thinges have no more command, or testimonie in Scripture, then the particulars of order and Decencie: Neyther have the generalls of order and Decencie, lesse command and testimonie in Scripture then the generall of these.</p>
                  <p>His 2. answer that Zanchies comparison is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of similitude, not of aequalitie, is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words answered.</p>
                  <p>For no disparitie can be shewed, betwixt many particulars of Doctrinall pointes, in their cases of

practise, considered with all circumstances, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of Decencie and Order: muche lesse betwixt their generalls. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple it is as difficult for D. B. to fetche from any doctrine in Scripture, this particular: <hi>It is venerable, just, and of good report, for him to write su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But suppose both to be probable, the former (being no Ceremonie) is no more determined in Scripture, then the later.</p>
                  <p>There hath been a fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taken up of speaking other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but no reason can be rendered of it. Let any man shew the reason, and I will yeeld.</p>
                  <p>The epistle out of which this quotation is, was written in deed <hi>against</hi> our Ceremonies, yet the Repl. leaving to a fitter place, noted onely for the present purpose, that it was written <hi>of</hi> them. But the Rejoynd. being great with an observation or two, addeth about that: <hi>Moreover Zanchie when he wrote to Q Eliz. to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade her not to urge the Ceremonies so severly, did write at the same time to B. Iewel, that Ministers should rather yeeld to them, then leave their places: because they are not simplie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I answer 1. Zanchie writ to Q. Eliz not onely that the Ceremonies should not be so <hi>severe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of this his judgement, he gave suche effectuall reasons, as can never be answered. Amonge other, one is proper unto this place, and fit here to be remembred, because it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:245:198"/>
all that warrant which the Def. and Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have hitherto, or can heerafter plead for them, out of 1. Cor. 14. <hi>Order, Decencie, Edification.</hi> These Ceremonies saith he make <hi>not for edification, but for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke dissention, private perturbation of conscience, with scandall of good and bad. They make not for order, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and confusion of good Ministers with evill or Popish, who ought even in garments to differ. They make not for decencie of Christs Spouse: because they are a strange ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, idolatrous attire of this Romish whore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Zanchie when he writ unto B. Iewel, gave no reason of this counsel for yeelding, but left them to be invented by B. Iewel. Now because those reasons of yeelding were never yet made knowen, wherby the former reasons directed by Zanchie against urging can possibly be overborne, I cannot otherwise thinke, but this later counsel was more out of charitie guided by humane erring prudence, then out of judgement grounded on Scripture. Howsoever our question is, not onely of yeelding in case of extreame necessitie, but also of appointing and urging men to that extreame necessitie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Zanchie doeth not perswade to allow of these Ceremonies by subscription, or silence, but onely in extreme necessitie, to yeeld unto them, and that with <hi>Protestation.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 20.21. Concerning Reasons against the Negative Argument from Scripture.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Def. his first reason is: <hi>Whatsoever is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is a trangression of some law revealed in the word. Ergo against it. Ergo not onely beside it.</hi> The Repl. granteth all: and sheweth, that it is a meer fantasie, before confuted, as a cavill, in the Replie, and longe since, by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Cartwrights, 2. Rep. p. 56. not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the very words of the Argument, to which it is opposed. Vpon this the Rejoynd. powreth out words <hi>He turneth head: O strange! a Babe owned from the birth, suckled by many Scriptures, an ill favoured faced brat, absurd, contradictorie, when he is taken in a snare, he sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th he is mistaken.</hi> And what reason hath he to back or bear out all these words with? <hi>If the Scriptures</hi> (sayth he) <hi>condemne what soever is doen not onely against, but beside t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e direction therof, then doeth it condemne something as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for being onely beside it, and not any way against it.</hi> To which I answer, that it doeth not follow: because a thing may be onely beside the word some way, and yet some way against it. Onely beside the particular praescript of it, and yet against the generall command of it.</p>
                  <p>If a Father charge his sonne, or a Maister his servant, first that for a certain time, he doe nothing beside that which he shall bid him: and then commande
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:245:200"/>
him for that time, to read in a certain booke, if that sonne, or servant, shall beside reading paint <hi>antick f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ces</hi> in his booke, he shall doe onely beside the particular commande, and yet against the generall charge, &amp; both ways censurable. Let the Rejoynder therfore spare his words, and see better to his Argument, or rather eat both, that others be not troubled with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second reason, brought by the Def. was: <hi>Nothing that is indifferent, can be pronounced simplie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. But some Ceremonies of mans invention are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Ergo, not to be pronounced simplie unlawfull.</hi> All whiche is granted of circumstances of Order, if by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> be meant <hi>determination; otherwise, the Assumtion is denied.</hi> Though it was added also (<hi>exsuperabundante)</hi> that <hi>thinges indifferent</hi> are sometime taken so generally, that in that sense, the proposition may be denied. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, I cannot discerne what materiall thinge is Rejoyned. He sayth, that <hi>it is easy to say the Assumtion is false, and not to shew wherin.</hi> But I have hitherto thought that it is sufficient for answer to any Argument, to denie the Assumtion, untill it be proved: and that the falsitie of any sentence, doeth consist in this, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth otherwise then the thinge is, and therfore in saying an assumtion is false, it is not needfull, to shew <hi>wherin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He sayth also that <hi>the largest sense of thinges indifferent, doeth make no variation of thinges indifferent.</hi> But the Author, and place, was named to him: <hi>Sopingius in his Apologie ad lib. Anonym. pag.</hi> 166. Where the case is very pertinent. For Doctor Sibrandus was challenged
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:245:200"/>
by a Remonstrant, who intituled his book, <hi>Bona fides Sitrandi,</hi> that as in an Epistle Dedicatorie to the Arche-Bishop of Canterbury, he had, to winne his favour the more against Vorstius, and his, declared his judgement of the Hierarchie (and Ceremonies) of England, to be thinges <hi>indifferent,</hi> so he spake of the Magistrates power, under the same terme unfitly, Sopingius, a godly learned man, whoe had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Scholler under Sibrandus, and so desired to help him out of this brier, had no other way to doe it, but by saying that all those thinges are sometime called <hi>indifferent,</hi> which are not necessarie to salvation, or without whiche a man may be saved.</p>
                  <p>Now in this sense, the Repl. sayd, the proposition might be denied: viz. that nothing indifferent <hi>1.</hi> e. not necessarie to salvation, is unlawfull. The Rejoynder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it seemeth) had not the booke, and so ventured to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict he knew not what.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third argument was: <hi>There must needs all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be varietie of Ceremonies in severall Churches. Ergo all are not praescribed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Repl. answereth, that ther neyther need, nor ought to be any varietie, but onely in particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of order, for time and place etc. Here the Rej. (complayning of <hi>Coleworts, and of not caring to say any thinge, so it be in opposition</hi>) bringeth in to the contrarie some examples of civill decencie, variable according to times and places. But all suche thinges the Repl. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in his <hi>etc.</hi> He addeth also varietie of <hi>solemne feasts</hi> But before those can have place here, it must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that suche feasts <hi>must needes be.</hi> But (sayth he) <hi>never
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:245:201"/>
any Divine so spake before M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>
                     </hi> Iacob. And hath he soon forgotten, what was even now recited by himself out of <hi>Iunius</hi>? Suche kinde of Rejoynders will never be wanting.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Def. his fourth reason was, that <hi>the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists like well, that every Minister in his Parish, should determine of Rites and Orders: whence would follow varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Ergo they holde some rites of humane invention and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, lawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Rejoynder addeth, as an explication in text, and table, that Non-Conformists set up <hi>Parish-om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence without referen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to Bishops, as some teache, or to Synods, as other. Wherby a Minister, and some of his Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, may ordeyne some Rites and Ceremonies for their use, and the King, and Churche under his authoritie may not.</hi> Now before we come to the Repl. his answers unto the Def. his reason, let us consider a litle the Rejoynder his addition. 1. The malignant imputation of <hi>Parish omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie,</hi> ill beseemeth our Opposites, except that they can shew, more power to be given by us unto Ministers and Elders, in their severall Congregations, then by them is given to Bishops, For untill they can shew this (which they are as able to doe, as to call effectually that which is not, as if it were) in accusing us, of setting up <hi>Parish omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie,</hi> they confesse themselves, to set up <hi>Diocesan omnipotencie, Convocation-omnipotencie,</hi> etc.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It worse beseemeth D. B. then most other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he wil confesse, that he, when he was Minister at the Hagh, in Holland, and with the consent of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ordered thinges in that Congregation (as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:245:201"/>
the Communion sitting at the table, to leave out the Crosse in Baptisme, and Surplice in all Divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) did then and there set up <hi>Parish-omnipotencie.</hi> 3. It is an injurie, more then ordinarie, to make us (any way) extoll the <hi>authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie of a Minister, above the authoritie of the Kinge, in any matter of appointing and ordeyning.</hi> For though a Minister may doe something in his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which no other man can lawfully doe, yet none of us ever thought, that he may appoint and ordeyne any thing to be doen, with coactive authoritie, which the King may doe, in all thinges lawfull, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; even in Churche affaires. So that our tenent is, that the Minister, and his people, may use no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, nor exercise any publicke act of worship, which the King may not appoint, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and compell them to. For in holding that no suche thinge is to be doen, beside that which Christ hath appointed, and that the Kinge may, and ought to see that all Christs institutions be observed, we must needs be confessed to hold that assertion, which is the conclusion of these two. 4. The fallacious ground of this accusation is, that the Minister with his people, may occasionally order some thinges, which no man absent can, not for want of authoritie, but for want of presence to observe the occasion: as what time the Churche meeting shall beginne, upon that day, that the Communion is to be administred, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Baptisme, and other buisines, more then ordinarie. 5. That which he intermixeth, of <hi>reference to Bishops,</hi> bringeth all the Churches of France, Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, etc. under his Censoriall note, of <hi>Parish-omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:245:202"/>Thus much for the Rejoynder apart. Now to the Def. 1. His Argument is rejected, as supposing, all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances to be of like nature with these in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie. No (sayth the Rejoynder) but onely that <hi>one would like one thing, and one another.</hi> But I say yes, or else he cannot argue from one to the other. For what consequence is in this: Men may determine of simple circumstances for order and decencie: Ergo they may ordeyne double, treble, sacred, significant Ceremonies proper to Religion? beside he nameth in his supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Festivall days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second fault, found in the Def. his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, it supposeth all circumstances to be of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. No, sayth the Rejoynder againe. Let him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put <hi>ordeyning</hi> out of the Summe which he hath made of the Def. his reason, and confesse also, that this reason maketh nothing for mens <hi>instituting</hi> of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third was, it supposeth contrarie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, ceremoniously to be practised, by the same men as of institution. <hi>Not so</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder:) but <hi>onely cantrarie fashions practised by severall men, out of their election.</hi> Yet it seemeth to be for the most part so: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the question is of Ceremonies, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious practising, not of incidentall fashions. Of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which the Def. calleth <hi>ordeyning,</hi> not of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie occasionall election. If by <hi>varietie</hi> of observing Festivall days, and not observing them, was by the Def. understood of <hi>severall men,</hi> then in that part he was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood by the Repl. Now upon these premisses,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:245:202"/>
the Rejoynder concludeth all the Repl. his answer to be nothing but <hi>bogling and scurrilitie.</hi> What would he have sayd, if one had accused him of setting up <hi>Diocesan, and Convocation omnipotencie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seemeth that (though he aboundeth in that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) he would have wanted reproachefull words, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his indignation of suche an imputation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In opposition to this mishapen Argument of the Def. taken from Non-conformists confession, the Rep. propounded one, from the Conformists confession: You say these Ceremonies are Divine, and yet dare not denie, but the rejecting of them in other Churches, is Divine.</p>
                  <p>You retayne these Ceremonies as Divine, and yet reject other Ceremonies, of like nature, as divine as these. What divinitie (or agreement) is in suche courses? To this, the Rejoynder answereth, that this <hi>argueth an ill conscience: because the Def. doeth not say that these our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are Divine, but that in respect of permis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r, and hypothesi, humane. And this may be sayd of the different Ceremonies of severall Churches.</hi> For ill <hi>Conscience,</hi> I will not be so liberall in charging the Rejoynder as hee is prodigall of it toward the Repl. But ill <hi>science</hi> I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prove. For 1. He denieth the Def. to call our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies Divine: because (forsooth) he calleth them so in the <hi>generall,</hi> and not in their <hi>speciall</hi>: for so the Def. doeth interpret his owne termes.</p>
                  <p>Which is as muche as to say, he that doeth not call
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:245:203"/>
them <hi>every way Divine,</hi> doeth not call them <hi>Divine.</hi> 2. He passeth by the mayne termes of our Argument Divine <hi>rejecting of the same Ceremonies in other Churches, Rejecting of other Ceremomonies, as Divine as these in our Churche</hi>; and for these he putteth onely, <hi>different divine Ceremon. in severall Churches.</hi> This sure is no scientificall kinde of answer. 3. No Divinitie will suffer any thing to be called <hi>Divine,</hi> but that which (all circumstances considered) may at least necessarily be concluded out of the Divine law. Otherwise all good humane laws may be called Divine laws. Now wee have hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in vayne, when our Ceremonies may be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>It is altogether impossible, that the institution, and Rejection, of Crosse, and Surplice, in divers places, should be both <hi>Divine,</hi> or that the urging of these, and abolishing of Images, should be <hi>Divine,</hi> in the same place, and time. This part therfore of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rejoynder thought good, to answer with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe Repl. set downe the Def. his plea, with a generall answer thus: After all this adoe about the Proposition of the first Argument, Now we are tolde of an Assumtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Mr. Hy: viz: that Ceremonies have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the word of God being humane inventions, For Mr. Hy: I cannot say muche (because his reasons are not in printe) but for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Authors of the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they have great wronge doen them. Whosoever will turne to the place quoted by the Def. in the Abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, shall see, that the words which our Def. hath turned into a Proposition, are there but part of an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, belonging to this proposition: All Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that swerve from the Rules given in the Word, for the Churches direction, in matters of Ceremonies, are unlawfull. The Assumtion of which is: But the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in question, doe swerve from those Rules. Now all this cheif pith, both of Proposition, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtion, is by the Def. omitted: A by thinge is put in place of the Proposition. A new assumtion is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and yet all fathered upon the Abridgement. What hath the Rejoynder to say against all this? 1. <hi>This demurrer should have come in at the first.</hi> But first, or last,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:245:204"/>
if it be true which here sayd, the Def. cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Repl. granted the whole Argument, sect. 2.</hi> In saying (forsooth) that he took for granted, whatsoever was there sayd for the all-sufficiencie of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This of it self, is an Argument against our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> What then? the Authors of the Abridgement, may yet have wronge, if it be made theirs, against their will. 4 <hi>It is fit to be the first Argument, because if this be granted, all other rules are vayne.</hi> The question is nothere of fitnesse for place, but of fitting it to the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet this whole Argument being granted (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our meaning) of those that the Rejoynder calleth <hi>double triple</hi> Ceremonies, the Rules have use about <hi>single</hi> ones. <hi>5. The Proposition is taken out of the Abridgement, pag.</hi> 44. <hi>and the Assumtion is fitted to it,</hi> Let it be so, yet if that be made a proposition of theirs, which onely was an illustration, or confirmation of their proposition, and (a new assumtion fitted unto it according to an adversaries pleasure) the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fathered upon them, as a first and cheif one, this surely cannot be excused from wrong doeing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the Def. his answer unto the Assumtion, viz. that in generall and <hi>permissive appointment,</hi> our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are (not humane but) Divine, the Repl. sayd that he understood not <hi>a permissive apointment,</hi> to be other then an appointment without appointment: because to permitte, is neyther to command or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointe, nor forbid.</p>
                  <p>Here the Rejoynder amonge many shrewed wordes,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:245:204"/>
hath this reason that <hi>the same thinges are commanded, in general, but in particular are onely permitted,</hi> And for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of this, he twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>teth the Repl. with want of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke.</hi> But I cannot yet see, out of any logick how a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall can be commanded, generally, and any true spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall or particular of it be onely permitted. He that commandeth all order and comelinesse, commandeth also every speciall of it. Every generall command, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto his true speciall subject, maketh that specially commanded.</p>
                  <p>It is commanded in generall that every husband should love his wife, not in speciall, that Aquila should love Priscilla: yet suppose Priscilla to be Aquila his wife, she may chalenge conjugall love, all so well as if hername had been in that Command in speciall. Else we may as well say, that superstition, will-worship, or at least disorder, to which order is opposed, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in generall, but some specialls of them or it, are onely permitted. The trueth is, Crosse and Surplice, cannot with any shew of reason, or common sense, be sayd to be commanded in generall, any more then in speciall, no nor yet permitted, eyther in speciall or in generall. The Rejoynder hath yet found no fit place, to prove the commande though it mainely concerneth his cause, and of it self alone might satisfie any mans conscience, if it could be proved, and the permission is the maine question of this whole Dispute.</p>

               <head>Chapter second, Concerning worship.</head>
               <p>ALl the materiall doctrine of this Chapter is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discussed, in the Manuduction, sect. 5.6.7. Where the nature, distinctions, and differences of worship, are weighed, and found of no moment for our Ceremonies aide. It shall suffize therfore here, to referre the Reader unto those places, adding onely some notes, upon some passages, formerly not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 1. Concerning worship, distinguished into proper, or essentiall, and unproper, or accidentall.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Def. sayth, that by proper and essentiall worship, he understood Ceremonies so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required to Gods service, as that the contrarie therof must needs displease him.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Repl. inferred, that all Ceremonies, which serve for decencie, and edification, must needs be proper and essentiall worship: because the contrarie of decencie and edification must needs displease God, in his worship.</p>
                  <p>Marke now the Rejoynder his answer: <hi>The contrarie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:245:205"/>
of decencie and edification displeaseth God. But the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of particular Rites, serving to decencie and edification, doe not displease him: because they fall into one and the same generall kinde, without contrarietie therto, or therin. As fire &amp; water are not contrarie to an element, nor blacke and white, to colour, nor reasonable, and unreasonable, to a creature: so contrarie orders, contrarie formalities of decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and contrarie meanes of edification, are not contrarie to order, decencie and edification.</hi> All this answer depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon a distinction betwixt generall, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>1.</hi> This is a certain, infallible rule: what essence soever is founde in any generall, that must needs be in every speciall, conteyned under it. Ther is no essence in an <hi>element</hi> generally taken, which is not both in the fire, and water, none in <hi>colour</hi> so taken, but is both in blacke and white, none in the notion of a <hi>creature,</hi> which is not in man and beast. From hence therfore it necessarily followeth, that if <hi>Order and decencie</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, be essentiall worship, every true speciall of them must needs be so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not of, or for nothing, that the Rejoynder doeth so waver in his speache: <hi>contrarie Ceremonies ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to comelinesse, and edification, contrarietie of orders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of formalities of comelínesse, and meanes of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For this meanes, all his answer is at least put out of comely order serving to edification. For that which <hi>serveth to</hi> comelinesse, and order, all <hi>formalities</hi> of them, and all <hi>meanes</hi> are not specialls, under the <hi>genus</hi> or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of <hi>decencie, order, edification,</hi> but under the generall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:245:206"/>
of <hi>meanes, formalities,</hi> etc. So that the wholle distinction is confounded, by this wordy explication of it. 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of orders</hi> he confesseth, and yet denieth them to be contrarie to Order: As if order contrarie to order, were not contrarie to order! He will say no, not to <hi>order in generall.</hi> But then that order in speciall, must have some specificall difference, not conteyned in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of order, making the contrarietie: which should (if it could) have been declared. By the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, also as he acknowledgeth contrarie <hi>orders,</hi> he must also acknowledge contrarie <hi>decencies,</hi> and <hi>edifications</hi>: and this hath need of declaraiion, because it is a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to be trusted, before it be tried. <hi>4.</hi> By order, in this place, must needs be meant <hi>good</hi> order, otherwise, it were as well order, to set the carte before the horse, as the horse before the carte. Now in good order, the thinges ordered may be someway contrarie, as blacke and white horse set before the carte, and yet the <hi>order</hi> one and the same: and so in <hi>decencie. Edification</hi> is onely an ende. But good order, and decencie of the same thinges, in their particular or inviduall use, can be no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to any good order, &amp; decencie of the same thinges in the same use, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blackto black &amp; white to white. <hi>5.</hi> The playne trueth is, that order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie (as they pertaine to our question) doe arise out of the outward disposition and temper of thinges, as health doeth out of the inward disposition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the body, and therfore doeth admit no more contrarietie, then good health doeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Def. in his distinction, placed <hi>Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:245:206"/>
onely on the part of Accidentall worship, that was noted as a flaw. To which the Rejoynder answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that <hi>essentiall parts of worship serve also to edification, and worship of themselves.</hi> But 1. this can be no more gathered out of the Def. his words, then that all essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall worship serveth for <hi>decencie</hi>: for he placeth these two together, as endes of accidentall parts of worship, that they serve for <hi>decorum, and edification.</hi> 2. This is but to help a broken legge, with a broken crutche. For esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall worship tending to worship of it self, is as broken a phraze, as the former was a distinction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was noted also, that the Def. confounded <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances,</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> of worship. The Rejoynder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that those thinges which are appurtenances onely in <hi>proper, simple, and strict</hi> sense, are partes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>improperly, and in a sorte.</hi> So in deed at the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, amonge Sophisters <hi>impropriè, laxè, modo quodam, quodammodo,</hi> are woont to helpe at a dead lift. But that which is onely an appurtenance of worship, is no more worship, then a Bishops Rochet, is a Bishop.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. About the same distinction, a question was made how any worship can be not essentiall, that is, not having the essence of worship in it. The Rejoynder answereth, that these appurtenances have in them the <hi>essence of accidentall worship, but not the essence of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</hi> So then, they are <hi>essentiall accidentall</hi> worship: and why not as well <hi>substantiall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cidentall</hi>? A Rochet hath no more in it the essence, then the substance, of an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Bishop.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Repl. his last, was, that those which the Def.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:245:207"/>
calleth accidentall parts of worship, have not (by his owne expresse confession, in this sect.) so muche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the essentiall, as the haire of the body (which is but an excrement) hath with the body, and therfore cannot be accounted a part of worship. The Rej. here. <hi>1.</hi> answereth, that they are in deed no part of essentiall worship, but of the <hi>complement</hi> of worship, as <hi>garments</hi> are of mens externall honour. So that now we are come to have that expressed, which before was implied, the Ceremonies may be called worship, as a Bishops Rochet, or other Bishoply <hi>garment</hi> may be called a Bishop. Though it might be also further inquired, if Ceremonies be <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>complement,</hi> what the other parts of that complement may bee? Certes he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided worship into essentiall and accidentall <hi>parts,</hi> did not mean worship, and the complements of worship, muche lesse, <hi>parts</hi> of essentiall worship, and <hi>parts</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. If he did, his speache, and meaning, doe not well agree together. 2. He taketh great exception against the terme of <hi>excrement, as not well appliable to the hair of ones beard, savouring of a spirit full of rancor, to be judged of God as a reproche, tending to breed scorne and abhorring of these Ceremonies, in the mindes of ignorant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> At all which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might have laughed, if Gods name had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spared, in so frivilous a matter. All Philosophers, that ever I I heard, or read, heathen, and Christian, call and define the haire of mens bodies, <hi>an excrement.</hi> All Divines, when they speak of hypocrites in the Churche, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the hayr of a mans body, under the terme of <hi>excrement.</hi> I therfore would not be loath to hear one
call 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:245:207"/>
the hayr of my beard, an excrement. Neyther can I smell any savor of a rancourous spirit, or any reproche, in that phrase. As for <hi>breeding of scorne in the mindes of ignorant men,</hi> one would thinke, it should not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him, that a litle before spake of <hi>Parish-omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,</hi> and stuffeth his booke with suche termes, as I am loath (for his sake) to repeate, but that they cannot be more gently refuted, then by bare repeting, after the occasion of them is discussed.</p>

By the second distinction, no addition unto Gods will and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, is more forbidden, then unto mans. As it were a sinne to adde any thing unto Gods Testament <hi>as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> so also were it to adde any thing unto mans testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or testimonie, and make it his, when it is not his. None may adde any thing to D. M. his Defense, or D. B. his Rejoynder, and make it theirs, when it is not theirs. Suche additions, are usually called <hi>lyes,</hi> sufficiently forbidden by the ninth Commandemenr: so that no indifferent man will thinke, that nothing more is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in these prohibitions, so often and earnestly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in strict reference unto the holy ordinances, and worship of God, which by this interpretation, can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no privilege from them.</p>

But what is this to additions? and to suche additions, as our Ceremonies in question? The Lords ordinance is, that the Sacrament of Circumcision should cease. For the preservation of this ordinance, the Def. and Rejoynder pag. 285. provide a lawfull Cabinet, under locke and key, that <hi>Circumcision as it is used in some places, may be lawfully appointed, and commanded.</hi> The Lords ordinance is, that Baptisme should be administred according to the primitive institution, without suche sacrilegious cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as are in use among Papists. They have provided a Cabinet, under locke and key, for this, that all which are baptized, shall be crossed.

(for 6. was an error) whosoever will looke upon the places, shall finde, that neyther in Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, not in Cajetan, is any mention of <hi>addition preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> which here is the onely question. They speak in deed of adding words, to the forme used in Baptisme, and note, some words doe corrupt the sense, and some doe not: but not a word of adding Ceremonies <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative.</hi> The wordy additions, which they speak of, are as Thomas hath it, I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Sonne, the Holy Ghost, <hi>(and the Virgin Marie:</hi>) or as Cajetan hath it: I baptize thee (<hi>Sexton what is a clocke)</hi> in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. If these be additions of <hi>preservation</hi> let any Christian, that regardeth Baptisme, judge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was wished, that the Def. had set downe some examples, of preservative additions. The Rejoynder undertaking it for him, nameth for the Text <hi>diverse readings, marginall notes, etc. and for the sense, interlineary glosses, notes, marginall references, and commentaries, and then, readings by sections, building and ordering of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and a thousand suche.</hi> And in deed he might as well name diverse thousands, as these. But <hi>1.</hi> if so many
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:245:209"/>
thousand Ceremonies may be added lawfully to Gods law, what meant Augustine, and all our Divines, out of him, to complaine of suche an intollerable burthen of Ceremonies, in regard of their number? 2. <hi>Diverse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> are no more additions, then <hi>Coningstable and Constable,</hi> are to the Statute of Constables. <hi>Marginall notes,</hi> no more, then an exposition is to the text, which kinde of addition, the Papists doe wickedly allege for their doctrinall traditions. <hi>Interlinearie glosses, notes marginall references</hi> Commentaries of the same nature. <hi>Reading by sections, building, and ordering,</hi> are evidently thinges of meer order, of which, if any man shall say they are additions, then if he be a poor man, he may make great addition to the litle mony he hath, by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it into sections, placing it fitly, and disposing of it orderly a hundered ways, to the increase (as it were) of a hundred folde: which would be a welcome doctrine (if it were true) to many a poor man, and even to those which are impoverished by the Bishops silencings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations, and excommunications, for not allowing of additions to Gods worship.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was also justly questioned, if ther were not a deminution, or taking from, for preservation, as well as an addition of that kinde: because in the Text they are joined together, as drawing in one yoke? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder answereth <hi>no.</hi> And denieth the consequence, by example of <hi>hardning, and shewing mercy, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the same mertiorious cause.</hi> But 1. the example doeth not agree: because the question was not of a meritorious cause, but of a finall. And in the cheif or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:245:210"/>
last ende, hardning, &amp; shewing mercie doe agree. 2. I can easily, finde out a detraction, as of good praeservation, as the addition of a Cabinet with locke and key.</p>
                  <p>For from a sword, or any other yron weapon, a man may well detract <hi>rust,</hi> for the preservation of it, From an aguish man, bloud may be detracted, for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life, nay sometime a leg, or an arme, may be cutte off, for praeservation of the bodie. So that, all thinges considered, the Rejoynder will upon second thoughts, eyther cashier in Gods worship, his addition of preservation, or else adde unto it, a detraction or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of preservation. Calvin in his nineteenth ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon Deutrinomie, hath this remarkable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

But withall it is manifest from thence, that is is no sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but a very suspicious answer, for Ceremonies, accused of superstition, to say, and not to prove, that they are <hi>preservations.</hi> Yet these Ceremonie-mongers had all their pretense properly from <hi>meanes of preservation,</hi> which are and were always allowed by God, and his people, not from <hi>additions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Parliament statutes made for establishing of true religion, are a meanes of praeserving it in England: but I thinke that Hon. Assemblie would take it ill, if the Rej. should publish to the world, that their Laws are <hi>additions</hi> to the word, and worship of God.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder addeth, that <hi>Calvin in the place alledged, doeth account these praetented additions to have been corruptions, from the first.</hi> Now (though this is not heer, but in another place, after to be handled) let the Reader gesse of Calvins account, by these his words: <hi>Afterward there came teachers who did not think themselves should be esteemed acute enough unlesse they did patch some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their owne to the word of God.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 6. Concerning our Divines judgement about Ceremonious worship invented by man.</head>

                  <p n="1">1. The Replier sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Worship doeth not varie according to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>opinions,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in the nature of the action it self.

For all that he hath not known, are not <hi>monsters.</hi> But what is his reason of this so deep a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? because (forsooth) <hi>opinion, by error of opinion, doeth make that to be essentially false worship, which without suche opinion, were no suche worship.</hi> Of which I may as well say, that this opinion, by error of opinion, doeth make the reason essentially false. For 1. the question was not here of essentiall false worship, but of essentiall, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall worship, whether <hi>op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Rejoynder hath not yet (that I know of) nor can (as I thinke) define unto us, what is <hi>essentiall false worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:245:213"/>3. Every <hi>error of opinion</hi> doeth not make essentiall false worship: he should therfore have tolde us, what error he meant. The Def. nameth opinion of <hi>justice, sanctitie, efficacie, or divine necessitie</hi>: and the Rejoynder mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth often suche and such opinion, held of the Papists, concerning all their Ceremonies. Of this enough is sayd, Manud. sect. 7. For the present, I denie, that suche an erronious opinion, by it self, and of it self, doeth not make essentiall false worship. <hi>Opinion</hi> is but an adjuvant efficient cause of that <hi>affective act,</hi> wherin the essence of internall worship consisteth: and the externall acts of worship, though efficiently differenced by opinion, or faith, are essentially distinguished by their forme, and ende. A man may have an opinion, that is just, holy, efficacious, and necessarie, to performe diverse workes of the second Table, nay upon some occasions, to tell a lie, even against the second Table. Yet none spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king properly, will call, that essentiall false worship, which is a sinne directly against the first Table. Hitherto therfore, I see no <hi>monster</hi> of the Repl. his making. And if we consider his reason well, which the Rejoynder made to it, the <hi>mishaping</hi> of thinges will be found on the other side. If (sayth the Repl.) worship did varie occording unto mens oppinions, then a man may goe to Masse, conceyving another privat opinion to himself, then Mas-mongers use to have: and our Convocation may appoint us the grossest of all Popish Ceremonies, if they set another opinion upon it. The Rejoynder his answers are diverse, and some of them strange ones. <hi>1.</hi> His first is, that <hi>goeing to masse may be a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:245:213"/>
sinne of scandall and presumtion, though a man goe not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto worship.</hi> By goeing to Masse (acording to the use of our speache) is meant, doeing all those externall actions, which Mas-mongers use to performe. Now the question is, whether he that performeth all those externall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (intending onely to save his life therby, as having no opinion of any other good in so doeing) doeth onely sinne of scandall, and praesumtion, or else over and beside this, is guiltie of externall false worship? the Rejoynder seemeth to say, <hi>no, he is not guiltie of false worship.</hi> But when the Christians of the Primitive Churche, did with suche an opinion, lay but a litle incense upon the Heathens Altars, they were by all Orthodoxe censured for <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> The storie of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen is well knowen, how he delivered Palme, to those that offered it to the image of Serapis, with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his intention: <hi>come, and receyve the bows, not of the image, but of Christ.</hi> Yet was he therfore censured as a worshipper of that Idol. Calvin writing of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose concerning this very case, of goeing to Masse with suche an opinion, accuseth them that doe so, of <hi>external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professed idolatrie</hi>: and therin was justified by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton, Bucer, Martyr, <hi>Opus. de vitandis superstitionibus.</hi> And if this be not right, then all externall acts, and reall professions, whether symbolizing with Papists, or with Turkes, or Heathens, may be in themselves, (set scandall and danger aside) easily excused. So Calvin argueth, in the forenamed treatise and in a Homilie, Opusc, pag. 532. he sheweth, that those wise men which thinke otherwise, would have derided the simplicitie of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drac.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:245:214"/>
Misach, and Abednego, if they had then lived, in suche a fashion: <hi>Miserable men, yow may doe that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall act which is required of you: it is no worship, so long as you have no faith, trust, or devotion to that idol.</hi> 2. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond answer is that <hi>those which are present at false worship, by violence, are not false worshipers,</hi> and upon this he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth, with <hi>fie man, fie.</hi> I may better say, <hi>alas alas,</hi> that good D. B. (I speak as I thinke) should be driven to suche extremities, in defense of those Ceremonies, which he never loved, nor doeth at this day. For <hi>goeing to Masse,</hi> or doeing all those externall acts, which Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers use to performe, implieth more then <hi>violent</hi> carying thither, and deteyning there. <hi>3.</hi> His third is, that <hi>nothing but opinion doeth make humane inventions essentiall worship of God.</hi> Which is an essentiall denying of the conclusion. 4. For that which was inferred of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation house,</hi> he sayth first, it is a <hi>flinge.</hi> Let it be so, yet it may hit that Ceremonious Goliah, as it is suche, in the fore head. He addeth, that <hi>the grossest rites of Poperie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iblie be washed from their opinion.</hi> Which is not for a <hi>Rite,</hi> being an externall thing or act, any Rite may be separated from any internall opinion. The last is, that <hi>some other Popish rites might be lawfull, if they could be clensed, though we need them not.</hi> As if the grossest might not be lawfull, if they could be clensed, or the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had shewed that we more need the Crosse, then those other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Def. placed so muche in <hi>opinion of sanctitie,</hi> the Repl. in the second place, opposed, that Sanctitie cannot be separated from suche Ceremonies,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:245:214"/>
as are proper unto Religion, onely used in the solemne worship of God: because they are neyther civill, nor prophane, and therfore holy. Heer the Rejoynd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r being put to his shifts, as before, answereth that <hi>they are in deed holy by applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but not with inhaerent, or adhaerent holinesse in them, or their use as those which God hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor so as they sanctifie the actors, and actions, which is proper to Gods ordinances.</hi> Now how many strange thinges are here? 1. That Ceremonie, whose essence consisteth in application and use, is holy by application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet not by any holinesse that doeth <hi>adhere</hi> to them, or their use. Holinesse is an adjunct <hi>receyved</hi> by the thing that is holie, and therfore eyther <hi>inhaerent,</hi> or <hi>adhaerent.</hi> 2. Is this a good reason: they are not holy truely, as Gods ordinances, therfore they are not by men made holy? 3. Have any outward ordinances of God <hi>inhaerent</hi> holinesse in them? 4. If God hath no way <hi>sanctified</hi> our Ceremonies, who can make them holy? 5. Doe not Ceremonies teaching holinesse, sanctifie the actors, actions or spectators, after the same manner, that the teaching word doeth sanctifie them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Vpon occasion of the other part, in the Def. his distinction, (that Accidentall worship is any rite, which serveth for the more consonant, and convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharge of essentiall worship,) the Repl. wheras he might have sayd, that this is a mishapen definition of Accidentall worship in generall, as it may be divided into true and false, good, and bad, opposeth onely this: that no judicious Divine useth to call circumstances of mere order and decencie, (which notwithstanding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:245:215"/>
serve for the more consonant and convenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t discharge of essentiall worship) that is a Pulpit, a Table, a faire-Cloath, etc. Worship.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder answereth, that in deed, the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s cannot be called worship without madnesse, but onely the use and application of suche circumstances, and rites.</hi> Now 1. marke here, how the Rejoynder who defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a Ceremonie, <hi>it is an action etc.</hi> and laffeth at the Repl. (because he sayd, some Ceremonies may be put to other good use, as if all Surplices were turned into poor-folkes under-garments) <hi>as if the good wife of Bilson had burnt a Ceremonie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she burnt a Surplice in her oven,</hi> marke (I say) that this same Rejoynder doeth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from their <hi>use and application.</hi> 2. Who ever was so <hi>mad</hi> (because it pleaseth him to use this terme) as to say, that standing in a Pulpit, the better to be heard (which is all the use of it) is to be called wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? 3. Crossing with suche expression of the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication therof, as is used in Baptisme, can neyther be distinguished from the use of a Crosse, nor aequalled to the use of a pulpit, not yet lawfully styled true worship, without a spice of one disease or other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The first witnesse brought in for us, is Calvin, inst. l. 4. cap. 10. sect. 8. All those constitutions are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in the observation wherof we place <hi>any</hi> worship to God. The Def. answereth, he meant not by <hi>worship,</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of order. Which the Repl. readily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: because it were <hi>non sense,</hi> to say, all observations in which circumstances of order are placed, be wicked. To this the Rejoynder sayth first, it is a <hi>babie.</hi> 2. he sayth,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:245:215"/>
that Calvin meant not to comdemne all constitutions of order: which is as <hi>true a babie</hi> as the former. 3. Calvin (sayth he) <hi>defineth</hi> what Constitutions are contrarie to the word of God, namely <hi>suche</hi> as are ordeyned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as necessarie for consciencie, etc. But Calvin doeth onely shew that <hi>suche</hi> are of the forbidden <hi>kinde</hi>: and every notifying of a speciall, is not a <hi>definition</hi> of the generall <hi>kinde.</hi> 4. He addeth, that Calvin doeth allow of some significant Ceremonies sect. 14. Of signification, we are to consider in the next chapter. In the mean time this: Calvin generally speaketh against <hi>all</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship invented of men, without any distinction. One ambiguous phraze of Ceremonies in generall, without any example, save onely <hi>Divine,</hi> in which he instanceth immediatly after the words cited, doeth not make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the former sentence. All the rest of the Rejoynder his allegations out of Calvin, about this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer have their answer, in the staple sect. of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. 5.6.7.</p>
                  <p>The Def. having thus tould us, what Calvin did <hi>not</hi> meane, addeth that Calvin meant by <hi>wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ship,</hi> the <hi>inward vertue</hi> of worship, which consisteth (sayth he) in <hi>an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of holinesse and justice. The Repl here justly noted the <hi>ill sound of</hi> those words: <hi>the inward vertue of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship consisteth in an opinion,</hi> to which the Rejoynder sayth just nothing. And yet in all this chapter mainteyneth all that doctrine of <hi>opinionated worship,</hi> which the Def. let fall. But a man would thinke, that upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, he should have declared, how, and how farre worship doeth constift in opinion? As for inward
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:245:216"/>
                     <hi>vertues and vices</hi> consisting in opinion, it is as great a paradoxe, and greater also, then that of the Stoickes, who made all other differences of mens estate, beside vertue and vice, to consist in <hi>opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second place, it was asked by the Repl. how an <hi>inward vertue,</hi> can be planted in an <hi>outward Ceremonie</hi>? the Rejoynder <hi>by error of opinion.</hi> But it is more then <hi>error,</hi> nay more then ordinarie madnesse, for any man to thinke, his inside, is in his out-side, his heart is in the feather that he weareth on his hat.</p>
                  <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Repl. added in the third place, that the proper nature of worship, doeth not consist in <hi>holinesse,</hi> and <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> but in the honoring of God: so that all externall Ceremonies, whose <hi>proper use,</hi> is the honoring of God, are externall worship. This was directed against those words of the Def. the inward vertue of worship (placed in outward Ceremonies) consisteth in an <hi>opinion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and justice.</hi> Now what sayth the Rejoynder? <hi>1. No man can in any action ayme at Gods honor, without opinion of justice and holinesse in that action.</hi> Which may be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if <hi>justice</hi> (in this forme of speache, wherby our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines use to condemne many Popish Ceremonies) did not signifie <hi>justification</hi> as it doeth. But yet it doeth not follow from thence, that every opinion of holinesse, and justice, doeth make <hi>worship,</hi> much lesse <hi>inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and least of all, the inward <hi>vertue</hi> of worship.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Then</hi> (sayth he) <hi>all externall Ceremonies must needs be worship.</hi> And this is that which we avouche, of all Ceremonies, whose proper use is the honoring of God. 3. <hi>It is not</hi> (as he addeth) <hi>the immediate and peculiar
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:245:216"/>
use of our Ceremonies, to honor God, but to a aedifie man unto the honoring of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No more (may I say) is it anie otherwise the <hi>immediate</hi> ende of preaching the word, to honor God, but onely by aedifiying of men, to the honoring of God: and yet preaching of the word is <hi>essentiall worship.</hi> 4. <hi>Pulpits. Fonts, Tables, Table-cloths, and Cups, are as muche appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto religious uses, as our Ceremonies in question.</hi> But this is confuted in the staple section of the Manuduct. 3. and 4. And the difference is acknowleged by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, in that, he maketh Pulpits etc. to be onely <hi>simple</hi> Ceremonies, and ours in question, <hi>double and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> For by that it followeth, that our questioned Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are <hi>twice,</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> more appropriated to worship, then Pulpits.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Calvin</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>doeth marke out false worship by a false opinion of worship and necessitie</hi>: He doeth so in deed: but never meant to make it a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible,</hi> or <hi>reciprocall</hi> marke, muche lesse that wherin the <hi>essence</hi> of all false worship consisteth, as hath been cleared. Paul Phil. 3. marketh out <hi>Dogges,</hi> by urging of <hi>Circumcision</hi>: but he never meant, that ther were no other Dogges but suche. Calvin also many times marketh out false worship by an opinion of <hi>merit</hi>: yet surely a man may use false worship, without suche an opinion.</p>
                  <p>In opposition to these allegations out of Calvin, the Repl. nameth one place, epist. 259. where he sayth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rejoynder his owne translation: <hi>If it be well and throughly looked unto, what it is, that doeth so

                  <p>For if <hi>all</hi> humane Ceremonies flowed from affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of will-worship, then a <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and suche like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of order, and decencie, are no Ceremonies. If all the worship which is placed in humane Ceremonies, be unlawfull, then no suche Ceremonies are lawfull, what opinion soever ther be of their <hi>necessitie, etc.</hi> If this be so (answereth the Rejoynder) then <hi>Calvin hath confuted his more publick writings, in a privat epistle.</hi>

                  <p>Which is nothing so, but onely it followeth, (as the Repl. sayd) that he hath confuted the collection which the Def. made from a shred or two of his more publicke writings.

Calvin (as he lastly addeth) epist. 120. could have wished, that Hooper had not so muche strugled against the <hi>Cap, and Rochet, or Surplice.</hi> But beside that Calvin did not, nor we neyther esteem a Cap, or a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet eyther (a Surplice is added by the Rejoynder) so evill as the Crosse in Baptisme, Calvin could not say so muche, without a shrewed item (<hi>ut illa etiam non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem, though I doe not allow of suche thinges.</hi>) Which many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly declare that his wishe was not grounded on suche an opinion, as the Def. and Rejoynder mainteyne. It might also be added, that Calvin in the same place accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, of wicked <hi>perfidiousnesse,</hi> who though they seemed to favour the Gospel, yet made a partie against Hooper, about that trashe, unto the hindering of his Ministerie: which is the case of al our depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

made <hi>essential</hi> worship, not accidentall. Concerning this distinction, enough hath been sayd in the 5. and 6. staple sect. of the manudiction, let this onely be remembred, that it is all one, as if he should divide worship, into worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Vpon this occasion the Rejoynder 1. criethout of a falshood <hi>shamefull, and to be blushed at,</hi> for saying that the Def. distinguisheth will-worship into lawfull, and unlawfull. But let any man judge where is the falshood, shame, and cause of blushing. The question is of worship invented by man, which Chemnitius (with other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) call <hi>will-worship,</hi> whether it be lawfull or no? the Def. answereth by a distinction, that some is unlawfull, as <hi>essentiall,</hi> and some lawfull, as <hi>accidentall.</hi> What can be more plaine? But (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>Accidentall worship, be denieth to be properly worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not properly worship, and therfore it is not will-worship. He may as well say: it is not properly worship, and therfore it is not lawfull worship. May it not be improper will-worship, though it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly worship? Or no improper worship come meerly

from the will of man? It is rather a propertie of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to depend meerly on the will of the institutor.

                  <p>His second exception is frivolous. His third is this: Chemnitius hath this distinction in <hi>substance,</hi> though not in <hi>termes.</hi> For he sayth, that right inward worship being supposed, right externall expressions will follow <hi>of their owne accorde,</hi> and they are externall worship, though not acceptable in themselves.

                        </gap>ng.</hi> 2. This <hi>substance</hi> is a meer shadow. For first, Chemnitius acknowlegeth no outward expressions to be right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but onely those, that flow <hi>of their owne accorde,</hi> without any institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from inward worship. And who will say, that the Def. and Rejoynder their accidentall worship, of Crosse and Surplice, doe so flow from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Secondly, those externall expressions, are as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall to externall worship, as profession of faith is to a visible Churche. Nay ther is no externall worship, beside the expressions, and setting forth of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Thirdly, Though those expressions, be not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:245:219"/>
of, or in themselves, being separated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, yet it doeth not follow from thence, that they are in their nature accidentall worship, and no ways substantial. For the Rejoynder confesseth, that all Gods ordinances are substantiall worship: and yet he will not say that Gods outward ordinances are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him, when they are separated from internall worship.</p>
                  <p>Vpon supposition (which now appeareth true) that the Def. could not shew his distinction out of Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, he was desired, at the least, to shew, that ther is some worship, which is not necessarie: because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he must needs sincke under Che<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nitius his charge To this the Rejonder answereth, <hi>1. that Chemnitius un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth by will worship, whatsoever of mans device, is imagined necessarie.</hi> 2. <hi>that ther is some externall worship, which is not in the particularities of it necessarie.</hi> For the first of which, enough is sayd, in the 7. s. of the manud. Yet here I may adde, that it is so farre from trueth, <hi>(no will-worship can be without imagination of necessitie)</hi> that on the contrarie, whosoever doeth take upon him, for his will sake professedly to apoynt any worship, cannot possiblie imagine it absolutely necessarie, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging ther hath been worship, without his addition, he professeth to adde something, not simplie necessarie to the <hi>being,</hi> but onely to the <hi>better being</hi> of it. As for the second, In Gods own ordinances, which were substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and essentiall, by the Rejoynder his confession, the particularites were not allways absolutely necessarie Levit. 5. <hi>a lambe, or two turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:245:219"/>
And this answer may serve for all that is further rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about Chemnitius. For it beareth wholly upon perpetuall necessitie of the same particularities. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which he instanceth in, are naturall gestures, suche as <hi>kneeling, lifting up of eyes, or hands to heaven etc.</hi> which have as manifest impressions in them, of Gods will, without mans institution, as the offering of doves or pigeons ever had, and in their particularities upon occasion carie as muche necessitie with them.

                  <p>Now <hi>1.</hi> the Rejoynder will not say that any humane worship, is lawfull, beside that which is held absolutely necessarie for justification, for then it may be lawfull, though it be every way aequalled to many of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. 2. The signe of the Crosse, to signifie our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and constancie in Christs service, were worship, though it be considered, or were used alone by it selfe. 3. Our Ceremonies belonge to the first table, so farre as they belong to any part of his law. 4. <hi>Vestments, fasts, and feasts</hi> also, are accounted by Melancthon, matters of mere order.

Thence also it would follow, that no Praelats could offende, in instituting of Ceremonies, without sinning directly against their Consciences: wheras we are more charitablie persuaded of many, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And so what assurance have our Consciences, from their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of discerning? Kings multiplying of treasure, and horses, concerneth (in conscience of acting) onely themselves, and their officers. but the Ceremonies (in

acting) concerne all the Churches. In that ther is not onely a disparitie, and dissimilitude, but suche a one, as requireth the rule to be more accurate in one, then in the other. 3. Within a latitude, it were easy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, how muche treasure, and how many horses, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naily are lawfull to be multiplied, by this or that Kings, as also how muche is lawfull, for an ordinarie man to eat at one meal.

His 5. and last is, that perill of leaving Gods institution, there may be <hi>some,</hi> in matters of faith, and necessarie dueties to salvation: but in other matters, to speak of perill, is <hi>ridiculous.</hi> But <hi>some</hi> in matters of faith, and principall obedience? none to be feared but <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously,</hi> in poynt of Rites? It is strange that ever any man of D.B. his knowlege, and profession, should let fall suche a sentence.</p>
                  <p>He himself will recall it, when he hath considered
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:245:223"/>
how <hi>deadly</hi> a thing it is to depart from Gods institution in fundamentall pointes, and also, how great mischeif hath arisen, by leaving Gods institution even in Rites. It is well knowen that Ceremonies and rites, opened the dore and paved the way for invocation of Saints in heaven, and evocation of men out of Hell, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, and Idoll of the Altar, and suche like pretie stuffe to enter into the Churche. And they were Ceremonies which came in with the winde and tide of custome, to which winde and tide if we yeeld our selves againe, God knoweth, what wil become of us.</p>
                  <p>But this especially is in the conclusion, to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: the Def. and Rejoynder have hitherto sayd much upon the generall rules for Ceremonies, <hi>Order, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Edification,</hi> as if they did <hi>trie the tast of every occurrent Ceremonie, as perfectly, as if every one had been named</hi>: they are the Rejoynder his wordes, pag. 89.</p>
                  <p>Now when we are come to the issue, they are found to be nothing, but onely <hi>winde and tide</hi> of custome. As if <hi>winde and tide</hi> did trie the tast, or discerne distinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is no <hi>will-worship,</hi> to pray thrice or seven times in a day, or to preache thrice in one Lords-day upon spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occasion. Some <hi>vowes</hi> are no more worship, for

Cor. 14. doeth give Churches power to appoint suche <hi>formalities</hi> as our Crosse, and Syrplice: which is to tie harp and harrow together with a rope of sande. Secondly, suppose it had, then it is not fully and resolutely expressed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from will-worship of <hi>free will-offeringes</hi> may as well be concluded essentiall, as <hi>accessorie</hi> will-worship to be in the Churches power for to appoint it: because they were as essentiall offerings, as other sacrifices, which were by name commanded. If by <hi>accessorie</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, he meaneth that which is appointed by man, in opposition to <hi>essentiall,</hi> as appointed by God (which his manuductive interpretation beareth) then in stead of a conclusion, we have a mere confusion: the Churche may appoint that will-worship which God hath not appointed, but man doeth. Thirdly, the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing</hi> of this or that, doeth not follow upon the practise of free-will-offerings, and vowes, except it be

understood, that the Churche might have <hi>appointed</hi> men, what, and how many free-will offerings they should offer, which were to turne <hi>free</hi> worship into <hi>forced.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rde no matter capable of sad dispute. It shall be sufficient therfore to note onely the passages, which seem to looke towards the question. The Rejoynder pag. 179. tould us, that the Def. offered to confute, out of Vrsine, this proposition: <hi>All human Ceremonies which are imposed, and observed, as parts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ods worship, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi> Now first upon this, the Repl. brought forth the maine assertion of Vrsin, in the place alledged, viz. that <hi>humane Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies, not onely are not the worship of God, but also they binde not the conscience.</hi> To this the Rejoynder answereth, that Vrsin in his answer to an objection made against this assertion, sayth, that suche Ceremonies are not worship <hi>in themselves,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (addeth the Rejoynder) his meaning is, that ther is some true lawfull worship, <hi>improperly, and by ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is as if from these words: mans clothes, or armour, are not a man by themselvs, one should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that therfore they are affirmed to be a man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and by accident.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Repl. noted diverse words of Vrsin, sounding wholly to the deniall of the honorable title of good worship unto human institutions. Vpon which the Rejoynder complaineth, of willfull omitting these words of Vrsin: <hi>worship properly so called doeth so please
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:245:226"/>
God, that the contrarie of it would displease him.</hi> Where (sayth the Rejoynder) we have an <hi>exact</hi> description of worship properly so called. But he is herin deceyved. For if this be an exact description of proper worship, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a child honoreth his father, he doeth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediatly honor and worship God: because suche an act doeth so please God, that the contrarie of it (dishonoring of ones father) must needs displease him.</p>
                  <p>And so, in very deed, was the meaning of Vrsin, to call the morall duties even of the second table, worship properly so called. Which forme of speaking, though it cannot be excused from great improprietie, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it nothing for, but rather against the Rej. because Vrsin heerby denieth human Ceremonies so much to participate the nature &amp; name of worship, as any mean moral dutie of the second tabledoeth, no not so much as the hang-mans office, in the due execution of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the Repl. observed, that the Def. conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the very same thing out of Vrsin, which we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, and he undertooke to confute, viz. that <hi>divine worship properly so called, is that which is ordeyned of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Rej. answereth (after an angrie charging the Repl. with a <hi>contradctious spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now did not the Rejoynder himself tell us pag. 1794.

that the Def. offered to <hi>confute</hi> out of Vrsin, our propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? How can this be excused from contradictions (I will not say spirit, but) dealing, to say, and unsay the same thing, in the breath of one and the same section?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to that which the Def. sayd, of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in a <hi>large sense,</hi> to be helde worship, the Repl. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that <hi>thts should be proved.</hi> The rejoinder is, that <hi>the large sense</hi> it set downe, viz. <hi>as circumstances apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to the setting out of divine worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if we had not required a proofe, but onely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.

                     </gap> they are worship, (and that onely in their generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) just as civill things: that is not otherwise then all good deeds are worship. So forbidding, or hindering of false worship (which may be doen by Atheists) is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in this uncouth manner of speaking.</p>
                  <p>One argument yet is of the Rejoynder his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: <hi>Suche thinges doen to the honoring of an Idoll were idolatrie, as to build a temple, to the honoring of an Idoll. Therfore the same thinges doen by the rule, to the right ende, are some way a worship to God.</hi> Wherin ther are two ambiguous phrases observable: 1. <hi>suche thinges. 2. to the

honoring of an idoll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If by <hi>suche thinges,</hi> he meaneth <hi>suche</hi> as crosse and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, we not onely grant, but urge, that suche thinges doen to the honoring of an idoll, are idolatrie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from conclude, that suche thinges doen to the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, are (not some way but) properly, <hi>latria,</hi> or worship of the true God, though (being destitute of his allowance) false, or superstitious worship. But if he meane <hi>suche</hi> as circumstances of time, and place, then he accuseth all Princes, that ever granted time, and place, for idolatrous worship, to be Idolaters. Let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how farre this stretcheth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if by to <hi>the honoring of an Idoll,</hi> he meaneth a devout intention of suche an honor, wee grant, that the taking up of a straw directly to suche an immediat ende, is idolatrie. For howsoever suche intention is not necessarie to externall worship, yet the praesence of it doeth make that worship which otherwise were none.</p>
                  <p>Yet all circumstances of time and place, which are occasionally applied to idolatrie, are not idolatrie, eyther essentiall, or accidentall. For then the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, should be (in diverse Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To which I answer, that according as Ramus sheweth, about distribution, sometime adjuncts of a thing may (in a large sense) be called parts, and yet they cannot have the abstractive name of that subject attributed unto them: because the adjuncts of a man cannot (with any sense) be called men.

                     </gap>herfore of this argument is rotten at the root.</p>
                  <p>But suche a reason, as that from the adjuncts of a man, to a man, was thus propounded by the Repl. <hi>the crosse is annexed to a Sacrament.</hi> To this the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der answereth, that <hi>the Crosse is not annexed to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but onely to the solemnitie of the Sacrament, and so it is not a part of the Sacrament, but of solemnitie.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. THe 8. section was neglected by the Repl. as conteyning nothing but affirmation on one side, and negation on the other. This omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (sayth the Rejoynder) was for <hi>advantage,</hi> because (forsooth) here the Def. his assertion was <hi>clearly</hi> set downe, namely, that our Ceremonies are not imposed, or observed, as <hi>proper, essentiall and necessarie</hi> parts of Gods worship.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>1,</hi> If this had been a clear explication, yet seeing we meet with it, and handle it in a hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, before, and after, litle reason had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to suspect advantagious craft, in passing by the same termes in this one place. <hi>2.</hi> Ther is no <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> at all in heaping up termes, without any explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. <hi>3.</hi> When these termes, <hi>proper, essentiall, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie</hi> worship are now expounded, by the Rejoinder to mean nothing else but worship <hi>specially commanded of God,</hi> the sense is so absurde, that it was for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

                  <p n="3">3. Vpon occasion of that scorne which was cast on the authors of this argument, viz. that <hi>this learning never saw print before, as the Def. thinketh,</hi> Mr. Bradshaw was named, as a man not to be slighted for his learning, who had longe since put in print, without receyving any printed answer, unto it, or the booke wherin it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned. To this diverse thinges are rejoined, not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy any answer, but that they tende to the disgrace of a
<pb facs="tcp:245:230"/>
godly learned man, whose memorie is worthy of all honour. <hi>1.</hi> Mr. Bradshaw is ranked amonge <hi>discontented persons.</hi> Which imputation if it be understood of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment for want of preferment, or great living, could hardly have lighted upon any man in England, whose course and conversation would more beat it off then Mr. Bradshaws did, in the consciences of all indifferent men that knew him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His tracts of <hi>indifferencie,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> are styled <hi>litle Pamphlets,</hi> suche as doe <hi>creep in the darke, and are hard to be seen of men that walked by day light.</hi> This is (up and down) the language of great prelates, when Goliah-like, they confute their adversaries with scorning of their litle stature, and ignoble state. But the Def. or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder might have put that litle pamphlet into the belly of a whale, by setting it forth with a large confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in <hi>folio,</hi> and so also have helped it from <hi>creeping,</hi> to some kinde of riding on horsebacke.</p>
                  <p>Neyther is it harder for day-light men, to see suche treatises, though thrust by their commaund into dark corners, then it is to open their mouthes for to aske after them, and then their eyes to looke on them. Howsoever, if this be a sufficient answer, then what shall become of many litle bookes for instruction, and helpe, dispersed by good men amonge the Papists, where publicke authoritie doeth make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selves in a litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe, &amp; to creep in the darke, for fear of being apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the inquisitours day-light wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? Mr. Bradshaw was made for accurate, short, &amp; mere logicall fashion of writing. So muche appeareth out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:245:230"/>
of other treatises of his: as that of <hi>Iustification.</hi> For to have drawen forth him unto large wordy discourses, it had been as hard, as to confine wordy men, unto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatenesse of mere logicall dealing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because the <hi>learning</hi> of this argument was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Bishop, the Repl. doubted not to aequal Mr. Bradshow, for his skill in framing of an argument, unto any of the Bishops. To which the Rej. answereth, that this is no more <hi>praise</hi> to him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is for a <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters boy, to drive a pinne as well as his Maister.</hi> Which might be admitted for true, if ther be any Bishop, that may in this kinde of learning be <hi>Magister ejus.</hi> Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is not to the purpose, except the <hi>Maister carpenter,</hi> may deride his <hi>boy</hi> for driving a pinne, which is as well driven as he himself can drive any.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Rejoynd. raiseth up a report, without shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from whome he receyved it, that <hi>Mr. Bradshaw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed his owne opinion of thinges indifferent.</hi> Which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be some other way confirmed, then by an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries bare telling, and that in a humour of disgracing his person, it must be accounted a mere tale. But <hi>he had good reason to reverse his opinion (sayth the Rejoynder) because against all reason and sense, he resolved that ther is nothing indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this were so as it is related, reason would perswade to some recantation. But it is onely the Rejoynder his telling againe, without any shew of proof.</p>
                  <p>I, for my part, can finde no suche wordes in Mr. Bradshawe his treatise, neyther any thing from whence suche a raw sentence may be reasonably collected. He

Nay the harshest of these asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be found not onely in <hi>litle Pamphlets</hi> made by <hi>Carpenters boys, against learning and sense,</hi> but in great volumes, written by those that goe for very learned, and sensible in suche matters as this is.

                        </gap>l Mr. Bradshaw rise up.</hi> But who tould the Rejoynder that it never came into any mans head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? though if that were true, the soundnesse may be likely enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:245:231"/>Many reasons have been in other mens heads, which never came to the knowlege of our Def. and Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And he is immediatly tould, that it is for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in every one of our Divines, which hath written of worship: because they all, teaching that the common nature of worship required no more, then that it hath the honoring of God for the direct ende of it, they adde, that if this be according to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is true worship, if not, false. And the Def. was urged to shew one instance to the contrarie. The Rejoynder is made, 1. by repeating over the emptie termes, of <hi>in it self proper, essentiall, reall, necessarie, etc.</hi> Which have been so often discovered to be nothing but termes, that it were an idle tedious buisinesse, for to insist upon them againe. Yet some few thinges may be observed, as proper to this place.</p>
                  <p>First we are tould here, that it is <hi>essentiall to proper es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall worship, be it true or false, that it tende of it self, and immediatly, to the honour of God.</hi> So then we have the common nature of proper worship, as it is common to true and false worship. Now adde unto this that which is added, pag. 125.126. that this worship, <hi>if it be required of God, is true, if not, false.</hi> Now this being granted, our wholle Argument is granted, so farre as it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth proper worship. For by this confession of the Rejoynder it is plaine, that the institution of God doeth not make a thing proper worship, but onely true proper worship, and the want of it doeth make proper worship false.</p>
                  <p>And this is all that we intende in this Argument,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:245:232"/>
for which also we are twitted with new learning by the Def. pag. 185. where also he affirmeth that <hi>Gods institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doeth distinguishe essentiall worship from accidentall,</hi> and therin he is mainteyned by the Rejoynder as by and by we shall see.</p>
                  <p>But how can these thinges stand together Gods institution is first the specificall difference, wherby essentiall worship is distinguished from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall, and yet the specificall difference also wherby true essentiall worship is distinguished from false? Can any one thing be a specificall forme of diverse effects, or difference of diverse subordinate thinges, suche as <hi>essentiall,</hi> and <hi>true essentiall</hi> worship are? Can ther be ore and the same difference, betwixt a living and a livelesse creature, and also betwixt a reasonable and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble living creature.</p>
                  <p>It is in the second place observable, how the Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der seeketh to convey, or (to speak playnely) steal away from us, that which he had given. <hi>Divines</hi> (sayth he) <hi>doe distinguish proper worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It was required, that one of our Divines should be named, who handling the common place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, doeth not distinguish <hi>true</hi> worship from <hi>false,</hi> by this, that one is appointed of God, and the other not.</p>
                  <p>He bringeth in some Lutherans not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting with <hi>our</hi> Divines, neyther treating on any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of worship, but onely writing a breif con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, teaching a difference betwixt lawfull rites of order, and proper worship, which we never doubted of. He taketh hold of those terms <hi>immediately, &amp; of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> by which (saith he) these divines distinguish <hi>proper</hi> worship from that which is after a sort so called.</p>
                  <p>But it is more probable of the places cited, that they rather distingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh worship (by those terms) from mere rites of order and decencie, which they doe never call worship, <hi>after a sort.</hi> Beside, of our Ceremonies, it hath been shewed, that their <hi>immediate</hi> end, is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God: in which respect also, the Rej. himselfe ranketh them under the head of immediate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>per se,</hi> or <hi>of it selfe,</hi> it may meane also as muche as <hi>ex opere operato, the mere work wrought.</hi> In which sense some Divines pronounce generally of <hi>all externall</hi> worship, that <hi>of it selfe,</hi> and in it owne nature, it doth not please God. Perkinse, in his Cases, lib. 2. cap. 6. Howsoever, to shew
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:245:233"/>
how the authors of these confessions did not esteem significant Ceremonies Crosse, Surplice etc. to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of lawfull order, those words of the Wittenberge Confession doe sufficiently declare. <hi>It is not lawfull for Bishops, to thrust upon the Churche, the Ceremonies of the olde law,</hi> etc, where come in the words quoted by the Rejoynder and immediatly after, these: <hi>Neyther is it lawfull, eyther to restore the olde Ceremonies of the law, or to devize new, to shadow forth the trueth allready layd open, and brought to light, by the Gospel: as in the day light, to set up candles, to signifie the light of the Gospel, or to carry ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Crosses, to signifie the victoríe of Christ thorough the Crosse. Of which sort is all the furniture of Massing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon suche groundes as these, the Rejoynder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thus: <hi>Therfore the institution of God alone is that which maketh the same things to be worship truely, and really, which without suche institution, were no suche reall worship, though doen to the same ende, and in the same manner.</hi> But I know not how the terme <hi>truly,</hi> and then againe <hi>suche</hi> worship came into the question. Wee stand upon this, that Gods institution of worship, doeth make true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and denie onely that it maketh that worship, which otherwise, or without suche institution, were no worship at all. How can then the Rejoynder be excused in confounding <hi>true</hi> worship, with <hi>reall</hi> worship in this conclusion? Now take away this intruded truely, and then let any man tell me, how this conclusion can be reconciled with those his principles of concerning worship, pag. 125? <hi>Any action doen to the honoring of God
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:245:233"/>
immediatly, and in that act it self, is proper immediate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worship of God. If God requires it not, then that worship is false.</hi> And even now: <hi>suche an act is proper worship of God, be it true or false. Proper and Reall</hi> to him are all one: and yet granting some <hi>proper</hi> worship to be false (for lacke of Gods institution) he denieth it to be <hi>reall</hi> worship, if it wante Gods institution: as if Gods institution did make that <hi>reall proper</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which for wante of that institution is <hi>false</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>This wilde conclusion is further confirmed by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of Tilenus, which is answered before, in the head of <hi>Worship,</hi> and by one example out of <hi>Fenner,</hi> whome the Rejoynder is pleased to call <hi>our owne Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Where, I will not say, what kinde of men may (by like reason) beproclaimed his owne Maisters, but onely desire him to consider, what reason he had, to avouche, that to hold the Ceremonies <hi>unlawfull,</hi> is a new tenet lately broached, contrarie to that which was helde in Queen Elizabeths days, whenas he accounteh Mr. Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our Maister in this doctrine, who had to doe in the first infamous silencing of Ministers for Ceremonies, in the beginning of D. Whitgifts Dominatinon? But what is that which is brought forth out of <hi>our own Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>? Nothing but this: that after publick worship, <hi>the people are to use a reverent gesture, as bowing downe the head before the Minister.</hi> Wherupon the Rejoynder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, whether <hi>this adoration be essentiall, necessarie worship or no? and in what sense this respect of the Minister be by him called worship of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>od</hi>? To which I answer
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:245:234"/>
1. that I doe not finde it by him called worship of God at all 2. that it were a great absurditie for him to call a <hi>respect of man, worship of God,</hi> as the Rejoynder doeth. 3. that the adoration spoken of Neh. 8.7. from whence he tooke that observation, was proper essentiall exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worship. In this therfore nothing is founde to purpose.</p>
                  <p>One observation is added further by the the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, namely, that diverse of our Divines doe make this part of the defini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of proper worship, that it <hi>be according to the commandement of God.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that suche difinitions are to be understood of <hi>true and lawfull</hi> worship, even as those definitions of an oath, which require the true God to be sworne by, are to be taken of right and lawfull oathes onely, because swearing by false Gods, is swearing, as all worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, of false Gods, is worship, though both unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, answer is tendered to this reason of Mr. Br. <hi>The bare ratifying of the present use of any thing, cannot make it true and lawfull worship, if it had not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore some nature of worship in the use of it.</hi> The force lieth in this, that bare ratifying or authorizing of any thing to have that use which it had before without suche authoritie, doeth not change the physicall enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, essence, or use of it, but onely the authoritie, or lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of it. The instances brought by the Rejoynder to the contrarie, may have some shew, but have no force to that purpose. <hi>1. The sole stampe of the King, makes that current money, which was not money at all before, but</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:245:234"/>
onely <hi>used by way of bartery.</hi> In which comparison, he utterly mistaketh and varieth the <hi>qualitie</hi> wherin it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth. For on the one side, it standeth thus: <hi>If God should command and us to use our Ceremonies, after the same manner that we have used them, without his commande, they should be parts of Gods proper outward worship.</hi> On the other side it standeth thus: <hi>if the Kinge commande that peice of mettall to be used for current money, which before was not used so, but onely for bartery, it should be current money.</hi> Here is no similitude, because no proportion of qualitie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As the sole word of God, made living creatures of those that were not living, before, so sayth the Rejoynder the sole institution of God, makes that action to be true worship, which was before no reall worship at all, though used to the same ende, and in the same manner.</hi> But <hi>1.</hi> the <hi>creating</hi> word of that which was not before in being, differs so muche from that <hi>ratifying</hi> word which presupposeth the being of the thinge ratified, that here is not so muche as a shew of proportion. 2. This is a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to that which the Rejoynder teacheth, pag. <hi>125. If any thinge be doen to the honoring of God immediatly and of it self, which God requires not so to be doen, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per immediate externall false worship.</hi> For hence it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly followeth, that nothing can be doen, to the same ende with true proper worship, but it must be proper worship, eyther true, if it be required of God, or false, if not so required. 3. <hi>The place of Sacrifice, before God had determined the particular place, though used to the same ende, and in the same manner, was not in it self any part
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:245:235"/>
of reall worship to God: and yet after Gods determination, it was.</hi> I answer. There was a great difference in the <hi>manner,</hi> wherin the place determined (so as it was) ought to be used. For ther was speciall mysteriall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to be observed in the one, which was not in the other.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise, I see not what more reall worship ther was in Iacobs place of sacrifizing at Bethel, upon Gods speciall determination, Gen. 35. then in Abrahams sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifizing at <hi>Hebron,</hi> without any suche speciall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, Gen. 13.</p>
                  <p>When all other Essays faile, the Repl. himself is brought in as guiltie of contradiction, because he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth these two thinges: <hi>the institution of God doeth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish true wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ship from false: and yet it doeth not alter the common nature of worship. For (sayth the Rejoynder) it is as if one should say: the reasonable soule doeth distinguish man from creatures that have not understanding: and yet it doeth not alter the common nature of the creature.</hi> But the Repl. had answered this before, if the Rejoynder would have attended unto his wordes, as they are by himself set downe, pag. 189. <hi>alter the common nature of worship, that is, make that worship, which otherwise, being used to the same ende, and in the same manner, without Gods institution, were no worship at all.</hi> In which wordes he plainely expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that by <hi>altering the</hi> common nature of worship, he meant nothing lesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making true worship of false, but onely creating or making the common essentiall nature of worship. And certain it is, that the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule (as it is reasonable) doeth not make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:245:235"/>
essentiall nature of a living creature, for then ther could be no living creature, without a reasonable soule as the Rejoynder affirmeth, ther can be no proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, without Gods appointment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Against the Def. his invention of <hi>indifferent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> it was excepted (to passe by repetitions) that no Scripture, Divines, or good reason doeth acknowledge any suche worship. The ground is, because in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all worship is eyther approved as <hi>good,</hi> or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as <hi>evill</hi>: all Divines doe distribute worship into <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi>: and they have reason so to doe. To this the Rejoynder opposeth nothing but the contrarie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, grounded upon examples. 1. <hi>So farre</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as we may call the particularities of externall disposition, in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I will not here write over againe, that which hath been declared about these thinges in the head of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> But in breif thus: 1. The question is not, what this or that <hi>may be called,</hi> by a Rhetoricall trope, but what it is in the nature of it. 2. Respect to the utmost remote ende, doeth no more make matters of order, time, and place, worship, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it maketh worship of eating, &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and whatsoever we doe to the honor of God, 1. Cor. 10.31.3. In place, and howre, or in the election of one Psalme, before another, ther can no worship be placed, except we will make one worship to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by another, when it is timed, placed, and chosen.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:245:236"/>
4. Ther is no speciall worship in one of the gestures named that is not in the other. Neyther is any of these gestures so indifferent, as that it may be lawfull, to forbid, or refuse any of them, generally, and for all occasions, nor yet so, as that by circumstances (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any law or canon) they may become necessarie. These examples therfore serve not the turne they were brought for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ther is also (addeth the Rejoynder) an arbitrarie choise of essentiall Divine worship, as when we will pray or read, etc. where in respect of this libertie of choise, the kinde of worship is indifferent in some respect.</hi> Of which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I know not what to say: <hi>Necessarie worship is in some respect indifferent.</hi> Certainely that <hi>respect</hi> must make a worship, distinct from that necessarie worship wherof it is a respect: or else, as (by the Rejoynder his doctrine) <hi>all thinges in respect of their relation, are Ceremonies, and in respect of their utmost ende, worship, so all thinges, or at least all human actions, are also in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect arbitrarie and indifferent.</hi> Ther is no ende, or bottom in suche reasons. The trueth is, that this <hi>when</hi> which is here spoken of, is one and the same thinge with <hi>houre</hi> which was mentioned in the former instance, and therfore needeth no new answer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Def. for proving of his assertion (that Gods institution doeth difference necessarie and essentiall worship, from indifferent and accidentall) did bringe in the instance of lambes for colour unspotted, which was necessarie and essentiall (as he affirmed) after the law, though before indifferent and accidentall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:245:236"/>To this it was first answered, that this law of offering lambes for colour unspotted, is no where exstant, and therfore that this instance was alledged <hi>eyther out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or for want of due consideration.</hi> The Rejoynder being constreined to grant this exception to be just, turneth himself to those last words, <hi>eyther ignorance, or want of due consideration</hi>: and for them accuseth the Repl. of <hi>flying in the Def. his face, without Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> But if it be so great a crime, to impute eyther some ignorance or some inconsideratenesse (suche as no man alive is wholly free from) unto the Def. and if this be unchristian flying in his face, I am sure the Rejoynder hath gone beyoynd the face and stabbed deeper into our Vitals, in many passages of his Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>As succedaneall instances to the former, which was found failling, the Rejoynder bringeth in diverse, out of the Leviticall, or Ceremoniall law, which were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie before the law, and necessarily essentiall after. To all which, the second answer to the failing instance, giveth direct satisfaction. As for those Rites, which are further alledged, out of the Legende of fabulous Rabbines, by Mr. Ainsworth, and ratified by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder we regard them no more, then the Popish leaden Legendes. Onely the marginall conclusion out of these Instances is observable: <hi>The Repl. fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously supposeth, that all worship is onely true, or false, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a subdivision of true worship, into substantiall, and circumstantiall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:245:237"/>For 1. what reason can he render, of that which he layeth upon the Repl. as if he had supposed all worship to be <hi>onely</hi> true or false.</p>
                  <p>The Repl. never denied, but all worship is <hi>also</hi> good, or evill, internall, or externall, naturall, or instituted, etc.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reason which he bringeth, is onely from the <hi>subdivision</hi> of true worship. But that doeth not hinder a superdivision, or aequidivision, into common, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, Ecclesiasticall, and domesticall, as Mr. Perkinse divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the place before cited. 3. That division into substantiall, and accidentall, cannot possiblie (with any reason) be more applied unto true then false worship, except the Rejoynder will say, that no false worship is eyther substantiall, or accidentall.</p>
                  <p>The seconde answer to the former instance (belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all those by the Rejoynder adjoined) is, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> before the law, the same worship had been performed, with the same minde, that is, in the same manner, and to the same ende, it had been as essentiall worship, as after, though not so true, and lawfull.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder here first, observeth a contradiction to that which was formerly sayd sect. 6. <hi>worship doeth not varie, according to mens opinion.</hi> But if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the matter well, he shall finde both sayings well to agree. For though the want of some opinion doeth not varie the nature of worship, so as that the absence of this or that opinion, doeth make any externall worship, not essentiall: and yet it doeth so varie the nature of worship, as that the presence of some opinion, doeth (as an efficient, not as a formall cause) make some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:245:237"/>
act essentiall worship. The Rejoynder his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond observation is, that <hi>our Ceremonies are hereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from will worship, and superstition, except it can be proved, the imposers, or users of them, doe holde, that God is better pleased with them, then without them, in themselves, or that they are as pleasing to him, as if he had commanded them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The consequence of which <hi>heerby</hi> conclusion, no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician in the world can make good. Yet (taking out <hi>in themselves,</hi> as an intrusion) all the consequent part may be mainteyned. For if ther be any more good h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lde in the imposing and observing of them, then in the omitting of them, then God is better pleased with them, then without them. And that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and justly commanded by men authorized therto, is as pleasing to God as if he had commanded it. Nay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. It was also by the Repl. brought into the Def. his remembrance, that matter, and forme doe usually make up the essence of thinges, and that to instituted meanes, a proper ende is also required, but a right effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause not so. About this, the Rejoynder shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself perplexed.

                  <p>Where he manifestly separateth the essence of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, from essentiall worship, as if the essence of a man could exist without an essentiall man, 2. He gathereth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:245:238"/>
from that which was sayd of <hi>respect to the ende,</hi> in insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that therby their assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is cleared: viz. that <hi>Cer. respecting the honour of God mediatly, are not properly parts of Divine worship.</hi> As if here had been any mention or questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of <hi>mediatly,</hi> or <hi>immediatly, proper, or improper,</hi> and not onely of <hi>essentiall.</hi> But for so muche as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder would needs heer cite D.

Def. of Mr. Perk. pag. 844. <hi>Order and comlinesse (sayth the popish Bishop) is some part of Gods worship. But (sayth D. Abbot.) Who taught him this deep point of Philosophie, that an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is a part of the subject, that the beautie, or comelinesse of the body is a part of the body? Order and comelinesse properly and immediatly respect men, and therfore can be no parts of the woship of God.</hi> If this be not a plaine refuting of the Def. and the Rejoynder their assertion, then none is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in all the Replie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He in like manner concludeth, that <hi>every respect of the honor of God, doeth not make a thinge to be properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship.</hi> As if the Repl. had ever spoken, or dreamt of suche a phantasie, except it were in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder his name! His wordes are: beside <hi>the respect of the ende, is also required institution of means to an ende.</hi> What Paracelsian can draw so wilde an assertion, from suche a grounde as this?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It was (in the last place) demanded, whether, if the Temple of Ierusalem had been built, with insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all the appurtenances, sacrifices, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, there used, without any Commandement of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:245:238"/>
God, according as they were by his appointment, whether (sayth the Repl.) they had not been essentiall false worship, erected to God? The Rejoynder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth: <hi>Yes no doubt, if we may call (as the manner is) essentiall disworship, essentiall false worship: eyther in respect of the thinges themselves, or in the opinion conceyved in their use.</hi> Now marke (all readers that have sense) how this Rejoynder (here in the conclusion of all) is constreyned to confesse, that to be true, which he hath hitherto striven against as false. 1. The Repl. his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, that <hi>Gods institution doeth make that worship, which being used in the same manner and to the same ende, were otherwise no worship, or (as it pleaseth the Def. and Rejoynder to speake) no essentiall worship?</hi> The Rejoyn-hitherto hath contended against this, as against a great errour.</p>
                  <p>Now in the winding up of the wholle Argument, he confesseth, that some essentiall worship may be, without any institution of God. Certaynly, if this be so, then the institution of God, is not required to essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall worship, neyther is it of the essence of essentiall worship, that it be instituted of God. 2. He affirmed before, pag, 125. that <hi>proper immediat, (or essentiall) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are onely suche thinges as God hath to that ende ordeyned</hi> Yet here he confesseth, that essentiall worship may be without any commande of God. 3. The Rejoynder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, made <hi>essentiall and accidentall</hi> worship to be a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division of <hi>true</hi> worship. Now he confesseth, that ther is an <hi>essentiall</hi> worship under the head of <hi>false</hi> worship. 4. He acknowlegeth, that in all the former senselesse
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:245:239"/>
assertions, he did not speake, <hi>as the manner of speache is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That was therfore against the manner of speache, which the Def. &amp; he used before. 5. He graunteth some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be <hi>essentiall, in respect of the thinges themselves,</hi> separated from mens opinion. Yet hitherto, he would have made us beleive, that opinion did varie the nature of worship, as sect. 6. If this be not a plaine yeilding, and granting of the wholle Argument, ther can be none, save onely in plaine termes, to say, <hi>I yeeld.</hi>

                  <p>THe former argument being (though demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative) yet to the Def. his apprehension new, was derided as <hi>new learning</hi>: these following are excused from that censure, as being more popular, and seeming more fadomable. Of which it is to be observed, that moste of them are fetched out of incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine papiers, under the name of Mr. Hy. and <hi>others,</hi> upon the Def. his credit: wherin, what aequall dealing hath been used, it is very suspicious to any judicious reader, and some of those <hi>others,</hi> (for Mr. Hy. is past writing to) being asked, have testified, that in diverse passages they are muche abused. Yet even these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Arguments are defensible.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is: because <hi>they are imposed to breed an opinion of holinesse, by Mr. Hookers doctrine and therfore, as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:245:239"/>
parts of Gods worship.</hi> To which the Def. answereth, that <hi>it is no meant of operative holinesse, eyther by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or inhaesion, but onely significative.</hi> Whence he concludeth, a perverse purpose of calumniation: and the Rejoynder (adding another distinction, betwixt <hi>holinesse in them,</hi> and in the users of them) maketh mention also of <hi>dotage.</hi> But 1. the Def. his distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vaine: because even <hi>significative</hi> holinesse is also a part of Gods worship. Otherwise some holinesse must be fained, which having no other immediat ende but that which directly and immediatly tende to the honoring of God, is no part of his honor. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder also is vaine in limiting the matter to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For those thinges which are instituted to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat ende onely, that they may breed an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of holinesse, and so holinesse, in others, doe (in all reason) deserve the opinion of holinesse some way <hi>causall, or operative</hi> in themselves: because all breeding is causing, or working, 1. e. opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>It was also observed by the Repl. (onely in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis, by the way) that holinesse <hi>eyther by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or inhaesion,</hi> were unreasonablie by the Defend. disjoyned.</p>
                  <p>This the Rejoynder excepteth against, and sayth, in those termes ther is no more disjunction, then in these <hi>love or charitie, Magistrates, or Governours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he forgotte the proper English note of disjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>eyther, or.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:245:240"/>Where did he ever read suche a phraze: <hi>eyther love, or charitie, eyther Magistrates, or Governours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was also replied, that Mr. Hooker attributed <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> holinesse to the <hi>Crosse,</hi> in allowing all that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ascribed to it. The Rejoynder his onely mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall exception is, that the instance was here <hi>not of the Crosse, but of the Surplice.</hi> Yet the question is of <hi>our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> which is as well concluded from one, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Rejoynder himself, even now, spoke of holinesse <hi>in them,</hi> as of many, not <hi>in it,</hi> as of one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie onely.</p>
                  <p>Neyther is ther any more holinesse in one, then in the other, if both be <hi>onely significative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Repl. further affirmed, that Mr. Hooker spoke of reverence to be signified <hi>towards</hi> the Ceremonies. To which is rejoined I know not what. But let Mr. Hookers words, goeing before those nakedly cited by the Def. and Rejoynder, be considered. <hi>The wise man could not mention so muche as the garments of Holinesse, but with singul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r reverence,</hi> and it will be evident, wherto he required reverence.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, Mr. Hookers opinion is slighted, as <hi>privat.</hi> Wheras all know, that he is in our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall controversies, of as publicke note, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Bellamine in any Popish.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second reason being sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly propounded by the Def. out of Mr. Hy. his mangled manuscript, was thus by the Repl. distinctly explained: A holy assembly of Spirituall Lords, and their Assistants, if they be truly holy, and spirituall in their authoritie, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:245:240"/>
of it, will appoint no Ceremonie but holy: and by the observance of the sayd Ceremonies, have some spirituall honor redounding unto themselves: because the vertue which is found in any effect, doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde allways to the prayse of the cause. Of this argument, the Rejoynder pronounceth, that <hi>it is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wring out of sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> scurrilitie, to the very lees, a scornefull jest, ascoffing, a spitefull jest, a vagrant thinge, the very noting wherof is answer enough.</hi> Now how should a man deal with suche disputers?</p>
                  <p>The Def. brought this Argument out of unknowen papers, into a publick booke, and answered it with sharp wordes. The Repl. onely shewed the force of it: and for that, he is set upon a fresh with new wordes, like <hi>swords and daggars.</hi> Could they neyther suffer this reason to sleep in the darke, nor endure any light of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation should be set by it?</p>
                  <p>And what fault can be found with the repeating of those titles, which the Prelats in Convocation take to themselves, or in drawing a conclusion from them?</p>
                  <p>In the second place, our Rejoynder undertaketh to giue a <hi>reall</hi> answer to this reason. To which purpose, <hi>1.</hi> he denieth that our Ceremonies are <hi>of the institution of the Convocation-house.</hi> And yet the same Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in answer to the Repl. his preface. pag. 61. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of us, for <hi>infringing the libertie of the Churche in her Convocation, touching the appointment of externall Rites,</hi> or Ceremon. And pag. 71. as in diverse other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he telleth us that <hi>the Convocation house maketh and establisheth Canons upon &amp; with the Kings Commission, and allowance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:245:241"/>They are the words also of the Parliament, set downe pag. 70. that <hi>the Clergie of England made the Canons.</hi> Neyther can any man doubt of this, that have but looked on the booke of Canons. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of suche thinges by Civill authoritie, doeth no more take the institution of them from the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, then the like ratification of any point in true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, doeth take the institution of it from God and Christ. 2. He denieth the consequence: because <hi>a holy assemblie may ordeyne them, and yet not make them holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is manifest, that a holy assemblie, as it is suche, gathered together in the holy name of Christ, as their <hi>efficient,</hi> and <hi>finall</hi> cause, cannot but putte a holy <hi>forme</hi> upon their ordinances. <hi>Qualis causa, tale effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His third answer is that <hi>these Ceremonies may be called holy, because, they are used in holy actions.</hi> Which is just so, as a <hi>pesse, hassok, or cushin</hi> may be called holy, because it is used to kneel upon, in the holy acte of prayer. But instituted significant Ceremonies are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of another holinesse, to all that doe not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shut their eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Repl. (after the Def.) goeth about to prove that the Convocation may be called a <hi>sacred Synod, and holy in regard of their function.</hi> Which is so farr from being denied by us (upon the supposition of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of suche a function, as they take upon them) that it is the ground of our reason, to prove their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances holy. So that the Rejoynder might (in this place) have spared those sweet words of his: <hi>stomacke,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:245:241"/>without wit, or learning: these men say (in effect) to all other men, stand backe, I am holier then thou, they are censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and uncharitable.</hi> Yet the Repl. could not consent, that our Convocations should be so accounted holy as Churches instituted of Christ, and gathered for true holy worship: because neyther of these doe agree to our Convocation. Heerupon the Rejoynder (having nothing to say that was pertinent) speaketh something of right Ecclesiasticall Synodes, accuseth the Separatists with Mr. Iacob, and lastly affirmeth our Convocations to be gathered for <hi>a speciall dutie of Gods service,</hi> though he will not tell us, what it is, and confesseth, that litle good is sometimes (he might have sayd at any time) doen at their meetings. Which kinde of answering I leave to the judgement of any reader.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third reason, feched out of M. Hy. his papers, is, that Crosse and Surplice are set apart from civill uses, and <hi>appropriated</hi> unto the actes of religion in Gods service. To which the Def. answered, by equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Pulpit-cloth, Communion cup, and place of meeting in like manner appropriated. Wherupon the Repl. was, in generall, that the Def. did well understand what was meant by <hi>appropriation.</hi> This putte the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder into a passion, expressed by many wordes: <hi>a pretty sleight, for that which cannot be defended, by those which are pusled and toyled, a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, lent by Mr. Iacob, a mere shift, proceeding out of an haughtie desire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that which hath been once spoken.</hi> And this is all that I finde rejoined to that passage. To which I say nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:245:242"/>A reason was rendred of the former assertion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Pulpit-cloth Communion-cup, and Meeting-place are onely civill, being taken from the ordinarie civill customes of men. To which the Rejoynder opposeth, that <hi>no civill man will say, that they are onely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in their application:</hi> Whiche is verie true. Nor will any Grammarian say, that good Hebrue, Greek, or Latine, are onely gramaticall in their application, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are applied to the expressing of all kinde of trueths and falsehoods: and yet they are onely grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall <hi>etimologie</hi> and <hi>syntaxe.</hi> No Naturalist will say, that the <hi>earth and ayre</hi> are onely naturall in application, and yet they are onely naturall beinges.</p>
                  <p>It was further added, that <hi>clothes, cups, meeting places etc. are of the same use out of Gods service, that they are in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is occasion of admiration, and exclamation to the Rejoynder. But he might have considered, that the immediat ende of a clothe, is to cover; of a cup, to drinke out; of meeting places, to meet in: and then where is the strangenesse of this assertion? Is ther not the same immediat use of a mans eyes, in reading one booke, as another, of a mans eares, in hearing one voyce, and another, how soever the subject seen, or heard, may differ in nature or kinde.</p>
                  <p>A distinction was likewise used, betwixt appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this or that individuall, and of the kinde. To this it is rejoined, 1. that the individualls are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse appropriated. Whiche is not so: because appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of the kinde and individuall both, is more then
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:245:242"/>
of the individuall alone. Individuals may be extrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie, &amp; accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally appropriated, the kinde remayning intrinsically common, &amp; indifferent. 2. <hi>That some indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidualls (without all their kinde) have been appropriated to holie uses.</hi> Of whiche no man doubteth: because one individuall may be so used, without other. But is ther therfor no difference, betwixt extrinsecall, accidentall appropriation of one Levite to the Ministrie, and the whole tribe? 3. <hi>Not all kinde of linnen garments, or cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are appropriated to religious uses..</hi> As if the question were of linnen garments simplie, though they were used without any suche institution as a Surplice hath, onely for the naturall conveniencie of it, or of crossing the fingers, upon occasion, to drive away flies, that come crosse upon a mans face. Ther was (in the last place) mention made of the <hi>significancie</hi> of our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which maketh them in their intrinsecall nature (as suche) without any further expectation of occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall application, to be proper to religion. But of this our Rej. would not hear, in this place. Let it therfore passe to the next chapter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth confirmation wholly dependeth on Matth. 15. Where the Def. would have it, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour condemneth not the act of washing (that is sayth the Rej.) the <hi>monitorie significant signe of washing,</hi> used by the Pharisies, but their <hi>intention, &amp; opinion,</hi> in attributing legall and operative <hi>sanctitie, to that their owne invention.</hi> Now concerning monitorie significancie, enough hath been spoken, in the head of Ceremonies, and it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be discussed in the following chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:245:243"/>For the present, it was first noted by the Repl. that some intention and opinion of holinesse cleaveth to our Ceremonies. This is denied by the Rej. and yet in his whole dispute, he maketh them <hi>worship,</hi> though acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, arbitrarie, and improper. Neyther can any man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>double or treble religious</hi> Ceremonie without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and opinion of some holinesse belonging to it, more then to that which is not so religious.</p>
                  <p>It was in the second place observed, that more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was attributed to those washings, then is by many among us to the crosse, cannot be proved out of the text, ther being no one circumstance in it, which may not fitly be applied to our Ceremonies. To whiche the Rej. sayth 1. that those are <hi>blinde &amp; superstitious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which attribute suche thinges to the Crosse, not the <hi>Church imposing.</hi> Iust as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in the place by and by to be cited, answereth Calv. about the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si qui sunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Catholicos rudioras, &amp;c. Eos corrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos putamus, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>If there be any more rude among hir Catholiques, we hold them worthy to be corrected.</hi> But are not our blinde Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and those rude Papists, hardened in their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the imposing &amp; urging of those thinges which they superstitiously dote on?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Pharisies (addeth the Rej.) were so strongly <hi>conceyted</hi> of this washing, that they thought, without it, <hi>the very creatures of God should defile them.</hi> But that of the <hi>very creatures defiling,</hi> is not in the text: It is but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie collected out of our Saviours following discourse, that they estemeed some defiling to follow upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the creature, not as it was a creature, but as it was so used against the tradition of their Elders. And are are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:245:243"/>
there not many to be found in England, that their very Baptisme is deficient, unsufficient, and so defiled: if it want the Crosse?</p>
                  <p>For further answer, it was alleged by the Repl. that not onely Calvin in Mat. 15. but also Bellarmin himself (de eff. Sacr. l. 2. cap. 32.) sayth, that the Pharisies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing was condemned as <hi>vaine, and unprofitable,</hi> setting aside, intention, and opinion of legall, operative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Rejoynder answering first for Bellarmine, sayth he is abused: because (forsooth) he speakes that <hi>falsely, to defend the Popish Ceremonies.</hi> As if it were not the common notion of all Christians, that <hi>vayne and unprofitable</hi> Ceremonies are to be condemned, or as if Bellarmine alone sayd this! or as if this could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Popish Ceremonies, which are more easily defended from any other charge, then they can be from this, that they are <hi>vayne and unprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who would have thought, that D.B. would defende vaine and unprofitable Ceremonies, in Gods solemne worship? But <hi>Chemnitius</hi> (sayth he) <hi>observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, that Christ condemned not these washings simply as prophane fopperies, nor as simplie unlawfull, but in respect of religion placed in them.</hi> Not <hi>simplie profane fopperies,</hi> that is, voyde of all shew from Scripture, or reason, nor <hi>simplie unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> if the actes in themselves be considered or abstrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all relations by institution added unto them: but in respect of <hi>religion placed in them,</hi> 1. e. superstition adjoyned unto them. Now ther is <hi>superstitio</hi> not onely <hi>pernitious,</hi> but also <hi>vaine, and superfluous. Filucius, tract.</hi> 24. <hi>cap. 2.</hi> And chemnitius, in the same place affirmeth,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:245:244"/>
the Pharisies washinges to have been condemned, for that (notwithstanding their vanitie; and want of Divine institution) they were made <hi>some part</hi> of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>As for Calvine, the Rej. doeth not denie, but that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage alleged is found in the place, <hi>the inventing of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies was an idle vanitie, before the high opinion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was added unto it.</hi> Yet (sayth he) 1. <hi>he cleareth our Ceremonies, which was cast upon the Iewish superstitious washings.</hi> From some of that blame, (it may be granted) but not from all. For then those wordes (which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder confesseth him to set downe) should have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a contradiction to the other. 2. <hi>This shread</hi> (added he) <hi>is falsely alleged as touching the intention.</hi> And why so I pray?</p>
                  <p>Because (forsooth) Calvins meaning was, that to devize new washing, <hi>to the like ende, and with the like opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, as of those which God had set, wa of idle vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this were his meaning, how can that meaning agree with the meaning of these wordes: <hi>It was of idle vanitie before the high opinion of Religion was added unto it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was there any higher opinion of Religion added unto those washinges, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the washinges which God had set? <hi>Extremitie drives men to hard shifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the fuller clearing of this reason, that idle and vayne or superfluous worship is condemned by Christ, Mat. 15. let these testimonies, and reasons be wel consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

                     <hi>of which number of additions were those things of washing. There was a double fault for the innovation it selfe was not a slight metter and then this, that they stood more upon those observations of their owne then they did on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God. 1.

                  <p n="5">5. In the fift place, another reason (or charge) was brought out of Mr. Hy. his papers, that <hi>the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies imposed, are (for their use and practise) preferred before principall parts of Gods worship: because this is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats Canons: wear a Surplice, or preache not: Crosse, or baptize not.</hi> This the Def. accused of <hi>dull Sophistrie</hi>: because by this meanes, onely an <hi>orderly discreete preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is preferred before one that is <hi>factious and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> Of this base <hi>Bonnerly</hi> speache, the Repl. shewed his just detestation. For which he is censured by the Rejoynder <hi>of casting it out of the mouth of his stomacke, of malice, intemperat railings, and a furious spirit.</hi> All which I leave to the readers judgement. Onely this I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that he would excuse all or most of the Prelats, from <hi>willing</hi> silencing any able and godly ministers for omission of our Cerremonies, and doeth absolutely denie, that the Def. ever silenced any Minister (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or unwillingly (for <hi>onely omission</hi> of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Concerning which termes (<hi>willingly, and onely omission</hi>) some light of explication were needfull. For <hi>onely omission</hi> of Crosse, or Surplice, by oversight, or other accident, the Pope himself will not silence a Preist, as all Popish Divines tell us, in affirming that to be no mortall sinne. And how those which make Canons for silencing upon <hi>purposed continued</hi> omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and execute the same partly by themselves, and partly by their instruments, can be sayd to doe it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:245:245"/>
                     <hi>unwillingly,</hi> this requireth interpretation, which will certainly be found tardy. For clearing of this charge, from the imputation of <hi>dull Sophistrie,</hi> the Repl. first propounded it in this manner: an able godly Minister without the use of these Ceremonies, is not suffered in the Ministerie, wheras an unable &amp; ungodly one, with the use of them, is suffered: therfore they are praeferred before maine thinges: Vpon this, the Rejoynder 1. observeth, that from hence doeth not follow that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: <hi>therfore our Ceremonies are made parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> As if this conclusion were once named by Mr. Hy. or by the Def. in this charge.</p>
                  <p>If he will make it supposed, he must shew us Mr. Hy. his concealed papers for the proof of that supposition. He addeth 2. that <hi>all Prelats are to be charged with this practise: and that they have no suche power for depriving of bad, as they have for depriving of good Ministers.</hi> To which I answer, the question is not here of <hi>all,</hi> but of that which standeth by our Canons, and Canonicall practise. Yet neyther any authors, nor any defenders of the Canons, can be excused from partaking in this practise, no not the Rejoynder himself. And as for those Praelats, which have great power to doe evill, and litle, or none, to doe good (or which is all one, power effectually to hinder good, and not evill) they have a very dangerous standing, dangerous (I say) as well for others, as for their owne selves. Yet, when our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates procured that authoritie of doing evill, they might as easily, and more lawfully have procured the other, of doeing good: not to say, that none of them doe so

                  <p>The third Rej. is of a <hi>calumniation,</hi> because <hi>some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Ministers are suffered, and some unable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deprived.</hi> But 1. this calumniation concerning <hi>some</hi> inconformable suffered for a time, extraordinalie, besides, nay against Canonicall order. 2. He can scarce name one, that he hath knowen deprived for that he was <hi>unable.</hi> 3. The Turkes and Infidels would cashier their Preists for <hi>some</hi> ungodlinesse. What a poor rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is this?</p>
                  <p>A fourth consideration is, <hi>that a farre lesse offence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> is more punishable then a greater confessed, and that certayn evills, in themselves lesser, <hi>may</hi> doe more hurt, then others in themselves <hi>greater.</hi> Whiche consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it be applied to the purpose, will appear in the proper colours: If a Minister confesse himself <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> he is not so punnishable, as he that defendeth the Ceremonies are not to be used. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing of our controverted Ceremonies, may doe more hurt, then an unable and ungodly generation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters conforming. In that which is further added, under the title of <hi>lastly</hi> I finde nothing but words &amp; assertions, without backing reasons. <hi>Valeant igitur, quantum valere possunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same charge was (in the second place) thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the Repl. Though ther cannot be found able
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:245:246"/>
and discreet conformable Ministers, enough to supplie all the Parishes of England, yet many of godly men are shut out of the Ministerie for unconformitie. Therfore Conformitie is praeferred before the maine dueties of Gods worship. Heer the Rej. having litle to say, setteth notwithstanding two colours on the matter. 1. That the consequence is not simplie true, but onely that <hi>they conceive</hi> the non-conformitie may, by consequence, be a greater hurt, then an able and godly Ministrie, in suche places, as want it, would recompence. As if this crying sinne were onely <hi>their conceyt,</hi> not their practise, or that their conceits could make this sinne no sinne! or that the salvation of many thousandes of soules, could not recompence the hurt that would come upon the refusing of human Ceremonies? What is this other then daubing rotten walls with untempered morter.</p>
                  <p>His second colour is, that <hi>non-conformitans are no lesse blameable, whoe had rather have no worship, then conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Whiche is as muche as if he should say, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will not sinne for Gods glorie, doeth as muche offend, as he that will not suffer God to be glorified by those which will not to that ende be content to sinne against his conscience.</p>
                  <p>Because this reason was accused of dullenesse, it was noted (by the way) that every <hi>Plowman,</hi> being a good Christian, did usually make it in this blunt manner, against the Praelats proceedinges, and that the Repl. (being, as it seemeth first brought up amonge suche plaine people) had from his childhood tooke it to be unanswerable. Heerupon, the Rej. 1. answereth the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:245:247"/>
blunt argument, with this sharpnesse: <hi>It is like as if one should say, that God, admitting no man to the Priesthood with bodily blemish, did therfore praeferre bodily perfection before spirituall.</hi> Wherin, he deceyveth him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muche, whether he respecteth the first explication of this reason, or the second. For according to the first, it must be affirmed, that God would suffer men blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their bodies, to be priests, though they had no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fitnesse for that office. And according to the second, he should have sayd, that God having otherwise to furnish the Priesthood, according to a superior law, which he might not of his will dispence with, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding exclude some of those which that law did allow. But both these assertious are too absurde for the Rejoynder to owne.</p>
                  <p>His second note is of <hi>Plowmen, and Children,</hi> that they are not the best <hi>Logicians.</hi> Whiche though it be true, yet is nothing to the purpose: because many Plowmen have good naturall logicke, to reason withall. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they did very inconsideratly, whoe vented so good reasons under the title of the prayer, and complaint of the Ploughman, as in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Foxe is to be seen, Edw. 3. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge which reasons (a remarkable thinge) this very slighted argument is one. For so are the wordes: <hi>O Lord, for breaking of thy law, the Praelats will set men penance, or pardon them, and maintayne them, as oft as they trepasse. But Lord, if a man once break their laws, or speak against them he may doe penance but once, and after be burnt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The summe of which, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Foxe, in the margent, thus gathereth: <hi>The breaking of the Popes law is more punished,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:245:247"/>
then the breaking of Gods law.</hi> And as for <hi>children,</hi> I am perswaded, that D.B. himself, had some trueths so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto him, that by no contrarie shew of logick they could ever be wrunge out of him. Sure I am that Timothie, knowing the Scriptures from a childe, had many suche.</p>
                  <p>Neyther was ther mention made eyther of <hi>plowmen or children,</hi> But onely to shew the evidence of this trueth, not the logicall Demonstration of it.</p>
                  <p>That which was added, by way of limitation, to the name of a <hi>plowman,</hi> namely, that it was understood of suche a plowman, as is also <hi>a good Christian,</hi> is very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and yet as very unreasonablie carped at by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder as <hi>savouring strongly of that spirit of Separation, which hath been hunted after in the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se of inconformitie. For (sayth the Rejoynder if any will beleive all his conceytes) this shewes, that with these men the adversaries of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Bishops are the onely good Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a strange streine, to come from D. B. who both hath been an unconformist, and since he hath changed that title, cannot but know, that sundrie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists have caried themselves towardes himself, in all respects, as toward a good Christian. And what <hi>stronge savour</hi> is in this: <hi>every plowman that is a good Christian doeth unsua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly make this Argument.</hi> Doeth he imagine, that onely those plowmen, that are professed adversaries to Ceremonies and Bishops, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> make it? Nay he knoweth, that many, and many of those that could otherwise well digest both, yet doe apprehend this course of Bishops silencing Ministers for suche Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:245:248"/>
is ungodly, and Antichristian. If he did not know so muche, yet he cannot be ignorant, that the word here interposed by the Repl. for limitation, <hi>usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> doeth except some more ignorant, or lesse attentive good Christians. And I doubt not, but the Rejoynder will affirme, that every good conforming Minister in England, doth <hi>usually</hi> account them for scismatickes that condemne the Ceremonies: yet I would not thence conclude, that with him, those of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the <hi>onely</hi> good Ministers. For ther is as muche sinne against charitie, in rash accusing others of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse, as ther is in being uncharitable: of which fault, the Rejoynder can never clear this affected passage, which he in opposition let fall from him.</p>
                  <p>For overthrow of the former reason, an instance was brought in by the Def. taken from a Chancelor, who may (sayth he) put out of Commission him that refused to sit in the place appointed, without praefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that place to the Kings service. To this the Repl. 1. answered, that no wise Chancelour, would, for his owne pleasure, or for the circumstance of a place easily change, or put out of Commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a grave wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another like unto him ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be found. These last words <hi>another like unto him cannot be found,</hi> are cached up by the Rejoynder and under the shew or sound of them, the Inconformists are by him tossed (as it were) in a blancket, as <hi>being of a high straine, beyond all other men, in their owne persuasion etc.</hi> But he might have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (if sinister affection had not hidden it from him) that the case immediatly goeing before this answer,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:245:248"/>
was of shutting out able godly Ministers for inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, when <hi>ther cannot be found able and fit conformable Ministers enough.</hi> Wherupon is inferred, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the L. Chancelour will not help the Def. <hi>in this case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what kinde of straine is this then in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to conceal the <hi>case,</hi> and stretche the wordes as it were with his teeth, unto suche a strange odious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of so witlesse a bragge. Yet if ther had been no suche dependance of these wordes upon that <hi>case,</hi> they might be well defended, as understood of an absolute comparison (eyther for abilitie, or pietie) but in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this or that people; from whome suche Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are sometime plucked away by violence, whose like, in regard of that people (which have been muche edified by them, and more inwardly knowen, and also (upon good ground) affected unto them, then they can suddainly unto any other) cannot be found.</p>

Burges, in his Apologie (towards the conclusion) would not have alleged against the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of himself, and others like him, that those (at the least) should succeed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were not so wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the condition of their sheep. It might be also added, that though another like might be founde, yet it is not in the power of that L. Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or the Bishop to finde, bringe, &amp; place him in the same Commission, because (for the succession) he must depende upon the Patrons pleasure, not limited to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the predecessor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:245:249"/>But that this wresting of the Replyer his words, was affected (in some sort against conscience) it may appear by this, that no man will surmize, the Repl. to thinke, that to no unconformable Minister a Peer may be founde: because it is to be supposed (at the least) that another unconformable one may not onely be equall, but also superior unto him in all absolute perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It was also observed, for answer to this instance of a L. Chancelour, that about the circumstance of place, for Commissioners to meet in, ther can be no <hi>Conscience</hi> pretended, wheras in our Ceremonies, solemne oathes are offered, that no thing but conscience doeth keep us from them. The Rejoynder 1. opposeth, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likenesse maketh, nothing to the question. And yet it sheweth, that a Chancelour may in civill matters, where no conscience can be pretended, take more upon him without preferring, or comparing the matters, then a Bishop can, where Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce evidently withstandeth: because Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciëce is not to be vexed, except the matter be so great, that (in respect of Gods glorie) it cannot be neglected. He 2. opposeth, that many more of the Conformitans, are ready to take it <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> upon their oath, that nothing but conscience makes them conforme. To which I say 1. that he who was immediatly before, so curious in houlding to the question, should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently have digressed from it: as the Rejoynder here doeth, in turning the comparison, which was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a L. Chancelour and a Bishop, in respect of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyted Commissioner, and a conscionable Minister
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:245:249"/>
about preferring one thing before another, into a new comparison, betwixt the consciences of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, &amp; of those which refuse to conforme. 2. Of that <hi>so,</hi> if the same meaning be kept on both sides, I muche doubt.</p>
                  <p>For our Conscience is, that in no place, nor u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponany mans commande, we may conforme: and theirs is, that upon great urgent extremities, they may some time, and in some place conforme. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if it had been free in England to use these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or not to use them. D. B. himself hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that would ever have made him conforme.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Repl. added something, about the Def. his Pontificall termes, <hi>factious and exorbitant men.</hi> opposed to <hi>orderly and discreet Preachers.</hi> As 1. that the Def. himself in his conscience will not say, that Mr. Midsley of Ratsdale, and others like him, were factious and exorbitant men. 2. That this is the language of that evill servant, who beat his fellow-servants, better then himself: Mat. 24.49.3. That all those who are placed in the roome of silenced Ministers, are not orderly and discreet Preachers. <hi>4.</hi> That faction and exorbitancie may better be charged upon the Prelats, for breaking many substantiall, ancient, wholsome Canons, then upon us, for breaking a Ceremonious Canon. Now (setting aside the Rejoynder his wandring wordes, with the hony and gall of them) see what he bringeth to the purpose. <hi>1.</hi> The first he granteth to be true. But denieth that the Def. meant so generally. And yet the Def. his words are: <hi>whoe seeth not, that to deprive
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:245:250"/>
men of their Ministerie for not using of the Ceremonies (for that was objected</hi>) is to <hi>preferre an orderly and discreet Preacher, before one that is factious and exorbitant.</hi> If this be not generally spoken, let any reasonable ear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second he doeth not absolutely gain-say but casteth the like, or rather a farre greater fault in our faces: that wee (forsooth) doe <hi>condemne to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of darknesse. Bishops, Conformitants, and in a manner all that are not of our partie.</hi> Whiche is so manifest a slander, that the evill servant spoken of Matth. 24.49. could hardly vent one more shamelesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third he confesseth: But would make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent though it clean overthroweth the Def. his generall assertion, before expressed. He addeth also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn frothy wordes, conteyning litle else, beside mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest slanders, which if he were put to suche an oath, as they call <hi>juramentum calumniae,</hi> he would not owne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Prelats willfull, and continuall breaking of many, substantiall, &amp; wholsome Canons, is not denied by the Rej. but yet to save their credit, he addeth, that all suche Canons doe not binde every <hi>particular Churche, but her owne.</hi> In which wordes there is neyther rime, nor reason. The Canons objected, may be seen in Master Parker, part. 2. c. 9. sect. 4. to be Canons of our owne Churche. What then hath the Rejoynder sayd to the purpose? His other stuffe hath been sundrie times exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and found nothing worthe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All these considered, it will appear, that the Rej. had more will, then power, to maintayne, that the silencing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:245:250"/>
of Preachers for our Ceremonies, is the <hi>praeferring of orderly discreet Preachers, before those that are factious and exorbitant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. After all this, out of Mr. Hy. his papiers, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Def. to bring in some peices out of the Abrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which for substance are suche as diverse times have been handled before: and therfor need not muche labor in this place.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that <hi>many people in our land, are knowen to hold the Sacraments not rightly and sufficiently administred or receyved without them.</hi> For the force of suche an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the muliitude, many testimonies are alledged in the Abrigement, and applied unto this assertion, not in deed to prove the same simplie, but to shew what is the consequence of it. All these the Def. left out, and the Rej. had no minde to take them in, but chose rather to rest in this: they are no proofs of the assumption. It was added by the Repl. the opinion even of a few, may make some action unlawfull, which the opinion of many other cannot make lawfull. 1. Cot. 10.28. To avoyd this, the Rejoynder had nothing materiall to say, before he had changed <hi>unlawfull</hi> into <hi>simplie</hi> unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>The just number of those that are so minded, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, or disproved, without numbering and examining all the people. It was not therfore any meaning of those that gave the rule to reckon by the poul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Def. and Rejoynder would have us.</p>
                  <p>Neyther is this observation brought in to prove <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi> and <hi>observing,</hi> conjunctly, as they would bear the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:245:251"/>
reader in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but only for the <hi>observing,</hi> other proofes being added for the <hi>imposing.</hi> Yet it was observed by the Repl. that while <hi>actions of this kinde are supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously observed, they that still impose them in those places where they are so observed, may truely be interpreted so to impose them.</hi> To which the Rejoynder giveth no other proper answer, but onely leaving out the pith of that assertion, <hi>may be truly so interpreted,</hi> substituteth another; of <hi>a purposed ende</hi>: and then misinterpreteth <hi>actions of this kinde,</hi> as if they were meant of the speciall <hi>kinde of thinges,</hi> and not of unnecessarie actions known to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously abused.</p>
                  <p>It was also noted as ridiculous in the Def. that <hi>those people which thinke that Sacraments are not rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, or receyved without the Ceremonies, are brought into that conceyt by our condemning of the sayd Ceremonies.</hi> The Rejoynder answereth, that this condemning of them, must needs make some thinke that they are imposed as parts of religion, and so occasion the simple to think that <hi>we</hi> esteem them so.</p>
                  <p>In which answer, beside that I know not who are meant by <hi>we,</hi> and that an <hi>occasion</hi> of the second or third hand, is made a cause, ther is no mention made of <hi>right or unright Sacraments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For lessening of the number of those which so esteeme of our Ceremonies, the Papists are first remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as having no <hi>great conceyt</hi> of them. Which I leave to experience. Onely because the Rejoynder requireth testimonie, I can informe him, that Gretser, Apol. pro Greg. 7. p, 8. hath these words: <hi>A Lutheran, preaching in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:245:251"/>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>celebrates a German Masse.</hi> And the Rejoynder himself confesseth in the next wordes, they have a <hi>better conceyt</hi> of them, then of the contrarie, and that suche as hath been held <hi>likely to araw them to our service,</hi> and that they have <hi>a great disaffection</hi> to those that will not tollerat the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of their religious Ceremonies. Adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that after B. Babington, and B. Andreos, D. Morton him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf, in the last words of his Protestants Appeal, hath confirmed the rumor, that Pope <hi>Paulus quaertus,</hi> did offer to confirme our wholle <hi>Service and Liturgie.</hi> The Papists therfore have no cause whie they should not have a good conceyt of our Ceremonies, which of all the Service come neerest to, and make most for them.</p>
                  <p>As for the rest, that so conceyt of the Ceremonies, which are not of <hi>your disciplining,</hi> sayth the Rejoynder) and yet are conformable they are <hi>not many.</hi> As if those of our disciplinating, were so conceyted, or those of Wales, Non-residents, and dumb-residents forlorne charges, who are not disciplined by us, were eyther few or of reformed judgement. Surely D.B. is not like himself, when he upon ingagement defendeth that which cannot be defended.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The second thing brought out of the abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is about the punishment inflicted for omission of our Ceremonies, greater then for breaking of Gods law, in perjurie and adulterie. Now this hath formerly been handled. In this place therfore, it shall suffize, to set a few notes, upon the Rej. his answers. <hi>1.</hi> He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:245:252"/>
betwixt <hi>punishing, and punishing as a sinne.</hi> As if punishment in the internall nature of it, were not <hi>of sinne</hi>! 2. He distinguisheth betwixt internall peace of the Churche, consisting more in observance of Gods commandements, and <hi>the peace of her externall pollicie, impeached by the neglect of her constitutions.</hi> Wheras he should have made the distinction betwixt one <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi> &amp; another, or betwixt one <hi>impeaching,</hi> &amp; another.</p>
                  <p>And yet both the <hi>consisting and impeaching</hi> of the Churches peace, doeth principally depend on the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods commandements: which is all the Repl. affirmed. 3. He distinguisheth betwixt <hi>an offence every way lesse, and in it owne nature lesse,</hi> whenas the question is not, whether the neglect of our Ceremonies, be not onely in it owne nature a lesse offence, but also in all the circumstances of it. The Def. and Rejoynder themselves confesse, that this neglect, in the nature of it, is no offence at all. 4. Because suche answers were termed <hi>Sophisticall</hi> evasions, the Rejoynder twice crieth out of <hi>rayling</hi>: forgetting (without doubt) how often he had abused the same terme against the Repl. and that in the next former section, he had mainteyned the Def. his accusing a plain popular argument, not onely of Sophistrie, but even of <hi>dull Sophistrie.</hi> For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder certainly will not confesse himself <hi>a rayler.</hi> The rest is not worth repeating, that paper should be twice blotted with it.</p>
                  <p>Against the Def. his distinction, betwixt <hi>omission, and contempt,</hi> the Replie was 1. that mere omission hath been punished with suspension. Of which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:245:252"/>
requireth a <hi>continued instance.</hi> To which I answer, that one instance may be given in Ispswiche, where D. B. was Preacher. For most of the Ministers were suspended upon the complaint of one <hi>Web,</hi> who professed, that he would not put on the Surplice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept others did. D. B. may inquire easily if it was not so. As for <hi>continuance,</hi> it maketh not to the purpose, except all malefactors be not onely put in prison, but also continued in the same, above the Iudges pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The Repl. for affirming, that punishments for mere omission, are provided for by Canon, is accused by the Rejoynder of an <hi>untrueth in print.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the Rejoynder cannot be ignorant (beside other examples) that every man not kneeling, is to be denied the Sacrament, and that the Minister administring to suche, is by the Canon, to be suspended.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>was trueth in print,</hi> ever since the Canons were in print: except suspension from the Sacrament, &amp; from the Ministerie be in his account no punishment.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The last thing noted out of the Abridgement is, that non-Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitants are accounted <hi>Scismatikes, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes,</hi> and excommunicates, <hi>ipso facto, without appeal:</hi> which is without example. The Rejoynder here 1. denieth that flatly, without more words, which is plainly cited out of the 6. Canon, let the Canon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be looked upon, and that is enough. 2. He sayth that the ould <hi>anathema sit</hi> was as muche as to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>ipso facto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet King Iames himself, in his answer to Perone, doeth shew, that the olde <hi>anathema sit,</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:245:253"/>
was onely a declaring who ought to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and not an excommunication <hi>de facto.</hi> 3. He sayth for <hi>Appeal,</hi> that none is admitted, from the highest Court, suche as the Convocation is. As if eyther the Convocation were the highest court, or any court at all, for ought that I ever heard of the <hi>Court of Convocation,</hi> as I have of <hi>a Court of Parliament,</hi> or as if so muche libertie were left unto a poor Minister, now standing at the Bishops barre, as to appeal to the next Convocation. The Rejoynder surely did not well consider what he spake.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wheras the Def. granted, that we have reason perhaps to wish, that some poenalties were released, the Rejoynder interpreteth this reason to be suche <hi>as all men that feel the smart of punishment</hi> (for whatsoever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) <hi>may have.</hi> Which is nothing else, but to looke on, with laughter, at all the greivous thinges which any Ministers have suffered, for this cause. And yet every foot the Rejoynder putteth on another person, and (as I am perswaded) hath another heart.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Rejoynder commeth to the slanders of <hi>Puritamisme, and Schisme.</hi> And as for <hi>Puritanisme,</hi> he sayth the Def. <hi>slided by it, as a terme not imposed upon us by him.</hi> As if we may not complaine of, or inferre a consequence, from any terme, except it be imposed upon us by <hi>D. Morton, or D. Burgesse</hi> or at the least, they were not bound to answer for any termes, except suche as they themselves have imposed!</p>
                  <p>For Scisme, and Separation, after some sparkeling wordes of <hi>rash-blasphemous, and firie Sirs,</hi> he telleth us 1.

Now if it would please the Rejoynder eyther to declare what is <hi>Separation,</hi> or what is a <hi>principle,</hi> this question would be easilie decided. In the mean time, I answer. <hi>1.</hi> the first principle is from Moses, if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as we mean it: <hi>thou shalt not adde any thing therto.</hi> 2. The second confounding <hi>mere rites,</hi> with formes of worship, is not ours, but onely by the Rej. his fiction. 3. The third supposeth, that which we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denie, that the calling of our Ministers doeth es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially depende upon the Bishops calling. <hi>4.</hi> The fourth is made scismaticall, by a scismaticall conceyt of the Rej. namely, that every Church is to be utterly condemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so separated from, that hath any thinge in it, by participation idolatrous. His <hi>ever being of this opinion,</hi> may be answered in that fashion which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth the like phraze withall, pag. 216. <hi>He hath not ever been the best Logician.</hi> His profession, of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>(this day, ere he sleep</hi>) if he did beleeve these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is nothing else but a rhethoricall flourish, which he would twice recall, before he would separate from those that bowe to <hi>Altars,</hi> or even those which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an <hi>ubiquitarie bodie,</hi> in the Lords supper, though these are more palpablie idolatrous (in his conscience) then the Ceremonies questioned are in ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:245:254"/>As for the addition, with a <hi>yea,</hi> that <hi>Mr. Bradshaws very arguments are pretended for Separtion so as they cannot be denied with any forehead, etc.</hi> It is not worth a refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: because Mr. Bradshaw himself in a booke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the unreasonablenesse of the Separation)</hi> hath sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed how unreasonably they are pretended, and abused. If the Rejoynder hath any thing to rejoigne therto, I would willingly see with what <hi>fore-head</hi> he can doe it.</p>
                  <p>The other talke of this section, as also the <hi>recounting</hi> of a confutation in the 15. section, I leave to be <hi>counted</hi> as it deserveth, by him that will compare what hath been sayd, with the wordy rejoynder to it, so vainely opposed, and so often repeated.</p>
                  <p>Only (in few wordes) let it be noted 1. how in the 15. section, he slighteth the sentence of D.

How he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth some divine worship onely to be <hi>unholy in the kinde</hi>: as if some singular true divine worship may be <hi>unholy.</hi> 4. What a wilde consequence he buildeth upon: <hi>if the crosse be no part of the Sacrament, then it is no part of worship: because it may not (in the Repl. his opinion) be a part.</hi> 5.

                  <p n="3">3. A second proof was, that Christ is the onely teacher of his Churche, and appointer of all meanes wherby we should be taught and admonished of any holy duty, and all Christs doctrine, with the meanes therof, is perfectly conteyned in the holy Scripture. Here (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>the Def. forgot to tell, how absurd this collection is, Christ is the onely authentique teacher of his Churche etc. therfore they may be no meanes of teaching or admonishing unto duties, but suche as be ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as necessarie.</hi> As if it were sufficient for the Def. or Rejoynder to <hi>tell us</hi> any thing as they please, how litle ever it be to the purpose.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Onely this, by the way, I would learne: how we can acknowlege and receyve any meanes of religious tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with faith, except it appear to be appointed by an <hi>authentique</hi> teacher and lawgiver? And how our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in oppointing meanes of spirituall teaching which Christ appointed not, can be accounted (therin) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall teachers under him as their and our onely authentique teacher?

To passe by those exceptions of the Repl. against the Def. which the Rej. calleth <hi>wranglinges</hi> (though they be defensible enough) The first proof of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is taken from Mar. 7. and Matth. 15. where (as we allege) our Saviour by this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (among others) condemneth the Iewish purifijnges, and justifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his Disciples, in refusing that Ceremonie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (being the praecept of men) it was taught, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as a doctrine, by way of significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teache what inward puritie should be in them, and how they ought to be clensed from heathen pollutions. To this the Rej. (supplying againe that which the Def. had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) answereth, that this reason (among others) of signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is our <hi>fiction.</hi> Now (though these places of Scripture have formerly been handled, in the second chapiter) let any man considerthis observation: wee finde in our Saviours answer, three reasons of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Pharisies: 1. That their washing was praeferred
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:245:257"/>
before the Commandements of God. 2. That it was hypocriticall. 3. That it was a vaine worship, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinne. If any say, it was not vayne, as significant, wee replie, it could be no outward worship, but as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously significant. For washing, without signification had been meer civill. And Marc. 7.4. The Pharisies are reproved, for meer <hi>undertaking to observe</hi> washinges, no mention being made of any other reason, but onely that <hi>observance,</hi> which must needes be understood of all observance, which was not civill, but (by institution &amp; intention) religious.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the second and mayne poynt, the best way is, to set downe D.R. his owne wordes, which are these: <hi>Were it so, that the Popish Vnction had another, eyther worke, or meaning, with the Papists, then with the Iew, as after a sort, it hath, yet might the Ceremonie be Iewish notwithstanding, as sacrifizing of a lambe, to signifie Christ already come. At the least S. Peter did constrayne the Gentiles to Iudaize (Gal. 2.12.) though he, and those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had another meaning, then that wherin that choise of meates was praescribed to the Iews.

                  <p>Thus farr I had in my notes, out of the English editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ther is this more in the booke, as I now finde in the latine copie, not having the English at hand: <hi>your
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:245:259"/>
rites in the very kind are Iewish or as the Iewish were.</hi> Now out of these last words I argue thus:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vestri ritus ipso genere, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daici sunt, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Iudaici ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiterunt.</hi>
                     </note> 1. If all <hi>umbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> rites be Iudaicall, and therfore unlawfull, then all religious <hi>significant</hi> Ceremonies are Iewish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>But D. <hi>R.</hi> sayth the first: therfore he teacheth also the later. 2. Out of the former I conclude thus: if a Iewish rite may be without a Iewish opinion, then our Ceremonies may be Iewish, or Popish, without a Iewish, or Popish opinion, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
                  <p>But the first is affirmed by D. <hi>R.</hi> therfore the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also. Which if it be true, then both the Defend. and Rejoynder have taken a false grounde of their Ceremoniall doctrine, in affirming so confidently upon all occasions, that it is the opinion and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drine onely which maketh a Ceremonie Iewish, Popish, or any way unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>All this notwithstanding, the Rejoynder could not forbeare, to accuse the Authors of the Abridgement, his olde reverend friends, of <hi>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But I could wish, from my heart, that he, and his best friends living, had no more cause to be ashamed of his Rejoinder, then they had of these allegations, which none of the Authors, if they were on earth alive would disavow.</p>

                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:245:260"/>11. In the last place, upon occasion of our disliking all the significant Ceremonies, brought in by the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies,</hi> it pleased the Def. to taxe us for being too like the <hi>Saduces,</hi> in refusing suche Ceremonies. Now of this accusation the Replier onely desired the Def. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, if it did not touche our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, who by his example, and doctrine opposed the same Ceremonies? Heerupon the Rejoynder answereth, that <hi>our Saviour walked a midle path, betwixt the excesse of the Pharisies, and the praecisenes of the Saduces, in Ceremonies, observing many humane significant Ceremonies in religion, as the Feast of Dedication, embaulming at burialls, sitting at burialls, sitting at the Passover, and the Synagogues, with their formalities.</hi> In which answer, the Rejoynder hath shewed, that upon occasion, he dare goe as farr, and say as muche for humane Ceremonies, as any that went before him, if not more, and that with suche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as is not abated with reverence of our Saviour himself, whome this passage doeth concerne. But beside this audaciousnesse, I finde no trueth in these words, For. 1. That which he sayth of the Saduces praecisenesse in flying all human Ceremonies, is not true. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces (sayth Epiphanius lib <hi>1.</hi> c. 14.) <hi>omnia aequabiliter cum Samaritis observant. i. e. they observe all that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans observe:</hi> and who can doubt but the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ceremonies proper to the Samaritans, were all inventions of men, with the Divels helpe. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces also were sometime high Preistes at Ierusalem, as for example, Annas is noted by Iosephus (l. 20. c. 15.) and by like historians, to have been a Saducen. Now it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:245:260"/>
is not credible, that any high Preist in those times, did absteyne from all humane Ceremonies, used com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by all the Iews Mar. 7.<hi>3.</hi> At the least the high Preist did observe the feast of Dedication, sitting at the Passover, and suche like (in the Rejoynder his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) humane Ceremonies. 2. The Saduces were prophane beastes, not hoping for Heaven, nor fearing Hell, and so were allways ready to observe any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that made for their temporall advantage, of what kinde soever they were. 3. It appeareth out of the premisses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our blessed Saviour (in favour of our paltrie base Ceremonies) is wronged in his holy name, as if he had been more observant of humane misticall constitutions in religion, then many of the worst Iews, whome yet he reproved for following traditions of men. <hi>4.</hi> Because the Rejoynder speaketh of <hi>a midle path, betwixt the excesse of the Pharisies, and precisenesse of the Saduces, observed by our Saviour,</hi> it would be knowen, whether that <hi>midle</hi> were <hi>medium participationis, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium abnegationis?</hi> i. e. Whether it was only a third way partaking of neyther extreme? or had in it part of the Pharisies excesse, and part of the Saduces precisenesse? The former sense we may (upon the Rejoynder his supposition acknowlege: and that maketh nothing to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>If the later meaning be the Rejoynders, then he must shew us, how farr our Saviour did agree in practise with the Pharisies? And to clear that, he must prove that the Pharisies had lawfull authoritte, for appointing or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting mysticall Ceremonies, and whiche of them
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:245:261"/>
were allowed by our Saviour? <hi>5.</hi> The examples here given, pertaine nothing to the question. The <hi>feaste of Dedication</hi> commeth after to be handled. <hi>Embalming</hi> at burials, was no significant religious Ceremonie, but a civill rite common to the Israelites with the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and other Heathens. If it were, yet being from the time of the Patriarches, how will the Rejoynder prove that it was instituted without Divine direction? <hi>Sitting at the Passover</hi> can neyther be proved to be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, nor yet instituted by man. <hi>Synagoges</hi> were no more significant Ceremonies, then was the schoole of Tyrannus, Act. 19.9. The opening, closing, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Booke, Luc. 14.17.20. was no more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall a Ceremonie, then the opening of a mans mouth, when he speaketh, and the shutting of it againe, when he hath no more to say. Are not these worthy groundes, for to conclude upon, that our Saviour was an observer of humane religious mysticall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?</p>

And this was that, for whiche Augustines testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie was onely brough in for, viz: to shew that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious significant Ceremonies participate part of the Sacraments nature. To this (after some wordes of course) it is rejoined, that <hi>the name Sacrament impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly given to other thinges, doeth not prove them to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the propertie and nature of Sacraments, no more then the Swanne in Houlborne, or the Idols of the Gentiles, doe partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the nature of a Swanne, and God: suche denominations not being reall, and proper, but logicall, or relative. And if it were so, then the taking away of that name from our Ceremonies, doeth discharge them from partaking the nature of Sacraments.</hi> To whiche I have this to say 1. that our Argument is not taken from the meer name: for we know that some names are common to thinges quite differing in nature, so falling (as they say) by <hi>chaunce,</hi> But this communitie of the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> was not so: it was communicated to Mysticall Ceremonies upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certeine <hi>counsell and reason.</hi> And that reason was not meer similitude outward, suche as is betwixt the picture of a Swanne and a living Swanne: Because ther is no suche outward likenesse betwixt the Crosse, and any proper Sacrament: but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some proportion of inward nature, eyther in mens esteeme, as an Idols was called God, or in deed wholly so farre as mans institution can effect, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Popish five Sacramentes are so called, or else in part, as this kinde of significant Ceremonies, which are in quaestion.

It is but a picture of a reason, whiche the Rejoynder maketh, from giving of the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it away. For no man will say, that a name taken from the nature of a thing doeth argue more the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, then the taking away the name alone, doeth argue the taking away of the nature.

meanes enough to doe that; and that no meanes may be used to that ende, but suche as he hath ordeyned.</hi> This certayne was to the Rejoynder as it were a <hi>noli me tangere:</hi> that <hi>no meanes must be used to stirre up devotion, and to put men in remembrance of good thinges, but onely those which God hath ordeyned.</hi> He was therfore contented to passe it over without medling with it.

                  <p n="2">2. In the first place, therfore, we exspect his answer to that which is founde in the Harmonie of Protestant Confessions, generally approved, by Reformed Churches. About which he is very brief, as his cause required. <hi>The Divines of Witenburge</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and those of France, and the Lowe Contries: viz. that they speake onely of those significant Ceremonies, which serve to shadow out the Mysteries of the Gospell, or to supplie the office of true Sacramentes.</hi> Now (for the present) we will not stand muche upon those phrases, <hi>shadowes of the Mysteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:245:266"/>
that Massing attire, which (they say) doeth shadow out the wholle passion of Christ, and many other thinges of that kinde etc.</hi> The other wordes are these: <hi>No Mysticull rites (that is, which cary some mysterie, or signification, in them) though not otherwise impious (as namely suche as should be partes of Gods doctrine, or kindes of Sacraments) but onely suche lawes as pertayne to order and decencie are lawfull.</hi> Let any man that undetstandeth English, and reason, judge, if these wordes ought, or can be interpreted, onely of (I knowe not what) <hi>mysteries of the Gospell, or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies supplying the office of true Sacramentes,</hi> further then our Argument doeth importe. If not, then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder granting the premisses, denieth the conclusion as he did before.</p>
                  <p>The Confession condemneth <hi>banners</hi> by name <hi>and Crosses, signifying the victorie of Christ through his Crosse</hi>: Our men defende the signe of the Crosse, signifying that Christians shall not be ashamed, to fight manfully against Satan under Christs <hi>Banner.</hi> The Divines of France and the Lowe Contries, (with the Confession) reject all Ceremonies, that cary some <hi>mysterie or signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in them: Our question is, whether humane Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of <hi>mysticall signification,</hi> be lawfull?

                  <p>The Rejoynder therfore guesseth, that the wordes upon v. 2. or rather 1. were intended, where Mr. P. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the setting up of Images, to be <hi>lay-mens bookes.</hi> To which he answereth. 1. <hi>That he also doeth blame the same. 2. that Mr. P. in some persons and places, preferreth dipping, before sprinkling, in Baptisme.</hi> Now for the first of these, if the Rejoynder when he writ these wordes condemne (with Mr. P.) suche images or pictures as are lay-mens bookes, it is wonder, he forgot, or changed this judgement, before he came to the seventh section of this very Chapter, where he doeth defende them. And this is plaine, that if images be to be condemned, as they are lay mens bookes, or teachers, then all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane signes, ordeyned to be lay-mens teachers, in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are also to be eondemned with them.</p>

                  <p>But yet (howsoever the Rejoynder upon conscience of the consanguinitie, betwixt Images, and significant Ceremonies did suppose this first verse of the Chapter to be meant by the Authors of the Abr.)

In the other places, he speaketh from good groundes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie: but this reason of his, hath no more force in it, then if from the picture and apparation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it should be gathered, that no Minister should wear a black <hi>night-cap,</hi> a black <hi>tippet,</hi> or a blacke <hi>hood,</hi> which our Canons doe commande: or that every Minister should have sixe winges fastened to his body, with certain, vizard faces, like unto the faces of Lions, Eagles, and open, because Angels have so appeared, Isa. 6.

                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:245:269"/>It is answered 2. that <hi>we should beleive the sayd D.

                  <p>The 3, answer is, that <hi>D.

Finally this consequence is denied: <hi>D.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Rejoynder hath tried what he could say to those testimonies, which the Def. had omitted, in this place: and doeth so please himself therin, that he beginneth a <hi>plaudite</hi> to himself, saying that <hi>he hath openly whipped the Repliers friends</hi>: he meaneth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Abr. who were wonte to be his reverend friends also. But this whipping of his, is just as if a man should whippe thornes, and prickes, with his bare handes, getting more gashes therby, then he dealeth or giveth blowes.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:245:271"/>
our Def. and Rejoynder his tenet. For the releiving of that weak shift, the Rejoynder (in the second place) affirmeth, that Zepper (cap. 16.) doeth <hi>allow of dipping, and thrice dipping, in Baptisme, as an humane Ceremonie stated in Gods worship to signifie the Trinitie, and our Lords resurrection on the third day.</hi> Now in the 16. chapter, ther is no one word of these matters (which kinde of misciting or misprinting the Rejoynder useth to make a great matter of in others) but in the <hi>12.</hi> chapter, I finde suche a fonde allegorie of thrice-dipping meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of Augustine, but no allowance of the same. Nay, if the matter be well considered, I thinke the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder himself will scarce allow of it. For <hi>1.</hi> ther can be no better reason given for placing of a mysterie in thrice dipping for Baptisme, then in dividing of the bread to be receyved in the Supper, into three partes, as the Papists doe for a mysterie, among other of their massing toys. 2. This thrice-dipping for mysterie, is so mingled with the true Mysterie of Baptisme, that (to all appearance) it is made a part of that Holy Sacrament 3. For man to institute an outward representation (as an Image) of the Holy Trinitie, is a very great praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against the second Commandement. Christ himself never appointed any suche mysticall reall signe neyther can that incomprehensible mysterie be fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by any suche triplicitie as is of mans making. 4. To invocate the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost over the baptized, and then by thrice redipping, or sprinkling, upon mans pleasure, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie they are three Persons, is as if one should light a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:245:271"/>
candle, for the manifesting of something, and then put a bushel over it, for signifying of the same thinge. 5. How can the same <hi>three</hi> at one and the same time, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie three Persons, &amp; three days? Can men give mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold disparate senses to one and the same Ceremonies, as <hi>literall, allegoricall, tropologicall,</hi> and <hi>anagogicall?</hi> 5. Why may not as well three Crosses be made upon the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; for the same mysteries? 6. It could not be of any moment, for those auncient Byshops, sometime to dip <hi>thrice,</hi> for signifying of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and some time <hi>once,</hi> for signifying of the <hi>Vnitie.</hi> Seing Trinitie and Vnitie are not to be separated in the solemne signification of them, and Heretikes are not confuted with humane signes.</p>

Significative ceremonies of Spirituall things so oft they greivously offended. Withall I thinke that all symbolical rites should be once profligited out of the church whereinto by no right they could ever enter nor as long as they remaine can the Church have her native bewty restored.</hi> Here is no mention at all of <hi>graces,</hi> but only of spirituall <hi>thinges:</hi> and yet the Rejoynder would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his reader, that he <hi>sayth not spirituall duties, but graces.</hi> His glosse is naught. Spirituall <hi>thinges</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend so well spirituall <hi>duties,</hi> as <hi>graces.</hi> How this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will be excused, I cannot guesse: except perhaps it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:245:272"/>
be answered, that humane Ceremonies doe signifie duties as they are <hi>carnall,</hi> and not as they are spirituall. It is further to be marked, that Beza there speaketh of of suche humane significant Ceremonies, as were in common use amonge the ancient Fathers. Now the Rejoynder will not say that they had in common use, so many humane Sacraments, as Beza noteth them to have had significant Ceremonies. 2. The second reason, by which the Rejoynd. would prove that Beza meant not simplie to condemne all significant Ceremonies, is, because <hi>he alloweth some Feast-days, confesseth the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice and kneeling to be in their nature indifferent, and sayth that the Crosse might sometime of olde have had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full use.</hi> For the former of which, if the wordes of Beza, had been noted, more might be sayd. In the meane time, let this suffize: If Beza did allow of some humane Feast-days, it may better from this place be gathered, that he did not account them significant of spirituall thinges, then it can from them be gathered, that in this place he did not condemne all suche signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficants of mans making. Neyther doeth he affirme a significant Surplice to be indifferent. And as for knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that is more excepted against for other causes, then for instituted signification.</p>
                  <p>But in the last, ther is odde dealing. For wheras Beza sayth of the Crosse, <hi>ut olim aliquis fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:245:273"/>It is enough for any man, to read over Beza his eyght and twelf Epistle, for understanding not onely of his meaning, but also of his reasons.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Because the Def. made Beza a <hi>singular</hi> man, in opposing all humane mysticall Ceremonies, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier added out of Bellarmines observation (de effectu Sacram. l. 2. c. 30.) that at least Calvin, Barentius, and Chemnitius were of the same minde.

                  <p>The question (sayth he) in that place of Bellarmine disputed, is of Ceremonies <hi>meritorious, and binding the conscience, out of the case of scandall.</hi> And is this all?

the <hi>Negative</hi> part, Bellarmine nameth <hi>Calvin, Brentius, and Chemnitius.</hi> Now the Rejoynder to darken all, confoundeth the third, &amp; fift question into one hoche-poche.

Of Calvin, enough hath been sayd before as also of Brentius, under the title of <hi>Witenberge Confession,</hi> Chemnitius onely (being altogether passed over by the Rejoinder though he was not onely propounded by the Replier, out of Bellarmine but also in the Abridgement, pag. 32,) is here to be represented, in his owne wordes. Yet concerning Bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius first, a few wordes may be needfull. The words of Wittenburge Confession (before cited) are plaine. <hi>It is not lawfull, to devize new Ceremonies, to shadow forth the trueth already layd open, and brought to light by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: as in the day light to set up Candles, to signifie the light of the Gospel, or to carry banners &amp; crosses, to signifie the victorie of Christ, thorough his Crosse. Of which sort is all the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing attire.</hi> Of this Confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Brentius was the penman: and therefore Bellarm. citeth the same as Brentius his sentence about Ceremonies. The Rejoynder answereth 1. <hi>that Bellarm. sayth onely that Brentius reproveth the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of water, oyle. &amp;c. consecrated to signifie and worke supernaturall effects: because the mysteries of faith should not now be shadowed out.</hi> De cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 7.

                  <p>Ther was some cause, why the Rejoynder did not care to insist on these wordes.

                  <p n="15">15. The Replier added unto the witnesses afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd, <hi>Iunius &amp; Daneus.</hi> But concerning Daneus, we have already considered what the Rej. had to except. <hi>Iunius</hi> onely remayneth: whose wordes were quoted out of his animadversions upon <hi>Bell. de cultu Sanctorum, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>an.</hi> 12.

His rejoinder therfore is to be considered in all the parts of it. 1. First, he concludeth that <hi>the Repl. is no wise man, in not telling them, to what objection, or assertion Iunius doeth there answer: because (forsooth) the Repl. himself had sayd, it was no wisdome for any man, to take up an answer made to an objection, before he considereth the assertion against which the objection is made.</hi> As if it were all one to <hi>consider</hi> the assertion, and to <hi>tell them</hi> what it is. Is not this a fine consequence? 2. He attributeth unto the Repl. a Sophisticall <hi>wit,</hi> in concealing, that the assertion of Bell. by Iunius opposed, was, that <hi>the Churche may of her power, consecrate creatures, to signifie, and worke supernaturall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, &amp;c.</hi> But from hence nothing can be gathered, for the advantage of the Def. and Rej. except it appear, that Iunius did onely speake of the <hi>working,</hi> and not distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>signifiyng,</hi> which Bell. would have given unto those Ceremonies: whiche how false it is, shall praesent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Iunius his wordes are: <hi>Homo non potest creaturas ad significationem adhibere.</hi> The Translation is: <hi>Humane Ceremonies cannot be lawfully used for signification.</hi> Where is that great falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which drew from the Rej. <hi>Are you not ashamed? or can you not blush?</hi> The Rej. his owne translation of the same wordes, is: <hi>No man-can lawfully applie thinges to signification.</hi> He must discover the mysticall difference betwixt <hi>using</hi> for <hi>signification,</hi> &amp; <hi>applying</hi> to <hi>signification,</hi> before he can cast suche shame upon the Repl. &amp; none upon the Rej. 4. <hi>To shew Iunius in his owne posture, and the mis-reporting Repl. in his owne colours.</hi> The Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der translateth that wholle passages of Iunius, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon it, first, that Iunius speaketh of <hi>consecrating</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.

                  <p>The Def. first answereth, by a distinction, betwixt the <hi>signification of grace conferred,</hi> and the <hi>signification of mans dutie,</hi> the former wherof he maketh <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> but not the later. To the which was replied, that Sacr. also doe signifie the dutie of man towards God. This (sayth the Rej.) <hi>is not true</hi>: bec. Sacr. doe onely <hi>implie</hi> that dutie.

The Rejoynder not trusting to that deniall, sayth further, that if the Sacraments did signifie mans dutie, yet that is not <hi>a cheif part of their nature.</hi> To which I may replie, that if it were not a cheif part of their nature, but a part onely, yet it is presumption for men to take any part of the Sacraments, and set it upon other thinges, at their owne pleasure.

Whither shall we come, at length, by walking in this Ceremoniall way?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The second Argument, to the same purpose, by the Repl. alleged, was, that the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as it si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth an oath, or obligation, doeth import, that the Sacraments signifie our dutie to God. To this the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder answereth, that the Sacraments doe in deed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, but not <hi>represent</hi> any morall dutie. Now let any reasonable man judge, whether dipping under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and rising up againe, or taking of food for strength, and growth, doeth not more <hi>represent</hi> spirituall duties, then making a Crosse with ones finger, in the ayer?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The third reason mentioned, was taken from the name <hi>Eucharist,</hi> notifiing thankfulnesse, and the taking of the same, <hi>in remembrance of Christ.</hi> The Rejoynder his answer is, that <hi>the word Eucharist is no Sacrament, but a terme brought in by men to put them in minde of their dutie in receyving it.</hi> But that word doeth notifie the nature of the Sacrament, at least in the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al Divines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat have in this meaning used the terme, though it be not a Sacrament. And they are more then that the Rej. his judgement can counter-ballance. Yet if significant Ceremonies be like unto wordes and characters, as the Rejoynder formerly maintayned, that very word must
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:245:278"/>
needes be a Sacrament, or a significant signe of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: because it was brought in <hi>to put men in minde of their dutie in receyving,</hi> as the Rej. speaketh. He addeth 2. that ther is no element, nor action of that Sacrament, so particularly repraesenting thankfulnesse, as <hi>kneeling doth reverence, or humilitie,</hi> Where first, he maketh <hi>kneeling</hi> a significant Ceremonie, whiche hitherto he hath seemed to denie. 2. I answer, that the very action of receyving so great a gift, in a cheerfull humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, doeth repraesent both thankfulnesse, and humilitie, so far as Christ would have it repraesented by signes. The very celebration of a great benefit receyved, is a signe of thankfulnesse.

                  <p>This the Rejoynder confuteth first, with skorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wordes, as <hi>a sickly childish, and long some objection.</hi> After, he answereth, that <hi>our monitorie Ceremonies, are onely externall occasions, and objects, wherby the minde of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:245:279"/>
man worketh upon it self, not causes working by some vertue in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where 1. observe, how he mangleth and marreth the Argument, that he may maister it: the wordes are, that suche effects require vertue <hi>inhaerent, or assistant</hi>: he interpreteth them onely of <hi>vertue in them, i. e. inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> leaving out <hi>assistant</hi>: and yet dareth affirme, that <hi>upon this fiction of vertue in them</hi> (which is his owne fiction) <hi>the wholle objection is builded.</hi> 2. He maketh our Ceremonies to be onely <hi>occasionall objects, and no causes</hi>: wheras every instituted signe is a <hi>meanes,</hi> and so a <hi>cause</hi> of that effect for which it is appointed, as Logick teacheth. And if they were mere occasions of concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that which they signifie, then a white Surplice would not prove half so significant a Ceremonie of Ministers sanctitie, as a <hi>white Cocke,</hi> especially when it croweth, nor an aeriall Crosse, so significant, as a <hi>Gallowes.</hi> Beside, if our Ceremonies be occasionall objects onely, then no man is tied to regard the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Ministers Surplice, therby to thinke of his sanctitie, any more then he is bounde to regard the fowlnesse and soile of it, when for a longe time, it is unwashed, and he also useth it in stead of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchif, about his nose, therby to thinke of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, spots, and blots, which are founde in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters disposition, and conversation. Concerning, <hi>Letters, Characters, and Giblets,</hi> mentioned here againe by the Rejoynder, answer was made before, in the first section of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:245:280"/>8. To like purpose, the Repl. used this reason: <hi>If humane inventions be suche morall admonishers, in spirituall duties, then our consciences are bound to subject themselves to their admonitions, and so to those mortall men, who made them admonishers.</hi> The Rejoynder his answer is like his former: <hi>humane significant Ceremonies have no vertue of teaching the understanding, or exciting the devotions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but only externall objects tending by their signification to those uses, to the use of which, the consciences of men are not bounde simplie but onely collaterally, and for another thinge.</hi> In which answer, 1. ther is a strange mysterie confessed: that humane Ceremonies are appointed to doe that, whiche they have neyther antecedently, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, any vertue to doe. 2. <hi>Externall objects</hi> are made opposite unto <hi>admonishers with vertue to admonish</hi>: as if no externall objects (as Baptisme administred to a childe, before mine eyes) had any vertue of admonishing 3. As strange a distinction is made betwixt <hi>simply,</hi> and <hi>collaterally,</hi> and betwixt <hi>simplie,</hi> and <hi>for another thinge:</hi> which are suche sustian stuffe, that ther is no fear, they should satisfie any but suche as take termes without reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or right reason.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Another reason of the Repliers, was, that every teaching signe, of publicke use in the Churche, ought often to be interpreted, in preaching, and also defended if they be called in question, in the same preachinges, which kinde of preaching, upon Crosse and Surplice, were very absurd, especially in those Parishes, that scarce have Quarter-Sermons. The Rejoynder answereth 1. that <hi>the Crosse having interpretation with it, need not be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:245:280"/>
interpreted: and that the Surplice signifieth, he doeth not well know what, but suche a thinge as may be soon taught.</hi> Now that which he sayth of Crosse, he may as well say of the Sacraments, that because in their administration, they have the interpretation goeing along with them, therfore no Minister need muche preache of them. But indeed, ther is speciall need, that the very inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which goeth alonge with the use of the Crosse, should be well interpreted: because few or none, eyther of the people, or of the Crossers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves doe understand, how it hath that signification which the Convocation hath layd upon it, any more, then any other toy, which may easily be devized by the same Convocation: as if they should put a straw into the childes hand, in stead of a spear, to signifie, that he should manfully fight, against all enimies of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And of the Surplices signification, seing the Rejoynder himself is not yet certainly informed, what it is, ther must needs be great use of muche preaching about it, first to declare certainly (if it may be founde) what it signifieth, secondly to shew the ground of that signification, or authoritie from whence it commeth, lawfull, and thirdly to urge it upon the consciences of those that are to make use of that signification. His second answer is a bundle of phrases: and so let it passe. Onely let it be noted. 1. that he calleth it <hi>furie,</hi> to charge our Ceremonies of <hi>superstition</hi> and yet in sobrietie, mainteyned before, that those which count them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, are <hi>superstitious brethren. 2.</hi> that he determineth absolutely, upon his refuted groundes, that <hi>we have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:245:281"/>
our own mouths, from preaching the Gospell, by calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations.</hi> Wheras all England knoweth, that those which never preached, or writ against the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, have their mouthes stopped by his Prelates, though they onely professe, they cannot use them, by reason of scandall, of which number, Doctor Burges himself hath been one. 3. He would perswade the world, that <hi>some of us place all religion in opposing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies by speaking and writing</hi>: which is greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie, then any he charged us with, or then he can prove of any one. 4. He affirmeth us to be of all men he ever knew, the most <hi>impatient of opposition, and so most partiall, and Pharisaically proude</hi> as if his Prelates were very patient toward those that oppose their Ceremonies, no way so partiall, nor drew any thinge from the Pharisies, or as if himself in this Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had not shewed more of these vertues, then any other. 5. He sheweth where the store lieth: in <hi>rooting of them out of the hearts of their people, by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and calumnies.</hi> We cannot then defend our practise, but with clamours and calumnies, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for our hearts, without rooting them out of peoples hearts.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For the further manifestinge of the uselesse signification of our significant Ceremonies, the Repl. appealed to the consciences of the best conforminge Christiansin England, whether ever they founde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves truly stirred up to holynesse, by the Surplice, or to constancie in fayth, by the Crosse? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:245:281"/>
answereth, that <hi>no man is stirred up by them, as by causes, but onely as by the sight of the creatures, or other memorialls: of which use if men deprive themselves, it is their prejudice or negligence.</hi> Now of <hi>causes</hi> ther was no mention in the <hi>quaere.</hi> And the question being made of the <hi>best conforming</hi> Christians (amonge whome the Rejoynder himself is one) <hi>prejudice, and negligencie</hi> of some, make up no answer. The trueth is, that he himself could not say, out of his conscience, that ever he felt suche motions within him, by occasion of a Surplice, or Crosse, and therfore baulked the question. Yet this is here to be observed: that by the Rejoynder his confession, our sacred Ceremonies are no more admonishers unto spirituall duties, then any creature of God, i. e. then any <hi>butterflie</hi> is. And are not then our Ceremonies very <hi>sacred, or religious.</hi> Or is our representative Churches institution, of any more force, or worth, then any childes, that catcheth butter-flies?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It was added also which by experience, it is founde) that in some one Congregation, where these Ceremonies have not been used, more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and constancie of faith hath appeared, then in many Cathedral Churches, where they were never omitted. The Rejoynder his answer is, that <hi>where other helpes stand equall, ther is no difference, save onely in a Pharisticall opinion of those, who counte their very opposition of Ceremonies an high poynt of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and stiffenesse therin, constancie in the fayth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:245:282"/>Behold the man, that even now complayned of <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and calumnies.</hi> The reasonable part of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that in Cathedrall Churches, <hi>other helpes</hi> (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent preaching, catechizing, admonishing, directing in Christian duties) are not <hi>aequall</hi> or answerable to that which is founde in divers Congregations where the Ceremonies have not been used: otherwise ther were no difference. Now heerin, 1. he confuteth himself, in confessing that his Prelates, even those whose <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wisdome</hi> he extolleth, though they have power enough, doe not provide the cheif helpes of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for their Churches, <hi>aequall</hi> to those that are founde in poore Congregations, which receyve not their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall helpes, and yet will not suffer those poore Congregations to enjoy their helpes. For doe they not by this, place a high poynt of devotion in their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall helpes? 2. How can this stand with reason: <hi>where other helpes are aequall, ther is no difference?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if our Ceremonies be helpes to Edification (as the Def. and Rejoynder mainteine) then where other helpes are aequall, the Cathedrall Churches have a great advantage in helpes, above other, that want those Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Nay one Cathedrall Churche exceedeth another in this kinde: as <hi>Durrham,</hi> for Ceremonies, doeth <hi>Chester,</hi> and <hi>Lichefeild.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Because the Def. (to make way for an injurious accusation) changed the phraze used in the Abrigeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>a cheif part</hi> of the Sacraments nature, into another more obnoxious unto exception, <hi>the cheif part,</hi> the Repl. justly noted this, as no plaine dealing. The Rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:245:282"/>
(being loath to leave any of the Def. his words un-mainteyned) answereth, that the <hi>Sacraments have but two parts, signification, and obsignation:</hi> and therfore if signification be <hi>a principall part,</hi> it is also <hi>the principall part</hi>: so that the Defend (sayth he) dealt heerin <hi>fairely,</hi> and <hi>pressed us with suche wordes as our Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>1.</hi> whoe authorized the Defend. to change the termes of our Argument, and then presse us with his changelinges? Let him reserve suche <hi>faire dealing</hi> for other occasions, when it may passe with lesse notice taken of it. 2. What doeth the Rejoynder mean, to imitate the Defend. in attributing unto us, that we make mere <hi>signification,</hi> without any qualification or limitation, eyther <hi>the</hi> or <hi>a cheif part</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Abrigement sayth onely, that suche signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as is ordeyned mystically <hi>to teache and admonish us of spirituall duties,</hi> is a cheif part of the Sacrament. 3. <hi>Mr. Hooker,</hi> (lib. 5. pag. 3.10.) sayth that ther are <hi>great store of properties</hi> belonging to the Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that they are <hi>boundes of our obedience, obligations to mutuall charitie, provokation to godlinesse, preservations from sinne, memorialls of great benefites, markes of distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from strangers etc.</hi> How then can the Rejoynder so resolutely determine of <hi>two onely</hi> offices, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to them? 4. If all essentiall parts of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be reduced to these two, yet the lesser of these may be called a <hi>principall part,</hi> without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the other, in respect of those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which make <hi>accidentall, circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall, &amp; improper</hi> parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

and so of his Sacraments, as the Def. and Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon every occasion doe shift off Arguments with those termes. The rest of this section (beside wordes of no weight) conteyneth nothing which hath not been in the former passages, sufficiently cleared.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IN the Abrigement, after the former reason, now mainteyned, this was brought in: that <hi>In the time of the Lawe (when God saw it good to teache his Churche by significant Ceremonies) none might be brought into, or receyved in the worship of God, but suche onely as the Lord himself did institute.</hi> Ergo. And after that, this: <hi>It is muche lesse lawfull, for man to bringe significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies into Gods worship now, then it was under the Law. For God hath abrogated his owne (not onely suche as prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured Christ, but suche also, as served by their signification, to teache morall duties) so as now (without great sinne) none of them can be continued in the Churche, no not for signification.</hi> Vpon which last grounde, they inferre thus: <hi>If those Ceremonies which God himself ordeyned to teache his Churche by their signification, may not now be used, much lesse may those which man hath devized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>wisdome</hi> of the Def. was, to passe over the former groundes, and onely to insist upon this last inference derived from them. But let us see what he,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:245:283"/>
and the Rejoynder have to say of that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. About this inference, many testimonies of great Divines, were alleged in the Abrigement: all which the Def. passeth by, as not worthy answer: for whiche, he was challenged by the Replier. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder answereth 1. that this is <hi>wranglinge, spoken not out of conscience, but out of a spirit of contradiction, etc.</hi> To which I answer <hi>nothing.</hi> But that which the Def. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the Rejoynder taketh to supplie, <hi>least we should bragge,</hi> as it pleaseth him to phrasifie. See therfore how he dischargeth that which he undertaketh. 1. <hi>The Nicen counsel (sayth he) is twice falsified: first; that it is supposed to condemne significant Ceremonies, by man devized, upon this reason, that God had abolished his owne, and secondly, that the Councel is affirmed to condemne suche Ceremonies at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seemeth the Rejoynder hath more skill (about this cause) in multiplying <hi>falsities,</hi> then in dividing of them from trueths. For the Nicen Councell was brought in as speaking for one proposition: and the Rejoynder maketh two false assertions of that one sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple axiome. Beside the words of that Councel, or Constantine, speaking for it, are (in the Abrigement) onely brought in as testifying this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>the olde Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law, being abrogated by God, cannot (without sinne) be now continued in the Churche for signification.</hi> In stead of this, the Rejoynder faineth two other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and then fayth, that they are two falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: which if they be, let him (who is the coiner of them) see how he can excuse them. The wordes of Constantine are: <hi>It seemed unworthy to celebrate the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:245:284"/>
Passover with imitation of the Iewish custome. Let no (suche) thinge be commune to Christians, with the Iewes. We have receyved another way from our Saviour, a more lawfull and convenient of our holy Religion.</hi> This is pat to the purpose, for which it was alleged.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The testimonie of all the rest</hi> (sayth the Rej.) <hi>are perverted.</hi> 3. <hi>Sundrie of the witnesses are knowen to have allowed</hi> our, <hi>and all,</hi> some <hi>significant Ceremonies. It is a shame therfore for men gloring of synceritie, in refusing the Ceremonies, thus to leave all synceritie, in alleging of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. In which never any protestant writers abused the world so muche, as the Abrigement, and this cavilling Repl.</hi> Now 1. for the <hi>perverting</hi> of all testimonies, it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely, but not proved. Onely some generall <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> are brought in, to support the accusation, all which have formerly been confuted. 2. Among those which he sayth were <hi>knowen to allow</hi> of our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, he nameth <hi>D. Humphry,</hi> of whome <hi>Cambden</hi> in his historie of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> observeth, that he (though very learned and worthy) never was raised to Ecclesiasticall preferments, because he allowed not our Ceremonies etc. <hi>Harding</hi> also objecteth him by name, with Mr. <hi>Samson,</hi> as one that had rather loose all, then use our Ceremonies, and Iuel (Apol. c. 5. div. 1.) doeth not denie, but defend it: besides how well he allowed of our Ceremonies, let all men judge by a certeine letter of his heere printed, written to the Bishops, the Copie bearing this inscription.</p>

It is no <hi>abusing of the world,</hi> to allege generall sentences of men condemning that which they seeme to allow in their practise. If it were, I can name one protestant writer, who hath more abused the world, in this kinde, then any, or all of us: and that is no other, then our <hi>Def. D. Morton.</hi> For he hath written many bookes of good use, against the Papists, the cheif grace wherof is, that (having a good Librarie, and using it with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and discretion) he hath alleged many thousands of their owne testimonies, for the disproving of those errors and superstitions, which the same Authors, in

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:245:286"/>
other places, or at least in their practise, doe apparently eyther allow, or admitte of. This is the wordy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which the Rejoynder giveth unto the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alleged in the Abr. (pag. 33.34.) for to praevent our <hi>bragging</hi>: now let us trie if the Argument naked of testimonies, will not stand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Argument is this: If those Ceremonies which God himself ordeyned, to teache his Churche, by their signification, may not be used, muche lesse may those which man hath devized, The Def. his first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that <hi>the use of some Iewish rite, without any Iewish opinion, as Circumcision, and Easter.</hi> In which answer nothing is found, that toucheth any terme of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Yet upon the occasion of it, the Def. was asked how a Iewish Rite, can be used, without some part of a Iewish opinion?</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynd. answereth, <hi>materially, but not formally, and in use,</hi> But he should have remembred that the Argument is of <hi>significant rites using,</hi> and the Def. his answer is of <hi>Iewish significant rites using</hi>: so that in his grant, ther must needes be granted some <hi>formall use for signification.</hi> Beside, in all using of humane mysticall rites, upon due consideration, ther is some part of a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish opinion. I prove it thus: <hi>All they that consideratly use carnall, beggerly rudiments, in Gods service, have this opinion, that suche rites as the Iewish (set praefiguration aside which no Christian ever admitted) are good in the Christian Churche. But all that so use humane mysticall rites, use car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, beggerly rudiments, in Gods service. Ergo.</hi> The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I prove thus: <hi>All that use mysticall rites, wherto there
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:245:287"/>
is no Spirit annexed by God, as unto the Euangelicall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the new Testament, use carnall beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Gods service. But they whiche use humane mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rites, use mysticall rites, wherto there is no Spirit annexed by God. Ergo.</hi> The Proposition cannot be denied, untill a better definition of suche rites be given: nor the assumption, except an Euangelicall promise can be shewed of Spiritual blessing upon the use of humane mysticall rites.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Concerning Circumcision.</head>
                     <p n="4">4. Because the Def. for an example of a Iewish rite, lawfull for Christians to use, named <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the Repl. concluded, that belike, he houldeth Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as it is used under <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> to be lawfull.</p>
                     <p>The Rej. therfore resolveth us, that <hi>He doth so</hi>: and also chalengeth the Repl. for <hi>saying nothing to disprove him.</hi> Vpon this provocation, it is necessarie to say some-thing against these patrones of Circumcision. Where it is to be marked, that the quaestion is of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Ceremonies devized by man for signification of morall duties; whether it be lawfull, for a Churche repraesentative, (suche as our Convocation) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and urge Circumcision, in this kinde, and to this purpose, upon those Christians whoe are under their power?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now of this quaestion in the formal state of it, I finde not, that scarce any doubt was amonge under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Christians, before this Def. and Rej. being
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:245:287"/>
urged therto by direct consequence from their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have now found it necessarie, to mainteyne the affirmative part, for defence of our beggerly Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                     <p>Ther was some difference betwixt <hi>Hierome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> about observing of legall Rites, &amp; in speciall about Circumcision (as appeareth out of the Epistles which passed betwixt them, yet exstant) but both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agreed on this, that as well to Iew, as Gentile, all religious use of Circumcision, for Ceremonie, &amp;c. is now after due publication of the Gospel, unlawfull or <hi>deadly.</hi> All that have written since, agree about the same trueth, except <hi>Caietan</hi> in one place; who is forsaken &amp; opposed therin by all Papists, the Iesuites themselves not excepted. Our Divines are so confident of this, that from the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of Circumcision, they usually dispute against other humane Ceremonies: and the Iesuits in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, are forced to flie unto this (which must be our Def. and Rej. their answer) that the Ceremonies of the olde Testament, are not absolutely abrogated, but onely in regard of their <hi>speciall manner, end, &amp; intention. Greg. Valent. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 7. <hi>quaest.</hi> 7. <hi>punct.</hi> 7. <hi>Bellar. de effect. Sacr. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 32. whiche answer is called by D. Fulke (ag. Saund. of images, pag. 672.) a beastly doctrine.</p>
                     <p>But because it were an infinite and needlesse labor, to allege the testimonies whiche may be easily alleged, against Ceremoniall Circumcision, amonge Christians, as unlawfull, I will passe on to reasons against it; that the Rej. may no more say, <hi>You say nothing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:245:288"/>6. First, The onely place, in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> by which all Divines (as the Rejoynder speaketh, pag. 75.) prove a power in the Churche to constitute Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is 1. Cor. 14.26.40. <hi>Edification, decencie, order.</hi> But the Apostle, in that chapter, doeth no way give leave eyther unto our, or any other Churche to constitute <hi>Circumcision</hi> for a Ceremonie. Therfore no Churche hath power to constitute <hi>Circumcission</hi> for a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. For <hi>Order, and Decencie,</hi> no man in his right wits will say that Circumcision commeth under their notion, And as for <hi>Edification,</hi> it hath been formerly shewed, that it doeth not require new instituted signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies, muche lesse a rejected or abrogated Ceremonie, but onely is the ende of orderly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cariage of thinges instituted by God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Secondly, no part of the <hi>partition wall,</hi> betwixt Iewes and Gentiles, may by any Convocation-house, or other Churche be reared up againe. But <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> is a part, nay a principall corner-stone of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall, howsoever it be interpreted, so it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Ergo.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thirdly, Circumcision cannot be esteemed more lawfull to be instituted for a significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, then a <hi>Paschall lambe</hi>: and they two being brought into the Churche, what shall hinder (if it please our Convocation house) but the greatest part of the olde Ceremoniall law, may in like manner follow? For the Rejoynder cap. 2. sect. 6. acknowlegeth no other limites, or boundes for <hi>nomber</hi> of suche Ceremonies, then <hi>the judgement of those to whose discretion it belongeth
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:245:288"/>
to judge therof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. In the fourth place, It is not lawfull for any Churche to impose Ceremoniall <hi>burdens</hi> upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. But <hi>Circumcision</hi> is a great <hi>burden</hi> to them upon whome it is imposed: as our Convocation men would confesse, if it were imposed upon them. Ergo.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Fiftly, It is not lawfull for any Churche, or Convocation-house, to usurpe authoritie over the bodies of men, especially unto <hi>bloud.</hi> But appointing of Circumcision is usurping of authoritie over mens bodies, to the shedding of <hi>bloud.</hi> Ergo. Adde unto this, that the Convocation-house may better appointe, that all English men, should have their <hi>lippes,</hi> or their <hi>eares</hi> pared, or theyr <hi>eares</hi> nayled to theyr Parish-Churche dore, for signification of that dutie, which they are bounde to performe with their eares and lippes, then suche Circumcision as is in use with the Iewes, and Prester-Iohn. These thinges considered, I thinke ther is no reasonable man, but will sooner reject our Ceremonies, for bringing suche a foul tayle after them, (as that our Convoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="11">11. Presently after the Def. had excused Iewish Rites, if they were used without Iewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth (without distinction) that all <hi>Iewish-Rites are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</hi> Wherin the Repl. noted a <hi>contradiction.</hi> But the Rejoynder (to helpe at a dead lift) distinguisheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Iewish Ceremonies, as they were <hi>typicall or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative

                        </note> Now that D.

                     <p n="13">13. For the backinge of the former consequence, this reason was added, by the Repl. If it had been the will of God, that we should be taught, by other signes, then those which are appointed in the N. Testament: He could easily, and would surely, eyther have chosen some of the olde, for that use, or appointed some new in their places. The Rej. his answer is, that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth humane significant teaching Ceremonies, onely <hi>permissively, not praeceptively.</hi> Of which distinction I know not well what to make: as being uncertayn whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meaneth, that God hath onely permitted <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> that Christians may be taught (if men shall thinke fitting) by humane signes; or that he hath commanded that <hi>in generall,</hi> and onely permitted <hi>the particulars</hi> to mens discretion! Howsoever, those whoe usurpe this authoritie, must shew good evidence of this permissive will of God, before we can finde our selves, eyther prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptively, or permissively willed of God, to subject our selves unto their institutions. But that evidence we have hitherto exspected in vayne. The Rej. to darken the cause objecteth, that <hi>It is Gods will, that we should worship him constantly in one set place, at suche an houre, in suche an order; and yet these are not praescribed by God.</hi> Where it is not true that it is Gods will, to have us bound <hi>constantly</hi> to one place, time, and order of worship. 2. So farr as we can discerne Gods will for to have us use any one place, time, and order, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:245:291"/>
that will to be <hi>praeceptive,</hi> and not meerly <hi>permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all knowe, that God hath commanded most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, time, and order, for to be observed in his service: When therfore (all circumstances considered) we finde this place, time, and order, most convenient, we observe it as commanded of God. The like cannot be sayd of our Ceremonies: except first it be shewed, that God hath commanded humane significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in generall: and after it be made apparant, that our significant Ceremonies are more convenient for us, then others.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Def. having given a reason, why it is safer to invent new Ceremonies, then to use those olde ones of the Iewes: because they might ingender an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of necessitie: and so might bringe in all the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law: was answered by the Repl. 1. that though more danger may be in some respect, on the one side, yet more may be absolutely on the other. To this (though it be evident) the Rej. answereth <hi>with a bare deniall.</hi> 2. The Repl. observed, that the inventing of new humane Ceremonies have ingendred an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of necessitie in them: and have brought in all the Popish law of Rites: so that the comparison, even in these respects, may be <hi>quaestioned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Rej. heer first observeth, that it was formerly alleged out of Calv. Ep. 259. that <hi>the originall of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ceremonies was, that men would needes forge new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of God.</hi> In whiche wordes, he findeth more then any other man can: <hi>opinion of necessitie:</hi> and upon that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:245:291"/>
accuseth the Repl. of I know not what <hi>varying uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,</hi> without any reason at all. Afterward, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, that <hi>Iewish Ceremonies have more colour of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because of their first Divine institution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let that be so: yet if preaching, or the Churches sentence declared in a Convocation, be sufficient to remove from Ceremonies all false opinion (as the Def. and Rej. would persuade us) that maketh no suche dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that the comparison may still be <hi>quaestioned.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 7. Concerning Images, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A Third reason brought against significant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, was, that they open a gap to <hi>Images, &amp;c.</hi> where the Reader must remember, or consider, that the meaninge is: <hi>Images</hi> instituted for signification of morall duties, may as well be set up in Churches, as <hi>Crosse and Surplice.</hi> The Def. his answer was (to passe over superfluitie of wordes) that <hi>Images are not to be accounted Popish, or unlawfull, but onely in regard of superstitious adoration.</hi> Wherunto it was replied, that then Cassanders Images (<hi>not for adoration, but for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation &amp; incitement)</hi> are not Popish: whiche the Rej. doeth not onely grante, but also proveth it, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Calvin himselfe, Instit. lib. 1. capit. 11. sect. 12. where he sayth, that <hi>Historical Images, or Pictures, may have
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:245:292"/>
some use, in teaching, and putting, in remembrance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for this, let it be considered, that Calvin in that section, speaketh onely of ordinarie pictures, for teaching and putting in remembrance of that which they repraesent of themselves, without any Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call institution, as certayne wordes written doe signifie a certayne meaning, without any speciall institution. Suche (it may be) would be the picture of Ananias in <hi>a white Surplice,</hi> signifying with other pictures agreable to the storie, that Paul esteemed and called him <hi>a whited wall, Act.</hi> 23.3. But in the very next section, which is the thirteenth, Calvin, disputing against setting up of any Images in Churches, doeth sufficiently declare, that he allowed of no Ceremoniall religious use of Images, suche as is of our Crosse, and Surplice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Replier alleged against this defense of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall religiouse use of Images, especially in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the common consent of our Divines. Against this, the Rej. first opposeth <hi>Luther and the Lutherans:</hi> and then asketh if they be none of <hi>our Divines?</hi> To whiche I answer, that they are in most maine poyntes our Divines: but about this buisinesse they are no more <hi>our,</hi> then about <hi>Vbiquitie, Consubstantiation,</hi> &amp;c. for whiche they disclaime us, even the wholle Churche of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as no part of the Catholicke Churche, but <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Sacramentarians, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the historie of <hi>Luther</hi> about Images is well knowen: how in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Carolastadius,</hi> whoe brake downe Images with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his consent, he would have them to be tolerated, onely for a tyme, untill men were more fully instructed.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:245:292"/>
But that he allowed them for good Ceremonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that cannot be shewed. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Foxe, in the storie of Luther, hath this: <hi>Luther misliked the rashnesse of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>astadius, in stirring up the people, to throw down Images, without authoritie, and before the people were taught, that Images serve to no purpose. Not that he would mainteyne Images (as he sayd) to stand, or to be suffered: but that this ought to be doen by the Magistrate &amp;c. This was Luther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced unto, by the slanderers, that accused Protestantes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and tumultes, &amp;c. This is no argument, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to let Images stand; whoe may and should remove them, and will not. The cause why Luther did so stand with the standing of Images, was time, and not his owne judgement. He wished them away.</hi> Nay (as Zuinglius relateth) he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, some with their feet upward, and some with their faces toward the wall, &amp; their backes to the people, for to make them not religious, but <hi>ridiculous.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> make this one of their controversies, against <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. whether Images may be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in Churches, or in religious use. Fourthly, <hi>Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (whoe was borne amonge the Lutherans in Silesia) in Ezech. cap. 11. testifieth, that <hi>the Lutheran Images, are worshipped of most Lutherans, &amp;c. and therefore are Idoles to be avoyded.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Of having Images for religious use, the <hi>negative</hi> is defended by Calvin, and the <hi>affirmative</hi> by Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 9. in which quaestion, it was
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:245:294"/>
observed by the Replier, that the Def. taketh Bell. his part.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder heere first maketh a kinde of doubt, whether Calvin did not therin contradict himself! But not trusting to that, he addeth, that <hi>the quaestion was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Images may be well (rectè) placed in Churches? because thinges lawfull in them selves, are not lawfull in all times &amp; places to be used.</hi> Now the meer looking upon that Chapter of Bell. will praesently manifest, that Calvin, calling Images in Temples, <hi>Idolatrous signes sett up wherewith the Churches are defiled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Erecta signa Idololatriae, quibus Templa dehonestantur.</hi>
                     </note> never meant so to minse the matter, as to make them lawfull, but not expedient. And in deed, if Images may be used for commone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and institution, as Ecclesiasticall significant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, ther can be no reason given, why they should be shutte out of the Churche, where Ecclesiasticall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies have their cheifest use.</p>
                  <p>This is certayn, that the Def. expressly denieth the bringing in of Images into Churches, for some suche uses as Bellarmine speaketh of, cap. 10. <hi>For instruction, and erudition, for stirring up unto ímitation, and for praeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the memorie of Christ, and Saincts,</hi> he denieth <hi>(I</hi> say) this to be any part of <hi>Popis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. It was added by the Repl. that the Def. his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is directly against the <hi>Homilie against the perill of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,</hi> unto which we are bounde to subscribe. <hi>If this be true</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>the Bishop deserveth to be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</hi> the Replier, if it be untrue. Now <hi>I</hi> doe not desire

that he alone, (separated from the rest eyther partaker of the same or guiltie of equall faults,) should be supended: but <hi>I</hi> dare adventure my suspension, against his, that neyther he nor the Rej. can clear his assertion, from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradiction unto that Homilie. I will take no other wordes for proof of that which the Repl. sayth, then that founde in a booke written against <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Richard Mountague,</hi> about the like sentence, called <hi>A dangerous Plot, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 94. and 95. where these wordes are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of that Homilie: <hi>The words Idoll and Image, be words of divers tongues, and soundes: yet used in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferently, for one thinge allways. To bringe Images into the Churches, is a foul abuse, and great enormitie. They be forbidden, and unlawfull. They are not thinges indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nor tollerable.</hi> If the Def. will say, that his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not contrarie to these wordes, then I am conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that his suspension should be deferred longer then <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mountagues</hi> promotion was, after he had written this, and suche like scandalous doctrines, tending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the overthrow of our religion. And this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be alleged for him: that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mountague in some poyntes went so farre beyonde D.

                  <p n="7">7. The Repl. noted also, that the Def. his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confirmeth Bellarmines foul wordes, whoe sayth, that the Apologie of the Churche of England lyeth, in affirminge the Councell of Franckford to have decreed the abolishing of Images: <hi>de Concil. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8. because the onely answer is that which Iunius (in his notes upon that chapter) giveth: <hi>He that forbiddeth Images to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:245:295"/>
doeth forbid having of Images worshipable, especially in Churches: which answer this Def. doeth flatly denie.</hi> The Rej. answereth, that the meaning of <hi>B. Iuel,</hi> in that place of the Apologie, was, <hi>not that the Councel did simplie take away Images, but contrarie to the Councel of Nice, which required the adoration of them.</hi> But 1. If these wordes doe not shew <hi>Iuels</hi> meaning, yet certainly they declare <hi>Iunius</hi> his minde and judgement, plainely. How then dare the Rej. avouche <hi>Iunius</hi> to have allowed <hi>Images worshipable? 2. Iuel</hi> his words are: <hi>Charles the Great had a Councell at Franckford, contrarie to the</hi> 2. <hi>Nicen Councel, concerning the taking away of Images</hi>: where the <hi>taking away</hi> is not limited by <hi>contrarietie</hi> to the Nicen Councel, but manifestly explaineth the sentence wherin that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie did mainly consist. 3. Learned <hi>Iuel</hi> knew, how to write plainely, so that his wordes and meaning may be understood. Now what his judgement was of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for religious use, (adoration set a part) apeareth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as in his 14. Article, so especially in that notable and Propheticall sentence of his, concerning the <hi>Image of the Crosse</hi> of Christ, as it was in some place or places of England: <hi>Si illa mala Crux stat, nos cadimus. If that evill Crosse stand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee</hi> (or our religion) <hi>must fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is related by <hi>D. Humphrie,</hi> in the historie of B. Iuels life and death, a litle before the ende. And in very deed, except those which write against the Papists, doe refute all Images instituted for religious significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they doe not make any difference bewixt us, and a great part of Popish Doctors. For (as Bilson, against the Iesuites Apologie, pag. 572. well observeth) <hi>this is

the doubt, betwixt us and the Papists, whether we should not content our selves, with suche meanes as God hath devized for us, and commended unto us, therby dayly to renue the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our Redemption; or else invent others of our owne heads</hi>?

Chapter of Cardinall Perrons Replie, pag. 12. or sect. 17. For Holy Water, his more distinct answer was, that <hi>their</hi> (i. <hi>e. Papists) sprinkling of water upon the People, for remembrance of their Baptisme, if it were applied onely for to make them often mindfull, and carefull to keep their vow of Christianitie, made once to God in Baptisme, it might be called a morall Ceremonie and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. But as it is used in Romish Churche, as operative, to the purging of venialb sinnes, and driving away of Devills, it is Popish and execrable.</hi> I am constreyned to repeat the Def. his wordes, that they may discover the vanitie of the Rej. his exceptions against the replie to them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: which was, that Calvin Inst. lib. 4. cap. 10. s. 20.

                     <p>The Rejoynder 1. blameth the Replier for making shew, <hi>as if the Def. were fairely inclined to let in the use of Holy Water:</hi> But without any cause, except he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Def. to be fairely inclined, to let in the use of

                        <hi>a morall Christian Ceremonie,</hi> as the Defender calleth it. 2. He observeth, that the Def. named not <hi>H. Water, but sprincking of Water upon the People.</hi> Now the Rej. sayth expresly thus: <hi>Wee come to that which they</hi> (the Papists) <hi>call H. Water their</hi> (i.e. <hi>the Papists) sprinkling of Water upon the People, &amp;c.</hi> confounding plainely these two termes. 3. He noteth, that the Defender did not say it <hi>may</hi> be, but it <hi>might</hi> be called Christian: that is (by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder his interpretation) <hi>if superstition had not stayned it.</hi> Now I cannot see any difference betwixt that which the Replier sayth, <hi>it may be</hi> accounted Christian, <hi>were it not</hi> for this or that; and this of the Rejoynders: <hi>It might be</hi> so accounted, <hi>if it were not</hi> for this or that. But if <hi>a staine of superstition,</hi> doeth hinder, that a humane Ceremonie cannot be after called Christian, though that superstition be taken from it, by doctrine &amp; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, what will become of our Ceremonies, which the Rejoynder doeth so labour to mainteyne as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that he hath scarce one threed left about him drie, or free from his sweating? 4.

The Argument standeth thus: The second Commandement forbiddeth to make unto our selves, the <hi>likenesse</hi> of any thinge whatsoever,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:245:298"/>
for religious use: as Bucer, Iuel, Fulke, Andrews and Bilson doe interpret it. Therfore to make, appoint, or use significant Ceremonies, of mans devizing, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                     <p>The Rejoynder answereth, in general, that <hi>Religious use, by these fore-named Authors, is taken.</hi> 1. <hi>For worship to the Image</hi>: 2. <hi>Worship to God, by the Image: and not simply, that whiche may any ways conferre to the furtherance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Wherin, he sayth nothing but trueth, and yet no trueth at all to the purpose: except he understandeth in the <hi>that</hi> which he affirmeth, <hi>onely,</hi> 1. e. that they meant no more, but <hi>worshiping to, and by</hi>: and in that he denieth, by <hi>simply,</hi> no difference, betwixt any of those thinges that help forth or further Religion: as if ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill circumstances, and instituted religious Ceremonies, were all one. And if this be his meaning, it requireth more then his simple testimonie, to confirme it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. For the backing of this Argument, it was first observed by the Replier, that the word <hi>likenesse,</hi> used in the second Commandement, is generall, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth under it, all <hi>religious similitudes:</hi> because they are <hi>homogeneall</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> there expresly forbidden. To this the Rejoynder answereth nothing: but onely sayth, that <hi>our Ceremonies are not religious similitudes in suche a sense as the Commandement intendeth, and Divines under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. And that the Replier speaketh ignorantly: because the Commandement doeth as expresly forbid suche similitudes, as any graven Images.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the first of these sayinges, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, untill the Rejoynder explaineth him self, what <hi>that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:245:299"/>
sense</hi> is, in which the Commandement intendeth to forbid <hi>all religious similitudes?</hi> As for the second, to leave the Repliers <hi>ignorance</hi> unto the readers judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, more in it is granted, then was demanded: viz: that all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious similitudes are <hi>expresly</hi> forbidden in the second Commandement.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It was secondly added by the Replier, that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificant Ceremonies are externall actes of religious worship, even as they are used to further devotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suarez, in 3. q. 65. ar. 4. Bell. de Eff. Sacr. lib. 2. cap. 29, and 31. and therfore being invented by man, of the same nature with Images, by which, and at which, God is worshiped. The Rejoynder here (for want of a better answer) flieth to his olde Sanctuarie, of <hi>meritorious, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, and immediat worship grosly held by Papists of their Ceremonies, whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y be significant, or not significant.</hi> But he hath in the former part of this writing, been so beaten out of this <hi>burrow,</hi> that we need not againe spend time in digging about it. Let any man looke upon the places quoted, and he shall finde, that <hi>(merit necessitie, and immediatnesse</hi> set a part) significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are externall acts of religious worship: which was all that this argument required. And I dare leave it (though not to the Rejoynder yet) to <hi>D. Burgesses</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>if merit, necessitie,</hi> be thinges eyther cheifly, or at all, forbidden in the second Commandement, more then in any other? Certainly, <hi>meritorious</hi> conceites are generally forbidden: but in no one Commandement specially: and <hi>necessarie</hi> binding of Conscience by man, belongeth to the first. The Replier looking for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:245:299"/>
something like this, of <hi>essentiall and accidentall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> for praeventing of it, sayd that suche a distinction would help no more heer, then that of the Papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>For this the Rejoynder accuseth him of an <hi>uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart,</hi> and an <hi>unlearned</hi> head. But I see no cause: as hath been fully shewed in the confutation of that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both in the first part of this writing, and also in the second Argument, or Chapter, of this part. Yet because the Rejoynder is so impatient, of hearing his distinction of <hi>essentiall and accidentall</hi> worship, compared with the Papists vaine distinctions: let any man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a litle the Popish distinctions, which <hi>Rivetus</hi> hath well noted and expressed in his <hi>Cases,</hi> on the second Commandement: Worship religious is <hi>either of it selfe, or by accident proper or improper of it selfe,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="13">13. The Replier in the next place, argued from the affirmative part of the second Commandement, unto the negative, thus: This Commandementinjoigneth obedience to all the worship appointed by God, all which was significative, Heb. 8.5. and 10.1. therfor it forbiddeth any significative Ceremonies to be brought
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:245:300"/>
in to the worship of God, devized by man: &amp;c. The Rejoynder heer 1. answereth out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cartwright, that <hi>the Affirmative part injoineth us, to use suche as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doeth approve in his word.</hi> Now though in that edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cartw. his Catechisme printed an. 1611. the affirmative part is thus expressed: <hi>Doe that which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, and doe no more</hi>; Yet that which he quoteth, out of another edition, is enough to cashier all humane significant Ceremonies. For what can be more plainely spoken against them, then that <hi>onely suche outward means must bee used in Gods worship as himself hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But (sayth the Rejoynder) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cartw. reckoneth <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend gestures of the body, amonge those outward meanes</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What then? <hi>Then bodily gestures in religious actions are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther determined by God, or may be lawfully appointed for sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, by man.</hi> A strange consequence: as if, when God allowed for an offering eyther <hi>a payre of Pigeons, or two Turtle doves,</hi> without particular determination, the Priests might have appointed for signification, that onely <hi>two Turtle doves</hi> should be offered!</p>
                     <p>His second answere is, that <hi>all worship of God among the Iewes, was not significant in his sence of significant.</hi> What <hi>his sence</hi> is, I know not: but the sence and words of the Replier his argument, was of worship <hi>appointed,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, beyond that which is naturaall, or necessarie, without any institution, except the law written in every mans heart, be an <hi>institution</hi>; which hee seemeth not to haue conceiued.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 The last consideration by the Replier propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was, that significant Ceremonies, which are by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:245:300"/>
must needs belong vnto the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; as he that maketh an accurate distinction of the Commandements, will presently see: but to man the second Commandement is (in regard of making) wholly negatiue. Ergo. The Rej. answereth first, that signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies may belong rather to the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as <hi>D. Ames</hi> referreth them; or <hi>accidentally</hi> to the fourth. Now as for <hi>accidentall</hi> belonging to this or that Commandement, it is not in question. To the third Commandement they cannot be directly referred, according to that distinction of the Commandements, which the Rej. himselfe produceth, in the next words as <hi>accurate.</hi> As for D. Ames, let any man looke vpon his <hi>Medulla, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. 13. th.</hi> 34.35.36. and he shall see how the Rej. mistook him.</p>
                     <p>His second answere consisteth in distinguishing the Commandements of the first Table: Wherein (to let other things passe) he maketh <hi>the second to prouide, that from God</hi> wee take the prescription of all that, by use of which we may really worship him, and esteeme him to be truely and properly honoured of vs: and the Third to prouide, that in all acts of his worship, we carry our selues <hi>syncerely and reverently,</hi> from this hee concludeth, that <hi>the right use of Ceremonies, belong rather to the third Commandement, then to the second, as touching their end.</hi> Of this I know not well what to make: 1. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was of significant Ceremonies, in regard of their <hi>institution and making,</hi> the Rej. answereth, <hi>touching their end.</hi> 2. Touching their <hi>end, I</hi> cannot vnderstand (nor I thinke any man else) how the proper end of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:245:301"/>
Crosse in Baptisme, should be <hi>syncerity and reverence</hi>; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>mixture</hi> of humane inventions with Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be <hi>syncerity</hi>; and presumption of doing so, be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</hi> 3. If the second Commandement doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that we take from God the praescription of all <hi>reall</hi> worship; then also of significant Ceremonies, except they be <hi>phantasticall</hi> worship: and yet euen <hi>figmenta cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri, cordisve humani,</hi> the very <hi>phantasies,</hi> or <hi>images</hi> of the minde, not prescribed by God, are (by the most inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters) held as well forbidden, as outward reall images. If the same Commandement do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th binde us to Gods prescription, in <hi>all true</hi> worship; then humane signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies, being not prescribed by God, are <hi>fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se</hi> worship. If also in <hi>proper</hi> true worship; then they are onely <hi>metaphoricall</hi> worship, like unto true worship, or at least <hi>tropicall</hi>; which hath beene sufficiently confuted in the first part, and in the second Chapter of this.</p>
                     <p>The third answere given by the Rej. is, that in the second Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nothing is forbidden, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>making,</hi> but the <hi>instituting,</hi> or fancying of our owne meere <hi>devises,</hi> as an immediate meanes of <hi>worshipping God thereby.</hi> The force lieth in those two termes, <hi>meer</hi> devises, and <hi>immediate</hi> meanes of worship. Now for the distinction betwixt <hi>immediate</hi> and mediate worship, it hath beene sufficiently canvized in the first part. The other evasion, of <hi>meer humane devises,</hi> is the common refuge of Iesuites, when they are pressed with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So Bellarmine (<hi>de effectu Sacram. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.) to Calvin, alleging that all humane will-worship is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Scripture, <note place="margin">

                     <p n="15">15 In vie of those grounds, laid by the Repl. against humane significant Ceremonies, out of the second Commandement, the Rej. by way of <hi>Reconvention</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two grounds to the contrary: the first whereof is taken from <hi>supposed true worship, &amp; meanes necessarily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereto,</hi> as <hi>onely</hi> forbidden in the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and the second, from our placing the worship of God, in <hi>forbearing</hi> these Ceremonies, which he hath not commanded us to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bear. Now to both these earthy dead grounds (or <hi>Capita mortua)</hi> answer hath been given in the first part; partly in the chapter of <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and partly in that of <hi>Difference</hi> betwixt our and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Ceremonies. So that nothing need heer be added. Yet in few wordes, 1. He forgetteth himself muche, in distinguishing significant Ceremonies (which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to be some kinde of worship) from <hi>true</hi> worship; except he will confesse them to be <hi>false</hi> worship. 2. He considered not what he writte, when he speaketh of <hi>meanes necessarily inducing to true worship.</hi> For no Papist ever conceyted, that their Ceremonies, were eyther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to true worship, as if no true worship could be without them: or necessarily inferring true worship, as if he that used them, howsoever he did it, must needes performe true worship: and yet one of these senses must needes be the meaning of that phraze, if it hath any
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:245:302"/>
meaning at all. 3. He taketh the wholle quaestion for wonne, or granted, when he speaketh of our <hi>forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that, which God hath not commanded us to forbear</hi>: and therupon concludeth thus: God hath not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to forbear humane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. IN this section, the Def. beginneth a confutation of the fore-proved Proposition: <hi>All humane Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, being appropriated to Gods service, if they be ordeyned to teache any spirituall dutie, by their mysticall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, are unlawfull.</hi> His Scripture confutation (for want of rule or praecept) is onely by Examples.</p>
                  <p>Now to omit wordes of no weyght, his first example is Abrahams directing his servant, to put his hand under his thigh, when he did swear. Gen. 24.2. Against this, the Replier first excepted, that in probabilitie, Abraham was not the appointer of this Ceremonie. The Rej. answereth, that <hi>this is not materiall to the poynt, what man appointed it, so that it was not of Divine appointment.</hi> So that their first proof of Ceremonie appointed by man, is from an example appointed they know not by whome: onely begging of us to grant, that it was not appointed by God, whiche they ought to have proved. Yet the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:245:302"/>
Replier for citing <hi>Calvin and Iunius,</hi> as leaving it most probable, that is, was an ancient custome before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (which any man looking upon their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may see to be true) is called by the Rej. <hi>a false man in all his allegations.</hi> But let that goe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Def. for magnifying of this example, sayd, that <hi>ther is not a more Divine service</hi> of God, then the taking of an oath; the Replier denied this: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>proper, and principall</hi> ende of swearing is (not to worship God, but) to confirme a trueth. To this the Rejoynder answereth 1. that <hi>so the proper ende of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sacraments, Petitioning, is edification of men, confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, and obteyning of mercies.</hi> Where if he had repeated the Repliers other terme, proper and <hi>principall</hi> ende, his exception had been at an ende: because the principall ende of these meanes, is to honor God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side those very endes which he mentioneth, <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confirmation of faith, and obteyning of mercie,</hi> are ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoredly distinguished from <hi>Gods worship,</hi> as no more appertayning to it, then the fidelitie which a Vassall, or Copi-houlder, doeth by oath confirme ordinarily unto his Lord. The Rejoynder his second answer is, <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier before placed worship in the nature of the action it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet now placeth it in the ende of the action.</hi> As if the <hi>nature</hi> of an action, may not be gathered from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or naturall <hi>ende</hi> of it!

answer the Popish Proctors for Images, who allege as like, the Ceremonie used in an oath: <hi>Particular oaths, given onely for satisfaction of men, are not suche proper acts of Gods service, as supplications, thanksgivings, and solemne vowes are.

                  <p n="3">3. Because the Def. proved nothing to the purpose, about this Gesture, he was required to prove it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of some spirituall dutie: For it was in probabilitie onely a common signe of subjection, as well out of an oath, as in it, without any respect unto Christ. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder in stead of a proof, sayth, that some <hi>Ancient and Later Writers doe so conceit.</hi> And if the Def. and he also doe conceit it so, we doe not strive with them, about that: but mens <hi>conceits</hi> are no great proofs.

                  <p>He subjoigneth 3. that it was a common signe used in solemnitie of <hi>that kinde,</hi> as well out of an oath, as in it; this (sayth he) <hi>is barely and boldly affirmed, &amp; implieth a contradiction, as importing other solemnities with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for contradiction, if he had repeated the word <hi>subjection,</hi> then he might have discerned signes of that kinde, as well without, as with an oath.

                     </gap>ion of hands was, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, fit to signifie inferioritie, or subjection) this I say was not a meer <hi>fiction,</hi> as the Rejoynder would have it. For, beside that the meaning was, of the usuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of hands in blessing, wher <hi>the lesser is blessed of the greater,</hi> as Scripture teacheth: the Rejoynder hath brought but two examples, to infringe the generalitie of it Act. 13.2. Lev. 1.4. and in both of these it houldeth. For they that layd hands on <hi>Paul and Silas,</hi> did it not onely in the name of the wholle societie, which in suche cases hath some dispensative superioritie over par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members; but allso by Commission from God, which gave them in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t buisinesse superioritie. And he that brought a beast to be sacrifized, Lev. 1. had certainly power over it. If the Rejoynder could have shewed us, where, and when, a servant imposed his hand upon his Maisters head, or a sonne upon his fathers, that had been to the purpose. Wee on the contrary say with <hi>Tostatus</hi> on Gen. 47. that the putting under of the hand, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used, but by an <hi>inferior, to his superior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet the Rej. hath more to say: namely, that <hi>the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:245:304"/>
signe of a servants dutie to which hee is bound by oath, is a mysticall signe of some spirituall dutie: because all the law is spirituall; and obedience to maisters, for conscience sake, is a service of God.</hi> Whereto I answere, that I never heard the <hi>Hang-mans</hi> office, which is servile, called a <hi>spirituall</hi> dutie; no though he bee bound to it by oath. 2. The oath maketh the thing sworne to, no more spirituall, then a carnall obligation unto it (which may concurre with the obligation of an oath) maketh it carnall. 3. The <hi>Law</hi> is all spirituall, in the manner; but yet all the workes required by it are not spirituall, nor so esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Apostle (1. Cor. 6.) distinguisheth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>things pertaining to this life,</hi> from spirituall things. All Divines usually distinguish the common <hi>morall</hi> duties practised by light of nature, from such as are <hi>spirituall.</hi> 4. Obedience to maisters for conscience sake, is a <hi>service,</hi> or obedience to God, as it commeth from conscience toward God: but every signe of subjection, is not a signe of it as it commeth from conscience toward God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the last place, the Replier, supposing all true that hitherto the Def. and Rej. have striven for, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that any thing could bee concluded from thence, for our <hi>Convocation-power</hi> in appointing such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: because such Prophets as Abraham might doe more then our Convocation.</p>
                  <p>The Rej. heere, would have us <hi>shew</hi> that this was done <hi>by Propheticall inspiration</hi>: and because this is not done, he calleth this answere <hi>a boulting hole, fit for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed and wilfull disputer, whose cause cannot bee defended and yet his stomach will not yeild.</hi> But if he had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:245:304"/>
that it belongeth not properly to the answere, but to the Opponent, to produce reasons; and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable it is, for to require a reason proving a thing to be done, of him that iudgeth it false, and onely for disputation sake granteth his adversarie to suppose and take it as true, hee would never have abused so many words by misplacing of them. All these things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I doubt not (as the Replier said) but Abrahams servant, if he were heere present, and need required, would sweare, that his example maketh nothing for our Ceremonies.</p>

To this the Rej. first answereth, that Suarez doeth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded these three points, as three errours of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants: because hee mentioneth not Protestants, but Heretickes, which reason is not worth the answering: because hee mentioneth <hi>Heretickes of this time,</hi> which phraze is oftner in the Iesuites writings, understood of Protestants, then of any other, as all know that have looked vpon them.

                  <p>Out of these two observations, I make these two conclusions: 1. If this error be necessarily founded on those three mentioned, (as Suarez sayth, and sheweth) then suche Protestants as hold this (among whome the Rejoynder professeth the Defend. and his owne name) holde also those. 2. If Protestants holde this tenet, that it is <hi>Superstition,</hi> for to intend worship in humane Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (as Suarez sayth) then our Defender and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder in this point are by Protestants found guiltie of Superstition. For they place <hi>speciall immediat,</hi> though <hi>improper, accidentall, and secondarie</hi> worship in humane Ceremonies; as is to be seen in this Rejoynder pag. 125.127. &amp;c.</p>

                     </gap>scape, by alleging (as they use to doe) that the Papists place <hi>proper essentiall</hi> worship in all their Ceremonies. For Suarez in the same place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the Popish tenet, concerning worship, just as they doe theirs: <hi>Sacramental Ceremonies belong to secondarie worship: not onely because they conteine External worship, but also in the very Externall worship it selfe, they are as it were accidents of other more noble actions.</hi>

If it had been by men appointed, that every yeer, 14. days should be observed for the Passover Feast, it had fitted to the purpose.

                     <hi>Christ did not properly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Feast, but the Congregation of the faithfull at the Feast: For Christ tooke all such occasions then, to wit, before those solemnities were abolished, of sowing the seed of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Nor did Christ ought that wee read at those times, but preach in the Temple.</hi> And sure I am, that neither <hi>walking</hi> in the Porch, nor <hi>declaring that he was that Christ,</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged properly vnto the solemnity of that Feast.

                  <p>The Rej. objecteth <hi>1.

little before his passion; so that it appeareth plainely, they were not so driven out, but they came in againe, and continued their merchandise there: and yet in the meane space, our Saviour was often present in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without allowance of that their practise. So had he often condemned the traditions of men, in Gods worship; and yet was present some time, where they were observed. Beside, because the Def. and Rej. are wonte to accuse the Iewes for placing <hi>holinesse, necessity, efficacy, and proper essentiall worship</hi> in humane traditions, whereby they would avoid the dint of that generall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which our Saviour giveth of them, Mat. 15. Mar. 7. &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> would faine learne of them, how it appeareth, or may be conjectured, that they placed not as much <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, necessity, efficacy, &amp;c.</hi> in this and such like humane Feasts, as in <hi>washing of hands before meat.</hi> If they did (as any man will thinke) then how can they say, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our condemned the one, and allowed the other?</p>

IT is the Def. and Rej. their fashion, to produce Instances, without proof of their fitnesse, and so exspect from us that they should be disproved: whiche is all one, as if <hi>Iohn a Stiles</hi> should in a great <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> bringe forth against <hi>Iohn a Nokes,</hi> some instrumens, for evidence of his cause, which few, or none, beside himself, can read, (at least so as to discerne any thing in it making for him) and plead that in them was evidence enough, except <hi>Iohn a Nokes</hi> could prove the contrarie. So it is heer, about the <hi>Altar of Iordan:</hi> no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is first made, how it agreeth to the purpose: but we are chalenged to shew how it disagreeth. Yet yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them this libertie, we have enough to oppose.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And first of all, we answer, that this Altar of the two Tribes, was not in the state, or use, religious, as the Crosse is, by the confession of an English <hi>Bishop, Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on the</hi> 2. <hi>Commandement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder 1. opposeth out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Parker, par. 1. sect. 34. and 36. that <hi>religious in use</hi> is that which hath a <hi>religious ende</hi>: and <hi>religious in state,</hi> which is <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> belonging to Gods service. Ergo. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Parker in those sect. tould him, that <hi>religious in a sense common, or mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly, all thinges are, that are doen to an holy ende: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:245:311"/>
in sense speciall, or in state, all those thinges are, that have Order, Obligation, and a kinde of Immobilitie, in Gods service.</hi> Now the quaestion is not of the former <hi>common mixt sense</hi>: but of the later <hi>speciall state</hi>: according to which, no man can say the Altar of Iordan to have been religious, upon ground of Scripture or reason. Let any man judge then, whether <hi>partialitie did put out M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers eyes</hi> (as the Rej. speaketh) or blear theirs, that see not the vanitie of this allegation?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. B. Babingtons words on the 2. Commandement are these: <hi>They erected that Altar, not for religion, but in deed for a civil use, as you may see, Iosh.</hi> 22. The Rejoynd. answereth, that he calleth the Altar <hi>civill Analogically, because it was ordeyned by consent of fellow-Citizens,</hi> which is as meer a shift, as any yet invented by the Rejoynder. For 1. he calleth not the Altar, but the <hi>use, civill.</hi> 2. He opposeth this <hi>civilitie</hi> not unto <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> as the Rejoynder would have him, but unto the same fellow-Citizens erecting of an Altar <hi>for Religion.</hi> 3. What he meaneth, appeareth plainly, by his third Proposition, there set downe in these termes: <hi>It is lawfull to make pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of thinges which we have seen, to a civill use, but not to use them in the Churche, and for Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To passe over circumstantiall passages, the Def. <hi>(proving this Altar to be appointed unto Gods service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a patterne of the Lords Altar, as our Crosse is a resemblance of Christs Crosse)</hi> was 1. reproved by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier: because the Crosse, wheron Christ did suffer, was no more holy then Iudas: and so not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Lords Altar. To this the Rejoynder in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:245:312"/>
many wordes, maketh shew of saying something, but I leave it to the Reader, if he sayth any thinge. I (for my part) can not discerne what it is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Replier also in the second place alleged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that every resemblance of a holy thing, is not therfor holy: because then every Ale-house picture taken from holy thinges mentioned in Scripture, should be holy; and a modell of the Temple, caried by a Tyrian workman, into his countrie for newes, should have been holy.</p>
                  <p>To this the Rejoynder (after a few wordes of course) answereth, that <hi>this is to separat the resemblance of a thing, from the use of it.</hi> As if the Def. had not argued simply, &amp; meerly, from the <hi>resemblance,</hi> making, as yet, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the use! If ther be any <hi>Sophistrie</hi> in this argument (as the Rejoynder sayth ther is) it is first found in the Defender his uncouth reason.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Defender went about to prove, first, that this Altar did mystically signifie a spirituall dutie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Gileadites then living; viz: <hi>to teache that the Lord was God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it was replied, that it doeth not appear out of the text, that ther was intended any use for the praesent age, that then lived: nay the contrarie may be gathered out of the 24. and 25. verses: <hi>We have doen it for f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar of this thing, saying: In time to come, your children might speak unto our children, &amp;c. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord.</hi> The Rejoynder opposeth, that ther is afterward mention made of <hi>us, and you.</hi> But that is nothing: because it noteth onely, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come, may denie <hi>us,</hi> on this side Iordan, not
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:245:312"/>
to have been joint Tribes with <hi>you</hi> on the other side of that River. Vpon this, the Repl. concluded, that this Altar was no direct helpe unto devotion. To which is rejoyned, that <hi>it was not a direct (that is immediat) help unto devotion; but immediatly significative, &amp; collaterally for devotion it was.</hi> Suche distinctions I never heard, nor read. Any man may see, that a Ceremonie directly and immediatly signifying a spirituall dutie, is a direct &amp; immediat help to devotion. To what other help, this help was <hi>collaterall,</hi> I would fain know.</p>
                  <p>A further reason of this conclusion was added: viz: then most of the other Tribes should have had use of it, and also reason, to have set up Altars of devotion at every three-way-leet, as Crosses stand. The Rejoynder is <hi>1. that the other Tribes (no doubt) had use of it, as of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that the Lord is God.</hi> Now let any man consider, whether they which ordinarily resorted to the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and Altar of God,</hi> had need of a <hi>humane Altar,</hi> farre remooved from their sight, to put them in minde, that the LORD was God? And whether the two Tribes and a halfe, without the consent, or knowledge of the chiefe Priests, the chiefe Magistrates, the farre greater part of people, and power to appoint vnto all Israel a solemne significant Ceremonie, for their common use? The Rej. addeth in the 2. place, that <hi>all are not bound to the same helpes to devotion, and the other tribes needed no such monument, or patterne, having the Altar it selfe in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</hi> Where 1. except he holdeth the two Tribes, and a halfe <hi>bound</hi> to set up this Altar, hee maketh in that no difference: if hee so holdeth, then it is no instance of a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:245:313"/>
meere <hi>Arbitrarie</hi> Ceremonie. 2. The two tribes had the Lords Altar in present possession, as well as divers of the other: so that by this reason, they also for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent need no such monument and patterne: which is the very point in this place questioned.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Replier affirmed, that (<hi>in regard of posterity)</hi> the immediate ende of this Altar was, to testifie, that those Tribes beyond Iordan, belonged to the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so had right to the same worship, with those of this side Iordan: which is nothing to a Ceremony of state and immediate use, in the speciall solemne worship of God. The Rejoynder asketh <hi>if this were not a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ende?</hi> I answere, It was so holy and religious, as every <hi>Land-marke</hi> of a Parsons Glebe-land, or every <hi>signe of a Parish-bound</hi> is holy and religious: but not so as mysticall Ceremonies. B. Andrewes (against <hi>Perone,</hi> p. 18.) giveth some light to this, by the ancient use of <hi>Lights, and incense: There were lights (saith he) there was incense, used by the Primitive Church, in their service; not for any mysticall meaning, but (as it is thought) for this cause, that where the Christians in time of persecution, had their meetings most commonly in places darke, and so needing lights, and dampish, and so needing good savours, they provided lights against one, and incense against the other. After the Churches retained these things, to shew themselues the successours of those ancient Christians, &amp;c. the After-ages devized mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and significations of their owne, which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were not so.</hi> If this be so (as it is thought) then there may be signes of succession unto religious fore-fathers, <hi>without any mysticall meaning:</hi> which is all that by us is

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Rejoynder as having sufficiently confuted all other answers, bringeth in one made to himselfe in conference, <hi>(though he hath not found it in print)</hi> as a grand absurdity: namely, <hi>that the Gileadites did ill, in erecting this Altar; and the rest also in allowing of it.</hi> Now as for <hi>allowance</hi> by the High Priest, Princes, and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Israel, which he speaketh of, <hi>I</hi> finde it not evident in the Text.

Fulke, no absurd Divine, (against Sanders, of Images, pag. 649.) writeth thus <hi>in print: The two Tribes and a half, Iosh.</hi> 22. <hi>made not an Image, but an Altar for a memoriall: and yet their fact was not commendable, though it was, in some sort excusable.</hi> 2.

in the Temple, by reason of the speciall command of God to use them, and their superadded mysticall signification: wheras other Altars were onely permitted, and so helpes to the Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, but not sanctifiers of them; nay they were sanctified by the Offeringes; as also the Altars of Gods appointment, in the time of Moses, Salomon, Ezra, and Machabeus, were first sanctified by the gift that was offered on them, and so installed in their peculiar privilege, of sanctifying the Gifts which were afterwards offered upon them.</hi> For all this, no consent is shewed of any Divine: Onely we are bidden to see Zanchie, de Redem. lib. 1. cap. 16. thes. 2.3. Now 1. Zanchie hath nothing to the Rejoynder his purpose: he doeth not distinguish betwixt Altars <hi>commanded</hi> and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars <hi>permitted</hi>: but sayth of the <hi>commanded Altars,</hi> that they were annexed unto the <hi>acts of worship.</hi> And so he doeth of the <hi>Arke</hi> it selfe, and all the principall &amp; most essentiall meanes appointed by God. What can the Rejoynder make of this? 2. The <hi>speciall command</hi> of God was as well for the Offeringes, as for the Altar: so that cannot be the reason, why the Altar did sanctifie the Offering, more then the Offering the Altar.</p>
                  <p>And the same aequalitie is in the <hi>superadded mysticall, and typicall signification.</hi> 3. I am sory to hear from D.B. that the Altars built by Abraham, Iacob, &amp;c. before Moses, were <hi>onely permitted.</hi> He may as well say, that all the Sacrifices before Moses, were <hi>onely permitted.</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine himself, de Eff. Sacr. lib. 2. cap. 31. confesseth, that they were <hi>by inspiration, and impulsion Divine:</hi> and all our Divines, disputing against Papists about will-worship, make that <hi>Divine instinct,</hi> for substance, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

command. 4. How could Altars be sanctified by Offeringes, when the Offerings themselfs were not in state of sanctification actually, and properly, before they came to the Altars? He that <hi>left his gift at the Altar,</hi> that is ready to lay it theron, and then went to be reconciled with his brother, had not yet actually sanctified the same. 5. The Altars of Moses, and Salomon, were not <hi>first Sanctified</hi> by Offeringes upon them, but by Moses his <hi>Annoynting</hi>: the manifestation of Gods <hi>glorious</hi> praesence in a <hi>Cloude,</hi> filling the Tabernacle, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and by <hi>that fire</hi> which came downe from heaven to consume the Sacrifice. Ex. 40. Lev. 8. &amp; 9, 1. King. 8. 2. Chr. 7.6. If Salomons sanctified Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not sanctifie the Sacrifices offered theron, then eyther those Sacrifices were lesse holy, then those which were offered on the Altar, and sanctified therby: or else they had more sanctifying vertue in them, then the other, which did not sanctifie their Altar, as those did their Court. The like may be sayd, and more also, of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Altars, &amp;c. but this is enough.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our first answer is the same that D. Whitakers, D. Sutlife, &amp;c. giveth to Bellarmine (whoe de Pont. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. cap. 19. hath the same objection against Calvin) <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Salomon fecit, id Dei authoritate &amp; Spiritus Sancti nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu fecit</hi> (sayth D. Whitakers) that is, <hi>Salomon did this by Divine authoritie, and instinct of the H. Ghost.</hi> The Rej. excepteth 1. that Bellarmine would prove by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>proper, essentiall worship, by man ordeyned.</hi> But if he had looked upon the chapter quoted, he might have seen, that the onely quaestion there, is, <hi>whether it was
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:245:315"/>
sinne, for men, by their owne authoritie, to erect a new Altar in the Temple?</hi> And this the Def. and Rej. with Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine denie, against Calvin. 2. He addeth, that <hi>all our Divines doe not give this answer alone.</hi> As if we also did not follow them, in adding other answers to this!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our second answer (for I will not dwell on wordes) is, that Salomon did this from aequitie of the Law.

                     </note> To this the Defend. answered, that this interpretation overthroweth the former. Nothing lesse (sayth the Replier) because Salomon might be directed, to see, and authorized to follow that aequitie. The Rej. heer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving litle reason to oppose, putteth down, in stead of it, great wordes: as <hi>this is to confound Ordinarie, and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie; Speciall, and Common; Scripture-light, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Revelation; and so hath no sence in it.</hi> And what shew of <hi>wool</hi> for this great <hi>crie?</hi> May not one be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarilie, specially, and immediatly directed, to see that Scripture-light which in it self hath ordinarie, &amp; common shining? Surely, the Apostles had ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>raordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, speciall, immediat direction, to see the meaning of divers passages in the ould Testament (as the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall meaning of Sara and Hagar, Sinay and Sion, &amp;c.) which was before conteyned in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet</hi> (addeth the Rejoynder) <hi>Salomon</hi> (by this reason) <hi>needed no speciall Authoritie.</hi> Whiche I grant, if he be considered as a perfect man; but if he be conceived as

                     <hi>Peter,</hi> who after hee was sent unto all <hi>Nations,</hi> needed after a Vision from Heauen, to send him vnto the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> then this consequence is nothing worth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Passing over the third answer (in pitie) the fourth is, that this sanctification of the Court by Solomon, was no addition of a divers kinde. This is <hi>Danaeus</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Bellarmine, Cont. lib. 1. cap. 19. To this the Defender answered nothing, which either the Replier thought worthy any answer, or Rejoynder of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. So that <hi>I</hi> need not adde any thing to it, but onely a fitting explication which <hi>I</hi> finde in <hi>Tostatus</hi> (in 3. Reg. cap. 8.) thus expressed: <hi>It was lawfull to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

first founded by those Prophets, which brought in Schooles of the Prophets. 3. That in them, there was (of olde) no significant humane Ceremonie used. To the first is rejoyned, that <hi>the Synagogues bare some represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sanctuary.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> aske, How?

If so, then no <hi>Anabaptists</hi> ever denied significant Ceremonies of mansappointing, which yet the Rejoynderaccused them for. But this fonde conceyt is sufficiently confuted in the first part of this writing, Chap. 4. and 5. Yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Synagogues had been a repraesentation of the Sanctuarie, which was a Ceremonie; is every reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of a Ceremonie, a new Ceremonie? then any man may make more Ceremonies, then ther are men in his Parish.

The third (of no humane significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies used in Synagogues) is absolutely pronounced <hi>false.</hi> But no reason of this sentence is given out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but onely that they used there <hi>reverend gestures:</hi> as if all reverend gestures were significant Ceremonies of mans invention!

But the Rejoynder correcteth his interpretation, and saith this distinction is taken chiefely from the different Authors, <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> Be it so: yet it were not extreame rudenesse, to say that whatsoever the Apostles as the Apostles of Christ, appointed, that Christ himselfe appointed.

Which is true: yet 1. this overthroweth that which was even now alleaged, that this distinction is chiefely taken from <hi>different Authors:</hi> because this is onely a <hi>difference of manner,</hi> as Polanus (Syntag. lib. 1. cap. 47.) doeth clearely manifest, in his large confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this selfe same distinction. 2. By the same or somewhat like reason, a distinction may be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word of God, and the word of the Prophets, 3. It were worth the knowing, upon what <hi>occasion</hi> these Feastes were ordained by the Apostles?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is brought in by the Def. as a second answere of M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Nic. That these Love-feasts, were abrogated by the Apostles. From which he gathereth, that <hi>then they were not of divine institution.</hi> No say we, nor yet <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall.</hi> For it was onely said before, that <hi>if they were of one, they were also of the other</hi>: but not positively that they were of either.

                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> the Replier denied these Feasts to have beene, or <hi>Religious,</hi> because they were used in the same manner, or to the same ende, out of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that is, to the reliefe of the poore, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of brotherly love.

                     <hi>Clemens</hi> is the last: whoe calleth this gesture <hi>Mysticall, (Paedag. lib. 3.</hi>) But this was a Rhetoricall phraze. For it signifieth nothing else (as the fore-goeing words shew) but that they should not use it, <hi>qui non habent intus amicitiam</hi>; but as a true signe of good will. In the words also next following that common salutations (<hi>dilecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in via salutationes)</hi> should be with mysticall grace, <hi>mysticè, intus, amanter &amp; benignè alloqui.</hi> Now let the Def. and Rejoynd. cast up their accounts, and tell, what they have gained by these Testimonies more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was given them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet (sayth the Defend.) this gesture is called <hi>Holy,</hi> and the object of it is <hi>Peace:</hi> Tis true: But all our civill actions ought to be suche as becommeth <hi>Saints,</hi> 1. e. so farr <hi>Holy</hi> for manner, that they be <hi>free from sinne</hi>; and to the Glorie of God: many also have <hi>Peace</hi> for their
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:245:323"/>
direct object.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if this Kisse was holy in the nature of it, I aske whether a repraesentation of it may not be made also for a holy use, as the <hi>Altar of Iordan,</hi> and the <hi>Synogogues</hi> were in the Def. and Rejoynders opinion? And if so, whie have we not a <hi>Pax</hi> to kisse at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? I see not (by these tenets) what should keep out <hi>Paxes,</hi> more then <hi>Altars,</hi> with bowing to them, but onely the meer pleasure of our <hi>Prelats Regent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we have thus dispached the Defender we need not trouble our selves with his <hi>Second,</hi> the Rejoynder proceding another way, against the Replier. Yet I will note what new weapons he useth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Rejoynder thinketh it <hi>strange,</hi> that constant <hi>Application</hi> by direction, or custome, should not be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> But it is no more <hi>strange,</hi> then that the common using of one way from <hi>Lichefild,</hi> to <hi>Coventrie,</hi> or from thence to <hi>Coldfeild,</hi> may be without Institution; or that the same <hi>word</hi> which of ould signified <hi>Love,</hi> is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians commonly applied unto <hi>Christian Love,</hi> without any new institution.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He sayth, that <hi>naturall fitnesse for signification, doeth hinder Institution.</hi> True: but fitnesse, with actuall use for signifying of true love, doeth praevent an institution of the same signification: as the former signification of the word <hi>Love,</hi> doeth so hinder a new institution of the same word to signifie <hi>Christian love,</hi> that it would make the Authors of suche an institution, ridiculous, &amp; idle.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He affirmeth, that the ordeyned <hi>seating of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in an higher place, in way of Reverence to his Function, is
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:245:324"/>
as Mysticall a Ceremonie, as the Crosse in Baptisme.</hi> Then (say I) a Mothers kissing of her froward childe, in the Churche to still it, in reverence to Preaching or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is as Mysticall a Ceremonie, as the Kisse of Peace. And what need any other <hi>institution,</hi> then constant <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of suche gestures, by the Rejoynder his rule?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He quoteth <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon the place, as for him, whome every man that will, may see to be against him. So <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Paraeus.</hi> Onely he hath a litle shew (but no substance) out of P. Martyr his words, upon 1. Cor. 16.20.

                  <p n="8">8. Notwithstanding all this weaknesse of his prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, he concludeth strongly, that those which doe not yeeld unto his proofs, <hi>have themselves, above all other men, in estimation for soundnesse of judgement.</hi> To which I will onely say this, we have (by Gods grace) more jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then either to accuse others so vainely, or to make any account of this accusasion, as if it would prejudice us with any man of judgement.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe last example of Apostolicall Humane, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremonies by Institution, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto Gods worship, is a Womans <hi>Vaile,</hi> such as a <hi>Huik</hi> is, in the Low-Countries, or a <hi>french Hood,</hi> with a <hi>Bon-grace,</hi> was wont to bee in England. Now at this it was answered, that the <hi>Vaile</hi> was neither Apostolicall, nor meerely of humane institution, nor of instituted signification, nor yet <hi>appropriated</hi> unto Gods worship: but a civill order of decencie, used as well out of Gods worship as in it. And the Rejoynder granteth, that <hi>it was a civill custome:</hi> but addeth, that it is as <hi>absurd, from thence to conclude, that it was in religious worship civill, and not religious, as to affirme this of blowing of Trumpets in the new Moones, &amp;c.</hi> Where first, hee should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that we are heere in answering, not in proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and <hi>concluding,</hi> which is the Def. his part. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Replier said it was <hi>a civill order of decencie,</hi> expressing the immediate end, which it had as well in, as out of worship, which will well beare this conclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that it was no more religious, then Womens proper apparell, long garments, &amp;c. (to which Chrisostome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1. Cor. 11.) compareth the <hi>Vaile,</hi> as one part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or their <hi>shooes, or slippers are.</hi> 3. Concerning <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Def. proceeding by interrogatories, maketh this the first: whether the Vaile was not significant of some good thing? To which the Repl. answered, <hi>yes,</hi> it did declare, or argue a good thing, as indeed all civill apparrell of modest fashion doeth. For this hee is chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and bidden to <hi>stand by, with his answer while his elders speake.</hi> As if we were now in the <hi>High-Commission</hi>; and hee as Commissioner, might prescribe us when, and how much we may speake for our selves, though much without ground be spoken against us, and interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries propounded to the prejudice of our cause!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He asked secondly, what it did signifie? Answer was made, that it signified <hi>subjection to superior power. Then a morall dutie was professed by it,</hi> sayth the Rej. just so, as modesty, and shamefastnesse, gravity, and care of not offending, are professed by all apparell of modest honest fashion. And yet I never heard all modest apparell called a mysticall religious Ceremonie. Theophilact (in Cor. 11.) maketh a mans <hi>beard</hi> like and equall unto his unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in <hi>signification.</hi> And will the Def. and Rej. say, that <hi>Beards</hi> are religious mysticall <hi>Ceremonies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Def. added, that it had some relation unto God. To which it was answered, that so there is in an upper Seat, of an Heathen Magistrate, sitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which yet is no mysticall Ceremonie of religion. The Rej. (altering first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the case, into <hi>a throne set up to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:245:325"/>
that end, to represent the Soveraignty of God, for religious cognizance, and document)</hi> affirmeth the Seat of a Heathen Iudge, to be a <hi>mysticall Ceremonie of Religion.</hi> Now set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his changing of the question, and take him as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, that everry Seat, of judgement among all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, is such a Ceremonie; and then, let any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, if hee hath not brought his pigges to a faire mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket?

Hee may as well say, that such vailes as Tamars was where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she deceived Iuda, even unto incest, was religious Ceremonies among the Heathen; because a Vaile (in the nature of it) declareth a morall duty. For many of those Seates (in their nature tending to justice) are but vailes of injustice, as Tamars was of uncleannesse. If those High-seates bee religious Ceremonies, then the bowing of inferiours unto them, kissing of their feet, or foot-stooles, must be such also. Why then did the Def. seeke (as with a candle and lant-horne) in every darke corner for instances or examples of religious significant Ceremonies of mans appointing? every civill meeting, every Company of Soldiers, every Schoole of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren can afford examples enough, and more then enough.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was added, by the Repl. that the Def. allegeth nothing out of Divines, which may not as well bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the <hi>Iudges Bench,</hi> as to the <hi>Vaile of Women.</hi> Yes,

this (sayth the Rej.) that the one used in civill actions, is religious <hi>in use onely,</hi> not in state: the other used in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious actions, is religious, both in <hi>state and use</hi>; which is (saith he) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Parkers distinction. Now 1. there was no such distinction as this, alleged by the Def. out of our Divines: so that this contradicteth not that which the Repl. affirmed. 2. This distinction as it is heere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, was never used by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, or (as I thinke) by any reasonable man, before now: A circumstance used in civill actions, is religious in <hi>use</hi>; the like used in religious actions is religious in <hi>use and state.</hi> Is the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>O wize Religious in use,</hi> because, or as it is used <hi>in civill</hi> actions?

                  <p n="7">7. The Def. his third demand was, whether these Ceremonies of covering, and uncovering, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to bee observed in Gods publike worship? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was given (by the Repl.) that this indeed was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in every grave meeting of men and women: but not primarily, and principally instituted for Gods worship. Paul surely did not institute them for new Ceremonies, but onely urged the Corinthians, not to neglect them, as being naturall. The Rej. opposeth 1. that <hi>requiring is an institution.</hi> As if the Kings requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his subjects to observe Christs institutions, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore institute the Sacraments, &amp;c. 2.

also but <hi>probable,</hi> it may faile, with all that is built vpon it. <hi>3. Chamier</hi> (in the place fore-mentioned) answereth Bellarmine about it, that it must either include the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time (whose history is in Scripture) and so the humane Ceremonies come not within the compasse of it; or else it may bee denied as false. 4. If this rule bee good, then <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Ceremonies cannot be knowne from other, but onely by those who know certainely what is and hath beene allwayes observed in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: which will fall hard upon most Christians. 5.

                  <p n="4">4.

The contrary whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, partly by the fore-mentioned place of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, where hee complaineth of the Ceremonies which he practised, as disagreeing from the Doctrine of the Gospell which he taught. Beside, (because <hi>proper worship</hi> hath beene discussed in its proper place) it would be inquired, what the Rej. meaneth by <hi>necessary doctrine?</hi> If he meaneth onely that doctrine which is absolutely necessary to salvation, it is a poore commendation of Scripture-perfection: because that is found in every good Catechisme; and Bellarmine himselfe doth not denie that perfection to Scripture.

But the trueth is, he spake there for excessive commendation of our English-Church-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so, in comparison, depressed the Primitive; and heere he seeketh to defend our Ceremonies, by theirs, and so extolleth their judgement of Ceremonies; in both places (according to occasion) exceeding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. A great matter is made of that which the Replier said, concerning 1500. yeares experience of humane significant Ceremonies.

From
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:245:332"/>
the primitive times by the space of <hi>sixe hundred</hi> yeares, the Church generally erred, in giving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto infants, as <hi>D. Morton</hi> sheweth (Prot. Apol. l. 2. cap. 25. sect. 10.) and after that for many hundred yeares, it mended (for the common course of errors) as soure ale doth in Sommer. 5. The Rej. cannot name any Church in all that time free from errors: neither can he denie, but the Church that erreth in doctrine, may erre in Ceremonies. Ergo. 6. Hee was unhappie in mentioning <hi>Montanus</hi> his spirit, which breathed, and broached so many humane Ceremonies, that the Church hath ever since beene more wronged thereby, in Ceremonies, then in any other respect, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirit of that time, as all men know, that have read those writings of Tertullian, which were dictated by a piece of <hi>Montanus his spirit.

                  <p n="2">2. The Repl. taking from the Def. this proposition: <hi>Nothing is properly called a Ceremony, if it bee altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of signification</hi>; sayth that this convinceth not us at all: because, if this be true, then our tenet is, that all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies properly so called, <hi>of mans invention,</hi> should be packed out of the Church. <hi>What?</hi> (sayth the Rej.) <hi>even Sitting at the Communion, and a communion-Table?</hi> Yea, say we, even these if they can be prooved to bee Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

of <hi>mans invention.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. From the former consideration, the Defen. was challenged, for having gone about to deceive us, often times before, by confounding all circumstances of order and decency, with properly called Ceremonies; whereas now, in the winding up of all, he confesseth, that they cannot be properly called Ceremonies, except they be significant. The Rejoynder his answere is, that all such circumstances are <hi>some way</hi> significant, though not <hi>symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically</hi>: because they signifie <hi>some way what is to be done,</hi> or where, or when, or why, or how. Now though every circumstance doeth some way argue that whereof it is a circumstance, and so in a large sense may bee called a signe of it; yet 1. every circumstance is not a signe of <hi>what is to be done:</hi> because some have no place, untill the thing be done. 2. Both the Def. and Rej. have hitherto confounded <hi>indicant and symbolicall</hi> signes, except onely one place, where (for a shift) the Rej. sayth, <hi>Beza, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in phraze from other Divines, meaneth by Symbolicall, Sacramentall signes, pag. 264.265.</hi> Heere therefore to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them, is to confesse their former dealing not faire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>If all circumstances belonging to time, place, person, instruments or manner of actions sacred, be sacred significant Ceremonies</hi>; then not the Clocke onely, but the leaden weights of it, not the ground onely upon which men stand in worship, but the <hi>Rushes</hi> also strowed by occasion upon it, or the <hi>Besome</hi> wherewith it is swept; not the Preachers <hi>voyce</hi> onely, but his black <hi>Cap,</hi> his comely <hi>heard</hi>; not the Communion <hi>Table-clothe</hi> onely, but the

                  </p>
                  <p>See what an argument the Def. made against us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rej. his explication: If Signes <hi>Indicant</hi> that is, such as by the nature of the things themselves, without any religious signification put upon them by institution, are lawfull; then <hi>Symbolicall</hi> signes, that is, those which teach a spirituall duty, by their mysticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted signification, cannot be unlawfull. In striving to helpe the Def. out of the water, hee hath sunke, and followed him deeper in, then before he seemed to bee plunged.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 1. About the forming of this argument, and the generall answer given thereto.</head>
                  <p>IN the former Argument as being most essentiall, I suffered my pen to run a larger course, then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning I intended. Heere I purpose to hold it shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Passing over therefore by-matters,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Argument was thus propounded in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement: <hi>It is contrary to Gods word, to use (much more to command the use of) such Ceremonies in the worship of God as man hath devized, if they bee notoriously knowne, to have beene of olde, and still to be abused unto Idolatrie, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, by the Papists, especially, if the same be now of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use in the Church. But our Ceremonies are such. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Def. his answer was so set downe, that (by the Rej. his owne confession) no sense could be discerned in it. But the said Rej. (after three patchings of the words, and the distinctions, about <hi>abolishing, abused,</hi> and <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) bringeth, for account, this answer, out of all: If by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:245:337"/>
                     <hi>abolition,</hi> be meant, <hi>Abscission,</hi> and not <hi>Cure,</hi> the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition being meant of things <hi>indifferent,</hi> is false. But if in the exception, of things, <hi>necessary,</hi> be meant not an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> but a <hi>convenient necessitie,</hi> the Assumption is false, which sayth: that our Ceremonies are of no <hi>necessary</hi> use in the Church. Heere we have three distinctions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 1. <hi>abscission,</hi> or cutting off, and <hi>curing</hi>; 2. things <hi>evill</hi> in their nature, and <hi>indifferent</hi>: 3. necessity <hi>absolute,</hi> and <hi>convenient.</hi> Now 1. see how they agree among themselves: In the first, the Ceremonies are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as <hi>members</hi> of our Religion, or worship, which must be eyther <hi>cut off or cured</hi> (for so the Def. explaineth it of <hi>cutting off the members by the joynts)</hi> whereas they were never members joynted to our religion, or worship, but to the Harlot of Rome. In the second, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as no members, but things <hi>indifferent</hi>; and in the third (at the best) onely <hi>convenient.</hi> 2. For the first, it is well knowne that they are <hi>cloutes,</hi> which have lien vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plague-soares of Idolaters, many hundreds of yeares: and what wise Physition, or Surgeon, was ever knowne, to goe about the curing of such clouts? 3. For the second, it is a meere affectation of casting a myst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Readers eyes. For both the Def. and Rei. knew well, that the Authors of this Argument, holde our Ceremonies not indifferent, but <hi>unlawfull</hi> in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet upon supposed <hi>indifferency,</hi> undertake to make good their Proposition; as having all sense on their side, namely, that things otherwise meerely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, receive some difference, by their notorious abuse to Idolatry. 4. For the last, The Ceremonies are heere,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:245:338"/>
onely in a blinde distinction, (as it were in a <hi>parenthesis</hi>) affirmed to be of <hi>convenient use in our Church.</hi> Now let any man consider of this dealing, whether it be not more necessary for the Def. and Rej. then convenient for the Reader. In the Abridgement, pag. 42. and 43. &amp;c. it is largely prooved, that these Ceremonies in controversie, are <hi>not convenient.</hi> The Def. (professing a full answer to all that is objected) giveth no answere to any thing there alleged to that purpose. When he was challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Repl. for not <hi>shewing them convenient,</hi> the Rej. pag. 167. accuseth him of more <hi>impudencie,</hi> then hee would have expected from any <hi>Friar,</hi> and yet directeth us not to the place, where he hath gone about any such matter. The Rej. himselfe, undertaking to manifest their <hi>conveniencie</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> of Gods Word, suddenly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth off, pag. 74. and referreth that demonstration <hi>to a fitter place</hi>: which place hitherto he could not finde, nor ever will. Beside, the Rej. confesseth, a multitude of <hi>godly learned men,</hi> (among whom were) <hi>Calvin, Beza, Martyr, Bucer, Hooper, Iewel, Fulke, Rainolds, Whitakers, Humphrie, Perkins, &amp;c.</hi>) to have held our Ceremonies <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient,</hi> or <hi>inconvenient,</hi> at the least. Nay he himselfe hath beene in the same haeresie. All this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he thinketh it not significent, in one word, to say (for a shift) without any proofe or declaration, that they are <hi>convenient</hi> for our Church. <hi>Conveniency</hi> is esteemed when as a thing after the consideration of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, isfound to bring more good (at the least) then evill with it. And I dare appeale to the Rej. his owne conscience, whether our Ceremonies have beene cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:245:338"/>
or occasions of more good then evill? <hi>They may doe hurt</hi> (saith Beza) <hi>but they can doe no good. God knoweth</hi> (sayth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Foxe) <hi>they bee the cause of much blindenesse and strife among men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this (by the way) be well observed out of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall answer, that the particular answers following, in this argument, are nothing worth, but onely upon this supposition, that <hi>our Ceremonies are not onely curable and indifferent, but also convenient for our Church:</hi> which ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Def. nor Rej. nor any for them, will ever bee able with any shew of reason, and honestie, to demonstrate, while the world standeth. So that this whole fourth Argument is heere in the first section, sufficiently yeelded, For all that we desire, is plainely granted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the unlawfulnesse of all such human Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Gods worship, as are notoriously knowne to have beene and be abused unto Idolatry and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they bee now of no <hi>convenient necessary use in the Church.</hi>

doeth unto that which is carnall. This the Def. passed by in silence; and therein is defended by the Rej. because, according to his method, in one particular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he taketh knowledge of it, par, 2. c. 2. s. 2. As if <hi>Iohn a-Stiles</hi> his plea, for 3. akers of ground, were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently answered by <hi>Iohn a-Noxe,</hi> if he cold with any shew ward it off from 1. aker. His owne answer is, that <hi>as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandement doeth not forbid the use of all such things, as accidentally doe, or may provoke some men to base uncleannesse; but onely such, as in and of themselves, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king incitements thereto; so neither doeth the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement forbid the use of all such things, as the lust of some I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters may turne to spirituall fornication; but onely of such, as have in themselves, or in such use of them, an habitude, or aptnesse, to provoke thereto.</hi> But 1. Our Divines gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally teach (as Zanchy de Red. lib. 1. cap. 14. briefely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth their meaning) <hi>The summe of the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, that in the worship of God, or Ceremonies therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, wee are to devise nothing of our owne braine, or borrow ought of Heathenish idolatrous rites.</hi>

                     </note> 2. Let this be so: the question yet remaineth; whether our Ceremonies, the Crosse (for example) hath not some <hi>habitude, and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> to provoke towards Idolatry? I thinke it will not be denied, but the Crosse is an Idol, at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Calis,</hi> and among the Papists, in England. Now suppose a knowne harlot to be brought out of the Stues at <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Calis,</hi> unto <hi>Dover,</hi> and lodged there in an honest mans bed, or bed-chamber (as the Crosse is in the bed of our Religion, the holy Sacrament) would any man say, that there were no <hi>habitude</hi> nor <hi>aptnesse,</hi> in such a harlot, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:245:342"/>
her lodging, to provoke, even an honest man, and much more, a dissolute companion, unto filthy folly? Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I know none; but onely that the spirituall folly may be more secretly, and mystically provoked, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, then carnall can. The Rej. should have done well, if hee had given us a certaine rule, whereby wee might have distinguished, betwixt those monuments, or reliques of Idolatry, which have an <hi>habitude or aptnesse</hi> in them to provoke unto Idolatry, and those which have not. For then more might have beene said therefrom, eyther for, or against our Ceremonies. Now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell where to take holde, saving onely in this; that <hi>habitude and aptnesse of provoking,</hi> towards Idolatry, is in every consenting relation that any Ceremony (otherwise unnecessary) hath to any Idol: and all such relation of our Ceremonies to Idols cannot be denied: neither can their necessity to true Religion be with any shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or honesty, mainteyned. Beside, what jealous or wise husband, if his wife should receive any thing from a knowne adulterer, who hath also gone about to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne her honesty, and keepe it alwayes in her bosome, would take this for a sufficient excuse; that such a thing hath not in it selfe any <hi>habitude</hi> or <hi>aptnesse</hi> of prouoking unto Adultery? And doeth not God tell us, that hee is in like sort, <hi>a Iealous God</hi>? From hence it is, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Calvins grave collection, on Lev. 19.27. was by the Replier alleged, which thus soundeth, according to the Rej. his owne emendation of the translation: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though rounding, or cutting the hair, was in it self indifferent, yet God would not have it indifferent to his people that they as

litle children, might learne by small rudiments, that they could not have his favour, unlesse they should be unlike to the aliens, and uncircumcised, &amp; be altogether and farr different from their examples, especially in those Rites wherin religion was shewed.</hi> The Rej. answereth 1. that <hi>the cause of this restraint, was the Iews childlike estate, by Calvins owne words.</hi> But Calvins meaning is removed from the right center. For that he meant not to exclude our age, he sheweth in the next words: <hi>Experientia docet, &amp;c. Experience doeth</hi> (not did) <hi>teache.</hi> And this <hi>childlike</hi> estate was the cause (according to him and truth) not of the doctrine taught, concerning unlikenesse unto Idolaters, but of the manner, or meanes, wherin it was taught, namely, by absteyning from that fashion of hair, and beards, which Idolaters used. God teacheth us to teache our <hi>children,</hi> agreablie to their age, not that afterward they should forget, that which was taught them, but that they may remember what they were then taught, and <hi>not depart from it, when they are olde. Prov.</hi> 22.6. And did he give us a contrarie example? The praecepts given in the Churches minoritie, are her direction (by proportion) in her ripest years.

Surely, I should thinke, if the common sort ofGods people might not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion themselves then to Idolaters, then neyther now our Ministers: if not then in a matter of passion, muche lesse now in actions pertayning to Gods worship: if not then in a tuft of hayr, much lesse now in a Ministring garment, a Ceremonie consecrating us and our children to Christ, and a solemne manner of receyving him in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:245:345"/>
his mysteries. The difference of child-hood, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age, may teache us, that we should not look for suche particular warnings now what thinges of Idolaters we are to shunne, as were given in the Churches infancie, but make use of them; being now also generally war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flie from all Idolatrie, &amp; that in the same formes of speache which then were used. 2. He answereth, that <hi>It pleased God to set up a partition-wall betwixt Iews and Gentiles, in thinges otherwise lawfull.</hi> Whiche is very true: but among those thinges, otherwise <hi>lawfull</hi> (as Calvin clearly insinuateth) <hi>Rites of human invention, wherin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was shewed,</hi> had no place. 3. The Rej. addeth, that neyther <hi>Calvin,</hi> ever affirmed, nor any <hi>learned and advised man,</hi> dare affirme, that <hi>no conformitie with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in any Rites, abused by them to Idolatrous superstition, is lawfull to be used of Gods people in his service.</hi> To which I answer 1. that if he taketh <hi>any Rites</hi> so largely, that among them he reckoneth Gods ordinances, then he sayth nothing but truth, and yet nothing to the purpose. For the quaestion is, of <hi>Rites devized by man, not necessarie in the Churche:</hi> as may be seen in the termes of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, expressed in the Abrigement, though in part o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Def. which omission was so approved by the Rej. that he accuseth the Repl. of wrong-doeing for mending it. Pag. 404. We see now for what advantage. 2. If we may have leave to put in that part of the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as it standeth in our Argument <hi>(Rites devized by man, not necessarie</hi>) then hear Calvins and some other learned and advized mans judgement.<note place="margin">

                  <p>HEere nothing is handled but Daniels example, Dan. 1.8. Neither doeth the Rejoynder adde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the Defendant, but onely, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels forbearance of the Kings meat, was grounded on speciall ceremoniall injunctions of God, and not upon our morall rule, that the abuse had made the use unlawfull; nor was this a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in Gods worship.</hi> To which I answer <hi>1.</hi> that our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is also grounded on the <hi>equitie</hi> of Ceremoniall injunctions, and that equity is our morall rule.</p>

                        </gap>out any delay, and with great authority.</hi> And the same Doctor Abbot confesseth, the force of this consequence from Hezekias his example, to make against such private use of the Crosse, <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the ancient Christians had of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What then but <hi>the time,</hi> did hinder that good and learned man, from seeing that it maketh much more against the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like use of the same Crosse in Baptisme? <hi>I</hi> never yet could meet with that Papist, which denied the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: <hi>The brazen Serpent (having beene Gods owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) was for Idolatrous abuse, to be abolished.

                  <p n="2">2. The Def. gave five reasons for Hezekias his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Serpent. To which it was replied, that no man doubteth, but Hezekias had reasons, more then five, for that he did: and that the like may be alleged for abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of our Ceremonies. <hi>This</hi> last (saith the Rej.) <hi>should have beene shewed.</hi> So it is (say I) in the following dispute.</p>
                  <p>Let them (addeth the Replier) be abolished by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authority, and <hi>I</hi> will undertake, reasons to justifie the action done, will easily be acknowledged, even of those that now can see none to perswade unto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. <hi>Like enough</hi>; (answereth the Rej.) <hi>and well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:</hi> because <hi>it is lawfull, and just to abolish them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.</hi> Now let this be well noted. In the generall answer to this Argument, it was pleaded (pag. 406.) that Ceremonies abused to Idolatry are to be abolished, if they be not <hi>conveniently necessary.</hi> Heere our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies so abused, are confessed to be such, as that, if they were once abolished by publike authority, reasons could easily be found to proove them <hi>justly abolished as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi> So that nothing but publike authority, doth make them <hi>justifiable,</hi> or free from such <hi>inconvenience</hi> as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and requireth the <hi>abolishing</hi> of them. And who can conceive such a vertue in publike authority, as to make that morally <hi>convenient</hi> which before was <hi>inconvenient</hi>? or to make reasons forceable, for justifying an action <hi>done</hi>; which are not forceable for justifying the same, as <hi>to be doen?</hi> Our cause by this confession, wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but one <hi>Fiat,</hi> or act of publike authority, to make it justifiable; so farre at least, as concerneth this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

whether the Ceremonies are to be abolished or no?</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="6">6. The Defender in fine, noted two disparities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the brasen Serpent, and our Ceremonies: 1. That the Idolatrie of the Iews about that was publicke, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in the same Churche; which is not so with our Ceremonies. 2. That ther was no other meanes to cure the Idolatrie of those times; as now ther is. To the former it was answered 1. that these circumstances are not rendred as reasons of abolishing the brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, in the Text, but invented by the Def. <hi>True</hi> (saith the Rej.) <hi>yet any man may conceive that they might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> But for <hi>generality,</hi> I cannot conceive how it can be prooved: and the <hi>publike</hi> abuse, though it might be a reason, yet not such a one, as that with it, abolishing should be used, or suspended. But our Ceremonies (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Rej.) must in comparison be likened <hi>to the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent used well, at Ierusalem; which ought not to have beene abolished, for such another in relation to that, set up at Bethel, and made an Idol.</hi> Wherein he mistaketh much, For first our Ceremonies were never good, or well used.

them. 3. It may be very well questioned, whether the serpent at Ierusalem, considered as no way commanded of God, should not have beene abolished, if the ten Tribes should have taken occasion by it of Idolatry? It was answered 2. that <hi>private idolatry</hi> is also to be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as well as publike. That cannot be <hi>de facto,</hi> saith the Rejoynder. Yet thus farre it may be very well <hi>de facto,</hi> that nothing be used in publike, which is knowne to nourish idolatry in private. It was answered 3. That all these circumstances did more then agree to our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, in the beginning of our reformation. To this it is rejoyned 1. that <hi>our Ceremonies were never the object of grosse idolatry</hi>: which he would not have said, if he had thought of the Crosse, or that the proper <hi>meanes</hi> of idolatry are as well to be abolished, as the <hi>objects.</hi> The 2. rejoynder is, that though they ought to have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved; in the beginning of reformation, yet now not: which is as if a debter should pleade, that he owed indeed so much money to his creditour long agoe, but now (though it hath beene every yeare called for) he is quit by deferring the payment.

Yet all this doth not hinder, but divers corruptions may be found among us, which were not knowne in the first primitive ages. Nay let it be marked well, how strange an asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made up by this reckoning of the Rejoynders! <hi>In Hezekias time</hi> (saith the Defendant) <hi>the idolatry about the Serpent, could not be cured but by abolishing the Serpent: but

in our most truely reformed Church, which doth most lively expresse the face and full body of her Primitive Mother-Church, this disease would be found curable without any such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The meaning is according to the Rejoynder his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: <hi>the disease of idolatry is more easily cured, in that Church, which doeth lively expresse the face, and full body, of those Churches, which were infected with many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and declining in many things, to superstition, then in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekias Church, most purely at that time reformed.</hi> Surely the Rej. in a great part of his glosse, forgot his text: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would never have in this manner confuted it.</p>

Questioning before Synods, about Ecclesiasticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, is of Ecclesiasticall nature; going to law, not so. In Synods all things ought to be determined by Gods Word: at the Kings Bench, and Assizes, the Iudges pronounce sentence by mans law. Yet the good anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bishops, were so farre from seeking a title to their places, by Synodicall judgement, that they withdrew themselves, as being afraid to have such a title put vpon them, either by Churches or Synods: examples of which modesty, we have even in declining times, <hi>Basil, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp;c.</hi> A <hi>law</hi> we finde also (Cod. de Epist. &amp; Cler.) mentioning the same disposition:<note place="margin">

This answer is as much as to say, our Church hath a speciall wound, or sore in her face, which the Primitive Church had not; and therefore must have a plaister upon it now, in those times unknowne: that is, our face doth not <hi>lively represent that face,</hi> which is the question.

Now these the Rej. seemeth to excuse, for which they are more beholding to him, then the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are, upon whose spoyles they live, and aspiring by them unto higher places.

                     <p n="8">8. Of this, it was asked, if it were so ordinary either in the Primitive Church, or (almost) in the Popish, as it is in England?

For (to begin with the last) 1. The course taken against Simony, which he speaketh of, is no <hi>Canon</hi> of the Convocation house, but a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-law.</hi> Canons (I hope) doe not deprive Patrones of their <hi>title,</hi> which they have by civill inheritance, as the Rejoynder told us even now. 2.

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (out of Coron. milit.) was cited in the Abr. thus: We may give nothing to the service of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol; nor borrow any thing from it. If it be against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to sit at table in an Idols temple; what is it, to be seen in the habit of an Idol. The Defender answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he spake of habites then dedicated and appointed unto the service of Idols: but our Ministers are not ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to reverence the Masse-Priests brazen Idol, or to put on the <hi>very same</hi> Romish Surplice, now used at their Masse, <hi>even therfor, because it is Popish.</hi> Of this the Replier proveth, that this <hi>samenesse</hi> is <hi>vainely</hi> alleged, <hi>and lesse then nothing.</hi> The Rejoynder for succour, sayth that this <hi>individual samenesse</hi> was <hi>a stragling souldier,</hi> and confesseth it to be taken <hi>prisoner.</hi> But in an answer grounded on dissimilitude, where the same qualitie is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of one thing, and denied of another, if that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie be stragling, in eyther part, and so taken prisoner, the wholle answer must needs be held captive. And this captive souldier may easily be taught to fight against him from whome he was taken; as once (by report) it was in this manner: A Minister in Qeen. El. her days, was urged by his Ordinarie to wear the Surplice, whoe
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:245:376"/>
after other delays, alleged, that the Surplice proffered him to put on, was the <hi>very same</hi> that the Masse-Priest was wonte to sacrifice in: the Ordinarie admitting that excuse, commanded another to be made: which being doen, when it was brought him in the Church, he tooke it up, and spake thus to those praesent: Good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Bishop himself confessed, that the former mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Surplice, was not to be worne by a Minister of the Gospel; and judge you if this be not as like that, as one egge to another? let this therfor goe after the other: and so he justly c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st it away.</p>
                     <p>Yet let us see what other soldiers the Rejoynder can finde in this squadron, not stragling and taken? Ther are words set down (sayth he) in a different letter: <hi>dedicated and appointed.</hi> As if a different cassok did save a soldier from stragling! The buisinesse dependeth on him that weareth the cassok: and whoe was that soldier in the Defender his answer? or what was the thing dedicated and appointed, but the <hi>same</hi> individual habit? if <hi>other,</hi> then first shew the congruitie of the Defender his dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; and then shew also, that other <hi>Crosses,</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices</hi> are not dedicated and appointed unto the service of Idols, by Papists. <hi>The Defender also</hi> (addeth the Rej.) <hi>addes, that the comparison betwixt Papists, and Pagans is not altogether so aequal.</hi> He sayd in deed, that he would <hi>heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shew</hi> such a thing: but with soldiers promised, or threatned onely, I never knew any serious combat fought.</p>
                     <p>After this, the Rejoynder allegeth, that it <hi>cannot be sayd of these our Ceremonies, (as Tertullian sayd of the habits
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:245:377"/>
he opposed) that they were dedicated and appointed to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an Idol, from the first, and never used by any godly men.</hi> But first, this can be no good explication of those words: we may borrow <hi>nothing</hi> from an Idoll: i. e. <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which hath not been used by some godlyman.</hi> Secondly, he sayth not, that no godly man had ever used Crounes. Thirdly, Every olde usage of godly men, doeth not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the Idolatrie of it. For then sacrifizing of Oxen, should now be lesse Idolatrie, then of unclean Beasts. After these skirmishes, the Rejoynder finding that ther was no houlding of ground with such soldiers as the Defender had mustered, presseth new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And first he bringeth in one <hi>persuasion,</hi> that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> clear and professed judgement, was directly against our assertion, and for conformitie: because he sayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p n="6">6. Another place <hi>Tertullian</hi> (de oratione, cap. 11. &amp; 12.) was objected, where hee sayth, that Christians might not wash their hands (for a Ceremony) or lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their cloakes, before prayer; nor sit upon their beds, after prayer; because the Heathen used to doe so. The Def. his first answer being that these Ceremonies were not condemned <hi>meerely</hi> for resemblance with Idolatry, but for opinion of necessity; it was replied, that Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian speaketh plainely: <hi>therefore it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For then thus he should speake: not <hi>onely</hi> for resemblance, but (without any <hi>also)</hi> for opinion. If he did meane so, we say on the contrary, <hi>not onely for opinion, but also for resemblance.</hi> So farre as <hi>I</hi> can understand the word <hi>meerely for,</hi> it noteth not more, then is implied in Tertullians <hi>therefore it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth.</hi> A deserving cause is <hi>meerely</hi> a cause, or else malefactours are not punished meerely for their evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. In the former testimony, out of Tertullian, pag. 484. the Rej. translated <hi>meras utilitates, any commodious use.</hi> If <hi>meere</hi> commodities, be all one with any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, then <hi>meerely</hi> for resemblance is <hi>any thing at all</hi> for
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:245:378"/>
resemblance: and so the Def. denieth Tertullian to have condemned those Ceremonies he speaketh against, <hi>any thing at all</hi> for resemblance with Idolatry; which yet Tertullian doeth as plainely speake, as ever he spake any thing at all.</p>
                     <p>B. Iewel (said the Replier) doeth urge these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Tertullian, <hi>meerely</hi> in regard of resemblance: of <hi>others</hi> it is not needfull to speake. The Rej. answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth 1. that <hi>Iuel</hi> doeth not urge these Testimonies of Tertullian. But it is to be seene in his <hi>Def. Apol.</hi> par. 3. cap. 5. div. 1. how he citeth Tertullian <hi>de Coron. mil.</hi> and <hi>de Idol.</hi> with which the Rejoynder will not deny, this <hi>(de Orat</hi>) to consent. 2. He citeth them (addeth the Rej.) not for <hi>unlawfulnesse,</hi> but for <hi>inconveniency of resembling Idolaters.</hi> Concerning this distinction, enough hath beene said in the first part. Yet this heere is worthy of observation; that both the Def. and Rej. in the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this fourth chapter, confessed, <hi>that human Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies abused to Idolatry, are therefore unlawfull, except they be of convenient necessity, as the Rejoynder speaketh, pag. 406.</hi> What reason then had Iuel, or hath the Rejoynder in his name, to confesse such Ceremonies <hi>inconvenient,</hi> and yet make them <hi>lawfull?</hi> But that <hi>Iuel</hi> understood Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, to speake against such Ceremonies, as unlawfull, it appeareth out of these his words: <hi>Tertullian disputes sharpely therein, that a Christian may not weare a lawrell-crowne, and that for no ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The Replier added, that it doeth not appeare out of Tertullian, that he respected <hi>opinion of necessity and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> in these Ceremonies. For which, he is charged by the Rejoynder, with offence, against <hi>men, simple,</hi> and <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> as also against <hi>God</hi> himselfe. And why all this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (forsooth) Tertullian sayth, that <hi>such washings and cleansings, as many superstitiously affect, against every prayer, are not true; but those which we have in Christ, and in purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the heart.</hi> But this is no sufficient ground for so deep an accusation. For if now one should admonish a <hi>Non-resident,</hi> who sendeth a reading Curate, to supply his place, in these words: <hi>This is not true fulfilling of your Ministery; but those personall offices, which are in Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned</hi>; and the meaning of these words being questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, one should deny, that by them it was implied, that the said Non-resident held it <hi>necessary</hi> for him, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to be absent, and send such a Curate for supply; would any man accuse the denier of offending against God and man? It was further observed by the Replier, that the washing condemned by Tertullian, had relation to Christs delivering by Pilat, after washing of his hands, and so like unto our signe of the Crosse, in regard of the originall signification and use of it. The Rejoynd. answereth many words: but to the purpose (beside re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions) he sayth, that <hi>those washers did beleeve Pilat to have beene cleansed by his washing, and so themselves by theirs, from guilt of sinne.</hi> And this he gathereth from Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:245:379"/>
confutation: <hi>We adore Christ, and not deliver him: we should abhorre the example of him that did deliver him.</hi> But out of these words no such collection can be made; any more then some like invention out of these: we adore Christ, and not crucifie him: <hi>we should abhorre the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them that did crucifie him, and left a Crosse in the place, for a signe and memoriall that he was crucified.</hi> That wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a signe immediatly of Pilats washing, and so of Christs delivering: our Crosse is immediately a signe of Pilats Crosse, and so of our Saviours crucifying. This is the likenesse which the Replier truely noted.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Ceremony of <hi>Dossing cloakes,</hi> before prayer, the Defender put it off to <hi>opinion of necessity</hi>; because Tertullian in condemning it, hath these words: <hi>si sic oporteret,</hi> i. e. <hi>if it must be.</hi> It was replied, that our Prelates say also of our Ceremonies, <hi>sic oportet.</hi> i.e. <hi>It must be so,</hi> and yet disclaime absolute necessity. But (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth the Rejoynd.) they held an <hi>internall simple ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of conscience; not externall onely for order sake, as our Prelates doe.</hi> Of this distinction, see the first part of this <hi>Suite.</hi> The collection of this opinion, from Tertullians <hi>scoffe; nisi si qui putant, except there be any so foolish as to have such an opinion</hi> is so palpably vaine, that any man may see, he durst not impute that opinion unto those washers he spake against; but onely sheweth, that from their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, such a fond and absurd opinion, which themselves would condemne, might perhaps by some be collected, Tertullian spake, as we now speake. <hi>If Crossing ought to be used in Baptisme, the Apostles in their doctrine concerning baptizing would have made some mention of it: except perhaps
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:245:380"/>
some thinke, that they did not then know, or cared not to use, the right or best way of signifying Christian valour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, in fighting under Christs banner.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Melchiades</hi> decreed, that no Christian should fast on the Lords day, or friday, <hi>because it was a knowen cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Pagans,</hi> to fast on those days.</p>
                     <p>The Rejoynder 1. sayth one answer was, <hi>the incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fasting unto the Lords day.</hi> But this not being fetched out of <hi>Melchiades,</hi> the Replier justly passed by, and so will I, though enough may be sayd against it, as the Reader may see in the <hi>Altar of Damascus, pag. 669. &amp;c.</hi> 2. He telleth us also of another answer, by a distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>a light Ceremonie, and a sacred solemnitie.</hi> But this neyther is in Melchiades, nor holdeth congruitie eyther with Scripture, forbidding symbolizing with Idolaters in <hi>light Ceremonies</hi>; nor with it self, the light Ceremonie being <hi>sacred,</hi> and also a <hi>solemnitie.</hi> 3. The Rejoynder ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of his owne store, that the prohibition was onely of <hi>open and solemne fasting, not appointed by the Church.</hi> Which is as wreched an evasion, as the former: because the quaestion is of open and solemne Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:245:381"/>
and Melchiades disalowed that any Church should appoint it, in condemning the thing without any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or limitation, for a reason, that layeth more fault upon the Churches, if they should appoint it, then upon privat persons, if they should observe it without appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he groundeth his condemnation upon 2. Cor. 6. <hi>What concord hath Christ with Belial? What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> May the Temple of God have agreement with Idols, in Ceremonies, if the Church appoint so? 4. The Rejoynder addeth a note out of a later Councel, being a Iurie of twelve Bishops, wherin other phrases are used. Much good might it doe them that can make any thing of it.</p>
                     <p>The passage being thus cleared, let us now come to that which the Replier tooke for the Def. his onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: Melchiades for bad fasting at the same time with Pagans, <hi>because they lived in the same Countrie, at the same time, and place.</hi> This (sayd the Replier) could not make the difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because so litle a distance may be betwixt one Countrie, and another, that it can bring up no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of moment. The Rejoynder answereth 1. that it was a reason of <hi>inconvenience onely.</hi> But Melchiades sayd out of 2. Cor. 6. that it was to make <hi>the Temple of God agree with Idols.</hi> Is that onely <hi>inconvenient, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</hi> And if it were nothing but inconveniencie, was it not confessed, in the beginning of this Chapter, that Ceremonies Idolatrously abused, if they be not of <hi>convenient necessitie,</hi> are unlawfull? If this be so, then much more unlawful are they, if they be <hi>inconvenient.</hi> He addeth 2. that <hi>some place &amp; time may make a difference:</hi>
                        <pb n="445" facs="tcp:245:381"/>
which the Replier denied not; but onely sayd, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very distance of Countrie (such as is betwixt <hi>Dover and Calise,</hi> is not sufficient.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Ambrose</hi> taught <hi>Monica, Augustines</hi> mother, to leave bringing of Wine and Cakes to Churche, because it had a shew of conformitie with the Gentiles funeral-feasts. The Defender answered, that <hi>it was an act of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, &amp;c.</hi> as Bellarmine doeth, <hi>de Sanctor. Beat. lib. 1. cap. 14.</hi> Nay sayth the Rejoynder Bellarmine neyther so answered, nor had occasion so to answer. But if he had considered, that the Defender maketh this fact of Monicas, to be a sacrifice, derived from the <hi>Collyridian haereticks</hi>; and that Bellarmine there answereth to the argument taken out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> against those Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, as may appear by comparison of cap. 11. in the ende; and that in the objection, ther is no mention of <hi>sacrificing,</hi> but Bellarmin answereth by covert of that terme; he would have forborne this censure.</p>
                     <p>It was also pronounced an incredible thing, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines religious mother, should then sacrifice to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Papists now will nor professe to doe. To this the Rejoynder is, that <hi>the Defender never sayd Monica did sacrifice.</hi> Consider therfor his words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by the Rejoynder pag. 501. <hi>The act</hi> (objected) <hi>was sacrificing: You compare our Ceremonies, with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for his denial, such as they be: <hi>1. Augustine sayth his Mothers intention was good. 2. It was usual in Africa. 3. He thought that his Mother would not have been so taken-off from that custome by any beside Ambrose. 4. Ambrose did onely restrayne Monicas privat devotion, as having publickly forbidden that manner, for a double inconveniencie, not for unlawfulnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the first of these reasons import, that Augustin condemned nothing that was doen of a good intention. The second implieth, that he condemned nothing that was usual in Africa. The third supposeth, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are not more easily drawn from unlawful cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, by one man, then by another. The fourth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth first it self, conjoyning the <hi>restrayning onely of privat devotion, with publick forbidding</hi>; and secondly, the Defender and Replier whoe (in the beginning of this chapter) confesse Ceremonies Idolatrously abused,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:245:382"/>
to become unlawfull, except they be of <hi>convenient neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>; and so much more, if they have <hi>a double inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> in them. The rest of this section doeth onely jarre upon the same strings.</p>

But it is not so as the Rejoynder imagineth. For <hi>1.</hi> Augustine spake of them, which were present at feasts, made at the solemnity of the <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Patron</hi> of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, whom those Christians, he reprooveth, denied to be an Idol. 2. All the Citizens of Carthage could not celebrate that feast in one Temple. 3. It doeth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the Patrone had any proper Temple. 4. The Citizens being parted into divers places of feasting, why might not the Christians that would keepe that feast, have one place apart? <hi>5.</hi> Suppose the Christians had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some part of the Banket, or made one like it, and carried it into their owne Temple, to use it there, with another opinion then the Heathen had; would Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine have allowed it; 6. The case was at Carthage, as it was in Popish times, with the Company of Smithes at
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:245:383"/>
London, who after some worship done to their Patron, <hi>Dunstan,</hi> had a Feast in their Hall. Now if some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants refusing to be at their worship in Dunstans Church should yet have beene at their Feast in the Hall. I would know, whether they had more symbolized with Papists, in the worship of Dunstan, then our Conformists doe in the worship of the Crosse?</p>
                     <p>That which is after added by the Rejoynder out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Augustine, concerne not our present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: because there Augustine considereth not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto idolatrous abuse. Neither by citing one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule of Augustines, did we binde our selves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all his counsels.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Concerning the Councels of Nice forbidding Easter to be kept on the same day with the Iewes Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Rejoynder maketh long worke, to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. 1. He sayth (with the Defendant) that it was not for <hi>unlawfulnesse.</hi> 2. He confirmeth that answer, by a story of the businesse, marking, that the Councell said about Easter, onely, <hi>It seemed good to us.</hi> 3. He excepteth against the <hi>words,</hi> as they are cited in the Abridgement. And so spendeth many good words, and phrazes, not requiring any confutation. Now. <hi>1.</hi> Concerning the words, as they are found in constantines letters patents, they were cleared before, cap. 3. sect. 6.2. The same, or like forme of words, is used in the same Councell about things unlawfull, though not so desperately evill, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Faith. 3. The succeeding practises, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, doe shew, that <hi>unlawfullnesse</hi> was understood. For presently after, those which kept <hi>Easter</hi> with the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:245:383"/>
Iewes, were accounted a sort of Heretickes, styled <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadecimani.</hi> And what ruffeling, <hi>Augustine</hi> sent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by <hi>Gregorie,</hi> made against the ancient Britons, for dissenting in that observance, after, and out of other stories, Mr. Foxe doeth at large relate. But for such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I leave them (with the Replier) to those that are skilfull in human traditions; not regarding that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rejoynders. <hi>If you bee not skilfull in human traditions, you may hazzard your selves and others:</hi> because I doubt not, but skill in Gods word alone, is sufficient against all such hazzard.</p>
                     <p>The reasons rendred by the Defendant, for the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene prohibition of keeping Easter as the Iewes, are three: 1. Hatred of the Iewes. 2. Because of the Iewes insultations. 3. For uniformity. Of the last, it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that <hi>uniformity</hi> might have beene, if all could have beene drawne to the same time with the Iewes. Which the Rejoynder confesseth to be true, if they could have beene drawne thereto <hi>as well.</hi> Where <hi>1.</hi> He taketh it for granted, that all were <hi>well drawne</hi> to the time deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; the contrary whereof appeareth, as in others, so in our ancient <hi>Britons.</hi> 2. <hi>Well</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> that is, easily or hardly, these make no difference in uniformity, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the meanes of accomplishing the same. The other two reasons are sayd by the Replier, to agree unto our Ceremonies; because we are to <hi>hate</hi> the Idolatrous su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions of the Papists, with <hi>a perfect hatred</hi>; and the Papists insult over us, for borrowing our Ceremonies from them. About this (because it could not be denied) the Rejoynder spendeth many words and phrazes, partly
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:245:384"/>
Rhetorically good, and partly Morally not good; which I leave as I found: because there is no doing with them, but in greate leisure, or in idle time.</p>
                     <p>In the conclusion, it was asked by the Replier, for what causes many other Ceremonies of the Papists were abolished, if not for these two last named? or if the same causes that abolished them, would notsweep away these, if it pleased them who have the beezoms in their hand? About this the Rejoynder first, referreth the Reader to a preface set before the Service-booke, and I am contented he should seeke if he can finde any such reasons there. Secondly, he addeth, that <hi>wee which have not the bezome in our hands, should not shuffle abroad the dust with our feete.</hi> No more doe we (say I) but onely keepe it out of our eyes, and throates, so well as we can, giving reasons, why the Sweepers should not thrust it upon us, nor us for it out of the doores</p>
                     <p n="11">11. About the <hi>Gangren</hi> forbidding fasting upon the Lords-Day, many words are spent by the Rejoynder. The summe is, that <hi>such fasting is there spoken of, as was performed out of an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>reticall opinion, either of necessity so to doe, or of contempt of the Lords-Day.</hi> But this cannot be prooved. For there being divers different editions of that Councell, none of them mention <hi>opinion of necessity</hi>: and in the ordinary greek copy, there is neither <hi>contempt,</hi> nor <hi>contumacy,</hi> named, as <hi>Binius</hi> noteth. Beside, <hi>opinions and contempts,</hi> as they are inward, cannot be noted by the Church. If they were outward, in word; then not so much the <hi>fasting upon opinion,</hi> as the opinion it selfe, was to be condemned. If the act it selfe was taken for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:245:384"/>
of such an opinion, that is it which we urge As for that accusation which is layd upon the Replier, for relating the Defendant his answer, so as if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the matter unto <hi>contempt of Christian profession,</hi> that is remooved by the Defendant his owne words, related by the Rejoynder, pag. 521. <hi>Contempt, to wit, of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession.</hi> See before, in <hi>Melchiades</hi> his decree.</p>

They that forbad it, held it not lawfull to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as our Ceremonies are. 2. Inexpediencie, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Ceremonies notoriously knowne to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrously abused, maketh them <hi>unlawfull,</hi> by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and Rejoynder their owne confessions, in the first section of this chapter: where <hi>convenient necessity</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to make them lawfull.</p>

Thirdly, he speaketh of such thinges as are to be <hi>detested as much as is possible:</hi> are they lawfull? 2. The Rejoynder addeth, that <hi>Musculus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of such human traditions, as had been formerly under abuse, but were now reduced to another use.</hi> In which wordes, (if they be right printed) he maketh Musculus to speake as directly against our Ceremonies, according to his owne interpretation, as the Abrigement doeth. If <hi>not</hi> be left out by the Printer, then he may be convinced by those words of Musculus: <hi>so much as a shew of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But (sayth he) <hi>our Ceremonies considered as Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, (otherwise then in their materials) have no outward shew of Popish superstition, which consisteth onely in the reason and intention of their use.</hi> As if eyther <hi>outward shew,</hi> or <hi>outward superstition,</hi> consisted <hi>onely</hi> in inward inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:245:389"/>
Such miserable answers have at the least, an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of no syncere intention. His 3. answer is, that <hi>Musculus speaketh of such traditions as in their praesent, and publick professed use were Popish.</hi> He doeth not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed exclude such out of his censure: but if he spake <hi>onely</hi> of such, what need was ther, that he should so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully interpret <hi>what he called Popish traditions</hi>? or what meant he in his description of them, to leave out <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent publick professed use,</hi> and use such wordes, as every ordinary impartial Reader must needs take to be more general?</p>

                     <p>The same <hi>P.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:245:390"/>
ever since remayned in diverse Churches, and are now (for countenance of other Ceremonies) comming up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine where they were abolished, with an Idolatrous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of bowing unto them. <hi>Crucifixes</hi> will soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that by good right, if the Defender and Rejo. their groundes be good. For the doctrine being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the materials onely of Popish Crucifixes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what can be sayd, to make them <hi>simplie unlawfull</hi>? And for their <hi>conveniencie,</hi> whoe may judge of that, but those that have authoritie of praescribing and imposing matters of order and decencie? But to let that passe, P. Martyr spoke of that time, when he supposed the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine reformed; and manifestly riseth in his discourse, from those specials, to the general to <hi>all footsteps of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,</hi> and not <hi>those onely.</hi> But (sayth the Rejoynder) the same P. Martyr professeth, <hi>no separation would be made for such matters.</hi> He sayth so in deed of the Surplice, pag. 1127. and so say we; especialy upon the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we may be suffered to abrogate them for our owne practise: <hi>Ferremus, nobis gratulando quod eas abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verimus.</hi> To this the Rejoynder addeth diverse senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of P. Martyrs, somewhat favoring a toleration (for a time) of our Ceremonies, especialy in M. Hoopers case. To which I answer 1. that this was in perplexitie, caused by the mischief of our Ceremonies, which are therfor so much the more to be hated, even that they have allways bred such trouble unto good men, whoe should have troubles enough,<note place="margin">

hath been shewed.</hi> Namely that it was contrarie to all such Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>And this doeth abundantly appear out of his Epist. to <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> printed before, in English. 3. <hi>Zepper alloweth the ancient use of the Surplice.</hi> If he did, therin he should not have crossed his rule given, cap. 10. reg. 4. out of the Scriptures, at least in his opinion, except he judged the Surplice <hi>before that ancient use</hi> to have been notoriously abused unto Idolatrie. But the trueth is, Zepper doeth but comparatively excuse a supposed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient use of that garment, which in ancient times was not knowen, but as a civil habit, usual in hote countries. 4. <hi>Wigandus</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>was Illyricus his asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat in the furious opposition of the Surplice.</hi> Wheras the trueth is, Illyricus himself did not furiously oppose, but use the Surplice, as <hi>Calvin</hi> testifieth, Epist. 117.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Sadeels</hi> words are: <hi>We reject whatsoever remayneth in the Church of Rome, which came eyther from Iews, or Pagans.</hi> The Rejoynder answereth, that <hi>Sadeel sheweth what Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies the Refor. Churches of France did reject; but not what were necessarily to be rejected of all Churches: He useth also the limitation of Iewish and Paganish Ceremonies.</hi> But he clean mistaketh Sadeels meaning: <hi>Iewish and Paganish,</hi> are no wordes of <hi>limitation,</hi> but of explication by way of reason. Our use of his testimonie is 1. thus: Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ceremonies they of France have rejected, are in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deels judgement <hi>Iewish or Heathenish,</hi> which can have no lawful use in Gods worship. But the Churches of France have rejected our Ceremonies in controversie. Ergo. 2. Thus: <hi>If Iewish and Heathenish</hi> Ceremonies are
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:245:392"/>
to be rejected; then <hi>Popish</hi> also, they being in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or kinde, Iewish, and having evermore been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously abused unto Popish Idolatrie.</p>

                        </gap>it appeareth out of divers passages, in his writings: as in his <hi>Rejonder to Martiall, art. 4. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Calfhill answereth well, that the Ceremony of the Crosse, once taken up of good intent, being growne into so horrible abuse, is justly refused of us. And art. 5. Although the elder and better age used and received the signe of the Crosse tolerably, yet considering the shamefull abuse of it, it ought now, of right and conscience, to be condemned. Martiall will none of that: for (sayth he) things good in their owne nature, must not be taken away, or condemned, for the abuse. Very true; but who will grant him, that the signe of the Crosse is good of it selfe? It is as much as may be borne, to grant it a thing indifferent.</hi> But (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>our Ceremonies Doctor Fulke hath</hi> (of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) <hi>used and defended as lawfull.</hi> Of this knowledge, for his using and defending all our Ceremonies, his writings doe constraine me (at the least) to doubt. He was once so farre of from using all, that rather then he would use the Surplice, he went out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iohns Colledge, in Cambridge, with his pupils, and hired chambers for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and them, in the towne: <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Travers</hi> is my author for this. If afterward he was bowed something by the times, unto a little use of one Ceremony, that he might in some manner, and measure, excuse: but if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>defend</hi> that, and the other Ceremonies, some
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:245:396"/>
foot-steps of that defence would be found in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as there are divers of his opposing them. The knowne trueth is, that many good men through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of the times, have beene brought to be <hi>distressed,</hi> betwixt desire of liberty in the Ministery, and hatred of superstition; so that they have sayd with the Apostle, <hi>I know not which to choose</hi>; and so afterward, have given some place unto the later. To judge their persons, it is farre from us. We onely make use of their free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distressed judgement.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Of <hi>D. Andrues, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Merbury,</hi> I have not to say: because their Catechismes I never saw. <hi>D.

His proposition is this: <hi>All Ceremonies taken from Iewes and Pagans are unlawfull.</hi> We onely adde, that Ceremonies taken from Papists, are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the like censure; because Popish superstition, or Idolatry, is no more lawfull then the other. Of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Greenham,</hi> (beside that which hath beene often confuted) the Rejoynder sayth onely, that <hi>he did not perswade men against the use of our Ceremonies; and that he was loath to be put unto the solution of that objection: weare the Surplice or preach not.</hi> In which there is nothing pertinent. For to give proportionable answers, I my selfe was present, when an honest Conformist perswaded another not to conforme: <hi>For</hi> (sayd he) <hi>though I have not strength enough to stand out, yet I would not have you that have strength, for to yeeld.

                        <pb n="475" facs="tcp:245:396"/>
This was more then not to perswade unto Conformity.

Concerning the Assumption of this fourth Argument: namely, that our Ceremonies are human devises, notoriously knowne to have beene, and still to be abused unto Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and Superstition, by the Papists, and are of no necessarie use in the Church.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THat this was the Assumption, or second part of this Argument, no man can doubt, that readeth the Proposition, or former part, set downe in the first section of this Chapter, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the processe of reason. The Defendant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was blamed, for setting downe the Assumption thus: <hi>Our Ceremonies have beene Idolatrously abused by Papists.</hi> The Rejoynder not willing to forsake him in any failing, allegeth 1. That <hi>the Defendant tooke the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

of the Assumption from the Abridgement, and others.</hi> Which might indeed have occasioned him to adde some thing unto the Abridgers assumption; but in no wise to detract any thing from it: at least, not out of them and others, to patch up a false sylogisme (the whole <hi>medium, or third argument,</hi> which was used in the proposition, not being repeted in the Assumption) which every <hi>pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the clause (<hi>of no necessary use)</hi> is no part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but <hi>an exception,</hi> answered before. sect. 1. And yet see how he contradicteth hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lfe! The Defendant answered it: but it was no part of their Argument. He answered it was a part of the Assumption: <hi>If in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of things necessary, they meane a convenient necessity, he denies their Assumption.</hi> pag. 406. Yet now he denieth that to be any part of the Assumption. The trueth is, both the Defendant and Rejoynder, were loath to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, (more then of necessity they must) with the <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient necessity of our Ceremonies,</hi> least they should evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently either wrong their consciences, or betray their cause. In the 3. place, he denieth him to have omitted these words (<hi>human inventions, or devises)</hi> saying, that the Replier hath <hi>untruely</hi> added them: because <hi>neither they, nor any like them, are in the Abridgement,</hi> pag. 26. or 27. But let him, or any other, looke once againe upon the Abridgement, in those pages, and he shall see upon the margent, these words: <hi>All the Ceremonies in question, are human inventions, &amp;c.</hi> After this, he accuseth the Repl. for not observing <hi>every word</hi> of the Abridgement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Assumption: but he could shew no sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The Defender his answer to the foresayd Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was by the Replier thus collected: <hi>These Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are eyther generally, or individually, and numerally the same, that have been abused to Idolatrie. If generally, then it hindereth not, but they may still be lawfully used, though they have been so abused: If individually, then it is not true, which is affirmed (in the Assumption) neyther doeth it follow from thence, that they must be abolished, because they have been so abused, except they be the same formally, that is, in intention and opinion of those that impose &amp; practise them.</hi> For this he is accused by the Rejoynder of <hi>doeing no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but playing a theefes part, whoe changeth coates with an honest passenger.</hi> Now for this, to spare the labor of writing out againe many lines, I desire the Reader to looke upon the Defender his wordes as they are reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Rejoynder himself, pag. 561. &amp; compare them with the Replier his <hi>summe.</hi> If he can discerne any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, let the Defender be <hi>the honest man,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier, what it pleaseth the Rejoynder to make him. No material difference is noted by the Rejoynder but onely that the Defender hath not those words (<hi>if generally, then it hindereth not, but they may still be lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y used, though they have been so abused) nor any thing which will bear such a collection.</hi> To which I oppose those words of the Def. <hi>If you take it in the generalitie, then cannot you justifie any one of your Ceremonies, belonging to Order and Decencie. For they have been some way abused.</hi> Was it not his meaning, to say, that as other Ceremonies of Order, so these in quaestion, if they be onely <hi>generally</hi> the same with those
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:245:398"/>
that have been abused, may be justified, that is, lawfully used? Let the Defender hold his owne coate: then he cannot so easily escape, without being discerned, as the Rejoynder by changing, would have him. Certainly the Replier did not the evishly take his coat from him nor had he any cause to wish eyther it to himself, or his to the Defender for any advantage that he might get by that change.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Against the foresayd answer, it was opposed, that by this meanes, <hi>any kinde</hi> of Popish, Iewish, or Heathenish Ceremonie, may come in, so ther be new particulars, and a new intention used. To which it is rejoyned, that <hi>though they be not excluded, upon that sole poynt, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been abused, yet they may, upon other just exceptions, be shut out.</hi> But the Rejoynder should have shewed those just exceptions, which remaine, after the particular matter, and the evill intention be removed. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Defender and Rejoynder their groundes, I cannot guesse, what they should be. The Rejoynder mentioneth <hi>dumbe, darke, numerous, burthensome, incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, foolish, ridiculous Ceremonies.</hi> But all these excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been discussed before: where we have shewed that all these vertues are founde in our Ceremonies, as well as in Popish, beside <hi>numerousnesse,</hi> which in this place cannot be applied to the purpose: because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was of <hi>any kinde,</hi> not of <hi>any number.

concluded, that no Popish Ceremonies are <hi>Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Heathenish</hi>: because they are not the same individually, or in particular. <hi>Not so neither</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they use Iewish Typicals; and others, as still in force by the Iewes lawes; and Pagan Rites, with the like intention.</hi> But 1. The Papists doe not use Iewish Typicals, as types of Christ yet to come; and therefore according to the Def. and Rej. their sentence, must be excused: because they holde <hi>Circumcision</hi> it selfe lawfull to Christians, pag. 285. 2. They doe not hold any Ceremoniall Iewish lawes to binde Christians. See Bellarmine, <hi>de justificatione, lib. 4. cap. 6.</hi> It is neither good, nor safe, to accuse any beyond their deserts. 3. <hi>Likenesse</hi> of intention, betwixt Pagans and Papists, is such as admitteth much dislikenesse. And such likenesse there is betwixt our Ceremonies, and Popish.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It was inquired, whether the Scripture, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conformity with Heathen Idolaters, in shaving of heads, and cutting of beards, did meane the same heads and beards onely? <hi>No</hi>: (answereth the Rejoynder) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the like in kinde was forbidden.</hi> And this is that which the Replier sought. For then by proportionable equity, <hi>Ceremonies like in kinde</hi> to Idolaters, are forbidden to Christians, at this day, and not the same particulars onely.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Because the Defendant objected, that all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Order and Decency have beene abused to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; the Rejoynder noted, that this is one advantage he maketh of leaving out of our Assumption, those limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Ceremonies devised by man, of no necessary use</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:245:399"/>
Circumstances of Order, and Decency, are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie in their kinde, and not meere devises of men; Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine himselfe being Iudge, <hi>de effect. Sacram. lib. 2. cap. 29.</hi> Vpon this the Rejoynder having little reason to oppose thereto, after some repetition of confuted shifts, commeth on with a current of words, like a flood from the hils, after a great raine, which carrieth much mud with it. For after some rouling of Circumstances <hi>in their particulars,</hi> with adding of divers, neither meere circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, nor allowed by us, as he supposeth (which make nothing to the purpose) this muddy stuffe is found in the valley: <hi>The matter comes to this issue: you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e the godly men; other reformed Churches are the Churches of Christ, All other men are Carnall, Time-servers, Formalists, that have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, no syncerity, no godly wisedome, no zeale; you are the onely men.</hi> I cannot devise, what occasion he had of this extraordinary passion, but that he was angry, to see he could not confront reason with reason. In his could blood, I dare say, he will recall these words of distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which cannot be fastened upon us, and therefore rebound upon him from whose violence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                  <p>With more shew of reason, he addeth, that <hi>for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the kinde, a Surplice in the kinde of a garment; the Crosse, in the kinde of admonition to professe the faith; and kneeling, in the kinde of a reverent gesture, are as necessary, as any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of Order, and Decency.</hi> But this comparison hath beene largely confuted in the first part of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in the heade of <hi>Ceremonies, &amp;c.</hi> Heere, it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to note, that time, place, and such like circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:245:400"/>
are so manifestly necessary in their kinde, that the particulars may be deduced from them, by particular considerations, without any institution: but no man can deduce our Ceremonies from those kindes named. Mans will is the onely reason, of them; as Gods will is the onely reason of Ceremonies truely divine by institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No man can conclude thus: we must every where have some garment, and therefore in England, a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. We must alwayes in Baptisme, have some admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to professe the faith; and therefore in England a Crosse. We must use reverent gestures in receiving the holy Communion; and therefore in England we must kneel in the act of receiving. But we may conclude thus: We must have a fit place to meete in; and this place is generally fittest for our Congregation: therefore we must have this. We must have a convenient time to meete in; and this houre is generally most convenient for our Congregation: therefore this. The <hi>Monkes</hi> may as well conclude: We must have some garments: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must in one order have <hi>blacke</hi>; in another, <hi>white</hi>; in a third, <hi>blacke over white,</hi> or <hi>white over blacke</hi>; in a fourth, <hi>gray</hi>; a fifth, <hi>party coloured</hi>; in some, <hi>all wollen</hi>; in some, <hi>all linnen; &amp;c. ad infinitum</hi>; as well (I say) every whit, as the Rejoynder can conclude from a garment to a Surplice; from admonition, to the signe of a Crosse; or from reverence in a table-gesture, to kneeling.</p>
                  <p>To Bellarmine, the Rejoynder answereth, that <hi>he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of naturall Ceremonies.</hi> Which is true: but are not these conteined under the generality of the Defend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt his words: <hi>there is no gesture, or circumstance of worship,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:245:400"/>
which hath not beene abused?</hi> And as for other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are called <hi>civill,</hi> many of them admit onely of such variety, as nature doth lead unto, by occasion of this or that determination, common to religion with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That our Ceremonies are not individually, or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly the same which Papists have solemnely abused, the Replier said, it is no marvell: because it is impossible to carry the same particular signe of the Crosse, from the Fonte, to the Church doore; or to keep it being so long as it is in making. That is therefore no great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Rejoynder answereth nothing to this, save one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he descanteth upon the terme <hi>mystery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. It was added (as an <hi>overplus,</hi> not for necessity of the Argument) that as <hi>it seemeth,</hi> Papists doe give divine honour unto the signe of the Crosse, as it is us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Rejoynder opposeth <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>the Papists honour not the Lords Supper in our hands.</hi> The difference is, that unto that Sacrament, they require a right-ordained Priest; but not so to the Crosse. 2. He answereth, that they ascribe this divine operation unto it, onely when there is an <hi>intention</hi> of such an operation, in him that maketh the Crosse. Be it so: the Patrones of our crossing, defend that use which the Crosse had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fathers, who allowed that <hi>intention,</hi> as Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine (in the place now cited) sheweth. And how shall the inward intention of them be discerned?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:245:401"/>This at the least seemeth to follow, that as for uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Priests intention, divers Papists worship the Hoaste, onely <hi>upon condition,</hi> if it be changed into the body, by the Priests intention; so they must ascribe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour unto our Crosses, upon the like <hi>condition</hi> of such an intention, as was in the Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. About <hi>materiall formall samenesse,</hi> the Replier refused to dispute: that was (sayth the Rejoynder) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if he had, <hi>he must either have opposed all learning and common sense, or else have yeelded to the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fendant, that change of essentiall forme maketh the same materiall to become another thing; as in the changing of water into wine.</hi> But 1. with consent of all common sense, we may say, that our Crosse differeth not so from the Popish Crosse as the wine did from water, Ioh. 2. 2. It were no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all learning (whatsoever Aristole teacheth) if one should say, that not the forme onely, but also the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was in a great part changed, when water was turned into wine. 3. Opinion, and intention, is not the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme of a ceremoniall Crosse. For one and the same ceremoniall Crosse, is used by Papists, to divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as to represent a Mystery, to cure diseases, to drive away divels, &amp;c. Bellarmine in the fore-cited place. And opinion belongeth to the <hi>efficient</hi> or making cause, not to the forme. 4. The very making of a Crosse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in such a manner, or with such circumstances, as put upon it a relation to religion, maketh both matter and forme of that Ceremony: and so after idolatrously abused, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it at least a shew of an Idolatrous Ceremony. But this <hi>shew</hi> the Rej. referreth unto the fifth chapter:
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:245:401"/>
and heere opposeth onely, that <hi>likenesse and samenesse are not one.</hi> Which is true of individuall or singular same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not otherwise: for those things are <hi>like</hi> which have one and the <hi>same</hi> qualitie. But he himselfe will not say, that <hi>onely</hi> the same individuall or particular Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which Idolaters abuse, are forbidden to us. He hath hitherto in all this section declined the defence of that absurdity. This quidity therefore is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It was added by the Replier, that we have no intention, or opinion, in the use of the Crosse, but the Papists have the same (though they have others more) and therefore there is some <hi>formall samenesse</hi> in their Crosse and ours. To this the Rejoynd. in many words, answereth nothing, but that <hi>this replie stifles it selfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if we have not all the same opinions, which they have, then they have not the same with us.</hi> But it doeth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>positive</hi> opinions, concerning the Crosse it selfe. For we may want some of their opinions, and yet they have all that we have, the same. Doeth not he that knoweth most, of this or that, know the same thing with him that knoweth little, though he knoweth more?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Another odde reason was framed by the Repl. thus: If this doeth make a Ceremony not the same, that men have not altogether the same opinion of it; then among the Papists, there are as many kinde of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Crosses, Surplices, as there are diversities of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about their nature and use; which no man will say. Yes (sayth the the Rejoynder) I will say it of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and <hi>he that shall denie this, must lay aside both learning,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:245:402"/>
and conscience, not knowing what to say.</hi> But he is too too confident, upon the ground which he is driven to by force of a contrary winde. For without laying aside of learning, and conscience, we may thus argue: If this be so, then all human Ceremonies used among the Papists, and brought in (as hitherto all have used to speake) by Popes, are not Popish. For they may be this or that Hedge-Priests Ceremonies, who hath added his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and institution unto them. 2. The Pope) by the same reason) cannot know, when his Ceremonies ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> observed, or omitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he cannot know all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and intentions of men. And the like reason hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with us, our Church must inquire into the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intentions of men, before she can know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Ceremonies be observed, yea, or no. I leave it then to a Convocation-consultation, if it be not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that in the Bishops Articles, the Church-Wardens should be asked, upon that oath, which they usually take, and breake, <hi>With what opinion, and intention, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster doeth weare the Surplice, and use the Crosse?</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it cannot be knowne, whether he useth the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of England, or others of his owne making? 3. When men have no opinion or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Ceremonies, but onely that they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to stand betwixt them and deprivation, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or other vexation (which is the case of our best Conformers) then, though they use Crosse, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, &amp;c. they doe not conforme to the Ceremonies of our Church, but in hypocrisie, and so with great sinne.</p>

                  <p n="14">14. Instance was made (by the Replier) in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar erected by Vriah, 2. King. 16. which was idolatrous, like that of Damascus, though for another intention.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder answereth 1. that <hi>this Altar was not formaly the same with that of Damascus.</hi> But the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that Altar, conteyning all the idolatrousnesse that was in it, or belonged unto it, and that Idolatrie being in part common to Vrias Altar, with that of Damaskus, it must needs be in that part the same, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Idolatrie against the second Commandement, hath some formal communitie with that which is against the first. He addeth 2. that <hi>if Achaz had intention of offering to false Gods, then his intention was the same with theirs at Damascus.</hi> But yet there would be found a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of intention in Achaz, in that he intended wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship both to the true God, and to those false; wheras they at Damascus were onely for the false. And <hi>Vrias</hi> intention might be (as it seemeth to have been) onely to satisfie the Kings minde, that he might keep his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,

upon which intentions, Courting Praelats use to goe very farre.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In the last place, it was observed by the Replier, that this answer of the Defender is the very same with that which Papists give unto our Divines, when they are accused for using of Heathenish and Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.<note place="margin">

                  <head>SECT. 22. Concerning the Crosse Popish and English.</head>
                  <p>IN this Section, ther is nothing material, save onely, that the Rejoynder undertaketh to prove, that <hi>the Church of England hath utterly and cleane taken away the Ceremonie of the Crosse, which was amonge the Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused: or, that wheresoever, and howsoever the signe of the Crosse was a Ceremonie abused in Poperie, it is taken away in the Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because in common understanding, this is to prove day, night, and night, day, he requireth two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to be granted him (which before have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed) 1. <hi>that nothing is a Ceremonie properly so called, but in respect of, and in the use of it, as a Ceremonie. 2. That the signe of the Crosse, though it be but one kinde of thinge, yet is made so many several Ceremonies, as ther be several uses therof.</hi> And these things being taken for granted, he gathereth a Catalogue of many Popish abuses, which (thorough Gods mercy) we are freed from. Yet in his very first instance, he betrayeth his cause. For he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it a Popish Ceremonie, to signe the breast with the forhead (and so the forehead) in signification, that the mysterie of the Crosse is to be beleeved in the heart, and confessed with the mouth. <hi>This Ceremonie</hi> (sayth he) <hi>we have not.</hi> Yes surely we have the very same formal
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:245:404"/>
opinion and intention, so farre as signification com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to. For <hi>not to be ashamed of confessing faith in Christ crucified, &amp;c.</hi> is nothing else but to believe with the heart, and confesse with the mouth, hand, and feet, the mysterie of the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>But it is not worth the while, for to consider the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals of this Catalogue. This onely I would know; if we have not taken the Ceremonie of the Crosse from Papists, from whom we took it? The beginning of it was (so farre as appeareth by bookes) from the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian haeretickes.</hi> The first honorable mention of using it among Christians, is in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when (by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder his sentence) he was infected with haeresie: &amp; his use our Defender and Rejoynder (I dare say) will not allow: <hi>at bordes, and beds, putting on apparel, and shoes, &amp;c.</hi> Tell us <hi>(I pray you)</hi> from what Author, or Age, this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie of the Crosse was taken, which now is urged upon us? I have more then a doubt, that such exception may be taken against that propagation, and such proofes for the taking away utterly of the Crosse, as you have brought for the abolishing of the Papists Crosse. If it be a new Ceremonie, invented in England, just at the time of Reformation, the Author of that invention should be made knowen: and if he can approve his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, to be grounded rightly, his name may be added in <hi>Polidor Virgil, de Inventoribus rerum.</hi>

These wordes the Rejoynder accuseth of <hi>dishonestie, not to be used against a Pagan.</hi> And why so? 1. Because the Defender under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took onely to prove, that <hi>some Ceremonies, which have been formerly abused, are not therfor necessarilie to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, if they may be reduced to their indifferent use.</hi> Now by <hi>abused</hi> he meant <hi>Idolatrously</hi> abused, or else he touched not this fourth Argument, whose assumtion himself repeated thus: <hi>Our</hi> Ceremonies have been <hi>Idolatrously abused.</hi> The Replier in stead of <hi>Idolatrously abused,</hi> put <hi>Idolatrous</hi>: because (as such) they are Idolatrous.

                  <p>After these, the Rej. instanceth in <hi>sitting, or lying along, leaning on the left side; covering of the head and face, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; dividing of a beast in covenant-making; erecting of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars upon hils; erecting of religious monuments; Trophees of victory, in Temples; set dayes for solemne worship; wine and victuals for mourners; Marriage feasts, &amp;c.</hi> But in all these, he was so set upon <hi>number,</hi> that he cleane forgot <hi>weight,</hi> and pertinency to the question in hand.

                  <p n="1">1. THe Def. his first reason (by the Rejoynder his interpretation) is, that <hi>by our assertion, the Church shall loose a part of her Christian liberty: because if she may not use human Ceremonies a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>used unto Idolatry and superstition, she may use none at all.</hi> Now <hi>1.</hi> The Replier granted the conclusion, being understood of <hi>human sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremonies.</hi> And thereto the Rej. opposeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that there is the same reason of <hi>all other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>; and that one <hi>Did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>clave</hi> doeth not grant this of <hi>sitting</hi> at the Lords Supper, though he confesse it to be a human significant Ceremonie. But both these answers are voyd of trueth. For Circumstances of <hi>Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are sometime called Ceremonies, and heer understood, are neyther meer <hi>human</hi> institutions, nor <hi>unnecessarie</hi> (which is part of the quaestion) but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, as often hath been shewed. Neyther doeth <hi>Didoclave</hi> any where confesse <hi>Sitting</hi> at the Lords Supper, to be a <hi>human</hi> Ceremonie. 2. It seemeth very strange to me, that appointing &amp; using of human signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant unnecessarie Ceremonies, notoriously knowen to have been, and be abused unto Idolatrie, should be fetched from <hi>Christian Libertie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have considered what is spoken of <hi>Christian libertie,</hi> in
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:245:415"/>
the Scripture, and what I could finde written of it by Divines: and therout observed much against these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies (as is alleged in the sixt general Argument, which the Rejoynder was not hastie to come unto, in eight or nine years) but nothing eyther for their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or their using.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder meaneth by the <hi>Church</hi> (in England) the <hi>Convocation house</hi>; and by <hi>Christian libertie,</hi> their <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse,</hi> in Abridging Gods people of that libertie which Christ hath left unto them. So that, as in some parts of Germanie, and Polonia, the Noble men stand mightilie for the <hi>Libertie</hi> of their Countrie; And yet when the course of thinges is well weighed, that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is onely licence for them to oppresse the common people, or <hi>Boores</hi>; whome they keep under as slaves, or litle better; whose goods they take from them upon every slight praetence; whose lives (in some places) can scarce satisfie them for the life of a stagge, if they shoot one, spoiling their corne, even so, this Christian libertie is onely for our Convocation-house to oppresse the Congregations of Christ, as they doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Defender his second reason, was such, as the Repl. could finde no conclusion in, but that <hi>somethings abused, may afterward be rightly used:</hi> which he granted. The Rejoynder addeth, that <hi>his reason did conclude this of some human Ceremonies, from the Law of shadowes.</hi> He sayd in deed, among other instances, that <hi>a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, legally unclean, might he legally cleansed or purged.</hi> And can he conclude from <hi>Men and Women,</hi> to <hi>human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie Ceremonies?</hi> He may as well conclude, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:245:415"/>
in a fretting leprosie, the leprous mans head may not be cutt off, nor his body burned; therfor his infected <hi>garments</hi> were not to be burnt, nor the <hi>hayre</hi> of his head and beard cutte off.</p>
                  <p>The Replier also granted that Surplices might be turned into under garments for poor people; and woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Crosses given them for firing.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynder answereth 1. that <hi>this is no use of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as Ceremonies.</hi> As if he himself did allway speak <hi>formally</hi>!</p>
                  <p>The sentence immediatly goeing before, was of <hi>things abused:</hi> And so this addition was of those <hi>thinges</hi> which are made Ceremonies. Yet if that be true, which the Rejoynder affirmed pag. 570. that a <hi>Surplice,</hi> as a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, is in the <hi>kinde</hi> of a <hi>Garment,</hi> then it must needes follow, that this <hi>Ceremonie</hi> may be given to the poor for a garment.</p>
                  <p>And if he flie to <hi>Vse</hi> as necessarie to make a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as he doeth in his <hi>Definition</hi> of a Ceremonie, it may be as well quaestioned, whether a <hi>Shirt</hi> be a garment out of use when it is off a mans bodie? For a garment is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, by the Rejoynder his Definition. And so it may be quaestioned, whether any Shirt, or other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made, or washed, when no man had it on? His 2. answer, that <hi>M. Parker</hi> calleth them Devills, and jarring on the same stringe, would fright men from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Idols, as he did in Germanie, whoe when men were burning of wooden Idols, bored a hole in one, into which he stopped some gunpouder; so that the Idol being in the stove to burne, the gun-pouder brake the
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:245:416"/>
stove together with the windows of the room, in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that was imputed by some to the Idol, or Saint, and by others, to the Devil. But (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>from hence it followeth, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re is a change of Law: because the Iewes might not convert the matter of Idols to their privat use.</hi> And so much we grant; urging onely the <hi>aequitie</hi> of those Laws. Then (addeth he) <hi>the Abrigement hath abused the World, in alleging those Laws, as binding Christians now, as much as they did the Iewes.</hi> But with this out-cry no man will be troubled, that noteth how they are to be understood onely according to their quaestion, of <hi>human unnecessarie Ceremonies,</hi> as they are such. For the Second Commandement doeth binde us as much as it did the Iewes; and so the aequitie of particular Lawes, as they illustrate the contents of that Commandement, binde us <hi>as much,</hi> though not in every other particular <hi>to so much,</hi> as they did the Iewes. The summe is; those lawes binde us as much from all religious use of human unnecessarie Ceremonies, used or abused in Idolatrie, as they did the Iewes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the 27. Sect. the Replier could finde no shew of reason, beside meer affirmations. The Rejoynder findeth this Argument: <hi>If two other ways of reforming Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, beside Abolition, may be used; then abolition is not the onely way. But two other ways, (namely changing or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting) may be used. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this shew of reason, the answer is easy: 1. If those two other ways be understood as <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>insufficient,</hi> then the Proposition is false: if as <hi>sufficient</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without <hi>abolition,</hi> then I denie absolutely the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtion,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:245:416"/>
as being a meer affirmation of that which is in quaestion, according to the Repliers observation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Eyther this is understood of all Ceremonies abused, or onely of some? If of all, our Reformation is to be blamed, which hath used <hi>abolition</hi> without any necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If of some onely, the Defender ought to have tould us, which they are, or by what marke we may know them? And omitting this, he sayth neyther Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, nor certain affirmation in this Section.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The last Reason is, because Poperie and Popish Rites are not to be esteemed of aequal abomination with Paganisme, and Paganish Rites. The Rejoynder brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it to this: that <hi>the Idolatrie of Papists, and Pagans, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in themselves are not like.</hi> The Replier answered, that though this were true every way (as it is not) yet in this they may agree, that both alike are to be detested and abandoned. <hi>You speak monsters</hi> (answereth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder) <hi>because, if they be not alike detestable, they are not alike to be detested: and Abandoning hath no degrees.</hi> But 1. The substance of this assertion was wonte to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no Monster. For D. Fulke (Rejoynder to Bristow, pag. 288.) maketh open profession of it, not onely in his owne name, but of other Divines: <hi>This we say; that Popish Images, although they be not the same that were the Images of the Heathen, yet they are as abominable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as theirs; and the worshiping of them, as much to be abhorred of all true Christians, as the worshiping of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gentiles.</hi>

                  <p>To the Repliers assertion, that we are by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures warned to flie <hi>as well, and as farre,</hi> from Popish, as from Paganish Idolatrie, the Rejoynder (with some liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation about Rev. 18.) consenteth: but addeth that it is not necessarie to flie from every <hi>human</hi> (he should have added <hi>unnecessarie)</hi> Ceremonie, which eyther Papists or Pagans have Idolatrously abused. Now this is the maine quaestion of this wholle chapter: and therfor not heer to be discussed.

                  <p>The case is plaine, and plentifully confirmed by our Divines, in every dispute against Popish Idolatry. <hi>Doctor Ames</hi> hath not one word to the contrary: but this he hath for it, Bellar. Encrv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:245:418"/>Another ground of the Rejoynders is, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Idolatry may be, <hi>in some respect</hi> as great a sinne, but not <hi>simply</hi> so great Idolatry. pag. 622. &amp;c. To which I answer briefely, that there are such sinnes accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popish Idolatry, as make it as detestable, as if it were one simply. As for example; the worst of the Heathens Idolatry was, that they <hi>sacrificed men</hi> unto their Idols: and the <hi>Papists burning</hi> of so many godly <hi>Martyrs,</hi> for the maintenance and promoting of their Idolatry, may be equalled thereto, in horrour of sinne.</p>
                  <p>The third ground which the Rejoynder buildeth on, is, that <hi>Achabs Baal was worse then Aarons or Ieroboams calves, &amp;c. pag. 629.</hi> About this, Calvin shall answer, <hi>Hom. 1. de Fug. Idol.</hi>

                     <hi>That some goe about to lessen the Idols of Papists in comparison of that which was among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, is (that I say no more) most childishly done. Is not their Idolatry plainely recalled, the names onely changed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet it shall not be a misse, to give some reason of that which our Divines say. And this (for the present) is at hand: The Heathen gods (take them at the worst) were workes of cunning Artificers, made of silver, golde, or some precious thing curiously wrought, sumptuously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned, representing a Majesty. But the Papists Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god is made by every sacrificing Ideot, of a bready sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by uttering of a word, without forme or beauty. The Heathen knew, their Idols were not Gods: and the greatest estimation they had of them, was, a certaine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity might lodge in them. The Papists beleeve their bread (or Hoste of starch) is very God, not by acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall residence of some Divinity in it, but as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is God. The Heathen seat their Idols in Temples, and consecrated places, to be adored. The Papists ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lifted up their god, and adored him, devoure him. Will any man spoyle (much lesse eate, hearke said one,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:245:419"/>
how his bones crackt, when he swallowed him downe) his god? sayth the Prophet, Mal. 3.8. Vpon such consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations <hi>Coster,</hi> a Iesuite, (Enchirid. cap. 8.) confesseth, that <hi>if the substance of bread remaine in the Sacrament, then the Idolatry of Papists is more intolerable, then the Egyptians was in worshipping of an Oxe, or a Crocodile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This may suffize for the 28. Section: but that the Rej. will needs have us take notice of some sharpe phrazes, and sentences he passeth upon us. To passe by therefore his prescribing of <hi>Hellebore,</hi> for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Parker</hi> (which in us he would call <hi>skurrility,</hi> if it were spoken of a Prelate, though in all intellectuals, and morals, much inferiour to M. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker) to omit (I say) this, and such like single reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he gathereth a bundle together, pag. 628.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that <hi>we have wrought the faithfull Servants of Christ, out of the love and estimation of many.</hi> By <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servants of Christ,</hi> he must needs meane <hi>Conformists,</hi> as they are Conformists; and that Generally: for if he except any kinde of them, they will cast upon him that imputation, which he layeth upon us: <hi>you say unto other men; stand a loofe off; we are more holy, or more faithfull then you, &amp;c.</hi> Now 1. let any man consider, if it be any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to Christ, to observe and urge those religious Ceremonies, which he never commanded, but rather forbidden, as hath beene prooved? 2. Those which are in other things faithfull, we goe not about to worke out of the love and estimation of others, but them out of the love and estimation of unfaithfull conformity. May not a man speake against Non residency, if some honest man be come to it? But it becommeth not the Rej. to
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:245:420"/>
speake of bringing Christs servants out of love and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with many; while he writeth in defence of those courses, which have brought thousands of them out of house and home, into so extreame misery, as our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates could possibly bring any, and more then they bring the servants of Antichrist into.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that <hi>we have brought the publike prayers into contempt.</hi> Because (forsooth) we would have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers free from those contemptible fashions which are taken out of the Masse booke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>wee have brought the preaching of the Gospel, by any conformed Ministers into disgrace.</hi> As if we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the preaching of the Gospel, even by Frier <hi>Paul, or Fulgentius &amp;c. at Venice</hi>!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>we have brought the Sacrament to be of lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme then the gesture.</hi> Which is the proper fault of our Prelates, and those who deny the Sacrament to all that cannot bring their consciences to kneeling, though Christ hath invited them to his Table.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>we question, whether it be lawfull for one to marry with one that conformeth to the Lawes.</hi> Now of this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I never heard any newes, before the Rej. proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. It may be, that some, observing how divers godly women, having given themselves in mariage to some Ministers, upon a great aestimation of that calling, without making just difference of the persons, have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned others to use more discretion. But this I am sure of, that all <hi>Subscribers,</hi> doe testifie under their hands; that all whoe refuse to conforme, may lawfully have their Baines and Mariages forbidden: because it is provided
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:245:420"/>
in the <hi>Service-booke,</hi> that none shall marry, except they communicate, wherto is annexed <hi>kneeling,</hi> and that none shall eyther communicate, or marry, except first they be <hi>Bishoped, or Confirmed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>we quaestion whether it be lawfull to hear a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Minister, if another may be heard; or safe to relie upon their Ministery?</hi> which quaestions he seemeth to invent, and teach, rather then receive from vs; except, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by <hi>relying,</hi> taking all for good that they say, or doe.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>we have appropriated the surnames of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the title of Syncere, the very name of the Church, the Brethren, the Godly, unto our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which slanders we are so free, that I doubt not to say (according to my conscience) that among those which live under the tyranny of the Pope, and doe not utterly seperate from him, through ignorance, there be many <hi>Christians, Syncere</hi> according to their knowledge, belonging to the true Catholike <hi>Church,</hi> and so to be accounted our <hi>Godly Brethren.</hi> But on the contrary part, Our Prelates, appropriating unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the name of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime us (by their extreame <hi>hostile courses)</hi> to be farre from the account of their <hi>Christian Brethren.</hi> If some time some of us, call those among the godly that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us, <hi>the Brethren, the Godly,</hi> &amp;c. the Rejoynder should not have excepted against it, at least in this roule of accusations, in the first front whereof, he styleth and surnameth Conformists, <hi>the Faithfull Servants of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>In the 30. or last Section, a <hi>contradiction</hi> being sought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for in vaine, <hi>betwixt our conclusi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns, and our confessions and practises,</hi> the Replier thought it sufficient to dispatch all briefely, in a few questions, to which the Rejoynder answers; but so, as he bringeth little or nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a new confutation.</p>
                  <p>The first question was about <hi>Temples, Bells, Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths</hi> (objected by the Defendant) <hi>whether they have such Idolatry put upon them by Papists, as the Crosse hath</hi>? The Rejoynder answereth 1. <hi>that if they have as much as the Surplice, that will serve the turne.</hi> It would indeed, in part; though nor in whole. But that cannot be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. His second answer is, that such a Crosse as ours is, was never abused at all in Popery. Which is a Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall conceit, sufficiently before confuted. His third is, that <hi>Temples and Bells, were as well abused.</hi> But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was of <hi>such Idolatry.</hi> His fourth is, that <hi>the white linnen Altar cloth was as much abused as the Surplice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="525" facs="tcp:245:421"/>But the quaestion was of the Crosse. And 2. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <hi>Altar-cloath,</hi> differeth much from the <hi>Table-cloath</hi> which we allow of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second was, if the Defender his owne heart did not tell him, that ther is a civil use of the thinges fore-named; which cannot be imagined of the Crosse? The Rejoynder <hi>granteth a civil use of Bells; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ugh not of Churches, or Communion table-cloathes: Adding, that ther may be a civil use of some Crosses, though not of Transient Grosses (such as ours) and also of Wafers.</hi> But he attended neyther to those wordes of the Replier: <hi>If his owne heart doe not tell him</hi>; nor to those: <hi>such thinges.</hi> For his bringing-in first of termes, which involve the <hi>use</hi> together with the <hi>thinges,</hi> and that use also immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which is but mediat, in <hi>Churches,</hi> and Communion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloathes; with his contrarie changing of <hi>such Crosses as ours,</hi> into <hi>some Crosses,</hi> and <hi>Wafer-Gods</hi> into <hi>Waf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r-seales</hi> for letters, declare both. Concerning the difference, enough hath been sayd in the first part of this <hi>Fresh-suit,</hi> in the head of Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third was, what Superstition was in the <hi>meer signification,</hi> given by Durandus unto Bells, and Bell-ropes, which is not to be found in our Crosse and Surplice? The Rejoynder heer answereth nothing; but onely noteth <hi>many more</hi> superstitious significations to have been then conceited, of diverse thinges, and also of <hi>Bells,</hi> then we have in our Ceremonies. But the quaestion was onely of the <hi>weight,</hi> not the <hi>number</hi> of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious significations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The 4. was, whether the Pagans use of Bay-leaves
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:245:422"/>
(objected by the Defender) about 1000. yeares past, doeth cast such a reflexion upon our civil use of Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, as Popish Superstition doeth upon our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? The Rejoynder his answer consisteth onely in <hi>wordes</hi>; save that he aequalleth the <hi>Countries</hi> (of Papists) to those of ancient unknowen Heathens; the <hi>time</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after Baptisme) unto a 1000. yeares distance; the <hi>place</hi> (crowne of the head and fore-head) unto farre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and unknowen Landes. Heer againe he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that <hi>item</hi> of the Repliers: <hi>If his owne heart doeth not tell him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fift was, what sense the Defender had, to finde fault with us, for not altering the situation of Churches? <hi>Nay</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>what face have you, to say, that he did finde fault with you, for not doeing it</hi>? Surely the plaine countrie face, of taking the Defend. his wordes, as they stand in your Rejoynder, pag. 645. <hi>Nor doe you alter the Situation of your Churches, and Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels toward the East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The 6. was, if it be all one, to call a Ship, by the name of Castor and Pollux (Act. 28.11.) and to use a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ceremonie, in Gods worship, taken from those Idolls? <hi>No,</hi> sayth the Rejoynder. Which is enough to shew the vanitie of the Defender in comparing the <hi>names of Wensday, Thursday, Friday,</hi> unto Ceremonies taken from Poperie.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The 7. was, whether it be one thinge, to change Coapes into Cushions, and to use a Masse-vestiment, in Gods worship? The Rejoynder sayth nothing worth the repeating.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="527" facs="tcp:245:422"/>8. The last quaestion was, if it be not a kinde of slander, to say, that the Church of Geneva imposeth a round Wafer-cake, like the Papists, to be used in the Lords Supper. And if it be not a wide leap, to bring in the practise of Geneva, for an instance of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists practise, in England? The Rejoynder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth 1. <hi>Yes,</hi> it is a slander to impute unto Geneva a round Wafer-cake, <hi>like the Papists:</hi> but addeth, that <hi>the Defender did not so.</hi> If he doeth not, what mean those wordes of his: <hi>allbeit the Church of Geneva is not ignorant, what the round Wafer among the Papists did signifie</hi>? Or what consequence made the Defender from Genevas Wafer-cake, to Ceremonies abused unto Idolatrie, if the Geneva Wafer-cake be not <hi>like unto the Papists</hi>?</p>
                  <p>In the second place, the Rejoynder confesseth, that the bread used at Geneva, is <hi>a large square Cake, which is broken in sondry parcels, unto the Communicants</hi>: and yet he addeth, that it is <hi>a Wafer-Cake, as thin, as thin may be.</hi> Where it is something, that he confesseth their bread not to be like the Papists, neyther in <hi>extensive quantitie,</hi> nor yet <hi>in Forme and Figure.</hi> But yet I am perswaded, he wrongeth that Church, in making their Cakes as <hi>thin</hi> as the Papists Host. For the Papists Host is a <hi>starchie</hi> or <hi>scummie crust,</hi> distinct from <hi>cibarius panis, bread fitting for food,</hi> by our Divines censure of it: And it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that the Church of Geneva should reteyne such a grosse corruption. <hi>But</hi> (sayth the Rejoynder) <hi>you allow their Ceremonie of Wafer-bread.</hi> Nothing lesse. We never read, nor heard from them, that they made any <hi>Wafer</hi> fashion a Religious significant <hi>Ceremonie.</hi> This
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:245:423"/>
                     <hi>Wafer</hi> was first <hi>baked</hi> in England. And if they did, they are olde enough, let them answer for themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> (addeth he) <hi>even unleavened bread hath been abused.</hi> Neyther allow we of any <hi>Ceremonious leaving out of leaven:</hi> nor can it be proved of the Geneva Church. As for that which was added by the Replier, of <hi>custome heerin praevayling against Farells, Calvins, and Virets advise</hi>; it is confessed by the Rejoynder that these Divines had brought-in a custome of using common bread; but after some knaves working upon the reliques of the former custome, brought in unleavened bread: which is enough for to confirme that which the Replier spake (as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder sayth) <hi>at random.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the second part of the quaestion: whether it be nor <hi>a wide leape,</hi> to bring in the Practise of Geneva, for an Instance of the Non-Conformists practise in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? The Rejoynder answereth, that it is an <hi>abuse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly lightnesse, eagernesse after squibs, and scornes, which wrought the Replier out of his geares:</hi> All this it pleaseth him to lay upon this one phrase (<hi>a wide leape)</hi> a litle after he had commended <hi>Hellebore</hi> unto <hi>M. Parker,</hi> with many such <hi>Drugges</hi> unto others. And what is the cause? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, because this <hi>Geneva Wafer-cake was given as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our Confessions, and not of our Practise.</hi> But this is as <hi>wide,</hi> as if it had been confessed to belonge to our <hi>Practise.</hi> For no such Confession of ours can be shewed. It had been fitting to object nothing unto us as <hi>Confessed,</hi> but that which we have eyther in practise, or in writing allowed. Neyther in deed was it the Defender his meaning to make all the rest of his instances our <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:245:423"/>
and this onely our <hi>Confession</hi>: but he stumbled upon this in the ende, as a thing that must have some place among his objections; because it had been objected by others: and the Rejoynder having begunne his booke with the accusation of <hi>Scurrilitie,</hi> finding him to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, had no other way, but with this shew of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, to vente some salt phrases, like unto that, <hi>Vt ultima primis consentirent.</hi> 1. e. That both endes might agree.</p>

               <p>SOme Reader may inquire whence came this new writing about Ceremonies?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Authours of the Abridgment framed a strong Argument against our Ceremonies from the rules of Ceremonies prescribed in the Word, P. 43. &amp;c. with this Argument when the Defendant was not able to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as it stood in the parts combined, he thought good to sever some parcels of it, and try what he could say to them apart. Thus out of this one Argument he hath taken that which he calleth our first: and out of the same he hath made up this fift: and yet hee hath quite le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t out a great part of the sinewes wherewith that one reason is knit together in the Abridgement.</p>
                  <p>The argument is taken from the scandall or offence which the imposing and using of these ceremonies do bring unto divers sorts of men.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant here maketh great flourishing in nine whole Sections, defining, deviding, and subdividing a scandall, as if he would make all cleare before him: but at the end of all this preparation, he maketh no appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of these Rules unto the matter in hand at all: but onely, telleth his Reader, Pag. 154. <hi>That these divisions and subdivisions will expedite all difficulties, so that out of them he may collect the true and false sense of Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:245:427"/>
It were sufficient therefore either to deny this power to be in his divisions: or else to sett downe as many other subdivisions of scandall (which were easie to doe) and then tell him that these will expedite the controversie, and that from them hee may collect the errours of his answer. But I will notwithstanding briefly shew my opinion concerning some of these d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le externall meanes:</hi> Sect. 1. Wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing many faults may be found. For 1. every scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall is not <hi>wilfull,</hi> except the word be taken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then use of speech will allow. 2. Every scandall is not against Christians. 3. A scandall is not onely by provoking to sinne, but also in hindring from good. 4. What doth he meane to put in the word <hi>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable?</hi> the occasioning of any sin, sufficeth to make up a scandall.</p>
                  <p>Among his subdivisions, the first thing I except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst is, Section 5. where he distinguisheth so betwixt <hi>persons and causes, either determined or undetermined, that in matters determined by the Church</hi> (as he teacheth) <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to be given without respect of scandall: and onely in matters undetermined there is a charitab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e consideration to be had of other mens consciences.</hi> This is a new and a tickle point of Divinity, touching the tenderest part of our spirits, even our consciences, and other mens also. It ought therefore either not to have beene propounded, or else to be well confirmed either with testimonies, or with reasons drawn out of Scripture. But alas the Def.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:245:427"/>
thrusteth it upon us without any such warrant. <hi>The peace of the Church</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is to be preferred before the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> i. e. scandall <hi>of any sort of men.</hi> As if the peace of the Church did not more consist in avoyding of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, then in observing of humaine Ceremonies: it is not the peace of God which is broken by a charitable care of avoyding offences, but by rushing into them.</p>
                  <p>A scandall in the nature of it is spirituall murder. Now suppose a Superiour should command a thing in it selfe indifferent, whereupon murder were like to follow, as to runne a horse, or a cart, in a certain way, at a certaine time, when it may be unwitting to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, little children were playing in the way, would any mans conscience serve him to doe it?</p>
                  <p>Avoyding of scandall is a maine duty of charity. May Superiours at their pleasure appoint how farre I shall shew my charity towards my brothers soule? Then surely an infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iour earthly court may crosse the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the high Court of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The superiours have no power given them for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but onely for aedification. If therefore they command scandalls, they goe beyond their commission: neither are we tyed therein to doe as they bid, but as they should bid.</p>
                  <p>If determination by superiours were sufficient to take away the sinn of a scandall. Then they doe very ill that they doe not (so farr as is possible) determine all things indifferent, that so no danger may be left in giving of offence by the use of them. Then the Church of Rome is to be praised in that she hath determined of so many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:245:428"/>
indifferents; then <hi>Paul</hi> with the other Apostles might have spared a great deale of labour in admonishing the Churches how they should avoyd offences about some indifferent things. A farre shorter way had beene either to determine the matter finally, or else to have given order that the Churches should among themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it at home.</p>
                  <p>But say that the Archbishop of Corinth (for now I suppose such a one) had called his Convocation, and with consent of his Clergie had determined that men might, and for testifying of liberty should, at a certaine time eat of such and such meats which men formerly doubted of: would not yet the Apostle have given the same directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did? would not good Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s still have had care of their brothers consciences? Can the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a superiour be a sufficient plea at the barre of Gods judgement seat, for a man that by vertue or force thereof alone, hath done any action that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science telleth him will scandalize his brother?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I would faine know whether those superiours doe not give a great scandall, which take upon them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately to impose unnecessary rites which they know many good men will be scandalized by?</p>
                  <p>The second notorious flaw which I finde in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant his subdivisions, is sect. 9. where he granteth that <hi>much indulgence indeed is to be used in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent towards weake persons, whose infirmity proceedeth onely from simple ignorance: but that onely till such time as the doctrine concerning such things have beene sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: because a scandall doth alwaies presuppose a meer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:245:428"/>
weakenesse for want of due meanes of knowledge.</hi> For 1. <hi>Paul</hi> had sufficiently declared that it was lawfull for him to take wages, yet he would not, 1. Cor. 9. he had given sufficient reasons for the lawfulnesse of eating all kind of meats, yet he abstained, and so counselled others, for feare of scandall, Rom. 14. 1. Cor. 9.2. There can be no certaine set time for all sorts of men when they are sufficiently taught. 3. Who is this Def. that he dare judge so many of his fellow servants, that in such indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies as our ceremonies are held to be, they take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence not upon weakenesse, but upon presumption? 4. What authority have our Prelats to obtrude unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Ceremonies upon the Church, which must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before they can be used? Is it fit that the people should be troubled with the declaration of mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they are hardly brought to heare willingly the maine things of the Gospell? 5. Is it not more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wisedome of God, Exo. 21.33. to fill up the pit, then to set one by for to warne the passengers they fall not into it? 6. There was never yet sufficient decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this doctrine of Ceremonies throughout Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In many places there is no preaching at all. Many preach so, that they declare nothing almost to the people but their owne folly. Many are ashamed, or at least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to declare unto the people mens devices. Many declare them so corruptly that the scandall thereby is not removed but increased. And among those that goe about with some good mind to declare this kind of doctrine, there is almost as great variety of declarations as there is of declarers: while some will have them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:245:429"/>
significant some not: some say they are good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to edification, and others condemning them as altogether unfitt, declare them to be tollerable for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of a greater mischiefe: Some will have them onely civill, and others Ecclesiasticall: some excuse all but the crosse, and some extoll the crosse above all. Are not such declarations (thinke you) likely to informe well the consciences of poore men who doubt more whom they should take for a good D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AMong the instances of scandall arising from the Ceremonies, that which in the Abridgement hath the third place is sett first by the Def. viz. that <hi>the superstitious Papist will be hardened in the liking of his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Religion, from which he seeth wee borrow our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and increase in his hope of the full restoring of it againe.</hi> To this the Def. answereth, that <hi>our rites are not the ceremonies of Papists, because they are purged from super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</hi> But 1. that they are not purged from all supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath sufficiently beene declared before. 2. This plea of transubstantiating of Ceremonies by the breath of our Convocation, is a meere shift, contrary not onely to the language of all our Divines, and to that which every mans senses doe tell him, but also to the publicke profession of the Church of England, in the preface to our service-book, as it is cited by him, pag. 127.

Popish Ceremonies</hi>: All therefore are not abolished, but some remaine. And which be they, if these in quaestion be not? 2. That <hi>some of the old Ceremonies doe remaine.</hi> What sense can be given of these words, if our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be not the same with those which were of old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papists? if it were meant of old ceremonies not used among the Papists, then they doe not <hi>remaine,</hi> nor are <hi>retained,</hi> but restored. 3. That <hi>none are devised anew:</hi> therefore they must needs be taken from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or from the Fathers: but of the Fathers surplice or kneeling at the communion, no instance can be given: and as for the crosse, the Def. himselfe will not defend, I thinke, all that use which the Fathers putt it to. 3. The Papists owne words doe sufficiently manifest how they are hardened by the imposition and use of our ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For as it is shewed in the Abridgement p. 25. they seek to justifye their superstition by this, that <hi>we have borrowed our ceremonies from them.</hi> And some of them thence conclude (as there is shewed) that our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours like well of their superstition Beside <hi>Gretser,</hi> a principall Iesuit saith, that in these ceremonies our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are as <hi>Apes of Popish Priests, Apol. pro Gregor.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 8. and in his defence, <hi>tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib. 4. cap. 16.</hi> saith, that our Convocation house in imposing these Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, doe <hi>crosse the judgement of our best Divines.</hi> Lastly, the respect of that Popish superstition wherewith our people were then generally infected, was the chiefe, if not the onely cause why these ceremonies were retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our first Reformers.

will not say but there are many weak soules in that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: 3.

                  <p>A Fift instance, or rather an inlargement of the former is, <hi>in respect of the Ministers who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly refused the ceremonies, for whereas the Minister is bound to lead his people forward unto perfection, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by all good meanes, that his ministery be not despised: by this meanes he shall draw them back againe unto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of superstition: or at least not to dislike it so much as they have done, and give them evident occasion to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:245:431"/>
proofe is this? because they were subject to another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite, therefore this is no discredit. Beside it doth not appeare, nor is likely that most of these Ministers did ever absolutely subscribe: neither is it likely; because it is well knowne how easie and how ordinary it was in Queene Elizabeths dayes, to enter into the Ministry without passing under that gallowes. If the most had, yet how would this prove it a false pretence in the rest? If all had done so, yet this was no act of their Ministerie, nor known it may be to their people, and therfore the crossing of it did not so directly tend to the discrediting of their Ministery, as the crossing of their publick doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Lastly, that which is done before a man be setled in the Ministery at one time, without any great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is not of such note as that which a man hath long professed and perswaded by reasons taken from the word of God. By all this it appeareth, that this first accusation of <hi>Ialshood</hi> was rather an <hi>adventure</hi> as the Def. himselfe calleth it, then a grounded assertion.</p>

It is not their credit, but the credit of their Ministery which they speake of. 3. Is it such an irreligious thing, to desire that certaine ceremonies may not bee imposed upon them, lest their Ministery be by that meanes prejudiced?</p>

Or doth the forbearing of some ceremonies bring such discredit to the Authorizers of them? surely then they are more for the honour of mortall men, then for the honour of God. For Gods honour and worship is no wayes prejud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, the Apostle doth not pronounce any woe for not preaching, where imprisonment do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h hinder. Now hee whose conscience is against the ceremonies, or doubteth of them, is spiritually imprisoned, so that he cannot by using of them, make his way to the pulpit.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is a meere jest, though a bitter one, to say, that we leave our ministeries: when we doe all that our consciences will suffer us to doe, for the holding of our places: and when we have done all that, depart against our wills with sorrow. <hi>Non discedit a statione, qui cedit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitus.</hi> See M. Parker, p. 1. c. 4. s. 14.</p>
                  <p>But the Defendant undertaketh to prove, that the cause of silencing is not in the Bishops that suspend and deprive us, but in our selves. He is as it seemeth, a great adventurer: For he commeth forth upon this peece of service with flying colours: <hi>Know you well what you s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>when you lay the cause of your silencing upon the Bishops</hi>? Yes surely, very well. For a cause is that which bringeth force or vertue to the being of another thing.</p>
                  <p>Now the first vertue (or rather vice) which tendeth to silencing of Ministers in this case, is in the Bishops canons: they therefore are the first cause. The second vertue is in the Bishops and their officers, which are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of those unconscionable canons: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the secondarie cause. Non-conformity hath no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:245:434"/>
vertue in it of it owne nature, nor by Gods ordinance, to bring forth such an effect as the silencing of Gods Ministers is: though it be made an occasion by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse of our Prelats. I know well what I say: and will make it good against the Defendants vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. <hi>The case standeth thus</hi> (sayth he) <hi>Titus</hi> (it had been more proper to say Diotrephes) <hi>the Bishop doth deprive Titius a factious and schismaticall minister, that he may place Sempronius a peaceable and discreet man, in his stead. In this proceeding, the intendement of Titus is not absolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Titius, as he is a Minister, but as he was factious: yet so onely respectively, that Titius being deprived, he may consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Sempronius: for the charge of a Bishop is not determinate to appoynt precisely this min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ster: but indefinite, to ordaine a minister, so that the course of Gods plow is still preserved and continued. But as for Titius, who will rather be silenced then conforme, it is evident, that the cause of his silencing being his owne refractarinesse, which is onely personall &amp; proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and yet hath no faculty in himselfe to appoynt or admit of a successor: he may be sayd to have properly caused his own suspension and deprivation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This case needeth no long demurring on: for there is not one sentence in all the length of it, which doth not smell, without any uncasing, 1. are all those factious and schismaticall men, that refuse to conforme? was Hooper such a kynd of man? was Peter Martyr, and M. Perkins such, when one at Oxford, and the other at Cambridge, refused to weare the Surplice? was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Goodman, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Deering, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. More, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Rogers, and such like heavenly men, the lights &amp; glory of our churches,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:245:434"/>
were all these factious and schismaticall? In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God it is well knowne they were not. But our Prelats have this prerogative, they may dubb whom they please factious and schismaticall, &amp; after that, there is no redemption, they must be such, be they otherwise never so full of all grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Are all peaceable discreet men, which are placed in the deprived ministers stead? For the best of them, they are still as great eye-sores to our Bishops almost as the other: because they reprove a great deale of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall darknesse, by their practises. For the rest, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations over whom they are sett, cannot finde it, the voyce of all the countrey is otherwise for many of them; yet according to the Prelats measure, who meat (as it seemeth) the vertues and vices of a minister by certaine ceremonies of their owne imposing, it cannot be denied, but the most of them are very peaceable and discreet: Even so as many of the Bishops themselves were knowne to be afore they were Bishops, and shew themselves to be still: for, <hi>Episcopatus plures accepit, quam fecit bonos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What sence can this have, <hi>The Bishop depriveth Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius respectively, that he may constitute Sempronius?</hi> Doth he know before-hand whom he shall constitute? then there is grosse legerdemaine, betwixt him, and that <hi>Sempronius.</hi> For with what conscience can one seek and the other assigne the place of him that is in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? This is but some time in those benefices which are fatter, and whose patrons are more foolish. Ordinarily. the vilest minister that is to be found, may succeed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:245:435"/>
in the place of him that is deprived, for ought the Bishop knoweth, or for ought he can doe, except he will endure a <hi>quare impedit,</hi> which in case of morall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, hath scarce beene ever heard of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The charge which he sayth our Bishops have of appointing Ministers, I wonder from whence they have it, or by what conveyance. They say that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are the proper pastors of all the parishes in their Diocesse. It is well, if they have an ubiquitary faculty, and will, to performe the office of pastors to so great a people: but who made them such? Christ &amp; his Apostles never knew of ordinary pastors, having charge of so many Churches. But suppose they did, by whom doth Christ call one of our Bishops? By the Kings <hi>conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier,</hi> the Chapiters nominall election, or by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops consecration? There is none of these that can beare the triall of Scripture, nor of the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches example?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is the Bishops power of appointing a minister no wayes determinate to this or that minister? then it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his meere will determineth of the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, without any just reason. For if there be certaine causes or reasons which the Bishop is bound to follow in designing of this or that minister, rather then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, then is the Bishop determinate.

All Classicall Divines do consent to that which Iunius setteth downe, Conc. 5. l. 2. c. 6. n. 73. that no Bishop can send or appoint a Minister, <hi>sine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ac justa ecclesiae postulatione,</hi> without the certaine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choyce of the Church: <hi>Id enim esset obtrudere, non mittere,</hi> for that were to obtrude him, not to send him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How is the course of Gods plow preserved, when for the most part the succeeding Minister is thrust upon the people against their wills, and so pernitious conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions arise, of which the Bishop is cause procreant and conservant, by depriving the people of their minister, and obtruding his owne minister upon them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him in all those courses whereby he grieveth the poore people.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As the Minister hath no faculty in himselfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a successor, so hath not the Bishop neither of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by himselfe.</p>

                  <p>IN the last place, the Defendant bringeth forth to answere the words of the Apostle, 1. Thess. 5.22. <hi>Abstaine from all appearance of evill.</hi> But as this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not found at all in that page of the Abridgment which he citeth, so in the words or sence which he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe, I dare say it is not used either of them, or any other against the ceremonies. Yet let us heare his answer. <hi>The Apostle speaketh</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of the opinions of

private men.</hi> But 1. what warrant hath he to restraine a generall praecept, when the universalitie of it agreeth wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why must appearance of evill be needs understood of <hi>opinions onely?</hi> two or three interpreters indeed do understand it of doctrine most properly: but the most otherwise; and the word translated <hi>appearance,</hi> signifying rather an object of seeing then of hearing, leads us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the eye, as in actions, gesturs, garments, then to the ear in doctrines. 3. For that which he addeth of <hi>private</hi> mens opinions, there is no circumstance of the text, nor any reason or authority that doth warrant such a glosse.</p>

                  <p>AMong his accusations wherein he chargeth us with manifold scandalls, the first is, that <hi>some weak ones by occasion of these differences, stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and so become more remisse in profession or religion.</hi> Where 1. it is to bee observed, that when wee spake of weake-ones sect. 12. it was putt off with this pretence, that they were such as we had catechised. Now then, who are these weak-ones? I hope the Bishops provide that people of their Diocesses are well catechised: whence then is this weaknesse. 2. Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in matters of circumstance are not wont to breed scandall, untill some authority injoyne uniformity, as we may see in the primitive Churches. 3. If differences be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:245:438"/>
of this scandall, surely those that differ from us, may as well be accused therefore, as we that differ from them, especially when we urge nothing of ours upon them, but they impose their owne devices upon us, and so are causes of the differences. 4. The amazement which some have, wondring what will be the event of differences, is no <hi>damnable error,</hi> which by the Def. is required to a scandall, sect. 1. And if they grow remisse in religion upon it, that is their sinne. I am sure zeale against superstition, and for pure and undefiled worship, hath no fitnesse in it to work remissenesse in religion: but urging of humaine devices in Gods worship, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth directly thither.</p>

                  <p>THe second charge of scandall, is in respect of the <hi>Separatists.</hi> Where 1. I aske, if <hi>Gaius</hi> had made a separation from the Church wherein <hi>Diotrephes</hi> lived, whether the Apostle Iohn had beene cause of that scandall, because he condemned his abuse of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Ioh. 3.9.10. 2. If any separate from chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where Images are retained, who is the cause, they that dislike of Images, or they that retaine them? 3. The dislike of Ceremonies is not the cheife cause for which separation is made: but the intollerable abuses which are in Ecclesiasticall Courts, by which it commeth to passe, that many poore men being troubled at the first for a small thing, afterward are driven to flye the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and flying with a hatred of such courses, are ready
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:245:438"/>
to receive that impression which is most opposit unto them. The thing it selfe is plaine enough to all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men, that Ecclesiasticall corruptions urged and obtruded, are the proper occasion of separation.</p>

This assertion which is given as a reason, is evidently false. For in Scotland, France, the Low countries, and such like Churches, where none of these ceremonies are retained, the power of Gods word (which doth not depend on humaine Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (is as effectuall to the conversion of Papists, as in England. 3. How doth this agree with that which the Defendant hath so often told us, that <hi>our ceremonies are not the same with the Papists Ceremonies</hi>: and that <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists have no great conceit of our ceremonies,</hi> cap. 2. sect. 11. 4. If our contentions about these things bee a scandall to the Papist, let them looke to it that cast these apples of contention into the Church, under the pretense of peace and uniformity. 5.

then any (I might say then all) of the Bishops in England, with all his Ceremoniall observations. 6. It is well knowne that there are farre more Papists and Popishly affected in those places where ceremonies are most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, then where they have beene difused. 7. It is answered in the Abridgement, pag. 47.48. that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are not for the aedification of the Papists, but for the hardening of them. And that Papists are not so much to be respected as brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the latter of which words, the Defendant replyeth with a descant upon the tearme brethren, sect. 20. but sayth nothing at all to the purpose. 8. What manner of converts they are usually who are addicted to humaine ceremonies, we may see in the Archbishop of Spalato, and such others.</p>

                  <p>THe greatest scandall of all (sayth the Defend.) is against the Church. Now this Non-conformists are made guilty of two wayes: 1. comparatively in this section, &amp; then absolutely in the next. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative accusation is, <hi>that we for avoyding of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brethren, grievously offend our mother, in that wherein wee owe obedience unto her.</hi> Where 1. the quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is taken for granted, for we deny that we owe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the ceremonies to any man or society of men. 2. If our mother be somewhat angry, that is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently a scandall by his definition, sect. 1. but when shee is provoked to a mortall errour. Now what <hi>mortall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> doe we provoke the Church to? Our desire and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:245:439"/>
scope is, that the Ceremonies should be either wholly removed, or else left free to use or disuse: this is no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall errour, I hope. The event by accident is the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, depriving excluding, and molesting of us for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity: This indeed is a great errour and sinne of the Prelates: but as was formerly shewed, the beginning of it is in their irregular Canons, and the ending of it, in the cruell executions. 3. By applying our selves to the will of the Prelats in these Ceremonies, wee should, though not anger, yet greatly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>candalize them, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them in a sinne of making their owne will a rule to the Churches, even in mysticall ceremonies of superstitious worship, contrary to their and our daily prayer, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> 4. The convocation doth not carry herselfe like a mother toward us: neither doe we acknowledge any such honour to belong unto it. As for the faithfull congregations of England, the greatest part of them would willingly be rid of these burthens.</p>
                  <p>The rest of this Section is nothing pertinent: yet two things may bee noted in it. 1. <hi>An errour that the number of Iewish Proselites was great, and the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles few, Act. 15. 2. A grosse assertion, that after the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Indifferency in eating of meats, was made publicke by the Church, then to have sought by abstaining to avoyd the offence of some, had beene to the prejudice of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and to the scandall of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other accusation of <hi>contempt,</hi> is onely objected Sect. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>1.</hi> when as he confesseth, he hath no windowes to look into mens consciences by, what rule of religion will permit him to cast upon his brethren such a suspition contrary to their profession, of practising and speaking against their consciences for gaining of a poore contribution? Is there not farre more cause to thinke, that great livings, and worldly honors (one of the choicest darts that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath in his quiver, and therefore tried against our Saviour himselfe when all other failed, Mat. 4.8, 9.) is it not more likely I say that these promotions beare more sway in the mindes of our great Prelates, then a poore supply of necessaries with others? 2.

Perkins and other such lights of our Church, have with that kynde of life done more good then all our Cathedrall men with their great revenues. 3. Who are the cause that many are forced to live upon contribution? have not the Loiterers of Cathedrall Churches ingrossed a great part of that maintenance whereby labouring Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers should be maintained?

that either they must be supplied by contributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else by begging? Nay, doe not the people in divers places take it for a great courtesie at the Non-residents hands, if he will take his Tithes and suffer them to procure and maintaine to themselves an honest minister in his place? have not our honourable Parliament offered to provide some competent maintenance for the Ministers, if the Clergie would forbeare their sinfull excesses? 4. Why should the Ministers depend so much upon contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they had such accommodative consciences, as this Def. surmiseth of them? Some of them with ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the time, and the addition of Simony, might come to be Bishops: and the rest might be preferred by their meanes to some certaine incomings.</p>

                  <p>NOw we are come to the sixt and last generall Argument, viz. that <hi>the imposition of these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is opposite unto Christian liberty.</hi> Here the Def. observeth first, that <hi>the state of this quaestion is about liberty from the necessary observation of such things as are in their owne nature indifferent. This</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Objector implyeth.</hi> But I answer, the Objector doth not imply it: he speaketh of ceremonies lawfully appointed by man, that these are to be used as things indifferent. Neither if one private Obj. had granted it, ought it therefore to be sett, downe as the received state of the quaestion, seeing the Abridgment, which in the defence is chiefly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, doth every where deny the cerem. to be in their

If there be doctrinall necessity, in all those humaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, which have properties attributed unto them essentiall unto divine ordinances, then our ceremonies in controversie not onely have such a mysticall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation attributed unto them as is proper unto Divine Ordinances; but also that they are imposed as parts of Gods worship. 4. For the three properties, which the Def. mentioneth, they are such as Papists in imposing of their ceremonies (which yet by the judgement of all our Divines deprive men of Christian liberty) doe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:245:441"/>
disclaime. As for <hi>immediate binding of mens consciences</hi>; no learned Papist useth such a phrase. <hi>Azorius</hi> a Iesuit <hi>instit. mor. parte 1. lib. 5. cap. 6.</hi> sayth expresly, that humaine lawes doe not bind, <hi>directe, proxime, &amp; perse: directly, immediately, &amp; of themselves. Bellarmine</hi> also, <hi>de Rom. pont. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>ad arg. 9.</hi> sayth as much: <hi>Leges humanae non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligant sub poena mortis, nisi quatenus violatione legis humanae offenditur Deus,</hi> i. e. <hi>they doe not immediately binde mens consciences.</hi> For <hi>necessity to salvation,</hi> the same <hi>Bellarmine de verb. non script. c. 11.</hi> sayth plainly, <hi>That those things which are simply necessary unto salvation are sett downe in Scripture; and that the rest are not simply necessary.</hi> And it is plaine enough that they doe not hold them <hi>altogether unalterable</hi> by that authority which brought them in: for beside, that no reasonable man can deny so manifest a truth, they have altered many ancient Rites, as all the learned know.

                  <p>HEre an objection is fained out of the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pag. 34. I say fained, because there is none such found in the place quoted. That which is there spoken concerning other Popish ceremonies, is a sixt proofe of the second Argument, distinct from the fift, wherto that of Christian liberty doth belong. That also is handled by the Def. c. 3. l. 7. and there maintained against him. So that this might well be omitted. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is some force in the consequence, let us heare his Defence. The objection which he frameth is this: <hi>If these Ceremonies do not take away our Christian liberty, and in snare the consciences of men, by their imposition: how shall not the Popish Ceremonies be excusable, and free from accusation in this behalfe?</hi> His answer is, that <hi>Popish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies doe infringe Christian liberty, both in regard of their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:245:443"/>
nature, and also in regard of their number. And of both these M. Calvin giveth witnesse.</hi> I answer 1. for the <hi>nature,</hi> it hath beene shewed before, that a multitute of Popish Ceremonies have no other nature &amp; necessity allowed unto them by the learned Papists, then ours have by the Defendant himselfe. See for this <hi>Bellarmine de effect. sacr. c.</hi> 30. That which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Calvin saith of this point is true, notwithstanding in regard of the conceit which is commonly among the simple Papists, fostered by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Monkes, Friers, and other Priests, for filthy lucre sake. 2. The comparisons which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Calvin use, viz. <hi>That it is held among the Papists a greater wickednesse to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt auricular Confession, then to live impiously: eat flesh on fasting dayes, then to live in fornication; to worke on Saints holy dayes, then to act mischiefe, &amp;c.</hi> These he gathereth principally fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that practise of the Papists, whereby they punish more severely the breach of their Ceremonies then of Gods Law. Now this is not onely practised by our Prelates, but also maintained by this Defendant, chap. 2. sect. 12. with such faire pretence, as the Papists may well use for the Defense of their practise. 3. As for the multitude of Ceremonies among the Papists, that maketh their bondage greater then ours; but doth it make ours none at all? Besides, when a few mysticall humaine Ceremonies are admitted, the gate is set open for a multitude: even untill the Convocation will say there be too many. For Bellarmine himselfe will grant that Ceremonies are not to be multiplyed over much. <hi>Fatemur Ceremonias non esse nimis multiplicandas. de eff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacr. c.</hi> 30. but what is too much, that must be left to

seeing the most part of the Bishops, men greatly renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for all kinde of learning and godlines, had rather leave their office and place in the Church, then against their owne conscience, admit of such garments, or at the least signes of Idolatry and Popish superstition, and so defile themselves wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For without doubt that is Satans intent, by casting a seed of dissentions amongst the Bishops. And that hee aimed at the infancie of the Church, by stirring up discord betweene the East and West Churches, about the Passover and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of that kind. Therfore Irenaeus Bishop of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had just cause in his Epistle sent out of France to Rome, sharply to reprove Victor the Pope of Rome, because he out of a kind of zeale, but not according to knowledge, was minded to excommunicate all the Churches of Asia, because they celebrated not the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over just at the same time, as they at Rome did. For this was nothing but by an unseasonable desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same Ceremonies in all Churches to rent and teare a peeces the unity of the Churches. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so soone as I heard that so great a ruine hanged over the Church of Christ in that kingdome, presently, in respect of that dutie which I owe to the Church of Christ, to your gracious Majesty, and to that whole kingdom, intended to write thither, and to try by my uttermost endevor whether so great a mischiefe might possibly be withstood: some that feare Christ, and wish
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:245:447"/>
well to your Majesty, exhorting me to the performance of this duty. But when I had scarcely begun to thinke of this course, behold our most illustrious Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to doe it, which command of his did not onely spurre me on, who of mine owne accord was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready running, but laid a necessity of writing upon me. Wherefore this my boldnesse will seeme the lesse strange unto your gracious Majesty, seeing my writing proceedeth not so much from mine owne will and counsell of friends, as from the commandement of my most Noble Prince, who is one of your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties speciall friends. Now I thought I should doe a matter very worth the paines taking, if first I should humbly admonish your most famous Majestie what your dutie is in this cause: and secondly, if as your humble suppliant I should beseech you for our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christs sake, to performe the same. I beseech your gracious Majesty to take this my writing in good part, for it proceedeth from a Christian love toward the Church, and from an especiall reverend respect that I beare to your most gracious Majesty. The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things. Now to the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Apostle writing to Timothie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that prayers be made for Kings, and all other that be in authority, and saith, that the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ordained, is, that wee may lead a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet life in all (that is, perfect) godlinesse and honestie, he teacheth plainly enough what is the dutie of Godly Kings and Princes, namely, that they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:245:448"/>
take care, and bring to passe, that first &amp; above all things, true religion, and the true worship of God, where it is banished, bee restored, and being restored, bee kept pure: all things which smell of impiety being farre removed. Secondly, that men may live honestly and holily, all kinds of uncleannesses beeing abandoned. Lastly, that publicke peace &amp; holy friendship be maintained among the subjects, all occasions of contentions being, as much as possible may be, taken out of the way.</p>
                     <p>As the Apostle teacheth manifestly, as we have seene, so all learned men who bee of sound judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Magistrats office, doe with one consent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that these be the three chiefe parts of the office of the Prince, and of every godly Magistrate. Which thing being so, I see not how your gracious Majestie can with good conscience, propound againe the garments in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other things of that kinde, smelling as yet of Popish superstition, and once banished out of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the consciences of the Bishops <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> to be taken on againe, and so propound them that you should compell them by your commandement to receive them againe. For first, this is quite contrary to the first and chiefe part of the Princes office. For if the Magistrate ought to have a chiefe care, that the worship of God be kept pure and without mixture; and if for this cause all things are to be abandoned which may any way either by themselves, or by accident defile this worship: and therefore all things are to be called backe as much as may be, to the rule of God, and to the former and Apostolicall, and so the more pure and simple forme of religion: Finally,

if as the Apostle commandeth, we bee to abstaine, not onely from all evill, but also from all appearance of evill; to what end, I beseech you most renowned and most godly Queene, should those things be brought againe into the Church of God, by the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which be contrary to the purity of the Apostolicall worship, which smell of Popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which bee neither availeable to the aedification of the godly, nor to order, nor for ornament, except that which is whoorish: which lastly, can bring no profit, but on the contrary, many evills to the Church? It is out of all doubt, that by this law concerning apparrell, all godly men will bee offended, but the wicked will laugh in their sleeve, and hereby be putt in hope to get many moe things: as for those of the middle sort, that is, such as be newly converted and turned from ungodlines to godlines, and be not as yet well grounded, they will be in great danger, and if we speake according to mans judgement, they will rather looke back to the old su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, to which by nature wee are inclined, then fixe and fasten their eyes upon true religion. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a decree which will bring no avancement at all to godlines, but may much further ungodlinesse. For though these garments be not evill and uncleane of and by themselves, that is, of their owne nature, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the former and late abuse, they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from uncleannesse. Certainly it cannot be denied, but that they will at the least, give occasions of many evills and very grievous superstitions. Now the very occasions also of evills are to be shunned. To what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:245:449"/>
end then should these be thrust upon the Church, from whom no profit can be hoped, very much evill may come? for this is to tempt God. Your famous Majesty may well remember, that not without cause it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Hee that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it</hi>: that the Apostle had reason to command, that we should purge out the old leaven, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe. And that Hosea did not foolishly reprove the Iewes, because they translated and brought a yong graffe (of superstitions) out of Israel into their owne garden, that is, the true Church. We ought, most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Queene, to have nothing at all to doe with the Papists in matter of religion, save in those things which they have common with the Apostles. Why, I beseech you, were some kings, otherwise godly, reproved and blamed in the Scriptures, that they had not taken away Churches or Temples for divine service in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which were built by holy Fathers ere the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, in which the Lord was wont to be worshipped? Surely, because the Temple being now builded and ordained for divine service, God would not have any footsteps of any other chappell at all to be extant. Therfore also when once the kingdome of Christ was manifested, the Ceremonies and garments of Aaron ought not any more to take place. For this cause the Apostles were upon good ground carefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that after Christs ascention, they should so be taken away, that no relickes of them remained. And if they tooke them away holily, unholily have the Papists called them back againe. Now whether is the better to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:245:449"/>
godly simplicity of the Apostles, or the ungodly pompe of the Papists, who is ignorant? This recalling of such Popish garments, your gracious Majesty may beleeve me, will be a greater evill, then peradventure it may be seene, even to very wise men at the first blush: For me thinkes I see and heare the Monks crying out with very loud voyces in the Pulpits, both confirming their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in their ungodly religion, by the example of your gracious Majesty, and also saying, What? doth not even the Queene of England also, a most learned and a most prudent Princesse, beginne by little and little to come back to the religion of the holy church of Rome, the most holy and sacred vestments of the Clergie men being taken on againe? we are to be in good hope that the day will come, wherein she will at length, though now they be thought to be dead, recall also all the other Rites and Sacraments of the holy Church of Rome. These and such like words, no doubt, most prudent Queen, the Monkes and Iesuites will use in the Pulpits. For they take all occasions to confirme their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore to recall these stinking garments, and other rubbish of the Popish Church into the Church of Christ at this time, what is it but to give the Papists an occasion, and the best that may be, to confirme and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themselves and theirs in their superstitions, and also to helpe them in this businesse? But let us heare what the Prophet said to Iehosaphat King of Iuda, when he helped Ahab; <hi>Darest thou helpe the wicked, and love those who hate the Lord? For this thing the wrath of the Lord is upon thee.</hi> And what other thing will this be, then even
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:245:450"/>
to call backe the weake from the studie of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to give them a privy warning to looke backe, and returne into Aegipt? It is an easy matter for us weak men, who of our owne nature are prone to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to slide backe to impiety. Therefore occasions of sliding backe to ungodlinesse, ought to be taken away, and at no hand to be given. And what else, I pray you, meant God in forbidding to plpw with an Oxe, and an Asse, to sow the same field with diverse kinds of seeds, and to weare a garment woven of linnen and wollen together? It is an odious &amp; detestable thing with God, that the same field of the Lord should be tilled by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly &amp; godly Bishops together; If in the same Church Popish Doctrine be taught with the Doctrine of the Gospell: Finally, if Sacraments, Ceremonies, and Rites, partly Apostolicke, and partly Popish, be used, and the Church be cloathed with them as with a garment of linsey-wolsey. For what agreement hath light with darknesse? And therfore those things which be not of God, but f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And who knoweth not that these garments are a part of the houshould stuffe of that Romish Seducer? <hi>There shall cleave nothing of the execrable thing, sayth hee,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:245:450"/>
to thy hand, that the Lord may turne from the fiercenesse of his wrath, and multiplie thee, as he hath sworne to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore to bring these garments, seeing they be houshold stuffe of Antichrist, into the Church of Christ, what is it else then to provoke God to anger, and to kindle his fury against us? Certaine it is, that he who is a true friend of Christ, will never seeke to have the ornaments of Antichrist in his owne house, and much lesse will he suffer them in the Temple of Christ. For who can indure the armes of his enemy in his owne house, and specially in the chiefest roome of the same? And if God will haue a thing destroyed and abolished, who are we that we dare build it up againe. But it is Gods will that after the death of Christ all garments of Aaron and Levi should be abolished: and he hath plainly enough manifested every where, that in these our dayes he would have all ungodly and vaine cerem., pompes, deceits, and paintings of the Papists driven away by the shining brightnesse of the Gospell: because these things have no power in them to kindle and increase godlines, but greatly availe to the quenching of the same. Neither verily can I see to what other end these garments tend, then in very deed (that I may now come unto the second head) to defile and disgrace the faire face; nay, the whole body of the Church of England reformed according to the <note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:245:451"/>
Now who can allow or judge this to be tolerable. Wherfore though for no other, yet for this very cause, such garments ought not to be thrust upon the Church of Christ, because that harlot of Rome hath abused, and doth still at this day abuse them (though in their owne nature they be not evill) to evill, and to cover her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, or rather to entice men to commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For all these pompes, and Popish ceremonies are nothing else but whoorish paintings invented and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised for this end, that men might thereby be allured to spirituall fornication. Is it not therefore a filthy and dishonest thing, to have these in the Church of Christ? If the brasen serpent, which had beene ordained of God, and that for the wholesome use of the Israelites, was taken away by godly King Ezekias, because the Israelites had abused it contrary to the word of God: and if Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kias be highly commended for this so doing, because hee had turned that Serpent into ashes, and commanded them to be cast into the running water, that there might never be any print or signe of it extant any more; how much more then are these uncleane garments to be banished out of the Church of God, seeing the Apostles never used them, but the whoore of Rome hath used them in her Idolatrous worship, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men? For it is a very dishonest thing, that such things as are of themselves indifferent, and have beene long used to the dispight and dishonour of God, should be retained in the Church of God, to the hazard of the salvation of godly men. And much lesse that kinde of garments, which is nothing but an invention of men,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:245:451"/>
or rather of the Divell himselfe, devised to seduce the simple ones: Wee all know what praise those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealthes deserve, which make good lawes that the subjects shall not weare out-landish and strange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, nor bring it into the Common-wealthes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a corruption of good and honest manners, and of the Common-wealthes themselves.</p>
                     <p>How then can that counsell which is given to your Majesty, be commended, to witt, that garments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Christian world in that time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and Apostolicall men, should be brought into the Church of Christ. And if an out-landish kinde of attire be not tolerated in well-governed Common-wealthes, how much lesse are Idolatrous, and heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish garments to be borne with in the Church, where God is to be worshipped in spirit and truth, and where he would have few and very simple Ceremonies? Also if God established by his Law, that a woman may not putt on a mans apparrell, nor a man a womans, the one beeing so well of it selfe dishonest, and contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the other: Why then should godly Bishops, <note n="†" place="margin">

Why should wee not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as wee be of a divers religion from them, so also be discerned from them, at least in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of such duties as belong unto Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by outward signes, such as garments be? Verily this was Gods will, and he required of his people,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:245:452"/>
that it should be discerned from the prophane Gentiles, as by other things, so also by a divers sort of apparell, and so should professe by this publicke signe, that it would have nothing to doe with the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>And why should not wee doe the same? Are wee not the people of God? abides not the equity of the same commandement? And if the word honest be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived of honour, what honour will it be for the church of Christ to have Bishops attired and disguised with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish visors in the administration of the Gospell and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, so as they shall rather be derided then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced any whit by the people? And what commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation shall it be for your gracious Majesty in true Churches, and among true beleevers, that you permit such trifles to be called back into your Church?

                        </note> Bishops be compelled to receive such visors, neither is it indeed a matter worthy of honour and praise, neither deserveth it the name of vertue. For if your Majesty should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that all English men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving that ancient and very grave and comely attire, should weare Turkie coats, or a souldiers weed, as it is called: who would ever approve this decree as honest? And it is much lesse praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if godly Bishops be enjoyned, laying aside, or at least changing the honest and ancient apparell, which the Apostles wore, to wit, that common and grave habit, to put on the ridiculous &amp; execrable or accursed garment of godlesse Mass-priests.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the third part of the Princes dutie, there is nothing fitter to trouble the publicke peace of

the Church then this counsell. For every novelty, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in religion, either by it selfe, if it be evill, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs and troubles a good peace, or if it be good, gives occasion of trouble by accident, by causing contention betweene evill and good men. But as in things which be good of themselves, of which nature the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches according to the will of God is, we are not to care for the troubling of that ungodly peace, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t is of the world (for Christ came not by his Gospell to keep such a peace, but rather to take it away, &amp; to send a sword) so assuredly, by the urging of things indifferent, to trouble the peace of Churches, and to cause strife betweene good men and bad, yea betweene godly men themselves, is so wicked, that it can by no meanes be defended, so that Ireneus had just cause to reprove Victor Bishop of Rome, for this cause, as hath beene said afore. For it must needs be, that at such times the Churches be rent in peeces, then which thing, what is more hurtfull? Many exemples in the histories of the Church prove this which I say. How many and how great troubles arose in the Primitive Church, betweene those who beside the Gospell urged also circumcision and the law, and betweene those who upon good ground rejected them? And how great evills would this dissention have brought to the Church of Christ, had not the Apostles betime withstood them by that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell gathered together at Ierusalem, by a lawfull exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and discussing of the cause by manifest testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scriptures, and by sound reasons? If your gracious Majesty (as you ought) desire both to be and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:245:453"/>
to seeme Apostolicke, then imitate the Apostles in this matter. Neither lay and impose this yoke upon the neckes of Christs Disciples your selfe, nor suffer it to be imposed by others. But if you see that the Bishops dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree about this matter among themselves, assemble a Synod, and cause this controversie to be examined by the Scriptures. And then looke what shall be proved by plaine testimonies, and strong reasons, propound that to be observed by all., and command by your decree, that that be observed, and so take disagreement out of the Church. For your gracious Majesty ought to be very carefull, that there be no innovation in religion, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God. By this means shall a true peace, concord &amp; unity of the Churches be preserved. But if the proceeding be otherwise, what other thing will it be, then to take away unity, and to trouble the Christian peace? And this I may not passe over with silence, that by this novelty of the busines, not onely the publick peace shall be troubled in that kingdome, but also many else-where out of that kingdome will have occasion given them to raise new contentions in Churches, and that to the great hinderance of godlines, and the more slow proceeding of the Gospell. For all men know, that the most part of all the Churches, who have fallen from the Bishop of Rome, for the Gospels sake, doe not only want, but also abhorre those garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and that there be some Churches, though few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the former, which doe as yet retaine those garments invented in Poperie, as they very stifly retaine some other things also, because the reformers of those
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:245:453"/>
Churches, otherwise worthy men, and very faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, durst not at the first (neither judged they it expedient) utterly abolish all Popish things. But as the common manner is, every man likes his owne best. Now I call those things a mans owne, not so much which every man hath inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nted, as those beside, which every man chooseth to himselfe, receiveth, retaineth, and pursueth, though they be invented to his hand by others. But if there be also annexed the examples of other men, they be more and more hardened in them, and are not onely hardened, but also doe their uttermost endeavour by word and writing, to draw all the rest to be of their minde? Therfore wee easily see what the issue will be, if your gracious Majesty admit of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which some doe give you, to take on apparell, and other more Popish things besides. For some men, who be not well occupied, being stirred up by the example of your Majesty, will write bookes and disperse them throughout all Germany, of these things which they call indifferent, to witt, that it is lawfull to admit of them, nay that they be altogether to be retained, that Papists may be the lesse estranged and alienated from us, and so we may come the neerer to concord and agreement. As if forsooth the Papists, though we for peace sake admitted of all those things, would ever amend their Doctrine, and banish out of their churches, or at any hand lay down their false and godlesse decrees, manifest and abhominable superstitions and idolatries: and there will be some who will answer such bookes once dispersed. So of this English fire there will rise a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:245:454"/>
a new burning flame in Germanie and France, on which hot coles the Papists as so many Smiths a forging, will sprinkle cold water to make the flame the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And is not this a goodly benefite? Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not see that this counsell tends to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of all Churches.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, that golden saying of a certaine learned man is very true and certaine, and approved by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that indifferent things, that is, the question about indifferent things, is that golden apple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. So much shall suffice to have spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of publick peace; what should I say of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of private beleevers? It is manifest, that they are greatly troubled with this commandement, to put on these linnen garments. For they doe so greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that their lamenting voyces and grones doe reach unto, and are heard in Germany. Now how grievous and distastfull an offence it is to trouble the consciences of the godly, the holy Scripture sheweth: partly when it commandeth that we make not the holy Spirit sad, neither offend the weak ones; partly when it threatneth griveous punishments against those who feare not to do these things: partly also when it propoundeth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Saints, and specially of Paul, who speakes thus: <hi>If meat offend my brother, Ile eat no flesh while the world standeth, that I may not offend my brother.</hi> For in those words he giveth a generall rule, by his example, taken out of the doctrine of Christ, to wit, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing is to be admitted and yeelded unto, much lesse to be urged upon others, and least of all to be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:245:454"/>
commended by decree: if in the admitting, urging, and commanding of it, the minds of good men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the faithfull be offended; for a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which feareth God, is a thing most pretious and acceptable to God. How therefore can that counsell be approved, which would have a law established and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the Princes command for the use of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be used by Ministers in the ministery. For (to speak many things in few words) if such garments be to be propounded to the faithfull, they are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded either as indifferent, or as necessary: if the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wee doe ungodlily, because we make those things necessary, which Christ would have to be free: If the former, then are they to be left free to the Churches. But by commanding and compelling, we make things that be free and indifferent, to be necessary, and so fall into the same trespasse. Moreover, either they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God by Moses, or they be delivered by Christ God manifested in the flesh, or they be ordained by the holy Ghost working and speaking in the Apostles, or they are of men, either godly or wicked. Those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies &amp; Leviticall garments, which were ordained of God by Moses, ought all of them to have an end after the death of Christ, as the Scriptures shew plainly, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Epistles of Paul to the Coloss. and Hebr. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be revoked and called back without the transgression of Gods will. It cannot be sayd that Christ taught them, because there is no word extant to that end, but rather he taught plainly oftentimes, that all Moses his Ceremonies were ended. And the same
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:245:455"/>
I affirme concerning the Apostles. It remaines therefore that they be sayd to be of men. If they be from godly men, then were they ordained of them, either to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or for order and comelines. But they availe not to edification, that is, to further comelines, but rather tend to the overthrow of it, as we saw before; neither for any good order, but rather they tend to disorder, for there is a confusion of godly &amp; wicked Bishops, wheras it is meet and equall, that one of them be discerned from another, even by their garments also. Neither doe they make Christs spouse comely, as we shewed a little before. Therfore we ought not to yeeld unto them. And such things as have beene invented by men, voyd of Gods Spirit, doe nothing appertaine to us. Lastly, the Apostles used not these garments. For we have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke testimony. Now the church is to be fashioned after the rule of that Apostolicall Church in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and garments, as well as in Doctrine. What doe wee then with these garments in the Church? By whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can they be approved? What profit or wholsome use can the Christian people have by them? But on the contrary we have shewed that godlinesse is weakened by them, the pure worship of God is violated, Popish supersti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

those things which God would have to be destroyed, are hereby builded againe by us; the whole face of the Church is defiled and disgraced: there is a foule sinne committed against honest and good lawes forbidding the putting on of strange &amp; outlandish garments: and so the whole Church is dishonoured, Besides the publicke peace of the Church, yea of many churches is troubled: one Bishop is set against another, the consciences of the godly are troubled, and the minds of good men are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, Gods spirit is made sad in them, and this apple of contention is cast, as it were, upon the table of the Gods.</p>
                     <p>Now seeing the matter stands thus, most gracious Queene, not onely I, but all my fellow-ministers, and all the godly prostrate before you, intreat your Majesty, and for Iesus Christs sake, whom we are perswaded you love from your heart, we humbly beseech your Majesty not to embrace that counsell aforesayd, neither to give eare to such counsellors.

Let your Majesty rather bend all your thoughts, authority and power hereunto, that first and above all you may have Bishops, who be truly godly, and well exercised in the holy Scriptures, as by the blessing of God you have very many, and that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:245:456"/>
you make much of, and give eare to them. Secondly, that you be carefull that with all diligence they may discarge their office, watching over the flock, teach sound doctrine, confute heresies, drive away Wolves, keepe every man in his owne calling, and exhort and stirre up every man to lead a life beseeming a Christian. The Elders also and Deacons, are to be admonished, that every one be diligent in his owne office, and if need be, they are to be compelled by your gracious Majesties authority, that neither the former by their sleeping and winking at the misdemeanors of the flock, suffer the reines to be loosed to all licentiousnes, and to the lusts of the flesh; neither that the later, by reason of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate care for their owne private businesses, neglect the poore people of the Church, and omit such other things as belong to their office. For these three sorts of men be the very sinewes of the Church, upon whom the salvation or destruction of the Church doth chiefly depend. Furthermore, your gracious Majesty ought to use great care and diligence, that the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and in them good and godly teachers, be well looked to, cherished, liberally maintained and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for these are as the mothers, and nurses of the Churches, in which and by which those are to be fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, borne, brought up and adorned, who being fit, may be called from time to time to rule and governe the Churches. Last of all, such things as cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amended by the word and discipline of the Church, as it is necessary, that according to Gods word they be cut off and taken away by the sword of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:245:456"/>
so your gracious Majesty is to take care of them: as adulteries, blasphemies, and other capitall crimes of that sort. For God hath given the Magistrate the sword for this end, that ungodly seducers, filthy knaves, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet men being restained, the rest may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlines and honesty. This is the matter (most gracious Queene) whereon you are to spend your thoughts, hereabout are your counsells to be occupied, here is all your strength to be shewed, namely, that (to end in a word) we all denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and worldly lusts, may live soberly, justly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily in this present world. For this is the true and fairest garment of all other. For which every man ought to take care, to wit, that having put off the old man with his workes, we put on the new man, that is, our Lord Iesus Christ, neither are there any other true ornaments which become Christian Bishops, besides those which the Apostle hath laid downe in his writings to Tim. and Tit. <hi>A Bishop must be unreproveable, the husband of one wife, watching, sober, modest, harborous, apt to teach, not given to wine, no stryker, nor given to filthy lucre, but gentle, no fighter, not covetous, one that can rule his house honestly, having children under obedience in all honesty, not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oward, not angry, righteous, holy, &amp;c.</hi> For garments and ornaments of Aarons high Priest, were types of these true orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; those were the shadowes, these be the body. Wherefore let those be gone, and let these abide still. And then at lenght shall we have the whole Church, and so the Bishops rightly and truely apparrelled.</p>

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:245:457"/>Once again I humbly beseech your gracious M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>jesty, that thinking no more of those outward garments, you will mind and consider how these true and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ornaments may be retained, put upon, and kept in the Churches. And as I said in the beginning, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your gracious Majesties clemency, you will be pleased to pardon my boldnesse in writing. Our Lord Iesus Christ long preserve your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Majesty safe and sound to us, and to the whole Church. From Heydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. 10. Septemb. 1571.</p>
