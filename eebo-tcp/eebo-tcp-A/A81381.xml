            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have oft times Ruminated in my Retired Contemplation, how fitly man might be compared to a flower, which as it produces hony, ſo doth it poyſon; the one being a Cordial nouriſher, the other a Contagious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of mans nature, yet both the radice of one original: The metaphor is eaſily digeſted to an ordinary apprehenſion; mans nature being ſo prone and apt to yield to almoſt every attractive motion that attempts to draw it, &amp; is ſo far from being a permanent Jewel, that it may be ſaid to be an uncertain momentary nothing; which who ſo diſcreetly reads, the enſuing Treatiſe, cannot but witnes: and will ſurely find the Spider of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled vanity had ſuckt ſo much poyſon from that eye pleaſing, but ſence offending, flower, (given over to work vanity) that had not that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cridlyingenuous Be, of a converting goodnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the aſſiſtance of that precious flower his ſoul, probability concludes that the <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> &amp; <hi>Spider</hi> of impiety had doubtles extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fire, and converted to poyſon the hony
<pb facs="tcp:118918:3"/>
that lay treaſured there, and ſo made an object of pity of him whom Charity in joyns me to ſuppoſe a happy ſubject of mercy. And truly as to a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo to a <hi>Camelion</hi> may man fitly be alluded, that can aſſume any ſhape but white: intimating that though we could become lewd and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either to ryot or rage, yet not we but it muſt be ſomewhat Heavenly that makes our ſcarlet Tranſgreſſions white as ſnow, innocent &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And ſince the holy Spirit lays down this as an aſſertion, that more were converted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident then precept, I am confidentto preſuppoſe that whoſo reads conſiderately the inſuing lines will readily acknowledge this to be a Preſident for Converſion, and a Precept for Conviction, of ſuch as ſtand either in, or well affected to, thoſe Impieties.</p>
            <p>And as I cannot but much condemn the paſt part of his life being diſhoneſt, ſo muſt I of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity commend his reſolution to become a new man for the future, the reſidue of the time he hath to live: And that the world may receive benefit by it, as well as himſelf, therefore hath he ſolidly and pertinently laid open the myſtery of their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. And ſince that God himſelfe hath ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:118918:3"/>
there is joy in Heaven over every ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, God forbid but that which makes Heaven rejoyce ſhould exhilerate us, and ſo make the earth to be lifted up in mirth and triumph for that act of bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>And as I commend him and joy for him, ſo I do heartily wiſh that it may occaſion more joy, by working powerfully on them that ſhall peruſe it, that ſo his joy might be their joy, and that the joy of us all; that ſo with the Bee we may ſuck hony out of the ſtincking Hemlock, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Maxim, <hi>Foelix quem faciunt aliaena pericula cautum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do alſo much commend the noblenes of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that having deſerved of his Country to die thinks himſelf unworthy in the ſame to live, and ſo freely exiles himſelf, that having wrongd her by his abuſes, he may ſhew his willingnes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite her, and regain his own loſt honour, by writing in bloudy Characters the heroick evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a manly ſpirit on the Carkaſes of her enemies; and as it is his ſeemingly earneſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, let it be our real care and labor to fly from evil to do good, and thereby attain what follows, To live for ever.</p>

            <p>BEfore I appear to be judged by your diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, know I appeal to Mercy not to Juſtice, the one may give me life, though the other require my death; and the ſin-pardoning God of mercy give me a heart that may live anſwerable to what I now profeſſe, and to abominate what heretofore I have practiſed, and let Charity expiate what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may condemn me or diſpleaſe you; and look not on me as an impious <hi>Saul,</hi> and therein a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the innocent, though I must readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have deſerved it, but as another, a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Paul,</hi> which I humbly pray I may live worthy of, that ſo if I ſhould meet with my old Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and they upbraid me with what I was, I may anſwer with a Holy man to him, Such a one as thou art was I once, but ſuch a one as I am wilt thou ſearce ever be. And Charity being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians proper ornament, nay the crown of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, I hope to find your Chriſtianity in pardoning my past Offences, which with joy I find Heaven
<pb facs="tcp:118918:4"/>
hath remitted: For now remains Faith and Hope (both which are ſweet to my ſoul) and Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity; ſince then all remain, they are of uſe, and their uſe is to refreſh the ſoul, and if <hi>the</hi> ſoul then a ſoul, &amp; ſo mine.</p>
            <p>And if your expectations make you inquiſitive to know the Cauſe of my appearing in Print, let your patience lead you to peruſe the Diſcourſe it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Introduction will ſatisfie your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. I could inlarge on that ſubject were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neceſſity for it, but my indeavors centure in a deſire not to write much, but to be brief and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and to that extends what I have there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, which I judg ſufficient, and then to add were ſuperfluous, though I readily acknowledg it ſeems to me neceſſary to explain the original Cauſe that led me to that Licentious Courſe of life, but that were to open a wide wound in the credits of thoſe to whom I owe my education, when that time may be better ſpent to heal my own; but in a word, it was their too tender love that ſupplyed my youthful fancy with ſuch a redundancy of Coyn, that prompt me on to ſuch exorbitant prodigality, that my eſtate, though competent to maintain me in credit, was too little to ſupply my immoderate
<pb facs="tcp:118918:5"/>
extravigancies, which cuſtome and Company had wedded me unto. I had a purpoſe ſome months ſince, to have done what now I have accompliſhed, but ſome contradicting fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſmothered theſe intentions for a time, till being ingaged in an out Land Imployment, I determined when my fate ſhould ſend me to the Seas, to ſend a ſmall Tract to the Preſſe, that ſo when I went into foreigne Nations abroad, this might undertake a traſicking voyage at home, to the commodity of my native Nation.</p>
            <p>And I am bold to think no man will wonder at my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure concealing of my ſelfe, ſince to own the Subject might reflect diſparagement, not onely on me but on my Family, for gladly could I embrace the ſhame, being ſenſible of my own deſerts: So that though Heaven hath been gracious to forget, I deſire ſtill to remember my own unworthineſſe, not for ought, but that thereby I may be humbled, and God glorified that in mercy hath ſhewed mercy, which the Lord grant unto us all Grace here, that we may have Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

make my ſelf hatefull in the eyes of my miſdemeanors, by ſhewing its nakedneſſe to the World, that ſo I hateing it, it may alſo abominate me, and inveterate enmity rend our late amity to a perpetuall diſcord, and I become an example to others to ſtear their action by a ſcale of piety, leſt doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, expoſe them as it did me to the greateſt exigent Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which divine providence having ſnatched me from, I intended by its aſſiſtance to become a friend to my Country, by being an enemy to my late Company and Courſes, which were obnoxious and exorbitant, which when I embraced in the armes of an undaunted reſolution, I thought thoſe my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt courſes legitimate, and far more noble then the eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed babe of baſeneſſe, and ſneaking way of borrowing, arguing thus though inconſiſtent with honour, that it was far better taking of a purſe by violence from a ſtranger, then borrowing not intending to pay, and ſo with a complement to rob my Friends, and familiar acquaintance, when the former was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually repay'd by the Country being loſt on the Rode, ſo that many were better able to beare, contributing to my wants, then one or two, or a few: when and to which I neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor with a thouſand oaths ſware to repay them, as they that borrow moſt uſually do: thus I was, and others are, poor wretches deluded by Sathan, who tels the Quarrellor that to affront a meek Man is noble, and the Envious, that revenge is ſweet, repreſenting ſin in its falſe dreſſe, that ſo it may neither be unpleaſing to the Cautious, nor terrible to the Fearfull, but conformable to every diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>But the better to ſtifle and overcome theſe temptations, let us conſider firſt that every action hath its proper end, if it be good, the end will be anſwerable, for the end though it come laſt, it is firſt propoſed, and guideth the whole courſe, thence it is that I giving the raines of my actions to deboyſtneſſe, had well-nigh ended in deſtruction here, which leades to a greater hereafter, theſe ſerious thoughts hereof in my reſtraints fixed a conviction on my conſcience, that the end of ſin cannot be happy, becauſe there remaineth ſome thing to come after it, which the ſpirit of truth ſaith is death, the due wages of ſin, and it is want of the thoughts of the end, that makes the end

Take occaſion to make ſome ſtaie, then note whether they ſtaie, or keep their pace, or elſe alight and go on foot that you may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them; follow ſome half an hour aftet a ſlow pace, and if you overtake them, take heed, for that's the ſureſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of a Thief: The other uſual marks of Thievs bee theſe, which as you ride you may diſcern ſo plain, that you need not doubt the truth of what you think. They muffle their faces with their cloaks, or elſe their cloak or coat hides all their cloaths; they have a hand-kercher or ſcarfe, which with their hand they'l rear up to their eies, over their faces juſt when they bid you ſtand.

Next, they muſt keep civill hours, for fear that through miſtruſt they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; therefore it's their chief care to take their Inn betimes: and more, they hardly dare adventure in the dark, becauſe they cannot ſee either your dangerous defences, or their own advantages, or ſpie piſtols or other private wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: and you have time your mony to convey from them, and divers other advantages the day denies; but ſince this is ordained for reſt, I can ſay no more, but 'tis my beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to keep yom from the dangers of the road: and 'tis a general rule with high-way-men, to keep their ſtation upon the greateſt roads, that of thoſe number which paſſe by, they may ſelect ſuch as they think are richeſt prize: but on your petty rodes, where ſcarc any uſe to paſs; they never uſe to come: there you may paſſe ſecure: which I adviſe you chooſ if poſſible you can, rather then on great reads.

but take my counſel here, when e're you ride in fear, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ride far aſunder, a Buts length at leaſt, and then bee ſure they will never attempt to rob you, when your ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling order will give ſome of you leave undoubtedly to eſcape, and to raiſe the Countrie in their purſuit: Beſides, their Company is ſet in ſeveral parties, when ſhould you ride in a cluſter, they will ſurely ſallie out; and ſeiz their purchaſe; when if they ſhould fall upon a ſtragling partie, before they can do any thing it's ſtrange but reſcue comes, which eaſily will make the Cutters flie.</p>

nay, and with grief I ſpeak it, ſome ſilly fellow newly crept into office ſearches and enquires, and by Authoritie ſeizes poor Travellers, as far from wrong as they from wit and knowledg, thinking by this falſe apprehenſion to get cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and be eſteemed double-diligent, when they poor harmleſſe ſouls, now under hold, though free from guilt, do oft-times loſe their lives for what they never were once ſo much as privie to; therefore to regulate this errour, and that you may avoid the like, take my advice, and then I hope you'l find and ſecure the right offender: and ſo to do, with all poſſible ſpeed ſcour the next great Road, not ſtreight before, but either on the right hand, or on the left; and if you miſs them, then conclude they are ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome Inn which you have paſt, and therefore obſerv my good advice, and you ſhall ſurely find and apprehend them, as thus; If you have miſt them, ſet ſome careful Spies with a ſufficient aſſiſtance near at hand, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you'l ſee them come that way without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of fear; and if (becauſe I have betraied the ſecrets of their Trade) they leav this uſe, I am ſure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their wit, nor the Divels aſſiſtance, can ever deviſe the like again; and I ſeriouſly proteſt, I ſee no way for them to flie with fafetie, or the leaſt hope to eſape: But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if they light of any conſiderable ſumme, then they rid that night to their randezvouz in the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which is too ſure a ſhelter for them; but with a real heart to fright them from that waie, who I cannot draw from it with advice, I will purſue them hither with the beſt inſtructions for their apprehenſion; but obſervantly take notice, for here is as eminent an example of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie as any ever the Divel inrich'd their knowledge with; for if you are robb'd in the Eaſtern quarter, purſue them not in the direct road to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Hue and Crie,</hi> for by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118918:20"/>
ſome other way they are fled; therefore haſt to the Citie, and in <hi>Weſtminſter, Holborn,</hi> the <hi>Strand,</hi> and <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden</hi> ſearch ſpeedily, for there they are. If Northward they light on you, then to <hi>Southwark,</hi> the <hi>Bank-ſide,</hi> or <hi>Lambeth</hi> they are gone, and ſo of the Weſt and South; and when you find them, ſeiz all you find, for they are all Companions that are together.</p>
                  <p>Thus they alwaies do contrive to take thoſe places where they may moſt ſeemingly be ſafe from dangers of purſuits, and in thus doing as I have ſhewed you, they think the Citie is between them and the <hi>Hue and Crie,</hi> and they ſecure; and ſo before the ſearch comes to them, as it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome goes ſo far, they have time enough to ſtay, and then be gone. Thus have I laid ſuch a forme of Inſtructions for the <hi>Hue and Crie,</hi> as if obſerved, they cannot eſcape his hands.</p>

Which veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the old Proverb uſed in diriſion of the like acts: To ſhut

the ſtable-door when the Steed is loſt: 'tis not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ever the Thief ſhould come to make a needleſſe breach to thank the Groom for feeding of the beaſt ſo wel, and rubbing, dreſſing, and looking to him with honeſt care: for juſt ſo it muſt needs fare with them that ſhould igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly come to the ſame place where they ſeized their prize, knowing this cuſtome to be in uſe, but ſay they ſhould com there, and at that time the watch is ſate; I really proteſt, I ever held that road that had a watch upon it, to be the ſureſt and beſt place for purchaſe. For firſt the honeſt Travellours ſuppoſes it impoſſible for them to be robb'd, being guarded thus, which makes him careleſſe to ſecure himſelf, becauſe they fear not; whilſt alas! the Thievs do what they liſt, and freely paſs, and the watch men ner'e the wiſer; for they ſtand on that place commanded for their ſtation, and move not from it, when 'tis indifferent with the Thievs when he lays hold on what he looks for, his booty, which where hee ſingled it out, all places are alike to him, and ſo another's as good as that: ſo that the coaſt be clear in ſight; and when he hath done the deed, he may ſecurely paſs the watch, who cannot diſcern or know him from another man, but lets him paſs for honeſt. For I never paſt them, but they gave me civil language: 'tis true, they bid me have a ſpecial care I was not robb'd, when in truth it was my trade to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others: but then ſuppoſe they had examined me, I would have anſwered them with ſuch reſpect and civil lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and praiſe the work they ſtood to do, that they could not ſuſpect me; and I have known ſome of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cutters, that when examined, have carried themſelvs with that diſcretion, that to incourage them to be careful in their place, hath thrown twelve-pence, or a half-crown piece but newly borrowed, where they never mean to paie, that they have promiſed to drink his honeſt health. Nay,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118918:21"/>
ſuppoſe they ſhould ſuſpect me and my Companie, alas! they are poor ſilly old men, that are decrepid, weak, and altogether unable to make reſiſtance, and good for nothing but to loyter there; for I have ſeen a dozen ſuch ſtand all together with Halberds, Pikes, Pitchforks, and Clubs, amazed and frighted, not daring to ſtir to reſcue them that were diſtreſs'd; whilſt we before their faces have bid men ſtand; aſſaulted, ſurpriſed, and rifled ſuch as we liked; when we had done it, and were upon the gallop, then they faintly crie, Thievs, Thievs: Stop them, ſtop them; when none but Trees and Hedges that heard their clamours: and I have known ſome that by way of parly have grown familiar with them, and watcht opportunity, and ſeazed and bound them hand and foot; then in a ditch have charg'd them on their lives to lay ſo quiet that none may hear them: and then like a ſafe guard, ſet to preſerve the Travellour from wrong, with the watch-mens bills have ſtood with confidence till booty come that way, and then made bold as with authority to ſtop and hold ſuch as they think have coyn, and on pretence of ſearch for what was lately loſt upon the way: if they find purchaſe worth the takeing, ſeaz it and be gone: ſo that a watch doth hurt, not good. But if you needs will have it ſo, chooſ luſty able men, reſolved and yonug, arm them with bows and arrows, Muſkets, or good Carbines, or Fowling-pieces, and with a horſe or two let them coaſt up and down: this may do good, that they may not be ſo abuſed as I have ſhewn, but if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bee, may follow on to purpoſe; and this is my advice proceeding from experience.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Divers Inſtructions for the <hi>Inn-keeper,</hi> how to know Thieves from his honeſt Gueſts.</head>
                  <p>THus have I traced them from their firſt entrance to their action, and from their action to their flight, and I hope therein given ſo clear light to thoſe that deſire their apprehenſion, that yet may occaſion either their Converſion, or Impriſonment, and that their Conviction; and having ſpoke ſufficiently unto the Travilor to be carefull in his carriage in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: Give me leave to add a word unto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Inn-keeper, that ſo he may diſcern between the honeſt Travilor and the Thief, which I ſhall perform in a word; which to doe, let him make it his chiefeſt care not to wink at ſuch diſhoneſty for hope of gain, leaſt that ſweet be imbittered by futer trouble and diſgrace: therefore let thy reſpects, who ever thou art that reads in this, be levelled at honeſty more then gain, knowing that a certain little with a godly peace of contentment, is a greater gain, and a higher hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, then an uncertain deal with a terrour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And to diſcover them is eaſie, if you obſerve my Rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let the Oſtler obſerve and he ſhall diſcern their extraordinary curioſity about their Horſes, they muſt be ſtrangely dreſt, and as ſtrangely fed, with maſhes, bread, and mingled provender, and that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118918:22"/>
in an unuſuall quantity; and if he wonder at this, they cannot forbear but praiſe their Tricks, and ſhew how by their good abilities they doe deſerve it, and ſometimes they will boaſt their worthy ſervices will ſoon repay the coſt, or ſome dark words to that effect, that are palpable grounds for to ſuſpect them; and then they will ask, whoſe Horſe is that, and what is the owner, that ſtands there? what function is their Maſter? what manner of men? whither they travell, how far, and when? So by his anſwer they ſurmiſe which will be the richeſt purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>And, ſecondly, if you note their Clokebags, they are empty, onely they carry them to make a ſhew.</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly, when the Chamberlain has uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured them to their Chamber, he ſtrait is ſent away; but let him hearken, and if they are ſurely Thieves, tis ten to one, but they fall to ſhare what prize they have got that day, and let him prie narrowly into their Chamber and he ſhall ſee them ſhare as well as hear the money, and every one ſhall take what is his lot; this they never defer, if they have had any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, leſt he that hath the purſe ſhould cheat the reſt: this done, they hug each other, and then they knock in haſt, complaining at his negligence that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and call for Sack, and then they want my Hoſts company, whom with the higheſt ſtrain of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſalute and bid him welcome; but if my Hoſt mark their diſcourſe, he may conjecture much, and know what men they are, as alſo by the ſaucy carriage of their men; and if their ſeverall Names you do inquire, injoyn your ſervants to doe the like, and you ſhall ſoon perceive they have more Names
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118918:22"/>
then one a piece; and when they are at ſupper let ſome one haſtily knock at your gate, and bid him that attends obſerve their carriage then, and he ſhall ſee them ſtart, as in a fearfull maze, and ſtare each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the face with gaſtly looks, and if you are in the Chamber, ask what Officers are thoſe? who doe they look for? Or if forth from them, ask aloud that they may hear, what would Mr. Conſtable have? who doth he ſeek? or what is the Conſtable mad to knock ſo haſtily, or the like: and if they ſeem much frighted, bid them not fear, none ſhall come up or offer him that wrong to ſearch his houſe, ſo to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, for he has no gueſts but honeſt Gentlemen, and if they command him, he will uſe his authority that none ſhall enter; there by this you may prie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their private thoughts ſo far, that they will confeſs ſomething, and reply, they ſhall be much ingaged for your ſuccour, and then you may uſe your own diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>And you may ſee by their needleſſe ſtay, their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of time, what they expect, for they but bait to ſtand and gaze what purchaſe they can ſee go by, and when they have ſpied a likely money booty paſſe by them, they pretend immediate buſineſſe calls them to be gone.</p>
                  <p>And when they come to take up Inne to lodge, they commonly come in divided, and come in ſeveral companies, to fruſtrate the Hue and Cry as to their number: beſides if one part be ſurprized the other may eſcape; and when the reſidue comes in, they ſeem as ſtrangers, and of mine Hoſt they will enquire what their Companions are, and what Country-men,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118918:23"/>
whether he know them, and if they find he hath a jealouſie or ſuſpect either of them, they will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will ſome buſineſſe to be gone with ſpeed: but if for honeſt Travilers you take them, as it is like you may, in your kitchen they doe meet by ſeeming chance, they as mear ſtrangers one another ſalute, and drinking there together ere they part they become familiarly acquainted and conclude to ſup together, when if you mark them well you ſhall find by their behavior that they are not ſtrangers but boſome friends, there they imbrace, rejoyce, and praiſe their plot, and laugh at mine Hoſt, that he ſuſpect them not. The faireſt Innes they uſually frequent, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that they will not ſo much diſparage mine Hoſt, as to make ſearch among his gueſts, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are perſons of account.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I laid open their deviſes and deceits, that ſo the honeſt Traveller may eſcape their hand, and they fall into the hands of juſtice, thereby indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to repaire the wrongs my Country hath ſuffered, by indeavouring to prevent others from living in the like ſin, and ſo ſubvert ſin that would raiſe its own dominion by their fall and ruine; to which end that it may become effectuall, the Lord aſſiſt my indeavours to diſcover, and others by this diſcovery to apprehend them, and that apprehenſion expoſe them to the Law of juſtice, if they reject the Law of mercy.</p>

                  <p>BEing by a ſerious conſideration convinced how advatagious to a publick good, the diſcovery of every evill is, and finding that of Robberies to be of the greateſt magnitude, my own thoughts prompt me on readily to ſet a helping hand to the writing out of ſo eminent an evill, as that practiſed by ſuch as make a trade of ſin, whoſe wages is death, if once ſubjected to Law and Juſtice, and to the ſtopping of that Torrent whoſe ſtreams produce a double preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; Deſtruction to him that robs whoſe gain in the end is loſſe, and no ſmall damage to him that is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, who oft times is thereby undone: Therefore I ſhall indeavour to put a period to both, by in deavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to diſcomfeit the firſt, and inſtruct the other, ſo far forth as the beſt of my inquiſitive ſearch can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, either by report or Hiſtory; and ſo to doe, I ſhall firſt preſent unto your peruſall, what my ears preſented unto my Intelects the laſt Seſſions in the Old Bayly, concerning a Robbery acted within the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which when providence led me thither one afternoon, I heard there Examined before that Court of Judicary, which was thus.</p>

                  <p>ON the Wednſday before the ſaid Robbery was done, came unto the houſe of an ancient couple (whoſe many paſt careful years had competently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for their age) two or three ſtout luſty fellows to drink a cup of bear (for the ſaid aged people kept a kind of a vitling houſe) whoſe then in tentions without queſtion, were either to act, or to prepare for action of a Robbery there, as the people did in part miſtruſt, but ſeeing no advantage anſwerable to their deſires for that time they departed; and on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next following, they came again, diligently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all particulars, and viewed with ſo ſtrict an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation the ſtrength of the houſe, and aſked ſome ſuch doubtfull queſtions, that the peoples jealouſies became downright fears, or rather aſſurances, that they intended evill, but their juſt fears made them ſo obſervantly to heed their carriages, that no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity could crown them with their wiſhed for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, who ſeeing it impoſſible to effect any thing at that time, they departed alſo; but here obſerve the ſubtilty of thoſe villaines, as they went forth either to make water, or as they departed, they took an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mark on the outſide of the doorpoſt whether the bolts and locks wear within, that ſo thereby they might exactly know where the greateſt ſtrengrh of the door lay, that thereby with the more privitie and leſſe difficulty they might force it open; and ſo on the Sunday following, about midnight, they came and effected their wicked purpoſe, forced the doors, came

to their bedſide, ſwore to have either their bloud or their money, and ſo took about a hundred pounds in money, plate, and Jewels, and went their way; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt ſworn the aged people not to purſue them at that time.</p>
                  <p>By this may people learn to be cautious of ſuch as they ſuſpect, and to be carefull to fortifie their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with competent ſtrength; and if they are lone people, like thoſe, not to keep ſuch ſums or goods of value in their houſe.</p>

                  <p>ANd for thoſe that are of this function, they are Governed by Laws and Orders, as an hiſtorian of that fraternity relateth.
