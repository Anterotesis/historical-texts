            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now these bare verses and barren Epitaphes bringing no better frute but the death of some one or other, makes euery line vnwelcome that showes no cheerfull newes: but time that discouers all accidents (and death in his fury) brings pardon by the trueth that is found and such as in seasonable time do truly vtter that becomes them, are halfe excused though their boldnes be great: So neither fearing the open barker that makes a great bruite, nor the priuie byter that makes a great wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your sweet censure I offer these plaine Epitaphs that follow, partly to make you beleeue I am mindfull of my promise, and cheefely for that I know my L.

               <l>A world of wit it would containe, and please the readers well.</l>

               <l>And many a woorthie Towne to yeeld, so fearfull was his name.</l>
               <l>A King that made Kings stoop, and held them all in awe:</l>
               <l>When he him selfe did neuer droop, for any thing he saw.</l>
               <l>A King that took no wrong, of none in deed nor word:</l>

               <l>That rul'd by course in Senate seate, whilst glasse of life did run:</l>

               <l>Exprest an hye and noble spirit, and knowledge great withall.</l>
               <l>His silence spake by stayed lookes, but when he moou'd his tongue:</l>
               <l>Like tinging bell of siluer sound, the Counsell chamber ronge.</l>
               <l>His inward man was arm'd and clad, with priuye coate of proofe:</l>

               <l>No malice, wrath, nor angry rage, nor sullen nature strange:</l>
               <l>Could mooue his minde in all his age, nor make his manner change.</l>

               <l>To Princ and state a member fit, that Country could not spare:</l>
               <l>Right sharp of sence, profound of wit, of iudgement deep and rare.</l>
               <l>To suters all of nature good, but to the Princes men:</l>
               <l>A ready help from root of hart, with head, with hand and pen.</l>

               <l>His promise wrought performance straight, yet ware &amp; wise to speak</l>
               <l>Not won with gifts or worldly sleight, that makes men promis break.</l>
               <l>But drawne by iudgement and desart, to showe his godly zeale:</l>

               <l>LEaue off to write, spare speech a space, be mute O muse of mine:</l>
               <l>Let blubring teares bedeaw thy face, O waile with weeping eyne:</l>
               <l>The course of life that drawes but breth, in dollor all his dayes:</l>
               <l>Till hart stringes burst, till hower of death, til pilgrim goes his wayes.</l>
               <l>Vaine pomp is but a puffe or toy, so is both rule and raigne:</l>
               <l>For all that heere we do enioy, is nought but woe and paine:</l>
               <l>Hast thou not seene the highest tree, receiue his falling blowe?</l>
               <l>Death hath respect to no degree, when life from hence must goe.</l>
               <l>Satte <hi>Leyster</hi> not in Senate seate, as hye as man might clime?</l>
               <l>Was neuer heere, none halfe so great, nor happy in our time.</l>
               <l>Yet loe, a so daine leaue he tooke, and went where God assignd:</l>
               <l>His Brother that like <hi>Mars</hi> did looke, a man of noble minde.</l>
               <l>Who all good men did praise and loue, is packt from vs in poste:</l>

               <l>His glasse is run, his date is doone, and he must bid farwell:</l>
               <l>to all the pleasures vnder Sunne, and all that heere do dwell.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Warwick</hi> that won great good will, too soone was hastned hence:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Warwick</hi> was most warlike still, to stand in rightes defence.</l>
               <l>To serue the Prince, his pursse, or power, was euer ready prest:</l>
               <l>Like Fortresse or like stately Tower, in armes among the best.</l>
               <l>To spread in feilde the ragged staffe, against all forraine foes:</l>
               <l>As wind that driues both dust &amp; chaffe, in th'aire where te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest bloes</l>

In Court and Towne the world doth say, he neuer harmed wight.</l>
               <l>He kept the euen ballance iust, that eche man had true weight:</l>
               <l>He was a man of speciall trust, cleane voyde of craft or sleight.</l>
               <l>Most plain of words, most plain of deeds, plain dealing led him throgh</l>
               <l>Amid these briers &amp; scratching weeds, that wounds plain people now</l>
               <l>No storme nor change could make him turn, he stood like brasen wall</l>

               <l>At <hi>Norwich</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> raygne, amid ranke rebelles rage:</l>

               <l>No greefe, no tort, nor torment sore, could daunt his courage great:</l>
               <l>A Lyons hart in brest he bore, where hammers long did beat.</l>
               <l>Of one deuice or other still, and sounded like a bell</l>
               <l>To Gods great glory and his will, that conquered death and hell.</l>
               <l>To Heauen held he on his pace, for when his time he knew:</l>
               <l>He did but turne from freendes his face, and bad the world adew.</l>
