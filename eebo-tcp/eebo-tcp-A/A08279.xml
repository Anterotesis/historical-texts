         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as the heart (busied

neuer apprehendeth what
the mouth vttereth; neither
truly vnderstand they what
they speake, praying in a
language they know not:
And so turne their deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into sinne, being made
without vnderstanding, and
consequently, not of faith.
Moreouer they vse in their
prayers, a kind of humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which God requireth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:722:18"/>
not, superstitiosly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the auoyding of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
in going imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to God in
the name of strange media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
namely to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, to Angels, and
to Saints departed, prying
them by their merits to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for them to Christ
that he may pray to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for them. What a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
circumstance is this?
Hath not <hi>Christ</hi> our Sauior
louingly willed vs to come
immediatly and freely to
him, who is the sole and
onely mediatour vnto God
our heauenly Father for all,
that faithfully and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
come vnto him? There
is none, in and by whom we
can be saued, releiued or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:722:19"/>
defended, but in and by the
man <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs not to vse that kind
of humblenesse, which
should imply pride or any
breach of promise in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
as it followes if wee
think it too much presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to come immediatly to
him, but first to goe and
to pray vnto his blessed
Mother Angel or Saints, as
if he himself were of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and humour of earthly
Princes. It is far from him:
his children may freely
come to him: he disdayneth
them not for their basenes,
and therefore desireth not
to bee sued vnto by more
glorious persons, whom
they pretend he loueth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But this doth argue
that we thinke, He will not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:722:19"/>
bee as good as his wrod
where he saies: <hi>Come vnto
me all yee that are heauy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and I will refresh you?</hi>
Which is to make God a
Iyer, and Christ to haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in vaine. Hee saith not
come to me by the meanes
of my blessed Mother, holy
Saints or Angels. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is but a forged
humblenesse and a falselie
coyned meane to come to
Christ: but faith onely is the
meane to assure vs, that hee
is our onely Aduocate to
the father, to whom wee
come by Christ only and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
That praier, that men
make to God, in the name
of any besides Christ, is not
only no prayer, but a meere
derogation of the principal
part of his office, of being
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:722:20"/>
our only Mediatour. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
to goe to any besides
Christ, argueth a doubt that
either he cannot, or wil not
be as good as his promise,
where he saith,<note place="margin">Zeale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer

without faith, and
so become sinne vnto them
that thus superstitiously
pray. And I can not but
confesse also, that the most
religious praiers that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
men haue made; nay,
the very praier, that Christ
himselfe hath taught vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
most hard in it selfe;
may become vnprofitable
vnto them by proceeding
from an vnbeleeuing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling,
or vnreformed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:722:20"/>
heart, or proceeding onely
from the lippes, passing
from the mouth into the
Ayre, and vanishing with
the soud. Such prayers; as
they proceede from vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
hearts, are like vnto
<hi>Cayns</hi> offering; howsoeuer
foolishly accounted deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
these are but the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of fooles: who would
be seene to offer accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
incensce: and behold
hypocrisie! they would
seeme to glorifie God; and
behold blasphemy!</p>
               <p>There is a kinde of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which God requireth
and accepteth:<note place="margin">The prayer which God accepteth.</note> and is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper to the truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
And that is made som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in words, sometimes
by sighes, and groanes;
which cannot be expressed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:722:21"/>
and sometimes in silence
without vttering any sound
yet all very auailable with
God, who seeing and serch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart knoweth what
we inwardly desire, and
seeth wherof we haue need.
And these secret and silent
prayers, proceeding from a
faithfull heart, are far more
effectuall, then the verball
praiers which the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
may vse, with the like
words, as the godly do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
to the same seeming ends.
And yet the same prayer is
not to them both the selfe
same praier: the one hauing
but the shadow, the other
the substance: the one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but with the lippes, the
heart estranged; the other
with the spirit, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Therefore is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:722:21"/>
one of no force, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truly effectuall. These
two kindes of prayers, may
be resembled vnto two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ordnance: whereof
the one is charged with
powder onely; The other
with powder and a bullet;
Eyther of them takes fire a
like: and that which hath no
bullet, giues as great an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and audible report,
as the other; But the first
batters not, as doth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
although they seeme
to ayme both at one mark.
So hee that hath not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and faith, may
haue the like fire of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to enkindle the powder
of desire, but can neuer perse
the cloudes, the throne of
grace, with the bullet of
liuely faith: though the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:722:22"/>
tongue thunder out as loud
and clamorous acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as the other: yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
carries with it both
powder and bullet, both
voice of the tongue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
of the heart, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to worke the intended
effect with God. And the
force of the other perisheth
with the sound.</p>

by our generall slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in praier, that we hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue <hi>Christ</hi> vpon his

carnall man hath worldly
meanes to supply his wants,<note place="margin">How the carnal man commeth vnto God, and how, and when he prayeth.</note>
or to free him from danger,
he will hardly seeke God by

hee feeles no present

him of their goods in

keepe their goods to the

but vpon meere extremitie.
<hi>Pharoh</hi> neuerentreated <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

the one ceasing, the other

when the water ceaseth, the

long since gone to their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;

For euery carnall man in his
owne nature, extendeth his
confidence onely so farre as
he hath visible and carnall
meanes. <hi>Quantum habet
nummi, tantum habet &amp; fidei,</hi>
We trust so farre as we see
probable carnall meanes in
naturall reason, fit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
vpon: which failing,
Faith faileth. The couetous
man is called an Idolater,
because he puts his trust in
his riches: so may euery man
be truely called, that trusteth
in carnall means, whether it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:722:27"/>
be riches, strength, friends,
or other the like. And the
reuerence that men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yeelde vnto these meanes,
differeth not much from
that they doe vnto God:
onely what they pretend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God is ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but what
they do towards their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meanes is secret. They
seeme not visibly to kneele,
nor verbally to pray to the
meanes: but they in their
hearts preferre that they see
and enioy, aboue that they
haue but heard of; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the inuisible God.
And therefore rather then
they will diminish their
wealth, to doe good vnto
Gods people, as God hath
commanded, as touching
their abundance, they will
be bolde to straine a point of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:722:27"/>
Christian obedience, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giue ouer their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, and abandon
his presence with the <hi>Gerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
then to lend vnto God,
though they shall be assured
not only ten of the hundred,
but one hundred-fold more
then they disburse. And
therfore no maruell though
they neuer or seldome pray
vnto the inuisible God.
Their soules are not so deare
vnto them as their liues, and
their liues not so pretious as
their wealth: nay, liues and
soules are of smal value with
them, in comparison of their
worldly riches, and carnall
pleasures. Tell a rich world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that he ought to make
his praiers vnto God: hee
will in his heart aske you, for
what hee should pray; hee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:722:28"/>
hath wealth at will, as the
rich man in the Gospell; he
hath health at his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
his cattell prosper; his
corne, oile, &amp; wine abound:
for what should hee pray?
It is a strange exercise you
would draw him vnto, that
concerneth not his worldly
profit, or carnal delight. The
like may be also said of euery
meere carnall man, bee hee
poore or rich, who rather
then hee will embrace the
promises, and faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon the prouidence
of God, hee will aduenture

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:722:28"/>

vnto God for direction to

and therfore despise the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

passeth from his mirth to

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7. 8</note> For as Christ came not

they may be seene to kneele
at a piller to lift vp the eies,

And therefore the rich

as cousen germans may

not look for any applause at

according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
disposition of their
hearts and soules. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
not the person of
the rich, nor wise according

but according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

yet in the more dangerous

how riches wrought

of all diuine wisedome,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:722:39"/>
which is the life of faith.
And faith being the life of

rest with him in glorie; that
our bodies that are corrupt,
shall either die and putrifie,
or be changed, and in fine,
be glorified in the heauens.
And to apply all this to our

cannot but goe so farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

prayer which Christ taught
vs, we pray, <hi>Thy will be done:</hi>
wee must not therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attempt to aske, much
lesse to do any known thing
to the contrarie. But such is
our corruption, as howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we seem willing that the
will of God should be done,
we yet retaine a kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
desire that God would
doe according to our wills:<note place="margin">The will peruerts the mind.</note>
for naturally the will of man
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:722:56"/>
is neither rightly affected
towards his owne mind, nor
towards the will and word
of God. It is the rule of right
reason that the <hi>wil</hi> should be

contrarily and preposterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>will</hi> ouerswayes the

the <hi>minde</hi> begins to incline
it selfe to the sacred exercise
of prayer, the <hi>will</hi> as an vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
yoke-fellow peruerts
the minde, &amp; distracts it into
many noysom lusts, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thoughts. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the most godly and most
faithfully zealous man but
find in his deuoutest praiers:
and therefore wee ought in
our prayers to restraine our
cogitations from earthly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:722:56"/>
things; and the more wee
feele them to range here and
there (as sensibly wee may)
so much the more earnest &amp;
zealous we ought to be, and
so much the more watchfull
that they steale not away
our spiritual affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which
cause the minde to ascend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
vpward to the

               <p>OVr transgressions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
all from this,
that against the rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

will and our desires before
the most holy will of the

can we truly seek him whose
will our wills (as much as in

The Apostle sheweth the
reason, saying, <hi>The naturall

vnderstand the things of

subiect to the law of God, nor
indeed can be.</hi> How then can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:722:57"/>
the minde conceiue how, or
for what to pray? And how
can the will frame the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of vtterance and other
diuine affections? How can
it frame it selfe to pray vnto
God according to the right
rule prescribed vnto vs by

therfore al the praiers which
natural men make in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite

onely not profit them, but
turn rather vnto a curse then
a blessing vnto them. What
man is hee then knowing
this, will lie stil in his natural
corruption and ignorance,
hauing the way laide out
before him, the meanes of
direction offered him, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:722:58"/>
promise made vnto him, and
the reward assured him?
the way is Christ, the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in that way is the word,
the promise is to receiue
what wee aske, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is life eternall: the way
is straight, the direction
plaine, the promise iust, the
reward great. In earthly
affaires there is a continuall
common emulation who
may grow greatest, wisest, &amp;
most glorious, whose best
reward is but a vanishing
shadow. How foolish then
are wee to see and suffer all

best, but the last worke; of

And therefore the
most of them succeed to the

which hath been said of the

the reason why som men are

God, to bee guided by him

seeme to grow from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that if they should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde

and therefore couet rather
to conceale their counsailes
from God, and climbe vp to

held vp his hands &amp; prayed,
the Israelites for whom hee

steadily vpon the waters:
but when through a small

wauer in his faith, to stagger
betweene confidence and

may note the force and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the faith of the dearest
children of God, who beleue
constantly as long as all

but when a little tempest of

they beginne to faint. <hi>Iacob</hi>

through feare: for
the best are subiect to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
God when a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

And therefore casteth hee a

It is written that the Lion

sword of the spirit and the
shield of faith against him.
Although through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his malice to Christ
and his elect, he leaueth not
to tempt them, yet it is but
by starts and snatches, as hee
findeth them colde in their
spirituall exercises, as hee
found <hi>Dauid</hi> idle: or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

what got hee by betraying

they gaue him such an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
as afterwards hee
could neuer preuaile against
the force of their faith. It

to steale away our hearts
from the liuing God: these
are they that seeke to resist
our prayers, to peruert our
hearts in prayer, to estrange
our affections from heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things; and by no meanes
can we repell them, but with
spirituall weapons, as they
are spirituall enemies. And

Christ is the light in whome
whosoeuer liueth not, hee is
in darknesse. And hee that
hath but one day of light in
seuen, How great is his
darknesse? It is true, this day,
the <hi>Saboth</hi> was set apart by
God: that in it men should
imploy themselues, to serue
and to glorifie him. And in
that day they shuld not only
not doe but also not thinke
of anie Worldly affaires.
But are not some so far from
celebrating the name and
seruice of God that day,<note place="margin">The Saboth prophaned more then other daies.</note> as
they prophane it aboue all
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:722:140"/>

turne the glorie of God into

dicing, dauncing, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
gluttonie, and to what
sinne not? This commonly
is the day, that many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
for merrie companie,
to laugh, and to be jouiall, as
they call it, without meane
or modestie: And yet, this
day is sufficiently kept holy
as they thinke, if they spend
an houre in the fore part of
the day, and halfe an houre
in the after-noone, in the
Church: though all the rest
be consumed in most lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious

discharge the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that hath no care to

And how follow wee his

this? to his Countrimen, the

that are come, as it were, to
the Worlds period. And
therefore high time it is for
vs to looke vp, to watch, &amp;
pray, to liue religiously, and
soberly, least that the Master
of this great family come
suddenly, and find vs buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
swaggering drunken,
faithlesse, insolent, couetous,
and few or none doing the
seruice of our Master. It wil
bee a dreadfull sight, to see
him come with his iron rod
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:722:141"/>
in his hand to crush his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in peeces. The salt of
the earth, hauing lost it salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
shall bee cast to the
dung-hill. The Tree that
brings not forth good fruit
is hewen downe and cast in
the fire. The <hi>Magistrates</hi>
saltnesse is profession of the
Gospell, and the execution
of Iustice. The saltnesse of
the <hi>Minister</hi> is the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of godly life. The salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Fathers</hi> is their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
conuersation before
their children, and the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
them in the feare of
God, and holy life. The salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Masters</hi> of Families,
is to liue honestly, religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
aud gouerning their
charge in the feare of God.
And vnder these four estates
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:722:142"/>
of men, are all conditions
comprehended: subiects
vnder Kings; children vnder
fathers; and young men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
tutors and gouernours.
Euery of these, in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of superioritie and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie,
haue their seuerall
duties; and all vnder one
God, whome they ought all
to obey; Superiours in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanding; and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
in duly obeying. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these duties can bee
rightly performed without
knowledg of the wil of God
by his word. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not perfect without
practise: This practise is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
without faith: And
faith is known by the fruits;
the chiefe whereof is loue.
And this loue most shineth
and sheweth it selfe in doing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:722:142"/>
good to all, but especially to
them of the family of faith.
The greatest good, that can
bee done to the Church of
God, is Prayer. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth <hi>to
pray continually:</hi> not for our
selues onely, but, for Kinges
&amp; al the members of Christs
mysticall bodie. <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Magistrates</hi> ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Dauid,</hi> to accompanie
the people to the house of the
Lord: <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi>
ought to pray with and for
their Children and Families;
not on the <hi>Saboth day</hi> only,
but with all perseuerance.
Some refer the duty of praier
only to the Minister, and
thinke it a kinde of vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Ministers office, to
pray for or with any, but for
himselfe, contrarie to the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:722:143"/>
precept of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> Who
willeth that <hi>all men make
prayers, in all places, heauing
vp pure handes, without strife
or enuying, vnto the Liuing
God.</hi> Where it appeares, that
vnder the word <hi>all Men,</hi>
Kings, Princes, Nobles, and
men of all degrees, faculties
and functions, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
and because they
shall not thinke there is no
place but the materiall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he commands that dutie
to bee performed in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
euen in euery particular

bee done without strife and

For we know, that the

had learned this Prayer,
prayed often in other words,
albeit the Lords Prayer bee

let vs vse it as matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
