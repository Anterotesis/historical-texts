            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for that I wil be iniurious to no man, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in this action hath borne place, and well discharged the same, and that those men with the maner of their dayly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there, by name maye be knowne vnto you, I haue in their place remembred them in order as becommeth: and haue not onely named each principall, but euerye priuate person (if by any speciall seruice hee hath merited the same) to the ende, that the well deseruing man, receiuing the due commendation of his deserte, maye bee encouraged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and take pleasure in well dooyng after, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animated by like example, maye for hope of lyke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde also, desire to deserue well.</p>
            <p>By this Discourse, it may please your Honour to behold the greate industrie of oure present age, and the inuincible mindes of oure Englishe nation, who haue neuer lefte anye worthy thing vnattempted, nor anye parte almoste of the whole worlde vnsearched, whome lately, neither stormes of Seas by long and tedious voyages, daunger of darke fogs and hidden rockes in vnknowne coastes, congealed and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Seas, with mountaines of fleeting Ise, nor yet presente death dayly before their face, coulde anye whit dismaye, or cause to desiste from intended enterpises: but rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring an honourable death beefore a shamefull retourne, haue (notwithstanding the former daungers, (after manye perillous repulses) recouered their desired Porte. So that, if nowe the passage to CATAYA thereby be made open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, (which only matter hitherto hath occupied the finest heades of the worlde, and promiseth vs a more riches by a nearer way than either <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Portugale</hi> possesseth) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the hope (by the good industrie and greate attemptes of these men is greatelye augmented) or if the Golde Ore in these new Discoueries founde oute, doe in goodnesse, as in great plentie aunswere expectation, and the successe do
<pb facs="tcp:4786:5"/>
folow as good, as the proofe thereof hitherto made, is great, wee may truely inferre, that the Englishman in these our dayes, in his discoueries, to the Spaniarde and Portingale is nothing inferior: and for his hard aduentures, and valiant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, greatly superior. For what hath the Spaniarde or Portingale done by the Southeast and Southweast, that the Englishman by the Northeast and Northweaste hath not counteruailed the same?</p>
            <p>And albeit I confesse that the Englishe haue not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had so ful successe of profit and commoditie of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt place (considering that the former nations haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily chanced to trauel by more temperate clymates, where they had not onlye good meates and drinkes, but all other things necessarie, for the vse of man) all whiche things, the English, trauelling by more inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate places, &amp; as it were with mayne force, making waye thorowe seas of Ise, haue wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, which notwithstanding, argueth a more resolution; for <hi>Difficiliora pulchriora,</hi> that is, the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the more hard the more honorable: yet concerning the perfecter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, and Geographicall description, (wherin the present age and posteritie also, by a more vniuersal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is much furthered, as appeareth by my vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Mappe with pricked boundes here annexed) herein, the Englishman deserueth chiefe honor aboue any other. For neyther <hi>Spaniard</hi> nor <hi>Portugale,</hi> nor anye other besides the English, haue bin found by so great daungers of Ise, so neare the Pole, to aduenture any discouerie, wherby the obscure and vnknowen partes of the world (which otherwise had laine hid) haue bin made knowen vnto vs.</p>
            <p>So that it may appeare, that by oure Englishmens indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries, and these late voyages, the world is grown to a more fulnesse and perfection: many vnknowen lands and Ilands, (not so much as thought vpon before) made knowen vnto vs: Christs name spred: the Gospell preached: Infidels like to be conuerted to Christianitie, in places where before the
<pb facs="tcp:4786:5"/>
name of God hath not once bin hearde of: Shipping and Seafaring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue ben employed: nauigation and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, (which is the chief strength of our Realm) maintayned: and Gentlemen in the Sea seruice, for the better seruice of their Country wel experienced. Al whiche things, are (no doubt) of so gret importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as being wel wayed, may seeme to counteruayle the aduentures charges: although the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to CATAYA were not found out, neither yet the golde ore proue good, wher of both, the hope is good &amp; gret. But notwithstanding all these, euen in this (if no otherwise) hyr most excellent Maiestie hath reaped no small profit, that she may now stand assured, to haue many more tried, able, &amp; sufficient men against time of need, that are, (which with out vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be spoken) of valour gret, for any great adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; of gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good for any good place of seruice. For this may truly be spoken of these men, that there hath not bin seene in any nation, being so many in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, more ciuill order, better gouernement or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For euen from the beginning of the seruice hitherto, there hath neither passed mutinie, quarrel, or notorious fact, either to the slaunder of the men, or daunger of the voyage, although the Gentlemen, Souldiors, and Marriners (whiche seldome can agree) were by companies matched togither.</p>
            <p>But I may perchaunce (right Honourable) seeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course somewhat too largely, especially in a cause that (as a partie) somewhat concerneth my selfe: which I doe, not for that I doubt of your Honorable opinion already conceiued of the men, but for that I knowe, the ignorant multitude is rather ready to slaunder, than to giue good encouragement by due commendation to good causes, who, respecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a present gaine, and being more than needefully suspitious of the matter, do therwithall condemne the men, and that without any further respect, either of their honest intents, either of their wel performing the matter they dyd vndertake (whiche according to their direction, was speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:4786:6"/>
to bring home Ore) either else of their painful trauel (whiche for their Prince, and the publike profite of their Countries cause they haue sustained.)</p>
            <p>But by the way, it is not vnknown to the world, that this our natiue country of England, in al ages hath bred vp (and specially at this present abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth with) many forward and valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t minds, fit to take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any notable enterprise: wher by appeareth, that if the Englishman had bin in times paste as fortunate and foreseeing to accept occasion offered, as he hath bin alwayes forwarde in executing anye cause once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand: he had bin worthily preferred before all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the worlde, and the Weast <hi>Indies</hi> had now bin in the possession of the Englishe.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Columbus,</hi> the firste Discouerer of the Weaste <hi>Indies,</hi> made firste offer thereof, with his seruice, to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, then Kyng of Englande, and was not accepted: Wherevppon, for want of entertainement here, hee was forced to go into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and offred there (as before) the same to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Kyng of <hi>Castyle,</hi> who presently acceptyng the occasion, did first himselfe, and now his successors, enioy the benefite thereof.</p>
            <p>Also <hi>Sebastian Cabota,</hi> being an Englishman, and borne in <hi>Bristowe,</hi> after he had discouered sundrie parts of new found lande, and attempted the passage to CATAYA by the Northweast, for the King of England, for lacke of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, (notwithstanding his good desert) was forced to seeke to the Kyng of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to whose vse hee discouered all that tract of <hi>Brasile,</hi> &amp; aboute the famous riuer <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> and for the same, and other good seruices there, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes renowmed, by title of <hi>Piloto Maggiore,</hi> that is, Graund Pylote, and constituted chiefe officer of the Contractation house of <hi>Siuilla</hi>: in whiche house, are handled all matters concerning the Weast <hi>Indies,</hi> and the reuenues therof: and further, that no Pylot shoulde be admitted for any discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but by his direction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4786:6"/>But there hath bin two speciall causes in former age, that haue greatly hindered the English nation in their attempts. The one hath bin, lacke of liberalitie in the Nobilitie, &amp; the other wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of skill in Cosmographie, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whiche kinde of knowledge, is verye necessary for all our noble men, for that wee being Ilanders, oure chiefest strength consisteth by Sea. But these twoo causes are nowe in this present age (God be thanked) verye well reformed: for not only hir maiestie now, but all the nobilitie also, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perfect knowledge in Cosmographie, doe not onely with good wordes, countenaunce the forward mindes of men, but also with their purses do liberally and bountifully contribute vnto the same, whereby it commeth to passe, that Nauigation, whiche in the time of King Henrie the .7. was very rawe, &amp; toke (as it were) but beginning (and euer since hath had by little and little continuall increase) is now in hir Maiesties raigne, growen to his highest perfection.</p>
            <p>Thus right Honorable, as I haue in these my first trauels in these late voyages, vppon such occasions as passed there nowe, rendered your honour this bare and true accompte: So being further resolued to offer my self a continual sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with the first, for hir Maiestie and my country, in thys or any other like seruice, I intend (God willing) according to this beginning, if any thing hereafter fall out worth the memorie, to present your honoure therewithall, and from time to time, to aduertise you of euery particular. And in all these things which I deliuer now, or shal hereafter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise, I humbly praye, your honour woulde vouchsafe to giue some credite therevnto, and rather to thinke, I may be deceiued, than that I meane to deceiue, colour, or conceale any thing: for I neither can, nor wil, vse any flourish in the matter, but a bare truth in all: And therevpon I giue my poore credite vnto your honour in pawnne.

            <p>FOrasmuch as (ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle Reader) these three voyages lately by our Countreymen perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, do both for the matter of discouerie, for the strange and vnknovven accidentes, for the rare and hard aduentures, and also for the good and discrete order of gouernement, appeare aboue all others most notable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: I haue bin especially desirous, by all meanes possible I could, to procure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof, thinking it too great an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our common vvealth, to burie in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so vvorthy attemptes of our ovvne nation, and to hide the ensample of so good and so vvell a gouerned seruice. And for that (as I vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) many trifling Pamphlets haue bin secretly thrust out, not only vvithout the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Captaynes and executioners of the same, but also rather to the greate disgrace of the vvorthy voyage, than othervvise, I hauing intelligence of a substantiall discourse vvhiche vvas diligently vvritten thereof, and priuately dedicated to my very Honourable Mayster, Sir Christopher Hatton Knight, by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

of our men, their engines, and their policies in warre, than the ignorant and barbarous multitude in their days did to them, in celebrating their solemnities with all the honor that might be. But to drawe néere to my purposed scope, that is, to discourse of inuentions by way of discoueries, I say, that one of the excellentest artes that euer hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, is the Arte of Nauigation,<note place="margin">Nauigation.</note> which in times past was so raw, and vnknowen, that no man durst trauell by Sea, sauing only alongst the shore: and if by wind, currant or te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The vertue of this stone, as it is not long since it was first found, so in these dayes it is like to receiue his perfection, concerning his Northeasting and Northwesting to be brought in rule, &amp; particularly in this noble voyage of our worthy Captain <hi>Martine Frobisher,</hi> who, as you shall after vnderstande in the discourse, hath diligentlye obserued the variation of the Néedle.<note place="margin">The variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Needle,</note> And suche obseruations of skilfull Pylots, is the onelye waye to bring it in rule, for it passeth the reach of naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.

And that the things may séeme the lesse straunge, bycause i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First you are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, that the Sunne doeth worke his more or lesse heate in these lower parts by two meanes, the one is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the kind of Angle that the Sun beames doeth make with the earth, as in all <hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> it maketh perpendicularly righte An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, in some place or other at noone, and towardes the two Poles verie oblique and vneuen Angles. And the other meane is the longer or shorter continuaunce of the Sunne aboue the Horizon. So that wheresoeuer these two causes do most concurre, there is moste excesse of heate: and when the one is wanting, the rigor of the heat is lesse. For though the Sunne beames do beate perpendicularly vpon any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion subiect vnto it, if it hath no continuaunce or abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizon, to worke his operation in, there can no hote effect procéede. For nothing can be don in a momente. And this seconde cause, <hi>mora solis supra Horizontem,</hi> the time of the Sunnes abiding aboue the Horizon, the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4786:21"/>
neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, but regarded only the manner of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Sun beames made with the Horizon, which if they were equall and right, the heate was the greater, as in <hi>Torrida Zona:</hi> if they were vnequall &amp; oblique, the heat was the lesse, as towardes both poles, which reason is very good &amp; substancial: for the perpendicular beames reflect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberate in themselues, so that the heate is doubled, euery beame striking twice, &amp; by vniting are multiplied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue strong in forme of a Columne. But in our latitude of 50. &amp; .60. degrées, the Sun beams descend oblique &amp; slanting wise, &amp; so sthiketh but once &amp; departeth, and therefore oure heate is the lesse, for any effect that the angle of the Suns beames make. Yet, because we haue a longer continuaunce of the Sunnes presence aboue our Horizon than they haue vnder the Equinoctiall, by whiche continuaunce the heate is increased, for it shineth to vs .xvj. or .xviii. houres some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when it continueth with them but twelue houres al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>And againe, oure night is very shorte, wherein colde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors vse to abound, being but .6. or .8. houres long, wheras theirs is alwayes twelue houres long, by which two adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of long dayes and shorte nights, thoughe we wante the equalitie of Angle, it commeth to passe, that in Sommer oure heate here is as greate as theirs is there, as hath bin proued by experience, and is nothing dissonant from good reason.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whosoeuer wil rightly way the force of colde &amp; heate in any region, muste not onelye consider the Angle that the Sunne beames make, but also the continuaunce of the same aboue the Horizon. As firste to them vnder the Equinoctiall the Sunne is twice a yeare at noone in their Zenith perpendicular ouer their heades, &amp; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>alde a good while, before and after it come to the Meridian, so farre forthe as reason leadeth, I am content to allowe it, and therefore I will measure and proportion the Sunnes heate, by comparing the Angles there, with the Angles made here in England, bicause this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature is best knowen vnto vs. As for example, the .11. daye of Marche, when vnder the Equinoctiall it is halfe an houre paste eight of the clocke in the morning, the Sunne will be in the East, bycause there it ariseth alwayes at six of the clocke, and moueth euerye houre 15. degrees aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Horizon, and so high verye neare wil it be with vs at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the saide .11. of March at noone. And therfore looke what force the Sunne hath with vs at noone, the .11. of March, the same force hath it vnder the Equinoctiall at halfe houre paste eight in the morning, or rather lesse force vnder the Equinoctiall. For with vs the Sunne hadde béene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye six
y houres aboue the Horizon, and so had purified and clensed all the vapours, and thereby hys force encreased at noone, but vnder the Equinoctiall, the Sunne hauing béen vppe but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 2½ houres hadde sufficient to doe, to purge &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the colde and moyste vapoures of the long night, and as yet had wrought no effect of heate. And therefore I may boldely pronounce, that there is muche lesse heate at halfe houre past eight vnder the Equinoctiall, than is with vs at noone (<hi>a fortiori.</hi>) Butte in Marche, wée are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye contented to haue the Sunne shining, but we greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire the same. Likewise the .11. of Iune, the Sunne in oure Meridian is .62. degrées highe at London: and vnder the Equinoctiall it is so high after .10. of the clocke, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then it is beneficiall with vs <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it is beneficial to them after .10. of the clocke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:4786:22"/>And thus haue we measured the force of the Suns grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test heate, the hottest dayes in the yeare, vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, that is, in March and September, from sixe tyll af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tenne of the clocke in the morning, and from two vntill sunne set. And this is concluded, by respecting only the first cause of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te, which is the consideration of the Angle of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne beames, by a certaine similitude, that whereas the sunne shineth neuer aboue twelue houres, more than eight of them would be coole and pleasaunt eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs much more to them that are acquainted alwayes with suche warme places. So there remayneth lesse than foure houres of anye excessiue heate, &amp; that only in the two sommer dayes of the yeare, that is, the eleuenth of March, and the fourtéenth of September, for vnder the Equinoctiall they haue two som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, in March, and September, which are our spring and Autumne: and likewise two winters, in Iune, and Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which are our Sommer and Winter, as may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to him that hath onelye tasted the principles of the Sphere. But if the sunne be in eyther Tropicke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching neare therevnto, then may we more easilye measure the force of his Meridian altitude, that it striketh vpon the Equinoctial. As for example, the twelfth of Iune, the sunne will be in the first degrée of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Then loke what force the heate of the sunne hath vnder the Equinoctiall, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same force and greater, it hath in all that Paralel, where the Pole is eleuated betwéene 47. and 48. degrées. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the 12. daye of Iulye sustayneth more heate of the Sunne, than <hi>Saint Thomas</hi> Ilande lying néere the same Meridian, doth likewise at noone, or the Ilandes <hi>Taprobana, Moluccae,</hi> or the firme lande of <hi>Peru</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which al lye vnderneath the Equinoctial. For vpon the 12. day of Iune aforesayd, the sunne beames at noone doe make an <hi>Isocheles</hi> Triangle, whose <hi>Vertex</hi> is the Center of the Sunne, the <hi>Basis</hi> a lyne extended from <hi>Saint Thomas</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, vnder the Equinoctiall, vnto <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> neare

the same Meridian: therfore the two Angles of the Base,<note place="margin">In Iune is greater heat at <hi>Paris</hi> than vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial.</note> muste néedes be equall <hi>p. 5. primi, Ergo</hi> the force of the heate equall, if there were no other cause, than the reason of the Angle, as the olde Philosophers haue appointed. But by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at <hi>Paris</hi> the Sun riseth two houres before it riseth to them vnder the Equinoctiall, &amp; setteth likewise two houres after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by means of the obliquity of the Horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which time of the Sunnes presence .4. houres in one place, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, it worketh some effect more in the one place than in the other, &amp; being of equall height at noone, it muste then néedes follow to be more hote in the Paralell of <hi>Paris,</hi> than it is vnder the Equinoctiall. Also this is an other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that when the Sun setteth to them vnder the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, it goeth very déep &amp; lowe vnder their Horizon, almost euen to their <hi>Antipodes,</hi> whereby their twylights are very shorte, and their nightes are made verye extreame darke and long,<note place="margin">The Twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are shorter, and the nights darker, vnder the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and so the moysture and coldenesse of the long nightes, wonderfully encreaseth, so that at length the Sun rising, can hardly in many houres consume and driue away the colde humoures and moyst vapours of the nighte paste, which is cleane contrarye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paralel of <hi>Paris:</hi> For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun goeth vnder their Horizon but verye little, after a sloping forte, whereby their nights are not verye darke, but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as looking into the North in a cleare night withoute cloudes, it doeth manifestlye appeare, their twilightes are long, for the Paralel <hi>Cancer</hi> cutteth not the Horizon of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> at right angles, (but at angles very vneuen, and vnlike) as it doth the Horizon of the Equinoctiall. Also the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day at <hi>Paris,</hi> is sixtéene houres long, and the nighte but eight: where contrariwise, vnder the Equinoctial, the day is but twelue houres long, and so long is also the nighte, in what soeuer Paralell the Sunbe: and therefore looke what oddes and difference of proportion there is betwéene the Sunnes abode aboue the Horizon in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the abode it hath vnder the Equinoctiall, (it being in <hi>Cancer</hi>) the same
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4786:23"/>
proportion woulde séeme to be betwéen the heate of the one place and heate of the other: for other things (as the angle of the whole acke of the Sunnes progresse that day in both places) are equall.</p>
               <p>But vnder the Equinoctiall, the presence and abode of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, is equall to his absence, and abode vnder the Horizon, eache being twelue houres. And at <hi>Paris,</hi> the continuaunce and abode of the Sunne is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizon sixteene houres long, and but eight hours absence, whiche proportion is double, from whiche, if the proportion of the equalitie be subtrahed to find the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, there will remaine stil a double proportion, whereby it séemeth to followe, that in Iune the heate at <hi>Paris</hi> were double to the heate vnder the Equinoctiall. For (as I haue saide) the angle of the Sunne beames, are in all pointes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and the cause of difference is, <hi>Mora Solis supra Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontem,</hi> the staye of the Sunne in the one Horizon more than in the other. Therefore, whosoeuer coulde finde out in what proportion the angle of the Sunne beames heateth, and what encrease the Sunnes continuaunce doeth adde therevnto, it might expresly be sette downe, what force of heate and colde is in all regions.</p>
               <p>Thus you partely sée by comparing a Clymate to vs well knowne, and familiarlye acquainted by lyke height of the Sunne in bothe places, that vnder the Equinoctiall in Iune, is no excessiue heate, but a temperate ayre rather tending to colde.

Also our Author of the Sphere, <hi>Iohannes d' Sacro bosco,</hi> in the Chapter of the Zodiacke, deriueth the Etimologie of <hi>Zodiacus,</hi> of the Gréeke word <hi>Zoe,</hi> whiche in Latin signifyeth <hi>Vita,</hi> life, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4786:26"/>
out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> he alledgeth, that <hi>Secundum accessum &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessum solis in Zodiaco, fiunt generationes &amp; corruptiones in rebus inferioribus:</hi> according to the Sunnes going to and fro in the Zodiake, the inferiour bodies take their causes of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and corruption. Then it foloweth, that where there is most going too and fro, there is most generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: whiche must néedes be betwéene the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, for there the Sunne goeth too and fro most, and no where else, but there. Therefore, betwéene the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, that is, in the midle Zone, is greatest increase, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, generation,<note place="margin">Under the Equinoctiall is greatest generation.</note> and corruption of things, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we find by experience, for there is Sommer twice in the yeare, and twice Winter, so that they haue two Haruests in the yeare, and continuall spring. Seing then the middle Zone falleth out so temperate, it resteth to declare where the hotest part of the World should be, for we fynde some places more hote than others. To answere this doubt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son persuadeth, the hotest place in the Worlde to be vnder and about the two Tropickes, for there more than in anye other place doe both the causes of heate concurre,<note place="margin">Greatest heare vnder the Tropiks.</note> that is, the perpendicular falling of the Sunne beames, at righte Angles, and a greater continuance of the Sunne aboue the Horison (the Pole there being eleuated thrée or foure and twentie degrées.) And as before I concluded, that though the Sunne were perpendicular to them vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, yet bycause the same continued but a small tyme, (theyr dayes being short, and theyr nightes long) and theyr spéedie departure of the Sunne from their Zenith, bycause of the suddayne crossing of the Zodiake with the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and that by such continuall course and recourse of hote and cold, the temperature grew moderate.</p>
               <p>So now to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Tropikes, the Sun hauing once by his proper permotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declined .20. degrées from the Equinoctial, beginneth to draw néere theyr Zenith, which may bée (as before, aboute the eleuenth day of May, and

then beginneth to send his beames almost at right Angles, about which tyme, the Sunne entreth into the first degrée of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and with this almost right Angle, the Sunne beames will continue, vntill it be past <hi>Cancer,</hi> that is, the space of two Monethes euery day at noone, almost perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular ouer their heads, being then the time of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stitium Aestiuale,</hi> whiche so long continuance of the Sun aboute their Zenith, maye cause an extreame heate (if anye be in the world) but of necessitie farre more heate, than can bée vnder the Equinoctiall, where the Sunne hathe no suche long abode in the Zenith, but passeth away therehence very quickly. Also vnder the Tropikes, the day is longer by an houre and a halfe, than it is vnder the Equinoctiall, wherefore the heate of the Sunne, hauing a longer tyme of operation, must néedes be encreased, especially séeing the nighte, wherein colde and moysture doe abounde vnder the Tropikes, is lesse than it is vnder the Equinoctiall. Therefore I gather, that vnder the Tropikes is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test place, not onely of <hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> but of any other parte of the Worlde, especially bycause there both causes of heate doe concurre, that is, the perpendicular falling of the Sunne beames two Monethes togyther, and the longer abode of the Sunnes presence aboue the Horison. And by this meanes, more at large is proued, that <hi>Marochus</hi> in Sommer, is farre more hote, than at any tyme vnder the Equinoctiall, bycause it is scituate so néere the Tropike <hi>Cancer,</hi> and also for the length of their dayes. Neyther yet doe I thynke, that the Regions scituate vnder the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, are not habitable, for they are founde to be verye frutefull also, although <hi>Marochus,</hi> and some other partes of <hi>Africa</hi> néere the Tropike, for the drynesse of the natiue sandie soyle, and some accidentes, maye séeme to some to be intemperate for ouermuch heate.

To al which obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, may be answered in this maner: First, that thoughe the Sun be absent from them those sixe moneths, yet it followeth not, there should be such extreame darkenesse, for as the Sunne is departed vnder their Horizon,<note place="margin">The twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights gyue light vnder the Pole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste al the Winter.</note> so is it not farre from them. And not so soone as the Sunne falleth, so sodainly commeth the darke night, but the euening doth substitute and prolong the daye a good while after by twilight. After whiche time the residue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night, receiueth light of the Moone and Starres, vntill the breake of the day, which giueth also a certaine light before the Sunnes rising, so that by these meanes the nightes are seldome darke, which is veryfied in al parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but least in the middle Zone vnder the Equinoctiall, where the twylights are short, &amp; the nights darker, than in any other place, bycause the Sun goeth vnder their Horizon so déepe, euen to their <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Wée sée in <hi>Englande</hi> in the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer nights whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sun goeth not far vnder the Horizon, that by the light of the Moone &amp; stars, wée may trauel al night, &amp; if occasion were, do some other laboure also. And there is no man that doubteth, whether our cattel can sée to féede in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nights, séeing wée are so well certified thereof by our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:<note place="margin">The ending of twylight.</note> &amp; by reason of the sphere, our nights should be darker than any time vnder the Poles.</p>
               <p>The Astronomers consent, that the Sun descending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our vpper Hemisphere at the .18.

               <p>The cause why thys yeare we haue béene more combred with Ise (than at other times before) may be by reason of the Easterly and Southerly windes, whyche brought vs more timely thither now than wee looked for.

               <p>These broken landes and Ilandes, being very many in number, do seeme to make there an <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> which as they all differ in greatnesse, forme, and fashion one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, so are they in goodnesse, couloure, and soyle muche vnlike.

They goe clad in coates made of the skinnes of beastes, as of Ceales, Dere, Beares, Foxes, and Hares. They haue also some garments of feathers, being made of the cases of Foules, finely sowed and compact togither. Of all which sortes, we broughte home some with vs into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> whiche we found in their tents. In Sommer, they vse to weare the hearie side of their coates outwarde, and sometime go naked for too much heate.
