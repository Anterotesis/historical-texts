            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were a while ſince a few Queries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out with the <hi>right hand</hi> unto the people of this Nation, but it ſeems that by many they have been received with the <hi>left.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> complaint, that <hi>for his love,</hi> men <hi>became his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>rewarded him evil for his good</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 11. 19.</note>. Notwithſtanding he had this to ballance his loſs in this kind; that his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in ſuch deportments of himſelf was <hi>juſtified</hi> by thoſe, who were capable of the true nature thereof, and of the expreſs and clear tendency in it to thoſe worthy ends projected by it. <hi>But Wiſdom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is juſtified of her children.</hi> I am all thoughts made, that there is no man of a ſingle eye, that can diſcern any thing in the ſaid Queries of an oblique or ignoble tendency, or which comporteth with any end, whereof ſuch a man, who dayly expecteth to appear before the Judgment Seat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> needs to be aſhamed; or which ſavoureth of any thing in the Author, but of a publique ſpirit, and Chriſtian deſire to ſee the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of his God in the Land of his pilgrimage, in peace and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114811:3"/>
proſperity all his days, and in this condition to tranſmit it to poſterity.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſome, upon conſultation had with ſome froward and ſeducing Oracle, have pretended to ſee a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of darkneſs in thoſe Queries, by which they have been admoniſhed, to pronounce this hard ſentence againſt their Author, that he is a <hi>Time-Server;</hi> a Worſhipper of the Greatneſs of this World. If by, <hi>Time-ſerving,</hi> they mean, a ſubjecting a mans ſelf to <hi>ſerve</hi> with all diligence and faithfulneſs the common Intereſt of the men of the <hi>times,</hi> wherein he liveth, as well Great, as ſmall, as well high, as low, rich as poor, I plead, <hi>Guilty,</hi> to the Indictment: I have (in this ſence) been a <hi>Time-Server</hi> of a long time, well nigh ever ſince I was capable of ſuch a <hi>ſervice.</hi> But if by, <hi>Time-ſerving,</hi> be meant, any unchriſtian, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike compliance, either with the head, or tail, of this world, for any ſecular accommodation or Intereſt of mine own, I can waſh my hands in the Laver of <hi>Davids</hi> Innocency, and with an erect Conſcience profeſs and ſay, <hi>They lay to my charge things that I know not.</hi> And herein I ſuppoſe that all thoſe, who have fully known my principles and practiſe from the beginning, will be my Compurgators. This I confeſs, that from first to laſt, I have ſtood cloſe and faſt, by the preſent Authority for the time being, and have contended with the beſt of the ſtrength of my underſtanding, for an univerſal ſubjection of the Nation, in all things lawful, unto it. When there were two Authorities conflicting, that of the late King, the other, of the Parliament, in which caſe I judged it not meet, either to neutralize, or amphibolize, I joyned the ſmall ſtrength of my hand with that, which upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I judged beſt pleadable, and withall moſt promiſſory of Civil, yea and of Religious Happineſs alſo unto the Land. To this Authority I have conſtantly adhered all along
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114811:3"/>
without the leaſt regret, or relenting, not only in the loweſt ebb thereof, when its Competitreſs, like a ſtood, was ready to have overwhelmed it, but likewiſe under all that hard meaſure, and thoſe diſcouraging and ſad requitals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it recompenced all my ſervice and faithfulneſs unto the Interest of it. For as on the one hand, I ſtill was a zealous Aſſertor of this Authority, and compelled, as far as my tongue, pen, or example had any compulſive power in them, all ſorts of people in the Land to ſubmit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake unto it; ſo on the other hand I was as zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly faithful in declaring and aſſerting the juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bounds of this Authority, teſtifying and perſwading it to contain it ſelf within its own ſphere, witneſsing and proteſting, that if it ſhould prove like <hi>Jordan</hi> in the time of Harveſt, and overflow its banks, this would endanger the cutting off of the waters, and laying the channel of it dry: which thing alſo we all know is come to paſs now ſome while ſince. And, though I love not to be too poſitive in matters of this nature, yet I very much incline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that one Reaſon why God took no more pleaſure in the Parliament of the laſt ſitting, was their aſſuming of a Power notoriouſly incompetent to them, as <hi>viz.</hi> to make that Adultery in Parents, which God never made Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: and that illegitimacy in children, which God never, made ſuch; yea which common reaſon and equity might have taught them not to be ſuch. Yea in theſe caſes they aſſumed a Power, which we may ſay (without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of diſhonour upon God, or the ſtraitening of his Prerogative) is incompetent unto God himſelf. For God cannot make things to be ſuch, or ſuch, without that which is eſſentially and formally requiſite to make them ſuch; He cannot make a man without a reaſonable Soul, nor a wall white, without whiteneſs; nor that to be fraud or deceit, which in the eſſence of it is honeſty and plain dealing; ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114811:4"/>
neither that to be adultery, which is naturally and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially an honeſt and lawful conjunction. If they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed the former Law, which (with a like inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) made adulteries of ſuch marriages, which were not ſolemnized by the Clergy (then ſo called,) and the children born in ſuch marriages, illegitimate; and had only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by mulcts and penalties, or what other means they judged meet, againſt all clandeſtine and unworthy proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the affair, leaving the tranſaction of the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty free for perſons of any rank or quality, without making that Adultery, which God and the Law of Nature make an honeſt and honourable conjunction, or that illegitimacy which theſe make an honest and blameleſs propagation, they had done well and worthily. But now by appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the buſineſs we ſpeak of unto Juſtices of Peace, upon the ſame, or like, account, on which it was before appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Clergy, is to cleave a bad knot with a wedg as bad as it; and though, not formally or intentionally, yet conſtructively and conſequentially, to claim a Power beyond, or above, the Power of God himſelf; a claim, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, it was no otherwiſe like, but that God himſelf would declare firſt, or laſt. Men in places of Power and Authority, can hardly be ſufficiently jealous over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt they conceit their Power to be larger and more extenſive then it is, or that in the adminiſtration and exerciſe of it they do not entrench upon ſome or other of the appropriate Royalties of God. But my faithfulneſs in endeavoring to preſerve that Authority I ſpeak of from diſſolution and deſtruction by it ſelf, and its own exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies, was of ſo hard a reſentment with it, that it did not only quench all remembrance and regard of all thoſe other ſervices, wherein I unfeignedly and with all my might ſought to prevent the diſturbance and annoyance of it by other men, but further kindled a ſpirit of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114811:4"/>
yea of frowardneſs, and hard (that I ſay not, unjuſt) proceedings, in the breſt therof, against me. For upon this account I cannot but preſume it was, that I was ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally frowned upon, and ſmitten with the tongue, by this Authority; that ſome of my Writings (as I was inform'd) very narrowly eſcaped the double doom of the hand of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Hangman, and of the fire; that I was (to my no ſmall trouble) time after time ſummoned before the Conſiſtory (ſirnamed, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittee for Plundred Miniſters,) and this by the procurement, abetment, and contrivance of ſome of the Members themſelves of the Authority I ſpeak of, that here I was coarſly handled, diſgracefully entreated, my Accuſers, though but few and leſs conſiderable, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, my Friends, who appeared with me, and for me, neglected; and that at laſt I was compelled to drink the cup, prepared only for Malignant Miniſters (ſo called in thoſe days,) being not only ſequeſtred from my Living (the beſt means I had for the ſupport of my ſelf, wife, and ſeven children) but denyed the liberty ſo much as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my wonted place. Nor was there, as far as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is able to recollect the terms and circumstances of theſe high proceedings againſt me, any ground or reaſon to this day given by the ſaid Committe, of that ſo ſevere a ſentence awarded againſt me. This I verily beleeve, that from the firſt to the laſt of the ſitttng of that Parliament, there was no example of any Miniſter in the Land who had ſo conſtantly, and cordially, and with ſo much activeneſs in the promotion of their Cauſe, adhered to them, as was, and is, ſufficiently known (yea and was acknowledged by ſome of themſelves) that I had done, and upon whom they had ſo little to charge otherwiſe, who received the like meaſure from their hand. I confeſs that after ſeveral years total Sequeſtration (between four and five as I remember) the Presbyterian Intereſt ſomewhat damping (I remember not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114811:5"/>
now upon what revolution, or occaſion) and the Perſon hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto gratified with the hard meaſure meaſured unto me in my Sequeſtration, falling under ſome Parliamentary diſlike, with much ado I was again reſtored to my place in <hi>Colmanſtreet.</hi> But (as the ſaying was) <hi>Jam ſeges eſt, ubi Troia fuit;</hi> at my return I found only a piece of a <hi>Skeleton</hi> or bare Anatomy of thoſe Means, which at my enforced departure I left a fair and full Body. The chief men upon the place, during my abſence, had (it ſeems) ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably transferred their devotion-benevolence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their devotion it ſelf in hearing, upon him, who had all that while ſerved their turns, and his own, in my Pulpit; who, what he wan in this kind, wears to this day. So that if I ſhould eſtimate the damage and loſs I ſuſtained by the hard meaſure of my Sequeſtration (without valuing the diſparagement and diſrepute accompanying it) at 500l. I ſhould (I beleeve) cut ſhort the account by the one half. Notwithſtanding all theſe grand diſobligements, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-like dealings with me, yet did I not behave my ſelf, either frowardly, or faultringly, in that Covenant of loyalty and ſervice, wherein God, and mine own Judgment and Conſcience, had engaged me unto the men, who thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me.</p>
            <p>So that if I have been a <hi>Time-Server</hi> (in the ſence of my Accuſers) I have ſerved very hard Maſters, from whom I never received any thing for my work or ſervice, but only in ſome ſuch coyn, wherein <hi>Paul five times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived forty ſave one of the Jews</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor 12. 24</note>. Nor have I yet ever known, unleſs by theory, and hear-ſay, that the Great Men of the times, have, or have had, ſo much as the value of the ninth part of a farthing wherewith to reward the ſervices of thoſe who have ſerved them. But I know by experience that they have had rods, yea ſcorpions, wherewith to chaſtiſe their ſervants without a cauſe. Nor do I now write theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114811:5"/>
things, either out of any effeminate or querulous diſpoſition, or out of a deſire, or expectance, that the Maſters of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times ſhould repair the breaches made upon me by their Predeceſſors (the Maſters of the times lately paſt) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of a deſire to ſtop the mouth of that unworthineſs, which is opened againſt me, as if I had thriven in the world ſo well by ſerving the times formerly, that ſtill I meant to follow the ſame occupation. The truth is, that I do intend, and am reſolved (God aſsiſting me) to ſerve the preſent times upon the ſame account and terms, on which I ſerved the former; yea and judg my ſelf bound in conſcience, both to God, and my generation, ſo to do. There ſhall be no more Wars in the Land, nor bloodſheds, nor tumults, nor plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, nor depopulations in my days, no nor yet in the days after me, as far as I ſhall be able, whileſt I live, by my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt interpoſures to prevent them. But as <hi>Daniel,</hi> though free and willing to gratifie King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in his deſire, yet ſpake thus unto him, <hi>Let thy gifts be to thy ſelf, and give thy rewards to another</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 5. 17.</note>: in like manner, I can, and ſhall be free and faithful to ſerve men in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (and in them, the Nation) and yet leave them at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty to diſpoſe, as well their faces, as their places, to whom they pleaſe. I deſire neither, but in order to their own better ſervice, and the ſervice of thoſe, whom they are bound to ſerve as well as I: and if they pleaſe to deny me both, I ſhall ſerve them as well as I can without them. It may be it is a Maxim of Policy amongst Stateſ-men, to make uſe of their countenances, and opportunities of preferment, as ordinary men make uſe of their money, who do not beſtow or lay it out upon what they have already, but upon what they want, and deſire to have, and withall have reaſon to beleeve that they are not like to have, without it. Men of ordinary diſcretion cannot be offended that rattles and babies ſhould be given unto froward children, to content

and keep them quiet: and it is the ſence of more then one (though I am neu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>ordered by God, even when theſe Powers do give their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt, and make War with the Lamb. Yet have they been, and ought to be in their ſo doing, witneſſed against, by thoſe that are called, and choſen, and faithful,</hi> Rev. 17. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>But this Anſwer, 1. Reacheth not the intent or purport of the <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Query. For this querieth not about the unlawful or ſinful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of any authoritative Power (of which only the Anſwer ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,) or whether this may not, yea and ought not, to be witneſſed againſt by thoſe who are called unto it; but of the Power it ſelf veſted in the ſupreme Magiſtrate, conſidered ſimply as Power, and as diſpoſed unto him by God. This Power ought not to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or <hi>witneſſed against,</hi> by any perſon whatſoever; nor can it be, either reſiſted, or witneſſed againſt, but by reſiſting, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing againſt, the Ordinance of God. The Kings of the Earth, who give their power to the Beaſt, are not to be <hi>witneſſed againſt</hi> for being Kings, nor for their accepting of Kingly Power (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it duly caſt upon them,) but only for the male-adminiſtration of this power. Yea the power of the Beaſt himſelf (whoever, or whatſoever, be meant by the Beaſt) whereby he now maketh War againſt the Lamb, but might, if he pleaſed, employ and uſe for the Lamb, is not to be <hi>witneſſed against</hi> by any man, as being the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> but only the enormous and moſt deſperate abuſe of this Power in fighting againſt the Lamb, which is the Ordinance of the Devil. And when the Beaſt by being <hi>witneſſed against</hi> in the wicked exerciſe of his Power, comes through the juſt Judgment of God in putting it into the hearts of his ſervants to make War againſt him, to be deſpoyled and deprived of his Power, his Power (properly) is not reſiſted by theſe men, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114811:7"/>
only the horrid abuſe of this Power; which abuſe the Juſtice of God judgeth meet to puniſh, and to prevent for the future, by the utter ſubverſion and ruine of it. And the reaſon which the Apoſtle gives, why <hi>Christ ſhall put down all Rule, and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power,</hi> before his <hi>delivering up the Kingdom to God the Father,</hi> is, becauſe he <hi>must reign, till he hath put all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet (1 Cor.</hi> 15. 24. 25.) which plainly ſhews, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath no quarrel, no controverſie, with, or againſt, any <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as ſuch, but only as bent and acted in the exerciſe of it againſt him. Therefore they who clamour, or <hi>witneſs againſt,</hi> any Power, ſimply as ſuch, <hi>reſist</hi> the Ordinance of God; and they who <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs against</hi> any ſuch Power, which is ſubſervient to the affairs of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in the world, reſiſt not only the Ordinance, but the Intereſt alſo of God, and of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>

               <p>1. If ſome now in Authoritie, turned their back upon, and left the work of the nation when time was, as not being able to bear it, becauſe it was contrary to the letter of the Law, it is a ſign that had they been ſatisfied, as the Anſwerer acknowledgeth himſelf with the reſt, called Diſ-ſatisfied, to be, that the reaſon or end of the Law, is to be preferred before the letter of it, they would not have turned their backs upon it, becauſe of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in it to the ſaid letter.

               <p>3. Though it be not the advantage of a mans ſtation alone that will inable him to diſcover things, either near at hand, or further off, yet where there is the ſame, or a greater, ſingleneſſe of the eye, and with all the ſame trueneſſe of light, the advantage of a ſtanding muſt needs be a proportionable advantage for diſcoverie. If the Anſwer could prove that his <hi>Paul,</hi> either hath a more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eye, or walks in a truer light then his <hi>Phelimon,</hi> I ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much conteſt grant, that theſe advantages in this <hi>Paul,</hi> might very poſſibly balance <hi>Phelimons</hi> advantage in point of ſtanding.

               <p>4 (And laſtly) The reaſon why <hi>Jeremiah</hi> knew the means of <hi>Iſraels ſafetie better then the King and all his Princes,</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Prophet immediately &amp; extraordinarily inſpired by God. If the Anſwerer can ſatisfie us that his <hi>Paul</hi> plougheth with this heyfer, we will acknowledge him more able to declare the riddle we ſpeak of, then <hi>Philemon,</hi> and all his Princes. But as in <hi>Micah's</hi> daies men, <hi>walking in the ſpirit, and falſhood,</hi> might <note place="margin">Mic. 2 11.</note> notwithſtanding be <hi>Prophets,</hi> or <hi>Jeremies, unto that people;</hi> in like manner, he that will with a zealous confidence prophecie mens minds and deſires unto them in theſe dayes, ſhall be a Prophet, yea a <hi>Jeremie,</hi> a great Prophet unto them. Yet if the Anſwerers <hi>Paul</hi> be a <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo, I confeſſe the Query was not aware of it. For this eſtimateth the abilities of men for diſcoveries of a politique nature and import, by the generall preſumption of the wiſeſt men amongſt us, and (as I ſuppoſe) in the world, touching the preſent ſtate of things in the world, and not by the private ſuppoſition of any one perſon, or a few, as <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſhould be riſen from the dead, or now alive in <hi>England,</hi> or that any other perſon ſhould now be found of a like prophetique anoynting with him. Whoſoever now ſhall undertake to preach for Doctrine, or as the mind or purpoſe of God, any thing, which he cannot ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove from the Scriptures to be indeed the minde or purpoſe of God, eſpecially if he ſhall pretend revelation hereof from God, otherwiſe then by the Scriptures, we cannot but judge him a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer of the bleſſed fulneſſe and ſufficiencie of the Scriptures, and very near (at leaſt) unto that curſe; <hi>If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</hi> Rev. 22. 18.</p>

Or is not the ſad providence befaln his friend in this caſe, to be interpreted by him, not only, or ſimply, as a diſcharge from God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the performance of his ſaid promiſe, but as an Item, or engagement layd upon him by God, at no hand to perform it?

               <p>Firſt, This Anſwer miſtakes in the very firſt words of it, calling that an <hi>objection,</hi> which is onely a queſtion, propounded to thoſe <note place="margin">Reply, &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> who are diſ-ſatisfied, for this end, that by bethinking themſelves of a reaſonable and direct anſwer unto it, they may be brought to reflect upon the unreaſonableneſſe of their diſ-ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>2. Whereas it ſpends it ſelf upon the particular inſtance of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon calling into a <hi>delirium</hi> in the caſe ſpecified, it declines the dint, and plain deſigne of the Querie.

The caſe of a perſon falling into a <hi>delirium,</hi> was onely ſubjoyned in the querie by way of illuſtration, or exemplification of the ſaid generall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>3 It is a grand miſtake to think that the <hi>force</hi> or ſtrength of the Querie lieth in a ſuppoſall, that <hi>all the purſuers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique liberties</hi> (except the excepted) have <hi>fallen into a delerium.</hi> For as the Scripture ſpeaketh of a gift, that <hi>it blindeth the eyes,</hi> not of mad or fooliſh men, but, <hi>of the wiſe,</hi> yea and <hi>perverteth the words,</hi> not of hypocrites, deceivers, or the like, but, <hi>of the richteous</hi>

poſſibly be miſtaken about the naturall and direct tendency of the late change of the government, without being ſuppoſed fallen into a <hi>delirium.</hi> But,</p>

And becauſe theſe expreſſes from God, concern'd, as well the people, as their Princes, and the people being many, were the more conſiderable partie concerned in theſe meſſages; nor had the Prophets entruſted with theſe meſſages, always opportunity to conveene the people and their Princes together, therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they delivered their burdens, or meſſages from God unto the people, the Princes being abſent. But they alwayes ſet down, or cauſed to be ſet down, in writeing, the tenor of theſe their prophecies (reſpectively) that ſo they might be preſented unto the Princes upon occaſion; as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Jeremies</hi> roll, (mentioned in the Anſwer) which was read in the ears of the King, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 21. and this after the ſumme and ſubſtance of it had been made known unto him before.</p>
               <p>What is there then in any, or in all, the examples inſiſted upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114811:20"/>
in the Anſwer, that doth ſo much as colourably parallel, or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the practiſe of thoſe, who with turbulencie of paſſion and diſcontent, prophecie the viſions of their own hearts, (made of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe and blood) not againſt <hi>Jeroboams, Jehojakims, Herods,</hi> Idolatrous or ungodly Rulers, but againſt <hi>Davids, Hezikiahs, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiahs,</hi> men zealous for God, lovers of righteouſneſſe, hating cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, &amp;c. with open mouth, and in a clamourous manner, reſtleſly, and without craſing, pouring contempt and diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, laying to their charge things which they know not, calling their light, darkneſſe, making their ſtreight things, crooked, traducing their faithfulneſſe under the odious names and miſpreſentations, of promiſe-breaking, falſifying of words &amp;c. and all this in the ears (for the moſt part) of an ill-ſpirited and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate multitude, with menacing or diſparaging glances at all ſuch being preſent, who ſhall make report of the words ſpoken unto him, or them, who are moſt concerned in them. So that the practices and deportments of the men now deſcribed in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under conſideration, have as little <hi>communion</hi> with the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and carriage of the Prophets alledged in the Anſwer, as <hi>light hath with darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>righteouſnes with unrighteouſneſs,</hi> or that which is from God, with that whih is from men. All circunſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (well nigh) in the proceedings of the one, and of the other, are diametrally oppoſite. 1. The Prophets, though they mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or named the ſinns of their Rulers before the people, yet they ſought not hereby to render them odious to their people, or to incenſe the people againſt them, but rather to admoniſh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that if God were determined to puniſh their Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſuch and ſuch ſins, if in time they repented not, much leſſe would ht ſpare them, being partakers with them in their ſins, in caſe they remained ſtubborn and impenitent. But the men, whoſe juſtification is attempted in the Anſwer, inſiſt upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of oblequie and charge againſt their Rulers, before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to admoniſh them of any communion in ſin with their Rulers, nor of any judgement of God hanging over their heads for ſuch communion, but onely, or chiefly (as is too too apparent) to create and work an odium or diſtaſte in the people againſt their Rulers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophets inſiſted onely upon ſuch ſins of their Rulers before the people, whereof they were truly and really guilty, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114811:21"/>
which either by the light of nature, or the expreſſe Word of God, or both, they certainly knew to be ſins indeed. Whereas the men we ſpeak of, arreign their Rulers at the barre of their hearers, for matters of cavillation, and for ſuch things, under the names of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous crimes, or actions, which both by the Word of God, and by the Law and light of nature, are, under ſuch circumſtances, as under which they were tranſacted by them, not onely or ſimply juſtifyable, or warrantable, but alſo, (as farre as ſober men, and of beſt and ſoundeſt underſtandings, are able to judge) worthy commendation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prophets (ſpecified in the anſwer) were not onely willing that the Kings and Rulers, whoſe tranſgreſſions together with the judgments threatened againſt them, they had occaſion to declare in the ears of the people, ſhould come to the diſtinct and perfect knowledge of what they declared in this kind, but likewiſe endeavoured and procured it. <hi>Goye</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>tell ye that Fox, Behold, &amp;c.</hi> (meaning <hi>Herod.)</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Abijah,</hi> 1 King. 14. 7.

               <p>To the former of theſe Queſtions I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Or if the ſaid interrogatory catcheth at any ſuch advantage as this, that the Author of the Queries muſt needs goe beyond the line of his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> commiſſion, in reproving, or blameing ſuch Teachers, from whom he hath not perſonally heard the things, for which he reproveth them; his Anſwer is, that an <hi>accuſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The latter of the two queſtions, may well be a queſtion indeed.

What <hi>testimony of Jeſus</hi> it is, which this part of the Anſwer ſuppoſeth to be <hi>proper to a generation,</hi> and more eſpecially to this generation (for this is the emphaſis of the buſine) he Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhould have declared, as he ſaith to me concerning the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſedition,</hi> of which I ſpeak. It ſeems there were ſome in <hi>Paul</hi>'s dayes, who troubled the minds of many with this not on or Doctrine, that the <hi>day of Chriſt was at hand, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 2. Yet this was no <hi>testimony of Jeſus proper to that generation;</hi> with what confidence ſoever it might be pretended to have been ſuch. And to ſet a few people a gogg with a conceit, that if they might chuſe and ſet up ſuch or ſuch Perſons in places of power and Authority over them, they ſhould lay the foundations of the fift Monarchie, and ſuddenly bring the Kingdome of Chriſt (ſo much ſpoken of) upon the world, is no <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus proper to</hi> this <hi>generation.</hi> For <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath no where declared ſuch a <hi>propriety</hi> as this, to reſide in ſuch a Doctrine, or <hi>testimony of him,</hi> as that now mentioned. If by, <hi>proper to a generation,</hi> the Anſwer meaneth, commodious, uſefull, or neceſſary to a generation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am that the Doctrin of ſubjection unto the <hi>Higher powers</hi> is very <hi>proper to</hi> this <hi>generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But concerning what the anſwer ſpeaks (though eccentrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Querie) againſt <hi>giving thanks for theeves and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> Doubtleſſe in ſuch a ſence as we ought, or may, <hi>pray,</hi> or <hi>intercede for them,</hi> we may and ought to give thanks. For, for whatſoever good thing we may, or ought, intercede, or pray for on their behalf, we may and ought to give thanks, when God vouchſafeth to give it unto them. The matter of our prayer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for them, ought not to be any thing ſinfully evill: nor ought the matter of our giveing of thanks for them, be any ſuch thing (I mean, that is ſinfully evill in them,) but onely that which is good, as being ſome expreſſion or teſtimony of the goodneſſe of God towards them. But this is more againſt the Anſwer, then for the Querie.</p>
               <p>Whereas the latter part of the Anſwer, inſtructeth me in my duty, and telleth me that I <hi>ſhould have declared what thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſedition be,</hi> whereof the Query ſpeaketh, conſidering, that <hi>Pauls principles were counted ſeditious, which yet were onely ſuch things, which concerned the kingdome of God, &amp;c.</hi> I repone (by way of excuſe for my overſight, or failing, in this point,)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114811:25"/>
1. That I was rank of beleif, that no perſon, who would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to caſt his eye upon the Query, could look upon, either the Queriſt himſelf, or any other perſon in the leaſt degree conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt us, as no more able to diſtinguiſh between <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſedition, and things which concern the kingdom of God,</hi> then thoſe Pagans and profeſſed Infidels were, who ſo broadly miſtook <hi>Pauls principles,</hi> as the Anſwer ſuggeſteth. If my confidence in this kind did ill become me, I doe accept of the blame, and ſhame, of it. But, 2. (to redeem my overſight in the premiſſes, and obey the voyce of the admonition given me) I declare, 1. (in the negative) that by, <hi>principles of ſedition,</hi> I did not mean <hi>things concerning the kingdom of God;</hi> nor, 2. things of a doubtfull diſputation whether they were (I mean, <hi>principles of ſedition)</hi> or no; but (in the affirmative) ſuch Doctrines, Tenents, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, which in the eye and judgement of any conſidering man, not intoxicated with the cup of the ſame notions and deſignes, have a manifeſt tendencie in them to diſturbe the courſe of the preſent Government, to alienate the hearts and affections of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from thoſe rulers and Governors, which God hath judged meet to ſet over us, and conſequently to prepare them for tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous counſels, and practiſes, and for a conjunction with diſ-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons, who ſhall at any time appear in the leaſt degree conſiderable for the re-imbroyling of the nation in order to an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, of the government, or Governors of it.

                  <head>To this Query, this Anſwer tripartite is given.</head>
                  <item>1. It were better to try the ſpirits, then by Querying of what ſpirit ſome are of, to gratifie the carnal world, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note place="margin">Anſwer</note> ready to reject that Spirit which is of God.</item>
                  <item>2. To reprove the ſins of Government, is not to deſpiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but to remove from it that which makes it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeable.</item>
                  <item>3. The wiſdome from above, is first pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To the firſt member of this Anſwer; 1. That the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne <note place="margin">Reply &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadver.</note> of the Queries, both <hi>diviſim,</hi> and <hi>conjunctim,</hi> is to <hi>try ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and to diſcover who are the perſons that in their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the preſent Government and Governours, are acted and led by the ſpirit of God, and who, by their own ſpirits, or by the ſpirit of the World. Therefore if the <hi>trying of ſpirits</hi> be ſo commendable a work, the Anſwerer hath no cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o blame the Queries, at leaſt in reſpect of their projection, or end. If they have not quitted themſelves in their undertaking with that dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, or regularneſſe of proceeding, which was to be deſired, nor done their work to ſatisfaction, there is this to be ſaid for them; that their will was good, onely how to perform it they found not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114811:26"/>
2. I doe not at any hand underſtand, how <hi>the Querying of what ſpirit ſome men are of,</hi> ſhould be any matter of <hi>gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the carnal world.</hi> It is a greater and more dangerous <hi>gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of them, either ſo to ſpeak, or ſo to doe, that they may be incouraged or perſwaded, that ſuch perſons, who are of their <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> are of the Spirit which is of God.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is it <hi>alwayes,</hi> or univerſally true, that the <hi>carnal World is ready to reject that Spirit, which is of God,</hi> if by <hi>carnall world,</hi> be meant all perſons at preſent un-regenerate. For how then ſhould the world in any part of it become regenerate? Doubtleſſe no man becomes regenerate by rejecting the Spirit of God, nor by a readineſſe to <hi>reject it,</hi> no nor whileſt either of theſe are found in them. But this is little to the buſineſſe before us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond member of the Anſwer, in directneſſe of termes contains nothing but a moſt true and worthy ſentence: onely a little explication would ſtrengthen the claim of it to this honour. <hi>To reprove the ſins of Government,</hi> [with a Chriſtian gravitie, and with a diſcovery of an honourable eſteeme of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, the ſins of which we <hi>reprove] is not to deſpiſe the Government;</hi> but it is a matter of eaſie miſcarriage, <hi>to reprove the ſins of Government</hi> after ſuch a manner, as herein to betray our ſelves that we are <hi>deſpiſers of Government,</hi> yea and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe that hear us to deſpiſe it alſo.</p>
               <p>2. It is one thing to <hi>reprove the ſins of Government;</hi> another, to aſperſe it with the imputations and charge of ſuch ſinnes, of which it is not guilty; and then to fall heavy and foul upon it for ſuch <hi>ſins,</hi> of which, either the <hi>strength</hi> of our diſaffections on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the weakneſſe, of our underſtandings, or both, have made it guilty.</p>
               <p>The words of the third and laſt member of the Anſwer, are of too great an inſpiration to be queſtioned. But 1. it is no <hi>impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> not to reproach, revile, or curſe, the ruler of a mans people. 2. From the expreſſe tenour of the words, that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which is not <hi>peaceable,</hi> whatever it may pretend to <hi>purity,</hi> is evicted not to be <hi>from above.</hi> But (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iames) if ye have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth</hi> [by ſaying or thinking, you are men truly wiſe,

when as you are nothing leſſe] <hi>This wiſdom deſcendeth not from above: but is earthly. &amp;c.</hi>

But ſo they are called, becauſe ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the world, in which they live, and with which they contend to the loſſe of their honours, names, eſtates, and therefore are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fooles.

               <p n="1">1. The Scripture will not allow it for truth, that <hi>Sathan</hi> had <note place="margin">Reply &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadver.</note> 
                  <hi>not the advantage of ſifting againſt</hi> ANY OF <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> onely. For preſently upon the apprehending of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the multitude, that were ſent from the cheif Prieſts and elders with ſwords and ſtaves againſt him, it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>that all the Diſciples</hi> (as well as <hi>Peter) forſook him and fled</hi> (Mat. 26. 56. This was an effectual ſifting. Yea <hi>Peter</hi> (it ſeemes) in caſe it be ſuppoſed that he <hi>fled</hi> alſo, immediately repented of his <hi>flying,</hi> and ſhewed more courage (at leaſt for a time) then any of his fellows. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2 If <hi>Peter</hi> was therefore more obnoxious to <hi>Sathans ſifting</hi> then the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>becauſe he was ſo confident of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, that he thought none ſo able to ſtand, as he,</hi> this is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurrent with the deſign of the Query. For I verily beleeve that there are no men more <hi>confident of their abilities,</hi> or that think they are more <hi>able to ſtand,</hi> then the Perſons looked upon by the Query, and admired by the Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>This Query, being the laſt, is ſuppoſedly ſlain by the ſharp ſword of this Anſwer. <hi>The flattery of the preſent power doth not become the Author, who hath oft times approved himſelfe not to be the ſervant of men. But oh! who hath now bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to appear in this kind to ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, and to make their heart ſad, whom God hath not ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer, like the head of a <hi>polipus,</hi> hath a mixture of good, and bad, in it. The firſt words of it contein a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Chriſtian admonition; viz. that <hi>the flattery of the preſent power doth not become the Author;</hi> onely the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it is reflexive, if not aſperſive, without cauſe. The next words, that this Author <hi>hath oft times approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not to be the ſervant of men,</hi> contain a friendly and <hi>Christian</hi> teſtimony. But the words remaining are <hi>gall and vinegar given</hi> unto me, and my betters, to <hi>drink; But oh, who hath bewitched him</hi> &amp;c. But might not I, had I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch hard ſayings, upon much more equitable grounds, admiringly complain, and demand: <hi>But oh! who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched the Anſwerer, to appear in this kind to weaken the hands of the righteous, and to make their heart ſad, whom God hath not ſadded?</hi> More particularly;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the implyed charge of <hi>flattering the preſent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> it is a burthen laid upon my ſound ſhoulder: in which reſpect it little pincheth, or paineth me. Where the skin is whole, vinegar poured on ſmarteth not. The truth is, that I am, both naturally, and ſupernaturally, ſo farre indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>flatter</hi> any inch of the greatneſſe of this world, that I am ſtill put to my ſupernaturals to afford unto great men, ſo much as common and meet reſpects and civilities. <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſed that for twenty years together he never felt the leaſt motion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114811:37"/>
in his heart towards covetouſneſſe: I may, as in the preſence of God, Angels, and men, profeſſe and ſay; ſince I firſt knew what the world, and the greatneſſe of it, meant, I never found my heart tempting me ſo much as to ſuch a compliance with any great Perſon whatſoever, which yet is warrantable enough, and which I am farre from, either reproveing, or diſliking, in another. Yea I have been inclined (and am not yet much altered in my inclination) to look upon the Generality of great men, rather as <hi>faeces</hi> mundi, the dreggs and retriment of the world, and the reproach of mankind, then as worthy the applications of ſober men unto them. And they who have beſt known me from my youth up untill now, will (I preſume) very freely give this teſtimony of me, that what other weakneſſe or undue cariages ſoever they have ob, ſerved in me, they never found me adulterouſly inclined<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to familiarities, or correſpondings, with great men, much leſſe to any adulatory comportments with them. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I muſt confeſſe, that when I have met with any thing of the divine nature, any thing worthy a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a great man, I have, occaſionally, and according to the beſt of my underſtanding to avoid offence, endeavoured to nouriſh, ſtrengthen, and increaſe it; and (poſſibly) in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I have made the moſt of it, and (probably) more, then ſome others judg the true value, or extent of it to be. Nor do I think that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was very farre from ſuch a ſtrein, as this, when he addreſſed himſelf thus to <hi>Agrippa: King Agrippa, beleeveſt thou the Prophets?</hi> I KNOVV THAT THOU BELEEVEST.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

The Anſwerer had very little cauſe to demand with an, <hi>oh! who hath be witched me?</hi> I am able to give a reaſonable and ſober account unto any man, of what I have either done, or ſaid, in the Query. This account I have given already in part, and am ready to account further, when required. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I was <hi>bewitched,</hi> when I conceived and drew up the Query, it was, not <hi>Sathan,</hi> or the greatneſſe of this world; but God, or the Spirit of ſoberneſſe and truth, who <hi>bewitched</hi> me.</p>

               <p>Whether was there, or is there, any other way, courſe, or means, ſo promiſing in the eye of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane probability, and diſcourſe, whereby the Army and the Principal members thereof, who ſtood, and ſtill ſtand, moſt ſignally and ſolemnly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by many promiſes and publique declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to contribute their utmoſt endeavours to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Nation in righteouſneſſe, freedome, and peace; might, or yet may, performe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements in this kind to the beſt advantage, as by reducing the Nation, and Common-wealth thereof, to that form, or kind, of Government, unto which by the good hand of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it is now reduced, conſidering how un-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull in reſpect of any competent ſatisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Nation, our late Parliaments have been? Or, in caſe the late Government by Parliaments onely, continuing, the tranquillity, peace, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nation, or the liberties of the people of God in it, ſhould have miſcarried, or deeply ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thereby, could the Army, or the ſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal members of it, have given any tolerable account, either to God, or men, of their oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, neglect or ſitting ſtill, conſidering 1. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many ſacred ingagements they were to do their uttermoſt for the prevention of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and 2. That God had now entruſted them with an opportunity of great hope for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114811:39"/>
as <hi>viz.</hi> directing them to ſome ſuch change of the Government, as that which is now in being? Or in caſe it ſhould be ſuppoſed that it is not the ſence, or judgement, of other men, that the Government now erected is any whit more promiſing of ſuch a prevention, then that by Parliaments onely (however our late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have not proſpered in the work) is it reaſonable or meet to deſire, that the Army and the chief heads thereof, who were contrary-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould walk by the light of other men, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their own?</p>

               <p>Whether is it the kind, or form, of the preſent Government, or any exceſſe, or extent, of power, or revenue, ſtate-ſplendor, or the like, conferred upon one man, at which the diſ-ſatisfied, or the greater part of them, find themſelves ſo much aggrieved and diſcontented, as the Perſon, in whom the ſupreme place, or office, in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is veſted?

               <p>Whether was there the ſame reaſon to plead ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the power of the late King, eſpecially when the Parliament had declared themſelves in oppoſition to him, which there is now to plead ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the preſent power; Conſidering 1. That the ſoveraignty, or ſupremacy of power, was never regularly, or according to the law of nature, veſted in the perſon of the King, but in the people, whoſe lawfull agents and truſtees, the Parliament were; 2. That the people, to whom the ſupremacie of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power (as hath been ſaid) regularly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, having in Parliament queſtioned their cheif Steward, or Servant (the King) for male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his truſt and power, and declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Arms againſt him, he (the ſaid King) was not in a plenary or peaceable poſſeſſion of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which had been committed unto, or veſted, in him; whereas the power veſted at preſent in him, who is the head, or Cheif, in the Government that now is, is fully, peaceably, quietly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any forceible conteſt or oppoſition, poſſeſt by him?

up with any ſtrength conſiderrble againſt it? Or had it been regular and juſtifiable, for the power it ſelf of the people in Parliament, (how much leſſe for any other) either it ſelfe to diſobey, or to countenance, or abet diſobedience in any others, to the Authority of the ſaid King, in his lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in caſe he had walked in the execution of his truſt &amp; power, with that due comportment with the publique good, which became him? Or had the Truſtees of the people in Parliament been reſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or faithfull to their truſt, had they interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, oppoſed, or diſſolved ſuch a Government, under which the Nation had lived, and was (in all good probability) likely ſtill to live, in wealth and peace, with the enjoyment of all their juſt liberties and freedoms?</p>
