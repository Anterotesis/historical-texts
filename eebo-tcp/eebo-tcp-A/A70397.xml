            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Here present thee with Prayers and Devotions, fitted to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the spirits, and to direct and improve the virtues, of those who at any time, or in any place, are call'd out by the wisdom and goodness of God, to suffer for the cause of Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>The Charitable helps and offers of this kind, are very needful, and will be very acceptable, to those who are actually labouring under the Cross, and bearing affliction for the blessed <hi>Jesus.</hi> And as for others, who think they have no need thereof for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet may they at all times find occasion enough, if they please, to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up such Prayers for their persecuted <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50954:3"/> Brethren and Fellow-Members. For the Church of Christ, is still bearing his Cross in one part or other; and whilst in one place he is cherishing some with the comforts of Peace, he is elsewhere proving others of their Brethren with Tribulations. Nay, since these Tryals are common to men, and more especially to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, he who says at present that he is most free from them, knows not how soon the All-wise God may see fit to bring him under the same. And 'tis good to be fore-armed and provided for a sharp conflict, which we are lyable to be tryed withal; and the rather, because in the heat thereof, when these helps are most needed, they are usually hardest to be got, and 'tis not so easie then to put them into the hands of those, who want to be directed and assisted by them.</p>
            <p>Indeed, by the bounty and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Almighty God, the true Disciples of Christ have here their intervals of rest and quietness, and are oft-times comforted and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with worldly peace, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50954:3"/> of Princes. But when God gives them this outward ease, it is more than his Gospel promises. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, is to be followers of a man of sorrows, and to look for Crosses and Persecutions in his service; and, when they come, to take them up, and bear them patiently after him. So that it must neither be contrary to their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor expectations, to hear of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; &amp; it should never be thought a service out of season, to instruct them how to bear them, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with such Prayers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reflexions, as may afford them both direction, and support therein.</p>
            <p>The first care in this Case, is to see that their sufferings be for the Truths sake, or for a good Cause. Without this, the hopes of sufferers are but a Dream, and there is no true ground of comfort or support in them. If they suffer only for their own follies, or fancies, what reason has their blessed Lord to thank them, for being fanciful or foolish? Or, if they suffer for maintaining dangerous Errors, and for turning out of the way of Truth and Righteousness, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50954:4"/> these are not things for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but to punish. 'Tis only their suffering for some Doctrines, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his, that can render them his Martyrs or Confessors: And when they take care to be found in that way, and suffer for hearkning unto him, he will support them whilst they suffer, and afterwards make them ample amends for the same.</p>
            <p>But when they take care to be found in a Righteous Cause, they must be careful withal to honour him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves, by all the parts and virtues of a Righteous and truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Carriage. Their study then must be, to shew minds advanced above all earthly fears and desires, to support themselves with the comforts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp; the belief of Gods Promises, to bear their Afflictions for Christ's sake with patience and thankfulness, to weary out their persecutors fury with their Religious constancy, to vanquish all their injuries by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers and kindnesses; and in all things, to evidence a spirit, that is full of love, and holy zeal, and humble confidence in God; but that <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50954:4"/> is not either to be corrupted by the ease and comforts, or shocked and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the threats or losses of this world. And by these and such like virtues, they will be made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the image of their suffering Saviour, and perform a service most fragrant and pleasing unto him, and most honourable to Truth &amp; a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cause. For the world doth not afford a more glorious sight, than to see a Christian with Religious brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; constancy bearing Christs Cross, and by magnanimity and meekness, triumphing over all the powers of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and unjust Violence.</p>
            <p>These, indeed, are hard services. But as they have great difficulties, they will at last have glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and at present have great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances. The Almighty Spirit of God will support those, who seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and Religiously set themselves to suffer Christianly in his Cause: They will be set above themselves, and will be guarded and fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst human weakness, by the powers of the Divine Grace. And this, as they must humbly and firmly depend upon, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50954:5"/> so must they constantly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seek from him, by Prayers and Devotion.</p>
            <p>In the following Offices, it has been my aim and study, to be as helpful to them as I can for this purpose. And therein, according as I was able, I have not only suggested the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and supports; but directed their eye to the true spirit, duty, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Gospel-sufferers. And have taught them under the same, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press such resentments, and aspire after such raised affections, as may become those, who would honour God, and secure their own future happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by their sufferings, and who count it a priviledge to be thought worthy by the Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> to suffer in his Cause. And on this Account, this little Book may be put into the hands of the Persecuted, not only as a Form of Devotion, to be put up to God in holy and fervent Prayers; but likewise as a Treatise of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to be read for the Knowledge of their Duty, and as a Guide to their Practice; since therein they have a draught and delineation of <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50954:5"/> that Spirit which they are to nurse up and shew forth, and of those habits and virtues wherein they are to dress up their souls at such times.</p>
            <p>I have been very particular in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional provisions and supplies for these purposes, and have had regard both to private and publick necessities. Which pains, I hope will be acceptable to devout minds, who, when they are desirous to express their devotion on those particulars, will not be unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with fitting Forms, and may at any time use more, or fewer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as their leisure permits, or as their needs require.</p>
            <p>And to the Body of Prayers and Devotions, I have prefixed a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of select Scriptures, upon the several Duties, and most important needs and desires, of sufferers for Righteousness. And this I have done, for the sufferers guidance and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well as for their devotion. For, besides the kindling and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of devout affections, and the strengthening and supporting of their spirits amidst their Heavy Tryals, when they use them as sacred Hymns, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50954:6"/> or as matter of their Religious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: These Texts will teach them the necessity, and help to shew them the Nature and Offices of all those respective Duties, which are as

Who art wont to shew both thy Power and Mercy in correcting Sinners, when the cry of sins grows great, and nothing but Affliction will make them wise; justly art thou moved now at length, to visit thy People in this Land with Persecutions, after we had first turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deaf ear to all the Calls of thy Mercy, and had long abused the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of peace. There is need, O God, of our sufferings, to keep up a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for thy Justice, and to reclaim us from our iniquities; and this fiery Tryal comes to purge us from our dross, and to chastize us for our past Offences; as well as to prove our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Obedience and Constancy to thy Holy Laws.</p>

                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50954:26"/> Our Peace, O!

And the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Endowments about Religion, had stoln our Affections away from it; and instead of continuing thankful &amp; true to thee, our hearts grew covetous and ambitious after them, and preferr'd and took up with them for their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>We are, O! Lord, a stubborn, and a stiff-necked People, still lifting up our selves against thee, and against thy Vice-gerents. We are given to Hypocrisie, and take delight in Lyes. Oppression and Rapine are to be found in our dwellings; and Drunkenness and Adultery, have grown common and fashionable Wickednesses, &amp; have set up without shame in our streets. Thy pure Worship and Service, had been grievously and shamefully negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or carelesly and indevoutly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, before it was given up to be persecuted amongst us. And thine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things have been desiled; thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters have been despised and evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; and thy Sacred and Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50954:26"/> Name has been commonly &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly prophaned, by rash and false Oaths, and by the most presumptuous &amp; terrible Imprecations.<note n="*" place="margin">Is. 59 6.</note>

Help thou us, Good Lord, for we are not able to help our selves, and thou alone art our help. And when our sufferings have by thy help and Grace reduced us to our duty, we shall then, O! Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thankfully receive any Losses for Righteousness sake, and look on all the violent attempts of the Enemy, as so many instances and messengers of thy Mercy, through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>And when our Afflictions press most upon us, let the Graces and Comforts of thy Holy Spirit abound most in us. Whatever else we lose thereby, let us not lose Truth, and a good Conscience Preserve us steadfast in the belief of thy Heavenly and Oppressed Truths, &amp; undaunted in the Profession of them.

Strengthen our Faith, of thy Heavenly Joys, to recompence all these earthly sufferings; and of thy never-failing Help and Grace, to assist and support us under them, and to deliver us from the same in thy due time. Let the greatness of our distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, drive us to be more constant and earnest in our Prayers.

                              <p>O!

Yea, O!

Let the difficulties which we feel in sustaining Losses for thy sake, shew us the worldliness of our desires. Let the inclinations which we find at any time, to ease or secure our selves by sin, or to allow in our selves what we condemn in others; convince us of the deceitfulness of our own hearts, and of the hypocrisie of our pretences. Shew us all the roots of bitterness, which are ready to discover themselves when we are tryed; and when we see them, give us Grace to cast them out, and to purge our Hearts of the same.</p>

Let them not continue to resist thy truth; much less proceed to blaspheme and reproach it; and least of all, to set themselves to fight against it by an arm of flesh, and cruelly to persecute and extirpate the professors thereof.</p>

                                          <p>Whilst thou art pleased to try it with Tribulations, Lord, let them only purge it, but not lay it waste. <pb n="112" facs="tcp:50954:59"/> And revive a suffering Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us,<note n="*" place="margin">or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>when,</hi> say <hi>now,</hi> If the Church prayed for, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note>

                           <p>O! Almighty, and most merciful Father, perfect thy Strength in my Weakness, and support thy Frail, and most unworthy Servant, in this last and greatest Service, which I have now to pay thee, of laying down my Life, and leaving all that is dear unto me in this World, for thy Cause.</p>
                           <p>Oh! let not me dishonour the Cause and Truths, for which I suffer, by shewing any mis-becoming Fears, or unwillingness to suffer. 'Tis not my mistrust of the Righteousness of this Cause, O! my God; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of my other Sins, and of the common Errors of my Life, from the Rule of thy Holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which makes me at all afraid to appear at thy Righteous Bar. But cleanse thou me from all my Sins, by the Blood of my dearest Lord, and then I may meet Death with an humble Confidence, and Triumph over it.</p>
                           <p>I know, O! blessed Lord, that when Sin and Guilt, which are the Sting of Death, are taken out; there <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50954:82"/> is still an aversion in Nature, which is common to us all, against this Change, and which found place in our Blessed Lord himself.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> But let the Influences of thy Grace, though not wholly purge off this averseness, yet subdue and over rule it in my Spirit. Possess my Mind more with the Righteousness of the Cause, for which I dye, and with the Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of coming to live with thee for ever after I am dead; than with the pains of Death it self. And whatever Terror it would otherwise strike into me, let it arm my Spirit, and sweeten all, to think that I die for thee, and that I die to be received into thine Eternal Mercy.</p>
                           <p>Lord! perfect and accept my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and pardon all my Sins, and give me Patience, and Presence of Mind to the last. Let me die like a Christian, with Faith and Charity, willingly giving up my Life for a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to thy ways, and pouring out my Soul in Devotion towards thee, and in Prayers for my persecutors; till from my Body, it shall pass into the Arms of thy Mercy, and there <pb n="159" facs="tcp:50954:82"/> be comfortably received by thee, thro' the Merits and Mediation of my only Saviour and Redeemer Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>
