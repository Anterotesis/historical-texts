            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr as moche as this pistle ys the principal and most excellent part off the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and most pure evangelion / that is to saye gladde tydinges and that we call gospel / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a lyghte and a waye in vn to the whole scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re / I thinke it mete / that every christen man not only knowe it by roote a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with oute the boke / but also exercice hym sylfe therein evermore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally / as with the dayly bredde of the soule. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man verely can reede it to ofte or studie it to well for the moar it ys studied the easier it is / the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are it is cheued the pleasander it is / and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are grundely it is sherched the precioser thynges ar found in it / so greate treasure of spiritual thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges lyeth hyd therein.</p>
            <p>I will theirfore bestowe my laboure and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence / thorowe this lytyll preface or prologe / to prepare a waye i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vn to / so ferforth as God shall geve me grace / that it maye be the better vnderstonde of every man / for it hath bene het<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herto evyll darkened with glooses and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dreames off sophisters / that noman cowde spye oute the entente and meaning off it / which neverthelesse of it sylfe / is a bryghte lyghte / and sufficient to geve lyghte vn to all the scripture.</p>
            <p>Fyrst we must marke diligently the maner off speakynge of the Apostel / and above all thynge knowe what Paul meaneth by thes wordes / the Lawe / Synne / Grace / Fayth / Ryghtewesnes Fleshe / Sprite / and soche lyke / or else rede thou it never so ofte / thou shalt but loose thy laboure. This word Lawe maye not be vnderstonde he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re after the commune maner / and to vse Pauls terme / after the maner of men or after ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes / that thou woldest saye the lawe here in this

But god iudgeth after the grounde of the herte / ye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the thoughtes and the secret movi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of the mynde / therefore hys lawe requireth the grounde off the hert and love from the botome there of / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is not content with the outeward werke only / but rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth thos workes most off all which springe not of love from the ground and lowe botome of the herte / though they appere outwarde never so ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest and good / as Christ in the gospell rebuketh the Phareses above all wodyr thatt were open synners / and calleth them Yprocites / that is to saye Simulars / and paynted Sepulchres / wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich Phareses yet lyved no men so pure / as perte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynyng to the outewarde dedes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d workes off the lawe / ye and Paul in the thrid chapter of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell vn to the Philippians confesseth of hym syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe / thatt as twytchynge the lawe he was soche a wone as noman cowde complayne on / and nott withstondynge was yet a murderar of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten / persecuted them / and tormented them / so soore / that he compelled them to blaspheme Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riste / and was all to gedyr mercylesse / as many which nowe fayne outward good werkes are.</p>
            <p>For this cause the cxv. psalme calleth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars / because that noman kepeth the lawe from the grounde off the herte / nether canne kepe it. For all men ar naturally enclyned vn to evyll / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hate the lawe / we fynde in oure silves vnlust and tediousnes to do good / but lust and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doo evill. Nowe where no fre lust ys to doo

good / there the botome of the hert fulfylleth not the lawe / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there no doute ys also synne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th deserved before god / though their be never so many oute warde good workes / or never so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an outewarde shewe and appera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce off ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestely vynge.</p>
            <p>For this cause co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth sencte Paul in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde Chapter that the iewes all ar synners and transgressors of the lawe / though they make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleve / thorowe ypocrisi off outward workes / how that they fulfyll the lawe / and saith that he only which doeth the lawe ys ryghtewes before God / meanynge therby that noman with oute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde workes fulfylleth the lawe. Thou (saieth he to the Iewe) teachest a man sulde not breake wedelocke / and yet breakest wedelocke thy sylfe. Wherin thou iudgest another man / therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnest thou thy sylfe / for thou thy sylfe doeste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyn the very same thynges whych thou iudgest. As though he wolde saye / thou lyvest outewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly well in the werkes off the lawe / and iudgest them that lyve not so / thou teachest wother me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and seest a moote in a nother mans eye / but art not ware of the beame that is in thyn awne eye. For though thou kepe the lawe outewardly wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th werkes / for feare of rebuke / shame / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shement / other for love off rewarde / vantage / and vayne glory / yet doest thou all wyth out lust and love to the lawe warde / and haddest levyr a greate deale wodyr wyse doo / yf thou feared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not the lawe / ye inwardly in thyne hert / th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou woldest thatt their were no lawe / no nor yett God / the auctor and vangear of the lawe / yff it were possible / so paynefull it ys vnto the to have thyne apperytes refrayned a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be kepte doune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5646:4"/>Wherfore then it is a playne conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that thou from the grounde and botome of thyne her te arte an ennimye to the lawe. Whatt prevay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it nowe / that thou teachest another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to steale / when thou thyne awne sylfe arte a the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se in thyne hert / and outwardly woldest fayne steale yff thou durst? though that the outwarde dedes abyde not allwaye be hynde with sochey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and dissimulars / but breake forth am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onge / evyn as an evyll stabbe or a pocke can not all wayes be kepe in with violence off medicine. Thou teachest another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / but teachest not thy sylfe / ye thou wotest not what thou teachest / for thou vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest not the lawe a right / how th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at it can not be fulfylled and satisfied / but with in warde love and affeccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / so greately it can not be fulfilled with outeward dedes and werkes on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. More ovyr the lawe encreaseth synne / as he sayth in the fyfte chapter / because that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ys an enymy to the lawe / for as moch as it requireth so many thynges clene contrarie to hys nature / w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here off he ys not able to fulfill one poynte or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle / as the lawe requireth it. And therfore ar we moare provokede / and have greatter lust to bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ake it.</p>
            <p>For which causes sake he sayeth in the seve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Chapter / that the lawe ys spirituall / as though he wold saye / yff the lawe were flesshely and but mans doctrine / it myght be fulfylled / satisfied / and stilled with outwarde dedes.

So se we that thes thre chapters / the vj. vij viij. doo no other thinge so moch as they doo dryve vs vn to the ryghte werke of fayth / which ys to kill the olde man and mortifie the flesshe.</p>
            <p>In the .ix. x. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d .xj chapters he treateth of Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dꝭ predestinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whence it springeth all to ged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er / whether we shall beleve or not beleve / be loo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne or not be loosed.

Aftyr that when thou arte come to the viij. chapter / and arte vnder the crosse and soferinge of tribulacion / the necessite of predestinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will waxe swete and thou shalt well fele how preciou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se a thinge it is.

Therefore must Adam be well mortified and the flesshely wyte broughte vtterly to noughte / yer that thou

mayst awaye with this thinge / and drinke so st<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronge wyne. Take hede therefore vn to thy silfe / that thou drinke not wyne / wile thou art yet but a sucklinge. For every lerni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge hath hyr tyme mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>asure and age / and in Christ is there a certayne childhod / in which a man must be content with milke for a reason / vntill he war strong / and g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe vppe / vnto a perfecte man i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> christe / and be able to eate of moare stronge meate.</p>
            <p>In the xij. he gevyth exhortacions. For this maner observeth Paule i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his pistles / first he teacheth Christe and the fayth / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exhorteth he to goog workꝭ / and vn to continuall mortifying of the flesshe. So here teacheth he good workes i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deade / and the true servynge of God / and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men prestes / to offer vppe / not money a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bestes / as the maner was i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ryme of the lawe butt there awne bodies with killinge and morti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying the lustes of the flesshe. Aftyr that he desc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribeth the outewarde conversacion off Christen men / how they oughte to behave them silves in spirituall thinges / how to teache / preache and rule in the congregacion off Christe / to serve one another / to sofre all things pacienly and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte wreke a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vengeaunce to God / in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how a Christen man oughte to behave hym silfe vnto all men / to frend / fooe or what soever he be. These are the righte workes of a Christen man which springe oute of faythe. For fayth ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not holydaye / nether sofreth any man to be ydle / whersoever she dwelleth.</p>
            <p>In the xij. he reacheth to honoure the wordely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perall swerde. For though that mans lawe and ordinaunce make nott a man good before God / nether iustifie hym in the herte / yet are
<pb facs="tcp:5646:17"/>
they ordeyned for the furderaunce off the comm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>unewelth / to maynetene peace / to puneshe the e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vyll / and to defende the good. Therefore oughte the good to honoure the temperall swerde and to have it in reveraunce / though as concerning th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>emselves they neade it not / butt wolde absteyne from evyll of there owne acord / ye and doo good with oure mans lawe / but by the lawe of the spri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te which governeth the herte and grdeth it vn to all that is the will of god. Finaly he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth and knetteth vppe all in love. Love off her awne nature bestoweth all thatt she hath and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her awne selfe on thatt whych is loved. Th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou neadeste not to bid a kinde mother to be lovy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nge vn to her only sonne / moche lesse spirituall l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ove / wich hath eyes geven her off god / neadeth mans lawe to teache her to do her dutie. And as in the beginninge he did putt forth Christ as the cause and auctor off oure rightewesnes and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacion / even so here setteth he hym forth as an e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sample to counterfayte / that as he hath done to vs / even so shulde we doo one to another.</p>
            <p>In the xiiij. chapter he teacheth to deale sobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rly with the consciences of the weke in the fayth / wich yet vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the liberte of christ perfec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tly ynough a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to faver the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> love / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to vse the liberte of the fayth vnto hinderaunce / butt vn to the furderaunce and edifiynge off the weake. For where soche consyderacion is not / th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ere foloweth debate and despising of the gospell. It is better threfore to forbeare the weake a wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile / vntill they waxe stronge / then that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the gospell shuld come allogedre vnder foote. And soche werke is a singular worke of lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve / ye and where love is perfecte ther muste nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:5646:17"/>
be soche a respecte vnto the weake / a thynge that Christe commaunded a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d charged to be had above all thinges.</p>
            <p>In the xv. he setteth forth christ agayne to be counterfeted / that we also by his ensample shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de sofre wother that are yet weake / as them that are frayle / open synners / vnlerned / vnexperte / and of lothesome maners / and nott to cast them away forthwith / but to sofre them till they wax better and exhorte them in the meane tyme. For so dealte Christ in the gospell and nowe dealeth with vs dayly / soferynge oure vnperfetnes / we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes / conversacion and maners not yet fassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the doctrine of the Gospell / butt smell of the flesshe / ye and sometyme breakeforth into the outeward dedes.</p>
            <p>After that to conclude with all he wissheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> encreace of fayth peace and of ioye of conscien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / prayseth them and committeth them to God and magnifieth his office and administracion in the Gospell / and sobirly and with greate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecion desyreth succur and ayde of them for the povre sanctes at hierusalem / and it ys all pure lore that he speketh or dealeth with all. So fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de we in this pistell plenteously vnto the vttenio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste / whatsoever a Christen man or woman oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hte to knowe / that is to wete / what the lawe / the Gospell / synne / grace / fayth rightewesnes / ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist / God / good werkes / love / hope / and the cro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sse are / and even where in the pythe of all thatt pertayneth to the Christen fayth stondeth / and howe a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man oughte to behave hym silfe vnto every man be he perfet or a sinner / good or bad / stronge or weke / frend or fooe / and in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usion howe to behave oure selves both toward
<pb facs="tcp:5646:18"/>
god and toward oureselves also. And all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are profoundely grounded in the scriptures and declared wyth ensamples of him silfe / of the fathers and off the prophetes / that a man can here desyre no moare. Wherefore it apereth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that pauls mynde was to comprehend br<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>evely in thys pistle all the whole lernynge of Chr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ists Gospell / and to prepare an introduccion vn to all the olde testament. For with out doute w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosoever hath this pistle perfectly this hert / the same hath the lighte and the effecte of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stamemte with hym. Wherefore lett every man with oute excepcion exercice hym selfe therein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and recorde yt nyghte and daye continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally / vntyll he be full acoynted therewith.</p>
            <p>The laste chapter is a chapter of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion / wherein he yet myngleth a good monicion / that we shuld be ware of the tradicions and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of men / which begyle the simple with sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hestry and lerninge that is not after the gospell / and drawe them from Christ / and noosell them in weke and feble and (as paull calleth them in the pistle to the galathians) in bedgerly cerimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies / for the entent that they wolde lyve in fatte pastures / and be in auctorite / and be taken as Christe / ye and above christe / and sytt in the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of God / that is to witte in the consciences off men / where god only / his worde / and his christe oughte to sytte. Compare therefore all manner doctrine of men vn to the scripture / and se whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her they agre or not. And committe thy selfe wh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ole and all togedre vnto Christ / and so shall he with his holy sprite and with all his fulnes dw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in thi soule Amen.</p>
