         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Short Inſtructions for the SICK: Eſpecially who by Contagion, or otherwiſe, are deprived of the Preſence of a Faithfull PASTOR.</head>
            <byline>By RICHARD BAXTER.</byline>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe happy perſons who have made it the chief care and buſineſs of their lives, to be alwayes ready for a dying hour, have leaſt need of my preſent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: It is therefore thoſe unhappy ſouls, who are yet unprepared, whom I ſhall now inſtruct. And, O that the Lord would bleſs theſe words; and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> them yet, ere Time be gone!</p>
            <p>If ſin had not bewitched men, and made them Monſters of ſenſleſneſs and unbelief, it could not be, that an <hi>Endleſs Life,</hi> ſo <hi>ſure,</hi> ſo <hi>neer,</hi> could be ſo ſottiſhly made light of, all their lives, as it is by moſt, till they perceive that Death is ready to ſurprize them. But, poor ſinner, if this have been thy caſe, ſuppoſing yet that thou art unwilling to be damned, I earneſtly intreat thee in the Name of Chriſt, for the ſake of thy immortal ſoul, that thou wilt preſently lay to heart theſe ſhort Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, before Time and Hope are gone for ever.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Deut. 6.5. &amp; 10.12. &amp; 11.1, 13.</note>I. At laſt bethink thee <hi>what thou art?</hi> and for <hi>what End</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> thou cameſt into the world? Thou art a Man of Reaſon, and not a Brute, and haſt a Soul which was made to <hi>Know,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> thy Maker; and that not in the ſecond place, with the leavings of the fleſh; but in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, and with all thy Heart and Might. If this had been indeed thy life, God would have been thy Portion, thy Father, and thy Defence, and thou mightſt have liv'd and dy'd in peace and comfort, and then have liv'd with God for ever. And ſhould not a Creature live to the Ends and Uſes which it was made for? Muſt God give thee all thy powers for Himſelf, and wilt thou turn them from him, to the ſervice of the fleſh, and that when thou hadſt vowed the contrary in thy Baptiſm? How wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for ſuch treacherous ungodlineſs?</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is time for thee now to <hi>have ſerious thoughts of the Life which thou art going to:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.29. Matth. 6.19, 20, 33. Matth. 25. Rom. 2. 2 Cor. 4.18. &amp; 5.1, 7, 8, 9. Phil. 3.18, 20. 2 Theſ. 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 4.18.</note> If thou couldſt ſleepily forget it all the way; it is time to awake when thou art almoſt there. When thy friends are burying that fleſh in the earth, which thou didſt more regard than God and thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Soul muſt appear in an endleſs world; and ſee thoſe things which God foretold thee of, and thou wouldſt not believe, or ſet thy heart upon: As ſoon as Death hath opened the curtains, O what a ſight muſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently behold! A world of Angels and of holy Souls adoring, and praiſing, and admiring that God, whom thou didſt refuſe to <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ſerve:</hi> A world of Devils and damned ſouls, in torment and deſpair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their contempt of Chriſt and Grace, their neglect of God, and their Salvation, their ſerving the fleſh, and loving the world, and wilfully loſing the time of mercy, and all the means which God vouchſafed them. Believe it, <hi>ſinner,</hi> there is an Endleſs Joy and Glory for the Saints, and an Endleſs Miſery for all the ungodly; and one of theſe muſt quickly be thy caſe. Thy ſtate is changeable while thou art in the fleſh: If thy Soul be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, there is yet a Remedy: Its poſſible Chriſt may renew and pardon it: But as ſoon as thou goeſt hence, thou entereſt into a State of Joy or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which muſt never change: No not when millions of years are paſt. And doſt thou not think now in thy conſcience, that ſuch an Endleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſhould have been prevented with greater care and diligence, than all the ſufferings of this life? And that the attaining of ſuch an Endleſs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had been worth thy greateſt care and labour? And that it is far better to <hi>ſee</hi> the Glory of God, and be filled with his Love, and joyfully praiſe him with his Saints and Angels, for evermore, and by a Holy life to have prepared for this; than to pleaſe the fleſh, and follow the world a little while, and be undone for ever! Haſt thou got more by the world and ſin, than Heaven is worth? Thou art almoſt at the end of worldly pleaſures, and haſt all that ever they will do for thee? But if God had had thy heart and ſervice, he would not thus have caſt thee off; and his Rewards and Joyes would have had no end. O how much happier are the bleſſed Souls in Heaven, than we?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31. 2 Cor. 13.5. Pet. 1.10.</note>III. And ſeeing you are ſo neer to the Judgment of God, where your Soul muſt receive its final ſentence, it is high time now to <hi>judge your ſelf,</hi> and know what ſtate your Soul is in? whether in a ſtate of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or of <hi>Damnation.</hi> For this may be certainly known if you are willing. And firſt you muſt know <hi>who they be</hi> whom Chriſt will <hi>juſtifie,</hi> and whom he will <hi>condemn:</hi> And this the <hi>Word of God</hi> will tell you: For he will judge them by <hi>that Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.3, 5. 2 Cor. 5.17. Epheſ. 1.18. Joh. 3.16, 19. Gal. 5.24. Rom. 8.9. Mat. 6.21, 33. Mat. 28.20. Heb. 12.14.</note> In a word [<q>All thoſe whom Chriſt will juſtifie and ſave, are made new creatures by the renewing work of the Holy Ghoſt: Their eyes are opened to ſee the vanity of this world, and the certainty and excellency of the Glory of Heaven; and to ſee the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of a <hi>holy life,</hi> and to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> to cleanſe them from their ſins, and bring them to that Glory. And therefore they forſake the ſinful pleaſures of the fleſh, and ſet their hearts on the everlaſting bleſſedneſs, and ſeek it before all things, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and hating their former ſins, they give up themſelves ſincerely, to their God and Father, their Saviour, and their Sanctifier, to be taught and ruled, juſtified, ſanctified, and ſaved by him;<note place="margin">Rev. 2.7, 10. Prov. 11.7. Job 8.13, 14.</note> reſolving whatever it coſt the fleſh, to ſtand to this choice and Covenant to the death.</q>] This is the caſe of all that Chriſt will juſtifie and ſave: The reſt who never were thus renewed and ſanctified, will be condemned, as ſure as the Goſpel is true. Therefore let it be ſpeedily your work, to try whether this be your caſe or not? Have you been thus enlightened, convinced, and renewed, to believe in Chriſt, and the life to come, and to give up your ſelf in a faithful Covenant to God your <hi>Father,</hi> your Saviour, and your Sanctifier? to hate your ſin, and to live and love a holy life, in mortifying the fleſh, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven before the world? If this be not your caſe, I ſhould but flatter and deceive you to tell you of any hope of being ſaved, till you are thus renewed and juſtified. Never imagine a lye to quiet you, till help is paſt. No one that is unregenerate or unholy, ſhall ever dwell with God. Yet you may be ſaved, if yet you will be truly converted and ſanctified: But <hi>without this,</hi> aſſuredly there is no hope.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Therefore I counſel you in the name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.3, 5. Luk. 15. Matth. 18.3.</note> to <hi>look back upon your ſinful life with ſorrow;</hi> not only becauſe of the <hi>danger</hi> to <hi>your ſelf,</hi> but alſo becauſe you have <hi>offended God!</hi> What think you <hi>now</hi> of a <hi>ſinful</hi> and of a <hi>holy life?</hi> Had it not been better that you had valued Chriſt and Grace, and lived in the love of God, and in the joyful hopes of the life to come, and denyed the ſinful deſires of the fleſh, and been ruled by the Law of God, and ſpent your time in preparing for eternity? Do you not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that this had been your courſe? Would you take this courſe if it were to do again? and God recover you? Repent, repent from the bottom of your heart, of the time you have loſt, the mercy you have abuſed, the grace you have reſiſted, of all your <hi>fleſhly, worldly</hi> deſires, words and deeds; and that you gave not up your ſoul and life to the Love of God and life eternal.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And now reſolvedly give up your ſelf in a hearty Covenant to God!<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28. 2 Cor. 8.5. Act. 11.23.</note> Though it be late, he will yet accept and pardon you, if you do it in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Take God for your God, your portion and felicity, to live in his Love and praiſe for ever; Take Chriſt for your Saviour, to teach, and rule, and juſtifie you, and bring you unto God; and the holy Spirit for your Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, and certainly God will take you for his Child. But ſee that you be truly willing of his Grace, and reſolved never to forſake him more.<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36, 37. Hebr. 8.10. &amp; 10.16. Jer. 32.40.</note> O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Soul, if yet at laſt, the Lord will make this change upon thee! And I'le tell you certainly how to know, whether this late Repentance will ſerve for your Salvation, or not. If it be but <hi>Fear</hi> only which cauſeth your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> be not renewed, but you would turn again to a fleſhly, worldly and ungodly life, if you be recovered; then it will never ſave your ſoul. But if your <hi>Heart,</hi> your <hi>Will,</hi> your <hi>Love</hi> be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this change would hold if God recovered you to health again, then doubt not of pardon and Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And if God have thus changed your heart, and drawn it to Himſelf,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.21, 23. 2 Cor. 5.1.8. Rev. 14.13. Act. 7.59. John 17.24. &amp; 12.26. Rev. 21. &amp; 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> be thankful for ſo great a mercy! O bleſs him for giving you a Redeemer and a Sanctifier, and the pardoning Covenant of Grace. And now be not afraid or loath to leave a ſinful world, and come to God! Pray harder for grace and pardon, than for life. Commit and truſt your ſouls to Chriſt! He had never done ſo much for ſouls, if he had not loved them, and been willing to receive them! How wonderfully came he down to man, to bring up man to the ſight of God! He is gone before to prepare us a Manſion in the City of God, and hath promiſed to take us to himſelf, that we may dwell with him, and ſee his Glory! The world which you are going to, is unlike to this! There is no pride, or luſt, or cruelty, oppreſſion, deceit, or any ſin! No wicked men to ſcorn or perſecute us! No vanity to allure us! No Devil to tempt us! No corruption of our own to burden or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger us! No fears, or cares, or griefs, or diſcontents! No poverty, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pain, or death! No doubtings of the Love of God or our Salvation! But the ſight of God, and the feelings of his Love, and the fervent flames of our Love to him, will be the everlaſting pleaſure of the Saints! Theſe will break forth in triumphant and harmonious thanks and praiſe in the preſence of our glorified Redeemer, and in concord with all the heavenly Hoſts, the bleſſed Angels, and the Spirits of the Juſt! This is the end of faith and holineſs, patience and perſeverance: When Hell is the end of unbelief, ungodlineſs, ſenſuality, and hypocriſie. How juſtly are they condemned, who ſell their part of endleſs Joyes, for a ſhadow and dream of tranſitory pleaſures? and can delight more in the filth of ſin, and in a fading vanity, than in the Love of God, and the fore-thoughts of Glory! What Love can be too great, what Deſires too fervent; what prayer and labour can be too much! what ſuffering too dear for ſuch a Bleſſedneſs?</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, Becauſe there are many caſes of the ſick, which require the preſence of a <hi>judicious Divine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2.7. James 5.14. Pſal. 73.26.</note> if it be poſſible get the help of ſuch; if not, remember that God is juſt, in denying men that mercy in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, which in the time of their health and proſperity they rejected with ſcorn &amp; contempt, and cleave to him whom you may enjoy for ever.</p>
