            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our Army advanced to <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi>
we were deſired by the
Parliament to march to <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire;</hi>
when we came there we
were deſired to purſue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the Field, we have done
accordingly; the King and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Gerard</hi> had about foure thouſand Horſe and
three thouſand Foot, we have driven them out of
<hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> and by parties have purſued them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113122:3"/>
from the one end of <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> to the other,
we put our great Ordnance into <hi>Glouceſter</hi> that we
might the better follow them; their Foot are now
all diſſipated ſo that we cannot heare of them, their
Horſe are out of <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> and diſperſed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Counties of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſome in <hi>Monmouth,</hi> ſome
in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> ſome in <hi>Brecknock,</hi> others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ludlow,</hi> ſo that we have no conſiderable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the enemy to follow; and I hope none will
blame us that wee doe not fight with thoſe that
will never ſtay in our view, but runne to Rocks
and Mountaines in divided and inconſiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
We were alſo deſired to hinder the enemies
Recruits, and live in their Quarters; I hope we have
done the firſt to good purpoſe; but concerning
the laſt, we know not where they are; for we doe
no ſooner come to any place (though yeſterday)
all in the enemies poſſeſſion, but within a day or
two the Countrey calls it the Parliaments Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and deſire us to remove to ſome other place.
If there be any part in <hi>England</hi> the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we are now in them, for there cannot be a more
malignant people in <hi>Britaine;</hi> they give all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
and aſſiſtance they can to the enemy, and
will afford us no manner of entertainment that they
can withhold: Our Souldiers in a weeks time have
ſcarce got three dayes proviſions, and theſe eight
dayes paſt, except once, have not ſeene bread. We
ſent to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but could get nothing there, but
for ready money; and if Major <hi>Dobſon</hi> (who hath
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113122:3"/>
been very kinde and active for us,) had not given his
word in aſſurance thereof, we had been forced to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Money before wee received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>
            <p>Many promiſes were made for the care of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before our advance Southward; jf they had been
performed, and that reſpect had to us, as to other
Armies in the Kingdome, the Common Enemy
had been in a lower condition, and our aſſiſtance of
greater advantage to our friends; What the cauſe is
that hath obſtructed all our Supplies, or what the
ends of it are, I will not take upon me to determine;
but I doubt if any Age can parallel our condition.
Wee have weakened our owne Kingdome, by
bringing ſupplies to this, and have expoſed it to
the mercileſſe fury of Iriſh Rebels, and unnaturall
Countrymen, out of an earneſt deſire to quench
the flames here: Our Souldiers have not weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to march with hungry bellies both day and night,
when occaſion requires; yet we heare there be ſome
Aegyptian Task-maſters, who withhold the ſtraw,
and call for more brick, being never ſatisfied with
what we doe; the worſt I wiſh to ſuch, is, that
they were eye witneſſes to our ſufferings and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I am ſure (if they have any affection to the
Cauſe) they would lend us more of their help, and
ſpeake leſſe to our prejudice; If they be Enemies
I regard not what they ſay: But to returne; The
Generall ſent a Convoy to the Engliſh Commiſſio-weake
and a thin Army. But we bleſſe the Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113122:4"/>
ners, and they came hither upon Munday; yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
we had a meeting with them, where it was
debated, whether we ſhould purſue the Enemy in
the Fields, or fall upon ſome other deſigne, but
there being no conſiderable body of the enemy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the firſt was by all conceived no wayes for
the publike advantage; there remained nothing but a
ſiege; the Queſtion was, whether <hi>Worceſter</hi> or <hi>Hereford,</hi>
at <hi>Worceſter</hi> we could be more eaſily and better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of all neceſſaries, both for the ſiege and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of the Souldiers; the King had not another
paſſe upon <hi>Severne,</hi> and it brought much trade to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
upon the other part <hi>Hereford</hi> was neerer the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Quarters, we could be more able to annoy the
Enemy, hinder his Recruits, and breake his Forces, the
taking thereof gained the whole County where now
the Parliament had no intereſt, and ſo inlarged their
Quarters. <hi>Worceſter</hi> alſo would thereby be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
blocked up, the Parliament having already three
ſides of it. Theſe reaſons were found the ſtronger
and more for the advantage of the publike ſervice,
and this day the Army is marched toward <hi>Hereford,</hi>
and are to lie downe before it. I truſt care will be
taken to furniſh us with Materials for that purpoſe,
wherein for the preſent we are unprovided; but
our greateſt feare is, for want of Victuals for the
Souldiers, for they had never worſe entertainment;
and if they were not conſtant in their affections to
the Cauſe, the difficulties and diſcouragements they
have met with in theſe few dayes had made us a

for his aſſiſtance, and though we ſhould be yet more
neglected by men, ſhall never bee wanting in the
Cauſe of God, wherein we are confidentt he will
ever inable us to dee what hee requires at our
hands, I am</p>
