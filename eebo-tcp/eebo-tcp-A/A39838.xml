            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And behold I will ſend Elijah the Prophet,
before the Coming of the Great and Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Day of the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SOME there are that underſtand theſe words of
the firſt Coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, which
though it was a Day of Salvation to God's People,
yet to others it was terrible. But I ſhall treat of
them at preſent as they relate to the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if we conſult the anſwer which the
Angel gave to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> enquiring of him about the day of
Judgment, we ſhall find this to be part of it; <hi>And there
ſhall Fires break forth in many places.</hi> I hope then I need
not Apologize for my ſelf, becauſe I have made choice
of this ſubject, as if a Word not in Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Now the two Columns on which I intend to build the
Structure of my enſuing diſcourſe, are only the two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes
here in the Text given by the Holy Ghoſt to the
Day of the Lord; of which I ſhall ſpeak firſt ſeverally, and
then jointly in the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45550:5"/>
The day of the Lord is here ſtiled, <hi>Dies magnus,</hi> the
Great day, and that not without great reaſon: For then there
ſhall be ſuch a Convention, ſuch a huge meeting as never
was before that day, and never will be after it.</p>
            <p>For 1. Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven <hi>with Power and
great Glory,</hi> as he himſelf expreſſeth it, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 27. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſays as much, <hi>Titus 2. ver. 13. Looking for that bleſſed
hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The firſt coming of Chriſt was in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
The ſecond time he ſhall come as the Great God
with Power, and great Glory. All things ſhall be ſubject
unto him. He ſhall have his feet upon the neck of all Rule,
of all Authority, and of all Power: And the knees of all
things in Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth ſhall <hi>bow
down</hi> to him: and every Tongue <hi>confeſs</hi> him to be the Lord,
to the Glory of God the Father, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath it,
<hi>Phil. 2</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>2. All the Angels ſhall be preſent, attending like ſo many
Courtiers upon him; for he himſelf hath ſaid it, <hi>The Son
of man ſhall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with
him,</hi> Mat. 25. He ſhall not leave one behind him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The vaſt Regions of the Air that that multitude muſt
needs fill! Oh what a brave, glorious, great day muſt that
needs be, when ſo many <hi>glorious Suns</hi> ſhall ſhine in the
Firmament, and among, and above them all Chriſt the
<hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs!</hi> Some think the Angels at that day
will bear him aloft with their natural ſtrength as on their
ſhoulders, that his Glory and Power might be the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the greater terrour of the wicked.</p>
            <p>3. All the Elect will be preſent with him in glorious glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Bodies, as his Children, and deareſt Friends, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> mentioned by Saint <hi>Jude,
Behold the Lord comes with ten thouſand of his Saints:</hi> that
is, with an innumerable company, who together with Chriſt
ſhall judge the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45550:5"/>
4. Before him on that day ſhall be gathered all Nations,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. even as many as ever were born into the world
from the beginning to the end of it: Then ſhall <hi>Adam</hi> ſee all
his off-ſpring at once, none ſhall be exempted from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
at this general Aſſizes; neither ſhall any appear by
Proxy, but every one in perſon; neither ſhall men only,
but all the Legions of the Devils, how many ſoever they be,
they ſhall then appear, and that (as it is thought) in a
corporeal ſhape to be ſeen. Lord! what a great, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſtupendious ſight muſt that needs be, to ſee the whole
Hemiſphere above embroidered with Saints and Angels
reaching unto Heaven; and beneath an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Damned covering the face of the Earth far and
near, howling, and weeping, and ſighing: but in the midſt
of theſe two vaſt Bodies wonderfully rallied together, Chriſt
the Judge. Ought not this to be ſtiled a <hi>Great day?</hi> who
ever ſaw at any time ſuch a Convention, ſuch a Meeting,
ſuch an Aſſembly? Great, confeſſedly great will this day
of <hi>Jeſreel</hi> be, that is, of the Seed of God; for Chriſt ſhall
then ſeparate his Seed from the Seed of the Devil. As in
an Amphitheatre, ſuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> had, innumerable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
ſate round about it above, and below on the floor
were the poor perſons condemned to be devoured by Beaſts,
ruefully expecting them to be turn'd looſe upon them.
Thus all the Saints will be as ſo many ſpectators plac'd in
the Region of the Air above; but on the Earth the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that are by the Devils (when the ſentence ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
to be drag'd to Hell.</p>
            <p>2. It may be call'd the <hi>Great Day,</hi> becauſe on that day
buſineſs of the greateſt Concernment ſhall be Tranſacted.
Not about the Affairs of one ſingle Empire, or of ſome
certain Kingdoms, but the work of <hi>that day</hi> will be about
the buſineſs of the whole World: About the chiefeſt and
eternal Good, about the chiefeſt and eternal Evil. At <hi>that
day</hi> it will be known what condition every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45550:6"/>
ſhall abide, and continue in to all Eternity. For then
<hi>as the Tree falls, whether toward the South, or toward the
North, in the place where the Tree falls there it ſhall be,</hi>
Eccleſ. 11. 3. which denotes an Eternity of Bliſs or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. It may be call'd the <hi>Great Day,</hi> becauſe that day will
comprehend the <hi>paſt days</hi> of all Ages: it will be as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation
of <hi>all days,</hi> from the firſt day that ever dawn'd;
and on it, as in the laſt Scene of a Comedy, whatſoever at
any time was acted on the Stage of the World, ſhall then
be exhibited to view.</p>
            <p>1. For all the actions of mortals ſhall be laid open, and
ſurvey'd as at one view. There is not an idle word, but
we ſhall give an account of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
goes ſomewhat farther then this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. In that day
God ſhall judge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The ſecrets of
mens hearts.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe Thoughts, Words, and Actions ſhall be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Chriſt—
<q>
                  <l>Quem latebit nil occultum,</l>
                  <l>Nec relinquet quid inultum;</l>
               </q>
as one hath it: Who will ſuffer no Perſon, or Thing to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
his moſt exact Scrutiny.</p>
            <p>3. Every one ſhall be rewarded by Chriſt according to
what he hath acted in the Fleſh. Then the Lord will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
his Treaſures both of Rewards and Puniſhments,
which he heaped up together till <hi>that day,</hi> then to be
diſtributed; hence is that, <hi>Deut. 32. 32. Is not this laid up
in ſtore with me, and ſealed up among my Treaſures?</hi> A
Treaſure, you know, is a great heap, or heaps of Money
that hath been a great while a gathering; and ſuch are the
actions of men, and the deſerts of them lockt up from the
beginning of the world in the mind and memory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, which he will open on that day, and reward
every one according to his doings. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45550:6"/>
day the <hi>day of Reſtitution</hi> of all things, ſaying, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
muſt receive Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, till
the times of Reſtitution of all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. meaning,
he ſhall then reſtore whatſoever any committed to him, or
depoſited as in his hand. The Apoſtle uſing that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
minds me of <hi>Razis,</hi> of whom we may read in the
2. Book of <hi>Machabees,</hi> Chap. 14. who that he might ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and encourage the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſtand for their Laws, fatally
wounded himſelf being over-zealous, rather then he would
give himſelf into the hands of wicked men; ſo when his
blood was utterly gone, ſaith the Hiſtory, he took out his
own Bowels with his hands, and threw them upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
calling upon the Lord of Life and Spirit, that he
would reſtore them again unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> at the laſt and
<hi>Great Day,</hi> and ſo he dyed. The ſame reaſon holds for
evil actions, witneſs that expreſſion of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
2. 5. But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt
up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath. Now in
treaſuring, as one hath well obſerved, there is, 1. A <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in.</hi> 2. A <hi>lying hid.</hi> 3. A <hi>bringing out</hi> again, as there
is occaſion. Thus wicked profligate perſons, while by
following of their Luſts they think they do ſomewhat to
the furthering of their happineſs, they ſhall in the end find,
<hi>pro Theſauro Carbones,</hi> inſtead of other Treaſure, hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coals. And if it will be thus, what is there hid that
ſhall not be made manifeſt, that it may have its reward?
The Adulterer who waits for the twilight, and to whom
the morning is as the ſhadow of death, ſhall in <hi>that day</hi> be
manifeſt at Noontide to the view of Men and Angels; and
if his being known here puts him in the terror of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of death; how terrible ſhall <hi>that day</hi> be to him, when
what he hath done in ſecret ſhall be proclaimed on the
houſe top!</p>
            <p>4. It merits to be call'd the <hi>Great Day,</hi> becauſe it will be
a day of the greteſt combat and conqueſt. For behold, ſaith
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45550:7"/>
the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Joel, In thoſe days, and at that time,
I will gather all Nations, and will bring them down into
the valley of</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>and will plead with them there,
Joel</hi> 3. 2. Behold here the Warriour, and the Triumphant
Conquerour. But with what Weapons will he wage War?
I anſwer, with no other then the two edg'd Sword of the
Word of his mouth, with which he will object againſt the
wicked their abominable ingratitude; ſo that they ſhall
have nothing to ſay for themſelves, no more then he in the
Goſpel who had not on his wedding garment; 'tis ſaid of
him, he was ſpeechleſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. Suppoſe we Chriſt ſitting
in the Air near <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> judging the world there where
himſelf was judged, and uſing this, or the like language.</p>
            <p>Behold me ſitting over againſt that place where firſt I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd,
and began my Paſſion; here, here in <hi>Gethſemani</hi> I
did ſweat blood for you; here I was betray'd, and taken,
and led like ſome notorious Thief, or Robber into the City,
where I was hurried from one Tribunal to another,
ſcourg'd, buffeted, abuſed, and at length unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd;
after that, lugging my Croſs, I came to Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi>
where I was Crucified for you. Behold the very
place where hanging between Heaven and Earth, (being
plac'd between two Thieves) I offer'd my ſelf a Sacrifice for
you to the Father: you <hi>Pilat</hi> can witneſs this, and you <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,
Caiphas, Annas, Judas,</hi> and ye ô <hi>Jews</hi> that opened
thus like a pack of Blood-hounds upon me, Away with
him, away with him, he is not worthy to live; Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, Crucifie him: Heaven and Earth can witneſs
as much, for the Heaven that was darkened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the face
of it, and the Earth opened, and did cleave aſunder the
moſt rocky part of it: Nay, theſe very ſcars that your eyes
ſee in my body teſtifie no leſs: After this being riſen from
the dead, I aſcended up into Heaven from this very Mount
of <hi>Olives,</hi> in the publick view of my Apoſtles and many
other Diſciples, to ſhew that I came down from Heaven for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45550:7"/>
your Salvation, and my Embaſſy being done was to return
to my Father. The Angels at my Aſcenſion were heard to
ſay, that I ſhould ſo come in like manner as you ſaw me go
into Heaven; and I my ſelf ſpake of it to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> the chief
Prieſts, and the <hi>Jews,</hi> uſing this very Language; Ye ſhall
ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of Power,
and coming in the Clouds of Heaven: why then did ye
not credit ſo great, and ſo good Teſtimony? Behold now
my condition is chang'd with yours, ye ſate once as Judges,
and I was the Priſoner at the Bar, now ye are the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and I am the Judge; ſee my hands and my feet, that it
is I my ſelf; ſee the very holes that ye dig'd with your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of cruelty in this Body of mine. Theſe like ſo
many mouths cry out againſt you, theſe accuſe and condemn
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go ye unworthy Wretches, ye Chriſt-Killers, get ye
packing into unquenchable fire; and ye ô <hi>Infidels, Turks,</hi>
and profligate <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who know theſe things, or might
have known them, but ye have neglected, but ye have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
and contemned whatſoever I did, and ſuffer'd; ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, ye choſe
rather to follow the dictates of your own Luſts then of my
Law: ye preferr'd Riches, and ſenſual Pleaſures, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Preferments, before Eternal Salvation promis'd by
me; ye made a mock of me when I threatned Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
now ye ſee him whom ye have deſpiſed, now ye
find my words to be more then wind; my Threatnings not
to be vain, but true; my Promiſes not to be Chimera's, but
realities; now ye experience your Delights and Dignities,
and ſinful Pleaſures ye ſo much magnified, to be vain and
fallacious: now ye ſee how fooliſh, and ſottiſh, and ſenſeleſs
ye have been in your love; ye now lament and bewail with
a paſſionate wringing of your hands, and beating of your
breaſts, but too late, and therefore all in vain. Go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye Wicked, go ye Ingrateful, go ye Infidels, go ye Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45550:8"/>
but for you my Apoſtles, who ſaw me in this place
Condemn'd, Scourg'd, Crucifi'd, Murther'd, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
in me, followed me throw the ſame Red Sea of Blood;
and you Apoſtolical, and Religious Perſons, who did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the world, and were not aſham'd of my Croſs, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd
my Poverty and Humility, propagating my Doctrine
and Faith throughout the whole world: and as for you, O
ye Faithful ones, who did believe in me your Redeemer,
hope in me, love, worſhip, and obey me, leading a life
worthy of me, a ſober, righteous, and a godly life, who
did look for that bleſſed hope, and this my ſecond coming
to judgment; Come ye, come ye my Elect, come ye bleſſed
of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from
the Foundation of the world. That then muſt needs be a
<hi>Great Day</hi> that determines buſineſs of ſuch great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>5. It may be ſtil'd the <hi>Great Day,</hi> becauſe that day will
put an end to the world, will put a period to time, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and all kind of impieties, and to all the labours and
endeavours of men. Thus thoſe days among the <hi>Romans</hi>
were call'd <hi>Great Days,</hi> which did put an end to great and
grievous Troubles: <hi>Alexander</hi> got the Appellation of <hi>Great</hi>
in that he won ſtrong holds, and ſlew the Kings of the Earth,
ſo that the whole world ſtood in awe of him, it was huſh
and ſilent, but that ſilence continued not long, but till his
death, which ſoon came to paſs. But Chriſt the King of
Kings in that <hi>Great Day,</hi> when he hath deſtroy'd all the
wicked, he ſhall impoſe a perpetual and univerſal ſilence on
the whole world. Then the Heavens ſhall be ſilent becauſe
their motion ſhall ceaſe, and ſo conſequently the viciſſitude
of day and night, winter and ſummer muſt ceaſe too: The
motion of the Elements ſhall ceaſe, and ſo conſequently
Clouds, Winds, Rain, Hail, Tempeſts, and Earthquakes will
be no more: All Creatures will be ſilent, becauſe there
will be none to make any diſturbance: All the Studies,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45550:8"/>
Arts, Diſciplines, Deſires, Quarrels, and Contentions of
Men will be ſilent, becauſe all things that were in motion
will obtain their period; methinks our Saviour pointed at
this (as it were) with his finger; for when he read that
place in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>The Spirit of
the Lord is upon me,</hi> &amp;c. to Preach the acceptable year of
the Lord; <hi>Et Diem retributionis,</hi> and the Day of <hi>Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
'tis ſaid, he clos'd the Book, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. hinting thus
much to us, that in that <hi>Great Day</hi> of Reſtitution, or Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
all things ſhall have an end, and the Heavens be
roll'd up like a Book or Scroll once more. This Day of
the Lord it may be ſtil'd the <hi>Great Day,</hi> becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that <hi>Great Day</hi> call'd Eternity: A Type of which
Day we may read of in the Book of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> Chap. 10.
when <hi>Joſuah</hi> that he might purſue his Enemies to purpoſe,
caus'd the Sun to ſtand ſtill: The Sun and Moon ſtood ſtill
the ſpace of one whole day, ſo that one day was as long as
two, ſaith the Son of <hi>Syrach;</hi> there was no day like that,
before it or after it, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joſuah</hi> 10. 14.
Thus when Chriſt ſhall encounter his Enemies, he will make
the Sun and Moon to ſtand ſtill till he hath reveng'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon them: But becauſe that vengeance is to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the Day muſt be Eternal too: I may adde, as in the Day
of <hi>Joſuah</hi>'s victory one part of the Heaven was always
bright, and the other dark; thus in <hi>that Day</hi> it will be
eternally light to the Elect, but as long darkneſs with the
Damned: What ſhall we think thoſe People thought in
the time of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> who in the oppoſite part of the Heavens
had ſo long night, with what a deal of perplexity did they
expect day? and if ſo, what will an Eternal night be? but
if to an Eternal Night be added an Eternal Priſon, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Hunger, and Thirſt, a never-dying Worm, an
Eternal Stink, an Eternal Horrour, Eternal Weeping, and
Wailing, an Eternal Fire, and whatever miſery the mind
of man is able to think of: <hi>Qualis illa nox erit!</hi> Tell me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45550:9"/>
if you are able, what a Night that will be? Good reaſon
then there is that <hi>this Day</hi> of the Lord ſpoken of here in my
Text ſhould be ſtyl'd <hi>Dies Magnus,</hi> the Great Day.</p>
            <p>That which remains for me to ſhew you, is, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
it will be Terrible, or Dreadful. <hi>Behold I will ſend
you</hi> Elijah <hi>the Prophet, before the Coming of the Great and
Dreadful Day of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, Beloved, the Dreadfulneſs of <hi>that Day</hi> will
conſiſt chiefly in the Judge: As,</p>
            <p>1. In his <hi>Dreadful coming</hi> to Judgment, which Saint
<hi>John</hi> therefore uſhers in with an <hi>Ecce, Rev. 1. 7. Behold he
comes with Clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him:</hi> The Royal
Chariot then of this Judge will be a Cloud: But what kind
of Cloud think you? ſuch a one as was that, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from extremity of heat in the day, and
gave them light by night? Or like that little Cloud in
the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> no bigger at firſt then a mans hand,
which increaſing brought rain to the parched Earth? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no: The Clouds that are for this ſervice will not be
ſuch as our eyes may often behold, coaſting about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Air as they are driven by the Winds, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
themſelves to the refreſhment of the Earth; but
ſtormy tempeſtuous Clouds breathing Fire, and caſting
forth hot Thunder-bolts: hence is that, <hi>Pſalm 50. 3. Our
God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence, a</hi> Fire <hi>ſhall devour
before him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtuous round about him:</hi>
Not before him only, but, which is very obſervable, round
about him, leſt the wicked ſhould hope to eſcape by creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
behind him. That was a terrible Tempeſt I read of
that befel <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and his Army marching
into the Country of <hi>Gabiza,</hi> when by reaſon of continual
Thundring, and Lightning with Hail-Stones, and Light-Bolts,
the Army was diſ-ranked, ſo that they wandred
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45550:9"/>
many ways: but alas that was nothing to the rout that
will be at the coming of this Judge; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt
Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> Chap. 1. 8. he ſays that he will
come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know
not God; 'tis true, our Saviour hath appeared comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to his, though over-ſhadow'd with a Cloud, as at
his Transfiguration; but when he comes in a warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
againſt his Enemies, as he will do then, his appearance
muſt needs be Dreadful.</p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> will conſiſt in his being <hi>known,
Revelations</hi> 1. ver. 13. we may read of one in the midſt
of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks like to the Son of man,
which ſhews that Chriſt the Judge of the world will be
ſo manifeſt as to be acknowledg'd: Then there ſhall be
no conteſt about him, as whether he be <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
or the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> ſuch queſtions as theſe ſhall then be
put out of queſtion. Neither ſhall he come obſcurely,
as when he came firſt in the fleſh: But why is he ſaid to
be like the Son of man only, and is not call'd the Son of
man, as he was call'd when he liv'd on Earth? becauſe,
ſaith one, <hi>Sicut in Chriſto aliquando Divinitatis ſuae glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam
occultabai Humanitas,</hi> &amp;c. As the Humanity once
obſcur'd in Chriſt the Glory of his Divinity, ſo now the
meanneſs of his Humanity will ſeem to be ſwallow'd up
of the Glory of his Majeſty; as then at firſt he appear'd
ſo meanly, that little or nothing of his Divinity externally
ſhew'd it ſelf; ſo at his coming to Judgment he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ſo ſplendent, and glorious, that he will be believed
by all to be the Son of God. Suffer me here a little to
expoſtulate; If powerful <hi>Herod</hi> fear'd him lying in the
Manger, will he not be much more fear'd ſitting upon his
Throne? If the Buyers and Sellers were drove out of the
Temple by him having a ſcourge of ſmall cords only in
his hand, who ſhall ſtand before him puniſhing to death
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45550:10"/>
with Scorpions? If he ſo ſtun'd a whole Troop of his
Enemies in the Garden at the ſpeaking of one word,
that they fell backward, what Terror will it be to hear
him pronounce the laſt Sentence of Damnation? What
amazement and ſhame will take hold of them who either
believ'd him not to be God, or did not believe in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
or honour'd him not with a good life, who yet
confeſs'd him to be God with their lips? Then <hi>Herod</hi> will
look upon him with aſtoniſhment as the wiſeſt, whom
when on Earth he did cauſe to be gorgeouſly attir'd like
a fool, on purpoſe to laugh at him, and deride him. Then
<hi>Caiphas</hi> will behold him coming in the Clouds of Heaven,
as he himſelf told him to his head, whom therefore he did
pronounce a Blaſphemer. Then will <hi>Pilate</hi> ſee him whom
he expos'd to the People to be ſeen, nay, deliver'd up to
their brutiſh will. Then will the <hi>Jews</hi> know whether he
was their King whom they deny'd; and then ſhall all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wretches, who ſaid in the pride of their hearts, <hi>Nolumus
hunc regnare,</hi> we will not have this Chriſt to Reign over
us, ſee him Reigning over them, and Arraigning them
both as King and Judge.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> he ſhall be inveſted with,
ſhadow'd forth by the Garment he was cloath'd with, which
reach'd down to his feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. Kings, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
have long hands, but they are not ſo long, but ſome
ſometimes eſcape unpuniſh'd in ſome blind places of their
Kingdoms. From this Judge there is no flinching; every
Tranſgreſſion, and Tranſgreſſor from him ſhall receive a
juſt recompence of reward; even thoſe Corruptions that
are moſt inward, and lye up in the heart of the Country,
as it were; thoſe Pollutions, not of fleſh only (that is, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
luſts, and groſs evils) but of ſpirit alſo, more ſpiritual
luſts come within his cognizance: He eyes not only the act
but the intention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45550:10"/>
4. The <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> of <hi>this Day</hi> of the Lord conſiſts in
the <hi>rigorouſneſs</hi> of the Judge. 'Tis true, he is ſaid to
be girt about the paps with a golden girdle, but this
denotes ſeverity as well as mercy: The pardoning of the
Thief on the Croſs; the long waiting for the Converſion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the patience of his which we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
ſhews that he hath paps; But a time will come,
I mean, the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> when he will ſhut up his
boſome, and girt it cloſe about with a girdle of gold,
to ſhew the juſtice of ſuch a proceeding, they being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
deſpis'd then, who deſpiſe him now when he offers
the milk of Grace, and Mercy unto them.</p>
            <p>5. In the <hi>Equity</hi> of the Judge this <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
his head, and his hairs, 'tis ſaid, were white like
Wool, as white as Snow, <hi>Rev. 1. 14</hi> that is, the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Concluſions of this Judge will be moſt pure, moſt
true, and moſt juſt. 'Tis confeſt in the Fifth Chapter of
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where he is deſcrib'd reſembling one that is
young; his locks are ſaid to be buſhy, and black as a
Raven: Becauſe here in this life we experience Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign,
and liberal, for he rewards true repentance with
receiving into his favour, gives Heaven for a few Cordial
Sighs, or Groans, proceeding from an humble, and a
contrite Heart; but the caſe will be alter'd when he
comes to ſit in <hi>Judgment,</hi> then he will appear white as
Snow, the Ancient of days, not to be wrought upon
to ſhew favour. Youth (you know) is more liberal
then old Age: Ancient people hardly part with any
thing, as knowing the difficulty of getting what youth
freely gives.</p>
            <p>6. His <hi>Eyes,</hi> 'tis ſaid, were like a <hi>Flame</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> that
is, agile, nimble, and able to penetrate any thing; hence
is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to
do: naked for the out-ſide; diſſected, quartered, cleft in
the back-bone for the in-ſide; <hi>Eraſmus</hi> renders it <hi>reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinata,</hi>
making it a Metaphor from thoſe that lye with
their faces upward, that all Paſſengers may ſee who they
are. <hi>Thou numbreſt my ſteps,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> he did no leſs
then confeſs that he kept an exact account of every ſin of
his, of every ſtep that he trod awry, yea, though it were
but ſome wry motion of his mind, ſo curious and critical
he is in his obſervation; even then when to many he
ſeems to ſleep, and to ſhut his eyes, and to ſee nothing, he
takes notice of every thing. Of this Judge it is ſaid,
<hi>Pſalm 11. His eyes behold, his eye-lids try the Children of
men.</hi> Where his eye points out his knowledge, and his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
his critical deſcant. Thoſe Creatures that have fiery
eyes can ſee in the night; and there is nothing but is open
to the ſight of this Judge. Again, 'Tis ſaid, his <hi>Feet</hi>
were like <hi>fine Braſs,</hi> as if burned in a Furnace: which may
ſignifie the inflexibleneſs of this Judge, proceeding from
an ardent zeal to do juſtice: while life laſts he is pleaſed
to bend his feet, and bow them going forth in a way
of Commiſeration, and compaſſion towards the Sons of
Men: but it ſhall not be ſo, when he acts the Judge:
Then his Legs will be Marble, and his Feet Braſs;
where he placeth his Foot, there it ſhall inflexibly
ſtand. This very thing is ſignified likewiſe by the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Rod, which the Scripture ſpeaks of; the one is a
<hi>Rod of Wood,</hi> mentioned <hi>Pſalm</hi> 23. which Rod is eaſily
bow'd if any thing of weight be faſtned to the end of it;
but the other altogether inflexible as being a <hi>Rod of Iren,</hi>
ſpoken of, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. which the Holy Ghoſt there puts
into the hand of this Judge. 'Tis poſſible that <hi>the Rods</hi>
of earthly Judges may be bow'd if a Purſe of Money be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45550:11"/>
ty'd at the end of them; but the Rod of this Judge is not

            <p>To proceed; His voice is ſaid to be as the <hi>ſound of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Waters,</hi> terrible; ſuppoſe, as the noyſe of a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that is heard far, and near. A River or Stream that is
damm'd up for a time, when once it breaks forth, the
noyſe it makes is inutterable, not to be expreſt. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then if the Ocean of the wrath of God ſtreightned,
as it were, for ſo many thouſand years, at length breaks
forth like the <hi>ſound of many Waters. I have a long time
held my Peace,</hi> ſaith the Lord himſelf, <hi>I have been ſtill,
and refrain'd my ſelf, now will I cry like a travelling Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I will deſtroy, and devour at once,</hi> Iſaiah 42. 14.
If <hi>Job</hi> was forc'd to ſay, Deſtruction from God was a
terrour to me, and by reaſon of his Highneſs I could
not endure; How will the Damned be able to bear the
weight of that Sentence, <hi>Ariſe ye Dead, and come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
or of that, <hi>I was an Hungry, and ye gave me no
meat, I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. And
if theſe whiſperings, as I may ſay, be ſo terrible, how
terrible and inſupportable will the pronouncing of this
<hi>Sentence</hi> be; <hi>Ite maledicti, Go,</hi> or <hi>Depart</hi> from me <hi>ye
curſed into everlaſting fire?</hi> words which breath nothing but
fire, and brimſtone, ſtings, and horrors.</p>
            <p>Neither is this all, for 'tis ſaid, <hi>out of his mouth went

thought themſelves, <hi>terrible</hi> it will be to the Bad, becauſe
they know themſelves guilty, and <hi>terrible</hi> to the Good
too, ſince they know they cannot ſtand in judgment
without God's Grace, cannot by any ſtrength of their
own eſcape. Thus while the Parent corrects a refractory
Child, the more ingenuous, and obedient fear, and tremble,
becauſe they think they may commit the ſame fault for
which the other is beaten: As the wicked ſhall be ſure to
be condemned, that are on the left hand; ſo the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſhall hardly be ſaved, that are on the right hand.</p>
            <p>'Tis added by Saint <hi>John</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>this
Judge,</hi> That his <hi>Countenance</hi> was as the <hi>Sun</hi> in his
ſtrength, or in its <hi>Zenith.</hi> If the righteous ſhall ſhine as
the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Kingdom of their Father, as they ſhall,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 43. how much more bright ſhall <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhine,
who will appear in the ſtrength of his <hi>own</hi> glory? Chriſt
was a <hi>Sun</hi> on Earth, who roſe, as I may ſay, at his
<hi>Nativity,</hi> and ſet or went down at his <hi>Death.</hi> But alas,
how few minded that Day of his, becauſe that Sun was
obſcur'd with the Cloud of his Humanity, much more
by the darkneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> obſtinate blindneſs. He
<hi>roſe</hi> again at his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> beginning, as it were, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day; was in the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> when he Aſcended; at
the Day of <hi>Judgment</hi> he will be in the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and
will never ſet again unleſs it be to the <hi>wicked,</hi> from
whom he will for <hi>ever</hi> obſcure himſelf, not vouchſafing
them the leaſt ray of the light of his Countenance to all
Eternity.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhew'd you in what reſpects the Day of
the Lord may ſtil'd, <hi>Dies Magnus,</hi> the Great Day, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45550:12"/>
in what reſpects the <hi>Dreadful Day.</hi> As in reſpect of the
Judges dreadful coming to judgment mounted on the
Clouds; in reſpect of his being well known to all to be
the ſame as was judg'd, and unjuſtly condemn'd; in reſpect
of his Authority, rigour, and ſtrict juſtice that he will
execute, in reſpect of his piercing eye, his inexorableneſs;
his dreadful denouncing of Sentence; and in reſpect of his
brightneſs, every Ray of which will be as a Dagger to ſtab
the Reprobates at the very heart.</p>
            <p>I come now (according to my promiſe) to ſpeak joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of theſe two Epithites by way of Application to our
ſelves of what hath been already ſaid.</p>
            <p>1. Then is there a day, that the Lord hath appointed
to judge the world in? Then let us take Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Counſel which he gives to his <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Let us
judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs,
and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 5. Let no man anticipate this Judge, take his office
out of his hand by judging his brethren. Exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is requiſite in a Judge, the eyes of Man are too
dim to judge of the Actions of others, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee into the heart, their root, or fountain, for God
alone is the ſearcher of the Heart. Hence it is that
holy men in this life are oft judg'd to be Hypocrites,
when as on the contrary, the gliſtring Glow-worm of
morality in this dark night of the world goes under the
the notion of holineſs, and integrity. Thus the righteous
are condemn'd, and the wicked uſtified by thoſe who
judge after the light of their eyes, according to appearance,
and not righteous judgment.</p>
            <p>2. Is this day coming? The thought of this ſhould take
off the wheels of their Chariots, make them drive hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45550:13"/>
who walk not only, but run in the way of their
hearts, and in the ſight of their eyes, thoſe windows of
wickedneſs, and loop-holes of luſt. Know this whoſoever
thou art thac takeſt thy ſwing in ſinful courſes, that God
will bring the to judgment, either in this life as he did
<hi>Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phineas, Nadah,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> or infallibly
at thy Death's day, which is thy <hi>Dooms-day,</hi> then God
will bring thee <hi>per</hi> force be thou never ſo loath to come
to it, he will hale thee to his Tribunal be it never ſo much
againſt the heart, and againſt the hair of thee.</p>
            <p>To contract, will this Day of the Lord which is coming,
be a great and terrible or dreadful day in ſo many reſpects
as you have heard? Then as you tender the ſafety of your
immortal Souls in <hi>that Day,</hi> ſoak them before in the
conſideration of it; and to this end ſuffer me to furniſh
you with a few Meditations, which may conduce to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſetting home of what hath been already ſaid on this
ſubject As Almighty God hath ſhar'd his Pow'r in the
creating of things, his Wiſdom in the Government of
them, his Mercy in the Reſtauration of faln man; ſo he
hath reſerved his juſtice in puniſhing of wicked to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
eminently on <hi>this Day.</hi> 'Tis true, the wicked meet
often with ſome of Gods vengeance here in this life; but
that is only as the heat-drops to the ſwinging ſhower of
Gods wrath, and indignation, which on <hi>this day</hi> will
take hold upon them; 'tis but the brief Preface to the
huge Volume of miſery that then will attain them. For
if he made ſuch variety of things to ſhew his power, ſo
wonderfully hath qualified them as he hath done to ſhew his
wiſdom: If he hath done, and ſuffer'd ſo much as he hath
done that he might manifeſt his mercy to all, what think
you will he do when he ſets himſelf about it, makes it his
buſineſs to manifeſt the greatneſs of his juſtice? Or if you
will thus, to make <hi>this day</hi> appear ſomewhat more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45550:13"/>
yet; If when he intended to ſhew the greatneſs of his
mercy, He the Son of God would be born in a Stable, lye
in a Manger, converſe with ſinners here in the world, and
at length for wretched ſinners be apprehended, bound,
ſpit upon, buffeted, crown'd with thorns, ridiculouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray'd,
bear his Maſſy Croſs on his own ſhoulders, and at
laſt on it be Crucified between two Malefactors; if, I ſay,
the Son of God deigned to undergo ſuch things to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Heaven, and Earth, Men, and Angels, and
this to declare the greatneſs of his Goodneſs, and Mercy:
Then conceive, if you can, what he will do when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
fully to declare the greatneſs of his Juſtice, kept with
much long-ſuffering and patience till this <hi>Great Day.</hi> If
you would have this farther illuſtrated, then thus: Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> in his relation of the manner of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
tells us, in the 9. Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that after he was
diſmounted he heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why
perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> and he ſaid, who art thou Lord? and
the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt; and he
trembling, and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord what wilt thou have
me to do? To apply this to our purpoſe, If the Apoſtle
was ſtruck with ſuch trembling, and aſtoniſhment, when
he did but come to the knowledge that it was <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom
he perſecuted, crying out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have
to do?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, behold I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to believe, ready to obey, ready to dye for thee,
ready to ſuffer any thing at thy hand for what I have
ignorantly done: Oh what fear, what trembling, what
amazement, what horror, will take hold of the wicked,
when they ſhall ſee Chriſt coming in ſuch Glory, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and Power, whom they for them embracing of moſt
vile things have neglected, contemned, and deſpis'd, to
ſpeak the beſt of it; whoſe Miniſters they have ſcoft at and
abuſed, whoſe menaces, and threats they have vilified,
whoſe precious Pearls of Promiſes, and wholſome Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45550:14"/>
they like Swine have trampled on, whoſe Livery
they have worn, but have ſerv'd themſelves. Neither is it
to be paſt by without wonder, that ſo much trembling,
and aſtoniſhment ſhould ſurprize Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> for what
dreadfulneſs could there be in that voice that courteouſly
call'd him (ſo vile a perſon) by his name; brought life to
him that perſecuted the Lord of life, and Glory; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Salvation to one that breath'd forth nothing but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and hatred; kindly received ſo cruel an Enemy? And
yet being not able to bear up under the weight of this
voice from Heaven, nor to endure that beam or glympſe of
the Divine Majeſty; 'tis ſaid, <hi>he fell on the Earth</hi> as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of life and ſpirit: What then will their Torment,
and Deſtraction, be whom the ſame Majeſty of God ſhall
entertain not with ſmiles, but frowns, not with life, but
death and deſtruction; not with any token of love, but
with a drawn ſword, and all manner of cruelty? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
they that cannot endure him calling them to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
will not be able to endure him coming to take
<hi>Vengeance;</hi> they that cannot bear the guilt of their ſins,
will never endure to look the Avenger of ſin in the face.

               </gap>nners at this <hi>Great and Dreadful day</hi> will be
forc'd to call upon the Mountains to fall upon them, and
the Hills to hide them from the preſence of him that ſhall
ſit as Judge on his Throne. I ſhall ſhut up my diſcourſe
with this ſtory: When <hi>Sapores</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> rais'd a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſecution againſt the Chriſtians; one <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſthazanes</hi> an
old Nobleman, a Courtier, that had <hi>Sapores</hi> Government
in his Minority, being a Chriſtian, was ſo terrified, that he
left off his Profeſſion: but he ſitting at the Court-gate when
<hi>Simeon</hi> an aged Biſhop frown'd upon him, and turn'd away
his face with indignation, as being loth to look upon a
man that had deny'd the Faith; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſthazanes</hi> fell a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſaith my Author, went into his chamber, put off his
Courtly attire, and brake out into theſe words, <hi>Ah! how
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45550:14"/>
ſhall I appear before the Great God of Heaven, whom I have
deny'd, when</hi> Simeon <hi>but a man will not look on me? if he
frown, how will God look upon me, when I come before his
Tribunal?</hi> The thought of Gods Judgment Seat wrought
ſo ſtrongly upon him, that he recover'd his ſpiritual ſtrength,
and dyed a Glorious Martyr. Thus did but men conſider,
that they muſt one day ſtand before the Bar of Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
they would be caſting up how things ſtand betwixt
him and their own Souls: would any man loyter away
the day when he knows he muſt ſhew his work to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
at night? Let every man in all his doings remember
his end, and ſo he ſhall never do amiſs; remember that
all muſt come to a reckoning in this <hi>Great and Dreadful
day,</hi> and that though here in this world men may wear
Vizard Masks of Hypocriſie, yet when they conſider
they ſhall be pluckt off in that day, it will be a means
that they will order their lives ſo that their appearance
may be with comfort.</p>
            <p>I have done with my Text, and it may now be expected
that I ſhould ſpeak ſomewhat of the occaſion. For you
are to know we at preſent ſolemnize no leſs then the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of <hi>the Metropolis</hi> of this Nation. But if you look
that I (though preſent when it was on Fire, and a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Sufferer
with many of you) ſhould preſent you with a
<hi>Hypotypoſis</hi> or Deſcription of that moſt lamentable and
devouring Fire, as it is deſervedly ſtil'd; you muſt excuſe
me if I fruſtrate your expectation; that I conceive is more
lively to be depainted by a Penſil, then a Pen, and better
expreſt on a Table or Draught then by the Tongue, only thus
much I ſhall ſpeak: As it is ſaid concerning the roll of a
Book given to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that it was written within and
without, and there was written therein Lamentation and
Mourning, and Woe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. So in every circumſtance
that accompanied this diſmal Conflagration, <hi>Judgment</hi>
was writ as in Text Letters, whether we conſider <hi>the Time</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45550:15"/>
when it firſt broke forth, the dead of night; or <hi>the
Place,</hi> a cloſe narrow Lane, where many Houſes were
burn'd down before any Engines could come to play in
order to the extinguiſhing of it; or <hi>Manner</hi> of it, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the wind ſo fiercely, that is ſpared no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
in its way though never ſo auguſt and ſtately:
Churches now prov'd no Sanctuaries as in the time of other
Fires: I may adde, it was an amazing Judgment, which
deluded People, and deprived them of the uſe of their
reaſon. I believe there are ſome here preſent, who with
my ſelf, did not think that ever the Adverſary and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that <hi>Dreadful Fire</hi> would have entred into our
Streets, the place where it began being ſo far diſtant
from our Habitations: And ſo you'l ſay this Fire well
deſerves both the Epithetes in my Text, <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
as if Almighty God had ſpoke to <hi>London in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
expreſly under the name or notion of a <hi>Forreſt,</hi> as
once he did to <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezek. 20</hi> 47. Behold, I will
kindle a Fire in thee, and it ſhall devour every green
Tree in thee, and every dry Tree in thee, the flaming
flame ſhall not be quenched, &amp;c. And all fleſh ſhall ſee
that I the Lord have kindled it, and it ſhall not be
quenched: I the Lord who am a conſuming Fire. 'Twas
brought to paſs then, <hi>Deo irato, &amp; irritato,</hi> God being not
only angry, but provok'd. It was not long before this
Fire hapned that God viſited <hi>this City</hi> with the Plague of
Peſtilence, which walkt in as <hi>much ſtate</hi> along the Streets
as ever the <hi>chief Magiſtrate</hi> of it did; its retinue wore a
kind of Purple to the fatal ſpots being of that colour.
O the high ſilence that I was witneſs of (to Gods Glory
be it ſpoke) in many places of the City, at other times
clamorous and tumultuous enough! Had it been askt
where dwells ſuch a one, the anſwer would have been,
<hi>he is dead;</hi> where his Wife? <hi>dead;</hi> where his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
<hi>dead;</hi> where his Man; his Maid? <hi>dead.</hi> Pale
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45550:15"/>
Death ſate in the Windows, kept Shop, ſeal'd up Doors, ſo
that none durſt enter. But <hi>London</hi> ſoon forgat this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy;
her filthineſs was in her skirts, ſhe remembred not
her laſt end, or rather how near to her end (in ſome ſenſe)
ſhe was brought: God had no ſooner turn'd her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
into <hi>joy;</hi> her ſighing into <hi>ſinging;</hi> her mourning into
<hi>melody;</hi> her prayers into <hi>praiſes;</hi> her Tears into <hi>Triumphs,</hi>
but they, nay, we made a bad uſe of his mercy, till a
Flood of Fire brake in upon us, as a Deluge of Water
did on the old World. Hence it was that ſhe came down
wonderfully, to uſe that expreſſion in the Lamentation of
<hi>Jeremy,</hi> concerning <hi>Jeruſalem. Londons</hi> incogitancy and
and inconſiderateneſs, together with the licentious lewdneſs
following thereupon, not to ſpare the place of my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
brought her down with a vengeance to ſit in
Aſhes, as <hi>Job's</hi> calamities brought him to the Dunghil.
You may ſuppoſe her then as a diſconſolate Matron uſing
theſe words; Is it nothing to you all ye that paſs by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and ſee if there be any deſolation like unto my
deſolation, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord
hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce, or fiery anger:
He hath ſent Fire among my buildings, and it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
againſt me, he hath made me deſolate. Is it in
the wiſhes of you the Inhabitants of this place, whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
are yet ſtanding, that they ſhould not partake
of <hi>Londons</hi> puniſhment? would you that your <hi>Bethel</hi> (in
which through God<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s goodneſs ye are aſſembled at this
time) ſhould never be turn'd into <hi>Bethaven?</hi> would you
not have <hi>Iccobod</hi> written upon all that you can call Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Glorious? then ſee you decline ſuch ſins as are
mentioned in the ſpecifick Prayer for this occaſion. Neither
are we to forget that in the midſt of judgment God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
mercy: not only in not conſuming the whole
Suburbs that were contiguous, but in ſparing ſome of the
City, and in bleſſing the endeavours of the Re-builders
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45550:16"/>
of it even to a miracle: The little time I have been in it,
I have ſeen enough to be thankful for while I live: As if
when in its rubbiſh it had been ſolemnly buried by ſome
of her Miniſters in ſeveral places of it, ſaying, ſince it hath
pleas'd Almighty God in his righteouſneſs to take away
from us our dear Habitations in which we ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
we commit them to the ground, Earth to Earth,
Aſhes to Aſhes, Rubbiſh to Rubbiſh, in ſure and certain
hope to ſee them to have ſuch a Glorious Reſurrection
(like a <hi>Phoenix</hi> out of its Aſhes) as ſhall create wonder in
all that ſhall behold it, and this through his Almighty
Power who is able to ſubdue not perſons only, but all
things to himſelf, even the vaſteſt Structures, and can with
as much eaſe give them a being again. Or as if the whole
Body of her Inhabitants, to the credit of us their Teachers,
had ſaid, ſeeing the Fire approaching their Habitations,
well, Gods will be done, we brought nothing into this
world, neither ſhall we carry any thing out of it, the Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name
of the Lord. Nay, we know that if theſe earthly Houſes of
ours, theſe Candle-Rents, old Timber Buildings be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
be conſum'd by Fire, we ſhall have buildings run
up ſo ſtrongly, and ſo ſuddenly, as if they had been made
without hands; nay, we ſhall have buildings of Gods own
making, for except the Lord build the houſe, they labour
in vain that build it. There is no good to be done unleſs
God ſet his <hi>Fiat</hi> to it, and ſay <hi>let it be done.</hi> If he blaſt
and not bleſs mens endeavours and policies, they are all
but <hi>Arena ſine Calce,</hi> ſand without lime, they will not hang
together, but like untemper'd Mortar fall aſunder. The
<hi>Jews</hi> at this day when they build a houſe, they are, ſay the
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> to leave one part of it unfurniſht, and lying rude,
in remembrance that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deſolate; at leaſt they uſe to leave about a yard ſquare
of the houſe unplaiſtred, on which they write in great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45550:16"/>
letters that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, If I forget thee ô</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>let
my right hand forget its cunning.</hi> I know not whether any
of you that are Building or have Built your Houſes, will
be willing to leave a yard ſquare of them unplaiſtred to
write in it in great letters, <hi>If I forget thee O London,</hi> &amp;c.
this may be thought too great a blemiſh in your fair
beautiful Buildings; but as ever you would have the Bricks
laid in order to continue long ſo, and not to be burnt again,
but to crumble away between the teeth of Time; let old
<hi>London</hi> dreadfully conſum'd by Fire have a room in your
minds and memories, not forgetting the mercy God
ſhew'd in the midſt of that dreadful judgment.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Let thoſe of us that have been large ſharers
in this judgment, who are Chriſtians not by Water only
but by Fire, heartily bee of God that we may come forth
of the Crucible of Affliction, as Gold doth out of the fire
<hi>refin'd,</hi> that we may loſe the droſs only of our ſins, not
the gold of our patience, and holy ſubmiſſion to his will,
and other graces. And you whoſe Habitations are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monuments of Gods Goodneſs, be ſure at leaſt that
you thus warble it on this ſolemn day, ſo often as it ſhall
come about; If it had not been the Lord who was on our
ſide, we may well ſay, if it had not been the Lord who was
on our ſide when the Fire brake out moſt furiouſly upon us,
then the Flames had conſumed our Habitations, when the
Fire of Gods wrath was kindled againſt us; but bleſſed be
the Lord who hath not given our Habitations up to ruine,
but hath mercifully pluckt them as ſo many brands out of
the fire. Beloved, God hath many ways to make deſolate,
he can effect it by Fire, or Sword, or Peſtilence, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and there is but one ſafe way to avoid thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings
of his judgment, and in the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s
language is to take away the fore-skins of your heart,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4. That place of Scripture is well worthy my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it, and your diligent attention to it, it runs thus;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45550:17"/>
               <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves unto the Lord, and take away the
fore-skins of your hearts ye Men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi>
Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my fury come forth like fire, and burn that
none can quench it.</hi> Begin at <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, heartily bewail
that, and then ſet upon your beloved ſin; out with that
Eye, off with that Hand, caſt away all your Tranſgreſſions,
with as great indignation as angry <hi>Ziporah</hi> did her childs
fore-skin; ſo will the Lord lengthen out your Tranquility,
neither ſhall your iniquities be your ruine.</p>
