            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if my conſcience and
my tongue have ever kept
one tune, how is it that I heare my ſelfe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
If any thing I have ſaid or done be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant,

Whilſt they are floating, I ſtand ſteady, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

            <p>The queſtion is, whether ever I profeſſed

of our Parliament-preſſing Miniſters, after I
had delivered my ſence upon Epiſcopacy in the

my conſcience was not ſo good as in the beginning of
the Parliament.</hi> Yet I may (and doe) challenge
him, or any man, to inſtance where, when, and
what I have ſaid to deſerve this opinion of
change.</p>
            <p>I preſſe not this, as fondly glorying in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy.
No, I profeſſe my ſelfe ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
at any time to imbrace a corrected under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
let any of them (who hath temper,
diſcretion and charity) come and try me. I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123666:4"/>
have no end, no ayme to lead me, but faire
truth, I have no byas but a conſcience warmed
with zeale, and therefore when I change, (if I
change) it ſhall be the conqueſt and victory of
truth upon me. And I then ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of being wonne, but will glory in the
change.</p>
            <p>But I delivered in the Bill for abolition of
Epiſcopacy.<note place="margin">S A. H.</note> True, my friend (then next me)
urged me with importunacy that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and plainly ſaid it ſhould goe in how
ever: and ſo (I am aſſured) it had, but not
with ſo faint commendations as I beſtowed on
it, which (I dare ſay) gave no weight unto the
worke. The Bill was then leſſe then two ſheets
of Paper, and by ſubjoyning two more might
have given us the old originall Epiſcopacy,
even with the ſame hand that abrogated the
preſent. Beſide, the chiefe end then was to
expedite the progreſſe of another Bill againſt
the ſecular juriſdiction of the Biſhops (at that
very time) labouring in the Houſe of Lords.
So that this Bill did in my ſence <hi>iniquum Petere,
ut aequum ferret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Little did I (or any man there) imagine,
that thoſe two ſheetes ſhould be multiplied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123666:5"/>
with addition of above forty more, and yet
unfiniſhed.</p>
            <p>The onely colour, or rather ſhadow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſome thought me as fierce for <hi>ruine</hi> as
themſelves, was my fortune or misfortune, to
ſtrike firſt, (and ſhortly after, ſecondly) at the
talleſt Cedar on the Churches <hi>Lebanon.</hi> Tis true
I did ſo, and am nothing ſorry for the blow.
His crimes were many: the complaints were
freſh with me, and my ſelfe (entruſted by that
County where his Dioceſe is ſeated) as fit as
any to ſtrike that ſtroke.</p>
            <p>This was at that time received and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as an act of juſtice, but by the ſame men of
late traduced, as reliſhing of perſonall malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<hi>Non ſic didici Chriſtum.</hi> I thanke God, my
heart hath never yet knowne the ſwelling of a
perſonall malice. And for the Biſhop, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
I did (and doe) beare a good degree of
perſonall love unto him, a love unto ſome
parts and qualities, which I thinke him
maſter of.</p>
            <p>His intent of publike uniformity was a
good purpoſe, though in the way of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
there of he was extreamely faulty.</p>
            <p>His booke lately ſet forth (eſpecially for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123666:5"/>
the latter halfe thereof) hath muzled the
Jeſuite, and ſhall ſtrike the Papiſts under the
fifth ribbe when he is dead and gone. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, whereſoever his grave ſhall be, <hi>Paul's</hi>
will be his perpetuall <hi>monument,</hi> and his owne
booke his laſting <hi>Epitaph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the roughneſſe of his uncourtly
nature ſent moſt men diſcontented from him:
yet would he often (of himſelfe) finde waies
and meanes to ſweeten many of them againe,
when they leaſt looked for it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he was alway one and the ſame man,
begin with him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo goe on to
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> he is un-mov'd, unchanged: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
complied with the times, but kept his own
ſtand, untill the times came up to him.</p>
            <p>Hee is not now in a condition to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
nor was I ever ſo low, to uſe it. I did not
accuſe him for theſe. I ſtrucke another ſtring,
and that of ſo right a tune to them that are
ſtung with the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> that I was inſtantly
voyced, more as they would have me, then I
was. For (the truth is) I did not dreame, at
that time of <hi>extirpation</hi> and abolition of any
more then his Archiepiſcopacy: our profeſſed
<hi>rooters</hi> themſelves (many of them) at that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123666:6"/>
houre had I perſwade my ſelfe, more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hopes then ſince are entertained. <hi>A ſevere
reformation</hi> was a ſweet ſong then. I am and
ever was for that, and for no more.</p>

                        <p>The Common-wealth (it is true) is full of
apparent dangers. The ſword is come home

                        <p>Theſe (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> and many other doe
deſerve and muſt ſhortly have our deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
but <hi>Suo gradu,</hi> not in the firſt place:
There is a <hi>unum neceſſarium</hi> above all our
worldly ſufferances and dangers, Religion,
the immediate ſervice due unto the honour
of Almighty God. And herein let us all be
confident, that all our conſultations will
prove unproſperous, if we put any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
before that of Religion.</p>
                        <p>For my part, Let the Sword reach from
the North to the South, and a generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all our remaining right and ſafety,
threaten us in open view, it ſhall be ſo farre
from making me to decline the firſt ſetling
of Religion, that I ſhall ever argue, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conclude it thus. The more great, the
more imminent our perils of this world are,
the ſtronger and quicker ought our care to
be for the glory of God and the pure Law
of our ſoules.</p>

                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:123666:7"/>
If then (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> it may paſſe with full
allowance, that all our cares may give way
unto the treaty of Religion, I will reduce
that alſo to be conſidered under two heads:
firſt of Eccleſiaſticke perſons, then of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticke
cauſes. Let no man ſtart or be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
at the imagined length of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
it will not, it cannot take up ſo
much time as it is worth.—This, it is God

nay, this, is God and the two Kingdomes
cauſe.</p>
                        <p>And therefore (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> my humble
motion is, that we may all of us ſeriouſly,
ſpeedily, and heartily enter upon this, the
beſt, the greateſt, the moſt important cauſe
we can treat of.</p>
                        <p>Now (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> in purſuit of my own
motion, and to make a little enterance into
this great affaire, I will preſent unto you the
petition of a poore oppreſſed Miniſter in
the County of <hi>Kent:</hi> A man Orthodox in
his doctrine, conformable in his life, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the Miniſtery as any we have, or I
doe know.</p>
                        <p>He is now a ſufferer (as all good men are)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123666:8"/>
under the generall obloquy of a Puritan; (as
with other things was excellently delivered
by that ſilver trumpet at the Barre.)<note place="margin">Sir Ben. Rudyer.</note> The
Purſivant watches his doore, and divides him
and his Cure aſunder, to both their griefes:
For it is not with him as (perhaps) with ſome
that ſet the Purſivant at worke, gladded of
an excuſe to be out of their pulpit, It is his
delight to Preach.</p>
                        <p>About a week ſince I went over to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
to move that great Biſhop (too great
indeed) to take this danger off from this
Miniſter, and to recall the Purſivant. And
withall I did undertake for Maſter <hi>Wilſon</hi>
(for ſo your Petitioner is called) that he
ſhould anſwer his accuſers in any of the Kings
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Biſhop made me anſwer (as neere as
I can remember) <hi>in haec verba,</hi> I am ſure that
he wil not be abſent from his Cure a twelve-moneth
together, and then (I doubt not) but
once in a yeere we ſhall have him.</p>
                        <p>This was all I could obtaine, but I hope,
(by the help of this houſe) before this yeere
of threats run round, <hi>His Grace</hi> will either
have more <hi>Grace,</hi> or no <hi>Grace</hi> at all. For our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123666:8"/>
manifold griefes doe fill a mighty and a vaſt
circumference, yet ſo that from every part
our lines of ſorrow, doe lead unto him, and
point at him the Center, from whence our
miſeries in this Church, and many of them in
the Common-wealth do flow.</p>
                        <closer>Let the Petition be read, and let us enter
upon the worke.</closer>

                        <p>YOu have many private Petitions, give
me leave (by word of mouth) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
one more generall, which thus you
may receive.</p>
                        <p>Gods true Religion is violently invaded
by two ſeeming enemies: but indeed they
are (like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate)</hi> faſt friends for
the deſtruction of truth. I meane the Papiſts
for one party, and our Prelating faction for
the other. Betweene theſe two in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
progreſſe, I obſerve the concurrence of
ſome few Parallels, fit (as I conceive) to be
repreſented to this Honourable Houſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt with the Papiſts, there is a ſevere <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition:</hi>
and with us (as it is uſed) there is
a bitter high <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> both theſe <hi>(contra
fas &amp; jus)</hi> are Judges in their own cauſe: yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123666:9"/>
herein their <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> are better then our
<hi>High Commiſſioners</hi>—They (for ought I ever
heard) do not <hi>ſaevire in ſuos)</hi> puniſh for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
and offenders, ſuch as profeſſe and
practice, according to the Religion eſtabliſhed
by the Lawes of the Land where they live.</p>
                        <p>But with us how many poore diſtreſſed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters?
nay how many ſcores of them, in a few
yeeres paſt, have been ſuſpended, degraded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived,
excommunicated, not guilty of the
breach of any our eſtabliſhed Lawes. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of many are here with us, more are
comming: all their prayers are in Heaven for
redreſſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, with the Papiſts, there is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
artifice, I mean their <hi>Index expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
whereby they clip the tongues of ſuch
witneſſes, whoſe evidence they do not like.—
To this I parallell our late <hi>Imprimatur's:</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
for the Preſſe: ſo handled that Truth
is ſuppreſt, and popiſh pamphlets fly abroad
<hi>cum privilegio:</hi> witneſſe the audacious and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
Pamphlets againſt true Religion, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Pocklington, Heylin, Dow, Coſins, Shelford,
Swan, Reeves, Yates, Hauſted, Studley, Sparow,
Brown, Roberts.</hi>—Many more: I name no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
but I adde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:123666:10"/>
Nay they are already grown ſo bold in this
new trade, that the moſt learned labours of
our ancient and beſt Divines, muſt be now
corrected and defaced with a <hi>Deleatur</hi> by the
ſupercilious pen of my Lords yong Chaplain;
(fit perhaps) for the technicall arts, but unfit
to hold the Chaire for Divinity.</p>
                        <p>But herein the <hi>Roman Index</hi> is better then
are our <hi>Engliſh Licences:</hi> They thereby do
preſerve the current of their own eſtabliſhed
doctrine: a point of wiſdome. But with us our
<hi>Innovators</hi> by this artifice do alter our ſetled
Doctrines; Nay they do ſubinduce points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
and contrariant. And this I dare
aſſume upon my ſelfe to prove.</p>
                        <p>One Parallel more I have, and that is this.
Among the Papiſts, there is one acknowledged
ſupreme Pope, ſupreme in honour, in order,
and in power: from whoſe judgement there
is no appeale.—I confeſſe (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
altogether match a Pope with a Pope:
(yet one of the ancient titles of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Primate was <hi>Alterius orbis Papa.)</hi> But thus far I
can go, <hi>Ex ore ſuo.</hi> It is in Print,—He pleads
faire for a Patriarchate: And for ſuch an one,
whoſe judgement, he (before-hand) profeſſeth
ought to be finall: and then (I am ſure) it
ought to be un-erring.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:123666:10"/>
Put theſe together, and you ſhall find that
the finall determination of a Patriarch will
want very little of a Pope,—and then we
may ſay
<q>
                              <l>—Mutato nomine de te</l>
                              <l>Fabula narratur—</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>He pleads Popeſhip under the name of a
Patriarch. And I much feare leaſt the end and
top of his Patriarchall plea may be as that of
<hi>Cardinall Pole</hi> (his predeceſſor) who would
have two heads, one <hi>Caput Regale,</hi> another <hi>Caput
Sacerdotale:</hi> a proud parallell, to ſet up the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as high as the Crown.</p>
                        <p>But herein I ſhall be free and cleare, if one
there muſt be (be it a Pope, be it a Patriarch;
this I reſolve upon for my owne choyce <hi>(Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul
a Iove procul a fulnime.)</hi> I had rather ſerve
one as far off as <hi>Tyber,</hi> then to have him come
ſo neere me as the <hi>Thames.</hi> A Pope at <hi>Rome</hi>
will do me leſſe hurt then a Patriarch may do
at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have done, and for this third Parallel I
ſubmit it to the wiſdome and conſideration
of this grand Committee for Religion, in the
mean time I do ground my motion, upon the
former two, and it is this in brief.</p>
                        <p>That you would pleaſe to ſelect a ſubcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123666:11"/>
of a few, and to impower them for the
diſcovery of the numbers of oppreſſe Miniſters
under the Biſhops tyranny for theſe ten yeers
laſt paſt. We have the complaint of ſome,
but more are ſilent: ſome are patient and
will not complaine, others are fearefull and
dare not, many are beyond Sea and cannot
complaine.</p>
                        <p>And in the ſecond place, that the ſub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
may examine the Printers what books
by bad Licences have been corruptly iſſued
forth: and what good books have been (like
good Miniſters) ſilenced, clipped or cropped.</p>
                        <p>The worke I conceive will not be difficult,
but will quickly returne into your hand full of
weight.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt humbly ſhewing, That by ſad experience
we doe daily finde the government in the
Church of England, by Archbiſhops, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Deanes, &amp; Archdeacons, with their Courts,
Juriſdictions, and Adminiſtrations, by them and their
inferiour Officers, to be very dangerous, both to
Church and Common-wealth, and to be the occaſion of
manifold grievances unto his Majeſties Subjects, in
their conſciences, liberties, and eſtates, And likely to be
fatall unto us in the continuance thereof. The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
effects of which <hi>Lordly</hi> power in them, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in theſe particulars following</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They doe with a hard hand over-rule all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123666:13"/>
other Miniſters, ſubjecting them to their cruell
authority.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They do ſuſpend, puniſh, and deprive many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
religious, and painfull Miniſters, upon ſlight and
upon no grounds: whilſt in the mean time, few of them
doe preach the Word of God themſelves, and that but
ſeldome. But they doe reſtraine the painfull preaching
of others, both for Lectures, and for afternoon Sermons
on the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They do countenance and have of late encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Papiſts, Prieſts, and Arminian both Bookes and
perſons.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They hinder good and godly books to be printed:
yet they do licence to be publiſhed, many popiſh, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,
and other dangerous tenents.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. They have deformed our Churches, with popiſh
pictures, and ſuited them with Romiſh Altars.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. They have of late extolled and commended much
the Church of Rome, denying the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
affirming the Church of Rome to be a true
Church in fundamentals.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. They have practiſed and inforced antiquated
and obſolete ceremonies, as ſtanding at the Hymnes at
<hi>Gloria patri,</hi> and turning to the Eaſt at ſeverall
parts of the Divine Service, bowing to the Altar,
which they tearm the place of Gods reſidence upon
earth: the reading of a ſecond ſervice at the Altar,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123666:14"/>
and denying the holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt to
ſuch as have not come up to a new ſet Rayle before the
Altar.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. They have made and contrived illegall Canons
and Conſtitutions, and framed a moſt pernitious and
deſperate oath: an oath of covenant and confederacy
for their owne Hierarchicall greatneſſe beſide many
other dangerous and pernicious paſſages in the ſaid
Canons.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. They doe diſpence with plurality of Benefices:
they do both prohibite and grant marriages, neither of
them by the rule of Law or conſcience, but do prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
that they may grant, and grant that they may have
money.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. They have procured a licencious liberty for
the Lords day, but have preſſed the ſtrict obſervation
of Saints holidaies, and do puniſh, ſuſpend, degrade,
deprive godly Miniſters for not publiſhing a Book for
liberty of ſports on the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. They doe generally abuſe the great ordinance
of excommunication, making ſometimes a gaine of it,
to the great diſcomfort of many poore ſoules, who for
want of money can get no abſolution.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. They claime their Office and juriſdiction to be
<hi>jure divino,</hi> and do exerciſe the ſame (contrary to law)
in their own names, and under their own Seales.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. They receive and take upon them temporall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123666:14"/>
dignities, places, and offices in the Comonwealth,
as if it were lawfull for them to uſe both Swords.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. They take cogniſance in their Courts and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
of matters determinable at the Common law.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. They put Miniſters upon Pariſhes, without the
patron, and without the peoples conſent.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. They do yeerly impoſe oaths upon Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
to the moſt apparent danger of filling the Land
with perjury.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. They do exerciſe oathes <hi>ex officio</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an <hi>Inquiſition</hi> even into the thoughts of men.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. They have apprehended men by Purſivants,
without citation or miſſives firſt ſent: they break up
mens houſes and ſtudies taking away what they pleaſe.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. They do awe the Iudges of the Land with their
greatneſſe, to the inhibiting of prohibitions, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of <hi>habeas Corpus</hi> when it is due.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. They are ſtrongly ſuſpected to be confederate
with the Roman party in this Land, and with them to
be authors, contrivers or conſenters to the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
in the North, &amp; the rather becauſe of a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
by the Clergy, and by the Papiſts in the laſt yeer,
1639. and becauſe of an ill named benevolence of ſix
Subſidies granted or intended to be granted this preſent
yeare 1640. thereby and with theſe moneys to engage
(as much as in them lay) the two Nations into blood.</p>

                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:123666:15"/>
It is therefore humbly and earneſtly prayed, that
this Hierarchicall power may be totally abrogated, if
the wiſdome of this Honourable Houſe, ſhall find that
it cannot be maintained by Gods Word, and to his
glory.</p>

            <p>Upon occaſion of what I ſaid of the late

of the founders, and of the whole order
of prelacy: And ſurely, if it had been my wiſh,
I would (as others) have ſo expreſt my ſelfe. Here
followes my argument againſt theſe Canons,
and that chiefly aymed againſt the founders of
them: yet nothing of <hi>Root and Branch</hi> therein.</p>

               <p>THat the late Canons are invalidous, it will
eaſily appeare, and that they are ſo ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in the foundation, or rather in the
founders of them, I will aſſume upon my ſelfe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123666:15"/>
to demonſtrate, having firſt intimated my ſenſe
by way of preparative.</p>
               <p>The Pope (as they ſay) hath a triple Crown,
anſwerable thereunto, and to ſupport that, he
pretends to have a threefold Law. The firſt is,
<hi>jus divinum, Epiſcopacy by divine right;</hi> and this
he would have you thinke to be the Coronet
next his head, that which doth circle and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his power. Our Biſhops have (in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
time) entred their plea and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
title to this Crown, <hi>Epiſcopacy by Divine
right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Jus huntanum, Conſtantins</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the gift of indulgent Princes; tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power. This Law belongs to his ſecond,
or his middle Crown; already alſo pleaded for
by our Prelates in print.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Crowns being obtained, he (the
Pope) doth frame and make his third Crowne
himſelfe, and ſets that upmoſt, upon the top—
This Crown alſo hath its Law, and that is <hi>Jus
canonicum,</hi> the Canon law, of more uſe unto his
Popeſhip then both the other—Juſt ſo our
Prelates from the pretended divinity of their
Epiſcopacy, and from the temporall power
granted by our Princes they would now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
a new <hi>Canon Law</hi> upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:123666:16"/>
They have charged their <hi>Canons</hi> at us to the
full, and never fearing that ever they would
recoyle back into a Parliament they have ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a prodigious ungodly oath into them.</p>
               <p>The illegality and invalidity of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
(as I conceive) is eaſily diſcoverable by
one ſhort queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> what do you call the
meeting wherein they were made? give it a
name to know it by: who can frame his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
aright, unleſſe he can firſt tell againſt
what he is to argue? would you confute the
<hi>Convocation?</hi> they were a <hi>holy Synod:</hi> would
you argue againſt the <hi>Synod?</hi> why they were
<hi>Commiſſioners:</hi> would you diſpute the <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi>
they will mingle all powers together, and
anſwer that they were ſome fourth thing, that
we neither know nor imagine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quo teneam nodo mutantem Protea?</hi> unleſſe
they will unriddle themſelves, and owne what
they were, we may proſecute, but hardly with
concludent arguments. Yet I venture.</p>
               <p>I have conferred with ſome of the founders
of theſe new Canons, but I profeſſe clearly,
that I could never yet meet with any one of
that aſſembly, who could (in behalfe of their
meeting) well anſwer me the firſt queſtion in
the Catechiſme, what is your name? Alas, they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123666:16"/>
are parted before they know what they were
when they were together.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the ſeverall anſwers, that I have
received, doth amount to this. They were a
<hi>Convocationall—Synodicall—Aſſembly of Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
indeed a threefold <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a monſter to
our Lawes, a <hi>Cerberus</hi> to our Religion.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange <hi>Commiſſion</hi> wherein no one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
name is to be found. A ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
that lived when the Parliament was
dead: A ſtrange <hi>Holy Synod</hi> where one part
never ſaw, never conferred with the other.—
But indeed what uſe or need of conference, if
that be true of theſe Canons, which I read of
the former ones,<note place="margin">Parker Polit.</note> 
                  <hi>Notum eſt Canones formari Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bethae,
priuſquàm in Synodo ventilentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far preparatory; I proceed to my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
whereby to manifeſt the invalidity of
theſe Canons, not borrowing but avoyding
what hath formerly been inſtanded by others.</p>
               <p>I will neither inveigh upon them as unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> nor infirme them as the
work of a dead <hi>Convocation;</hi> But will take them
in the capacity of their own affected title of a
<hi>Synod.</hi> Such they bragged themſelves to be
whileſt they ſate: ſuch they ſtile themſelves in
the Title-page of theſe (never to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123666:17"/>
Canons—The words are—<hi>Canons treated
upon in Convocation—agreed upon in Synod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This treating in one capacity and agreeing
in another; is a new mould to caſt Canons in,
never uſed before. Canons bred in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
born in a Synod. Thus although we
find not one good father, here are yet two
mothers to one illfavoured child; never known
before, nor imagined but of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom the
Poets cals among other attributes
<q>—Solúmque bimatrem.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I proceed: if their meeting be a Synod, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is ſo by <hi>Donation,</hi> by <hi>Election,</hi> or only by
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Donation</hi> from the King: is this title and
authority, indulged to them by his Majeſty?
Look through all his Highneſſe Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and they are not once ſaluted with the
ambitious title of a <hi>Synod.</hi> Yet in the Canons
they have aſſumed it ſeventeen times, it is their
own pride, their own preſumption.</p>
               <p>The King hath not done it, (pardon me) no
Prince ever did it or can do it; no power Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
Imperiall, or Papall did ever attempt it, to
ordaine that <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Richard, Matthew</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. and I know not who more, being
met and aſſembled upon other ſummons ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123666:17"/>
by a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> be on a ſudden tranſlated from
what they were, into an unthought-of <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Synod,</hi> without voyce or choiſe of any man
to be concerned: this never was done, this
never can be well done.</p>
               <p>As for due election for ſuch meetings, this
indeed is or ought to be of the true <hi>eſſe</hi> to a
Legitimate <hi>Synod.</hi> But due election made up
by voyces is ſo much a ſtranger to this <hi>Synod,</hi>
that their fatherhoods will confeſſe that
they were never truſted to this <hi>Synod,</hi> as a
<hi>Synod</hi> by any, either of the Clergie or of the
Laity.</p>
               <p>Concerning the choiſe of a few of them, and
but a few (about 50. as I gueſſe) choſen to the
Convocation houſe, that choice wil never ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them a lawfull <hi>Synod,</hi> untill they can prove
<hi>metamorphoſis</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>—For the
votes of all their chooſers upon expiration of
the Convocation houſe returned backe home
to every mans boſome from whence they
breathed. So that if you will en-live the ſame
men to be now <hi>Synodall,</hi> who were before but
Convocationall, you muſt renew the old <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean
Tranſmigration,</hi> for they want the
breath and life of an <hi>election.</hi> A new one you
have not, and the old one is not to be had but
by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:123666:18"/>
Beſides I do affirm and ſhall approve, that the
electors to a <hi>Convocation</hi> and to a <hi>Synod</hi> are not
all one. The Clergy only do, and of right one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ought to chooſe unto the Convocation
houſe. The reaſon; we of the Laity (ſo they
will call us) have our Houſe of Commons
where our Truſtees by vertue of our voyces do
ſit at the ſame time. But in the choice unto a
<hi>Synod;</hi> we who muſt be bound by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the <hi>Synod,</hi> ought alſo to be intereſted
in the parties determining. This is clear enough
in reaſon, and will be better oleared preſently.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Synods</hi> I find five ſeverall ſorts, firſt a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or univerſall Synod; ſecondly, Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall;
thirdly, Nationall; fourthly, Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
fiftly, a Dioceſan Synod. I paſſe by the two
firſt and laſt, as not pertinent to this time and
affaire. Concerning Provinciall and Nationall
Synods a word or two; if I know which to call
their late meeting. They run on riddles: and I
want an <hi>Oedipus</hi> at every turn.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> were they forged in one Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
<hi>Nationall,</hi> or in two <hi>Provinciall?</hi> were
they two Provinciall Synods? how then come
their Acts and Canons to be imbodyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
how comes it to paſſe that all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
ſpeak in the ſingular number? The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123666:18"/>
                  <hi>Synod; The holy Synod; The ſacred Synod.</hi> Sacred
will now be hardly granted, unleſſe as the Poet
doth,—<hi>Auri ſacra fames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it then but one? was it a <hi>Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod?</hi>
why the Provinces (we all know) never
did convene, they never met together. Look
on the repreſentative body of the Commons
of this whole Land: every one within the ſame
walls hearing every ones argument, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
mending, altering, and (as occaſion is)
correcting his own judgment, and afterwards
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) joyning in unanimous conſent. And
if the able members of the North beyond
<hi>Trent</hi> were divided from the reſt, there would
be quickly found a want of their worth and
weight, nor could their ſitting at the ſame
time at <hi>Yorke,</hi> make the reſt a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
here, for the whole Kingdome muſt be
repreſented entire.</p>
               <p>But as we have done the Title <hi>Synod,</hi> ſo let
us give them the attribute Nationall, a <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Synod,</hi> and yet ſee how inconſiſtent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validous
they are!</p>
               <p>The very <hi>eſſe</hi> of every Synod doth ſubſiſt in
a double foundation. <hi>Fundamentum materiale</hi>
and <hi>fundamentum formale.</hi>—The due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
of a <hi>Synod</hi> are the interiour qualities
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123666:19"/>
and indowments of the perſons whereof the
<hi>Synod</hi> conſiſteth, not their externall dignities
and promotions. And therefore every man
thus qualified is as capable to be of the <hi>Synod,</hi>
as any <hi>Deane</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of them all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fundamentum formale,</hi> is <hi>Delegatio ab ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia
&amp; debita electio.</hi> A due choice to be made
by all that are or ſhall be concerned in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of the <hi>Synod:</hi> and this truſt of
choyce may fall upon another man, as well and
as ſoon as upon <hi>Dean</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not quarell the want of able parts in
any members of that late doubtfull dangerous
meeting: I grant them the materials of a true
<hi>Synod,</hi> but will inſiſt only upon the ſecond,
want of form, want of due election: which if
they want, the moſt virtuall and moſt obliging
tie, and the moſt binding part is wanting.</p>
               <p>That they had no ſuch election, we need not
go forth to prove; No one man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
can ſay that he gave a voice to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any one <hi>Dean</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon</hi> to ſit for
him in that <hi>Synod,</hi> nor were the Clarks choſen
by all who were to be bound. So then there
remaineth only to be proved this: That ſuch
election of perſons, by all perſons to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Decrees, and Canons, is neceſſary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123666:19"/>
to the conſtituting of a lawfull Synod; which
is all one as to ſay, that the elections to a <hi>Synod</hi>
ought to be, both by the Clergy and the Laity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Speaker,</hi> I will trouble you but with one
reaſon, and a very few inſtances, all briefly.</p>
               <p>The Acts and Canons of every Lawfull Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Councell or Synod, ought to bind the
whole Nation, both Laity and Clergy: But
this cannot be reaſonable and juſt, if the Laity
be excluded both from conſultation and from
choice of conſulters. The reaſon is plain. It is
a ground in nature, and ſo confeſſed upon this
very caſe by D. <hi>Feild,</hi> who hath it out of <hi>Occam
—quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari
debet.</hi> And this is ſo cleare a maxim, that in this
very ſence alſo; for the Laity to be preſent at
Councels, this very <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> is uſed by the
Pope in his own gloſſe upon the Canoniſt
<hi>Gratian. Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari
debet.</hi> Surely our Clergy are much too high, if
herein they would outgo the very Canons of
the Papall Synods, and conclude that which

treat, neither by themſelves nor by proxy.</p>
               <p>Now the benefit of this Law of nature and
of reaſon (as Dr. <hi>Feild</hi> calleth it) we claim.
The preſent <hi>Canons</hi> do concerne us. I may be a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123666:20"/>
Church-warden, my ſonne may be a Maſter of
Art; then muſt I preſent upon their yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
articles, and he muſt ſweare their oath of
Covenant—well, they were never truſted by
us unto a <hi>Synod;</hi> &amp; therefore ought not to tie
us up un-heard, it is againſt <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſecond this Argument by inſtance in
proofe of practice, I ſhall produce a few, and
but a few of many examples and authorities:
the originals I cannot now command, but muſt
be content to name a few extracts, which by
way of tranſcript do walke along with my
<hi>vade mecum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The point that I would eſtabliſh is this, that
in <hi>Synods</hi> and Councels where Lay men are
concerned in the Decrees, there the Laity
may be preſent to conſult, if not alſo to
decide the concluſions. I will but point, I will
not enlarge to the vouching every place <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim;</hi>
Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulke, Goulartius,</hi> are cleare
and poſitive in this point.</p>
               <p>Our Statutes for correcting and gathering
together the former <hi>Canons</hi> into a new body,
do clearely evidence this unto us; in all which
there is an equall proportion mixed, ſixteen
of the Cleargy, and as many of the Laity.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the Hiſtory of <hi>Trent</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:123666:20"/>
in this point, adding this for a reaſon,
that in a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> the univerſall Church
cannot be repreſented, if the Laity be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
So by the rule <hi>a paribus,</hi> The reaſon hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the ſame, a <hi>Nationall Councell</hi> cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a Nation, if but one degree of men, men of
one quality and capacity be only preſent, and
the reſt altogether excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gratian,</hi> the Canoniſt, doth allow the Laity
to be preſent, eſpecially in ſuch Councels as
do treat of faith, and for proofe doth vouch
Pope <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will omit many proofs of many Emperors
being perſonally preſent and preſident in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Councels, by themſelves and ſometimes by
their Vicegerents, as <hi>Marcellinus, Candidianus,
Martianus, &amp;c.</hi> yet even this is argumentative
for us, and a preſervative of our right, for the
Laity to be preſent.</p>
               <p>The Greek Hiſtorians are ſo plentifull, that

               <p>Thus much for humane teſtimony. I have
done with my haſty notes, only I adde this, and
I beſeech you to intend it.</p>
               <p>Whileſt we of the Laity had our power and
voices to chooſe our own Miniſters, and our
own Biſhops, (which was our ancient right,
conſtantly allowed and practiſed in the beſt
Primitive times, whereof the proofs are yet
evident enough) ſo long (I ſay) we might truſt
them in a <hi>Synod,</hi> whom we firſt had truſted to

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123666:21"/>
now, and ſhut us our contrary to the Law
of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> contrary to ancient u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages:
not to admit us to determination, nay
to exclude us from conſultation, and after
all to take from us all aſſent both in choyce
and in refuſall of Paſtors to be ſet over us,
and yet to bind us by decrees ſo made, may
prove (I feare) no leſſe then ſoule-tyranny. I
do not preſſe the deſerved right of our choyce
of Paſtors: but one thing more, lend me pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to adde as a ſupreme <hi>Coronis</hi> to all that I
have ſaid for right of Laity in <hi>Synods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Looke I beſeech you in the firſt <hi>Synod</hi> that
ever was held in the Chriſtian Church, and
that for ſo great and ſingular a cauſe, as never
was occaſion for the like in the world before
or ſince: you have it in the firſt of the <hi>Acts</hi> of
the holy Apoſtles, and it is for the choice of a
new Apoſtle. There were in this <hi>Synod</hi> and of
this <hi>Synod,</hi> the eleven Apoſtles, <hi>Act. 1. 13. With
the brethren of the Lord, verſ. 14.</hi> There were <hi>the

Originall is more, <gap reason="foreign">

by common voyces reckoned with the eleven.
Now who were theſe common voyces? who
were theſe 120. men? Evangeliſts, Biſhops,
Deacons, and Presbyters or Elders, as yet
there was not one in all the world, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were but eleven, perhaps not numbred in
this 120. The Diſciples if you will ſay, that
they were there, yet they were but 70. So
that here is no evaſion: the Laity were preſent,
and not paſſive only, they were active in this
originall, ſo weighty a <hi>Synod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond inſtance in this kind, is out of

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the multitude
kept ſilence.</hi> True, <hi>ergo</hi> what? Therefore they
ſpeak not at all in this Councell? nothing leſſe.
But <hi>ergo</hi> they had ſpoken before: for it is plain
by the word, THEN, <hi>Then all the multitude kept
ſilence.</hi> If they had nothing there to do but to
be alwaies ſilent, this particle of time, <hi>Then,</hi>
might well have been ſpared. This may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be objected, and therefore ought to be
prevented, for the further clearing whereof,
obſerve (I pray) the next <hi>verſ. 13.</hi> where in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:123666:23"/>
like manner, it is ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And after they held their peace,
Ergo</hi> they had ſpoken. And therefore the Fryer
who collected together a body of Councels
<hi>(Peter Crabbe the German)</hi> doth even from this
place infer a conſent of the people ſaying,
<hi>Tacuit omnis multitudo Conſentiens Petro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you would have this more clearely
evidenced beyond all exceptions, I pray take
notice of the reſolution of this Synod, <hi>verſ. 22.
Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders with the
whole Church.</hi> With the whole Church, what is
that? The bleſſed Apoſtles and their fellow-labourers
did not engroſſe, and (as our Church-men
affect to do) uſurp and monopolize the
word Church, as proper only to Church-men.—
No you ſhall finde it even in the <hi>Epigraphe</hi> of
the Canons and Decrees of this true, holy, and
facted <hi>Synod,</hi> that the deſpiſed Laity are in
theſe Canons conjoyned with the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
although Pope and Patriarch, Primate
and Metropolitan, Archbiſhop and Biſhops,
yea even down to Dean and Archdeacon, (I
have heard it) do deſpiſe the thought of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Laity: I do not ſay to deciſion, but
even to Conſultation, nay to the very choyce
of conſulters in Religion: nay lower even ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:123666:23"/>
much as to have a negative power, when a man
of inability, and of ill life is obtruded upon
them; I proceed, for I would not <hi>orare,</hi> but
<hi>probare,</hi> looke <hi>verſ. 23.</hi> They that were preſent
had voyce, they who voyced the <hi>Canons,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the decree, and ſending the decree unto
<hi>Antioch.</hi> The words are thus, <hi>The Apoſtles, and
Elders, and Brethren ſend greeting to the Brethren
which are in Antioch, &amp;c.</hi> Here the <hi>Brethren at
Hieruſalem</hi> are (with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)</hi>
actors in, and authors of the <hi>Canons</hi> in
this Councell agreed. There is no evaſion, no
eluſion to be had, unleſſe you can prove that
all the <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Antioch</hi> to whom theſe
<hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> did write, were only
Clergymen.</p>
               <p>Which if you ſhould affirm, our Clergy will
hardly be pleaſed with you, for they muſt then
be of the <hi>multitude</hi> (not a ſpeciall lot) for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> did deliver this Epiſtle (being
the decree of this Synod) to <hi>the multitude</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
as it is found in the 30 <hi>verſe. And when they had
gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
Epiſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much in way of purſuit for this one
argument, that no Canons can bind the Laity
where we have no voyce of our own, nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:123666:24"/>
choyce of the Clergy perſons who do found
them, nor aſſent in the ſuſception of them after
they are framed. <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus

               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It remaines as a wiſh, that every

complaints crowd in ſo faſt upon us, that the

               <p>The preſent Report which I am to make unto

               <p>Two hardſhips have been put upon him: one

                  </note> it belongs to himſelfe) he
propoundeth foure queſtions to M. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi>
not taken out of the depth of Divinity, but fitly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:123666:25"/>
choſen to diſcover how affections do ſtand to
be novellized by the mutability of the preſent
times.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>The queſtions were theſe.</head>
                  <item>1. Whether hath the Church authority in matters
of faith?</item>
                  <item>2. May the Kings booke of ſports,<hi> (ſo ſome impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               </list>
               <p>The doctrine of the firſt affirmed, will bring a

our faith to humane reſolutions. The

               <p>As ſoon as M. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> heard theſe queſtions,
<hi>Lupum auribus,</hi> he had a Wolfe by the eares. And
becauſe unto theſe captious interrogatories, he
could not make a peremptory anſwer, M. <hi>Fulham</hi>
would not preſent your petitioner to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
for ordination.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee (Mr. <hi>White)</hi> a new way of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
Impoſition of hands is to be ſold, if not
for money, yet to make a ſide, a party, a faction.
They will not confer Orders, but upon ſuch as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:123666:25"/>
will come in and make party with them in their
new practices, as is evident by theſe queſtions.
Take this, in this kind, as a leading caſe, a firſt

               <p>I proceed to his ſecond ſufferance, which was
by the Vice-chancellor of Oxford, for a Sermon
preached in his courſe at S. <hi>Marys</hi> in Oxford.
Short to make, he preached better, then they
were willing to heare: the Sermon fell into the
eares of a captious Auditour. For this Sermon,
he ſtands now ſuſpended by the Vice-chancellor
from all the ſpirituall promotion that he had,
which was only the reading of a Divinity lecture
in <hi>Magdalen</hi>-hall.</p>
               <p>The Committee required the Vice-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
to ſend unto us the Sermon with his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in writing. They were brought, and being
received, they are three in number: great, and
weighty in the accuſation: none at all in proof.
Nay (M. <hi>White)</hi> there is nothing preſented unto
us, wherein to finde a colour or a ſhadow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to make the accuſation ſemblable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ſuſpenſion juſt. <hi>Ecquis innocens erit,
ſi accuſare ſuffecerit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The particulars inſiſted upon, pickt and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123666:26"/>
out of that Sermon by the Vice-chancellor
are three: every one a hainous charge, and the
firſt ſounding little leſſe then treaſon. Give me
leave to read them, as Mr. Vicechancellor hath
ſent them in writing.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Our religious Soveraigne, and his pious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is ſeditiouſly defamed, as if his Majeſty were
little better then the old pagan perſecutors or then
Queen Mary.</item>
                  <item>2. The government of the Church and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity
is unjuſtly traduced.</item>
                  <item>3. Men of learning and piety, conformable to the
publicke government, are uncharitably ſlandered.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The leaſt of theſe being duly proved, will
make him worthy of ſuſpenſion: but if M. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi>
be guilty of the firſt, he is not worthy to
live. The truth is, the Vice-chancellor hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>audacter criminare:</hi> and fayling in proofe;
hath only fowled himſelfe. Your Subcommittee,
upon due conſideration of the cauſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
have hereupon unanimouſly voted, that
M. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is free from all and every of theſe
exceptions, made againſt his Sermon by the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor.
We are all of opinion that there is
nothing therein, that deſerves <hi>Notam cenſoris, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
lituram judicis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If (M. <hi>White)</hi> there be in a Sermon (as there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:123666:26"/>
ought to be) <hi>aliquid mordacis veritatis,</hi> ſhall the
Preacher be for this ſuſpended? His mouth ſhut
up for preaching truth boldly? It is contrary to
their commiſſion, for <hi>(Sir)</hi> they have a great
charter to ſpeak freely: it is warranted unto
them <hi>Jure divino.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth own it, in his
inſtruction of <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> The words are, <hi>I charge
thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, preach the
word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon; reprove,
rebuke, exhort—For the time will come when they
will not endure ſound doctrine.</hi> Here is our caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.
Here was reproofe; here was exhortation:
here was preaching out of ſeaſon, to unwilling
or to unprepared hearers: and yet in ſeaſon, the
Theame was neceſſary and fitted to their want
of zeale: But the only fault was, that <hi>the time is
come when ſound doctrine</hi> will not be <hi>endured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Committee found it: thus have I
faithfully, but imperfectly, reported it, and do
now ſubjoyn the opinion and requeſt of your
truſtees, to this grand Committee.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is innocent and free from this
accuſation. He had juſt cauſe to petition. The
Vice-chancellor hath been without cauſe, nay
againſt cauſe rigid and oppreſſive. The Sermon
deſerved thanks. The preacher received injuries.
His ſuſpenſion to be taken of: The retracting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:123666:27"/>
and diſſolving whereof ought to be as publike
as was the inflicting thereof.</p>
               <p>One word more I ask leave to adde, and I hope
I ſhall not therein erre from the ſence of the
Committee, though indeed I received it not in
command to be joyned to the Report. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
(M. <hi>White)</hi> is ſpread into a wide and ample
notice. Two great Primats have appeared in it,
and that with different, perhaps contrariant
ſences, ſences as diſtant as <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Armagh.</hi>
The Vice-chancellor ſaith, that <hi>the Preacher was
cenſured by the moſt Reverend Lord Primate of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
who heard him, to be a bold or raſh fellow for
it.</hi> Hereupon I attended that learned, pious, and
painefull Primate, and did read theſe words of
the Vice-chancellour unto him. His anſwer was,
that he takes it as an <hi>Aſperſion</hi> upon him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
the Sermon, and commends it.</p>
               <p>This is an additionall to the Report, and with
this I leave M. Vice-chancellor, and the Biſhops
Chaplen <hi>(Fulham)</hi> to the wiſdome and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this grand Committee.</p>

                  <hi>This is Jeſus the King of

when life and death divided his ſoule and

he never was King indeed, untill he was out of

               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:123666:28"/>

               <p>It may prove a diſquiſition deep and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
yet I deſire (without envy to their pomp
or perſons) to wade ſo farre as may ſatisfie a
mind that loves truth, and deſires to be led by
it: and this with all poſſible brevity. There
hath been a happy and bleſſed reformation of
our Church, God ſend a better, and a more
ſevere reformation of our Church-men, or
elſe our Church is now in danger to be defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
again.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of this inquiry may be this, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether the Miniſters of Chriſts Kingdome
may receive worldly titles, and execute world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Offices and powers? or more generally thus:
Whether a Clergy-man may <hi>ſemel &amp; ſimul,</hi> be
both a Clergy-man and a Lay-man, in power,
office and authority over other men in both
kinds?</p>
               <p>Goe we to the fountain head,<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 22 24.</note> 
                  <hi>There was

ſhould be accounted the greateſt;</hi> which of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:123666:28"/>

Certaine it is, that the two ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 20 20.</note> 
                  <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with their mother, firſt preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which Kingdome was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them ſhortly after to be raiſed in the
ſplendour of this world: This is genuinely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from this very ſtory, generally confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and clearly confirmed in the Hiſtory of
the Acts, where the Apoſtles do aske our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
even after his reſurrection, ſaying,<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 1. 6</note> 
                  <hi>Lord
wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdome to
Iſrael?</hi> Therefore to theſe two brethren and
their mother, ſo much miſtaken in the nature
of his Kingdome he maketh anſwer,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 20 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye know
not what you aske.</hi> He preſently ſheweth the
entertainment of his Kingdome, <hi>A cup to drinke
of,</hi> that many were like to pray <hi>might paſſe from
them;</hi> but they anſwer they <hi>are able to drinke
thereof.</hi> This their anſwer as it proved true
in all the twelve Apoſtles, ſo by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, one of theſe two brothers,
<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>James</hi> was the firſt of the reſt (as ſome do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
who drank the cup of martyrdome, and as
ſome think, <hi>John</hi> was the laſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Equals look awry on the ambition of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:123666:29"/>
fellows. Theſe two were vaine in their high
requeſt, and the other ten murmured at their
preſumption,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 20. 24.</note>

                  <hi>They began to be much

error of theſe two Apoſtles, our Saviour takes
occaſion to inſtruct them, and the other ten,
and in them all other Miniſters belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, how far different the paſtorall care of
his Church, is from the power which governeth
in Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereupon the Sonne of God calleth unto

to theſe undoubted premiſſes, that no

But our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (Lord and

               <p>The Text ſaies that <hi>the Lords of the Gentiles

they would have taken in the worſt ſence of

               <p>That the former ſpeeches of our Saviour,

                        <p>YOu have here a Bill, but ſuch a one as is
likely to be ſhort-liv'd and not to grow
into a perfect Act, unleſſe you pleaſe to adde
therunto ſome very important, very ſignificant
<hi>proviſo's,</hi> ſuch wherein we may have, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may be aſſured in another Bill to have, a
future government, in roome of this that goes
out. I am confident the Lords will otherwiſe
debate and diſpute your Bil quite out of doors.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sir,</hi> we are all bound unto the goodneſſe of
his ſacred Majeſty (God preſerve him and his
for it) none of all our Bils, none of our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(this Parliament) have miſcarried in his
royall hand, but have beene all compleated
with the Royall aſſent.</p>
                        <p>But the Ambition of ſome of our Prelates,
will not let them ſee how incompatible two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
contradiſtinguiſhed functions are in one
&amp; the ſame perſon: And therefore there is left
you neither <hi>Root nor Branch</hi> of that ſo good, ſo
neceſſary a Bill, which lately we did ſend up;
and conſequently no hope of ſuch a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as we all do aime at.</p>
                        <p>What ſparke of hope can we then have,
that this Bill, which ſtrikes at <hi>Root and Branch,</hi>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:123666:36"/>
both of their Seats of Juſtice there, and of their
Epiſcopall Chaires in the Church will paſſe
(as it is, and without tender of ſome other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in lieu of this) ſince the voyces are
ſtill the ſame, which outed your former Bill.</p>
                        <p>Truly (I profeſſe) my hopes are ſad in this:
never had one Parliament ſo many great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
never had any Parliament any affaire ſo
great as this which we call <hi>the Bill of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
Certaine <hi>(Sir,)</hi> it is the great Hope, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Feare of every man here, and of all men
abroad.</p>
                        <p>Many a time this Parliament I have heard
(and not unjuſtly) that the buſineſſe then in
hand was of as great conſequence as any had
been agitated within theſe walls.</p>
                        <p>But in truth, <hi>(Sir,)</hi> to my apprehenſion,
neither Star-Chamber, nor High Commiſſion,
nor Shipmoney, nor <hi>Straffords</hi> death, nor <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburies</hi>
life, are (with me) equivalent, to the
ſetling or unſetling of the whole nationall
Church of this Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>We cannot anſwer to God or man, if we
doe not uſe our beſt and moſt vigorous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for the peace of the Church we live in.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould thinke this a happy day, if we could
ſo temper this Bill, that it might walke fairely
on through the houſe of Lords unto the King.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:123666:37"/>
To this end, (and that we may not loſe
all, by asking more then all,) I will be bold to
offer to your conſideration, a proviſionall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or two. Such as (I hope) may both ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us and ſecure our Bill, by fit amendments.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Here was a little interception, and then a long
additionall to the Bill preſented in writing, for
putting all Church-government into the hands
of Commiſſioners in every Dioceſſe. I proceeded.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir,<note place="margin">This was ſo at firſt, though afterward it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that no Clergy man but onely Lay men ſhould be Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</note> there is now offered unto you, a large
addition to your Bill, longer (indeed) by far,
then the Bill it ſelfe. It ſeemes to deſire, that a
proportionall number of Clergy and Laity,
may be commiſſionated together, for all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticke
juriſdiction, untill a future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be reſolved on.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſſe, I am not ſatisfied with this
way of Commiſſioners; it would joy me much,
and ſatisfie me more, if as one government
goes out, I could ſee another come in, and that
without an <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> of Commiſſioners.</p>
                        <p>We are reſolved that the preſent way of
government is unſufferable, let it goe, but let
us have another. This I conceive to be feiſible,
and that in fewer lines, fewer words, then this
additionall increment now offered to your
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:123666:37"/>
Bill; which in truth will make me like your
Bill worſe then I did before.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe, I doe lay this ground: A
Church government we muſt have. This is
(within theſe walls for ought I heare) on all
hands agreed upon: and then (by unavoydable
neceſſity) this government muſt be diſtributed
into parts, into certaine limits, circuits and
diviſions of places, wherein it is to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
                        <p>Unto this being granted, I do ſubjoyn three
propoſitions, and they are theſe:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, our preſent Dioceſes are (for the moſt
part) much too large, too vaſt; I deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the circuit for future Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may be reduced to the common bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and limits of our ſeverall ſhires. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
from thence objected ſhall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
anſwered.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Next, in every of theſe diviſions, I deſire
that ſome choice, able, grave Divines (twelve or
more in a ſhire) may be by the Parliament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
to be in the nature of an old primitive
conſtant <hi>Presbytery</hi> among us.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, becauſe all meetings of
many muſt be diſorderly, and the rule of many
cannot be without confuſion, unleſſe there be
one to guid and to direct the reſt. I ſhall deſire
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:123666:38"/>
that in every ſhire, over every <hi>Presbytery,</hi> we
may eſtabliſh one <hi>Preſident.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Preſident</hi> (I ſay) more to ſatisfie others
then my ſelfe. The name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> diſturbs not
me; let him be a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or an <hi>Over-ſeer,</hi> or a
<hi>Preſident,</hi> or a <hi>Moderator,</hi> or a <hi>Super-intendent,</hi> or
a <hi>Ruling-elder;</hi> call him what you will, ſo as you
provide me one in every ſhire, over every <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
to guid and to direct the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The different ſence (to be eaſily obſerved)
and I hope not paſt our ſtrength to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
in this Houſe, concerning our preſent
Church-government is two-fold. One is for
<hi>Ruine</hi> thereof, the other for <hi>Reforming:</hi> both
are neerer together in heart (I perſwade my
ſelfe) then we are yet aware of. The neerer
the better, and more eaſie compoſure both of
our owne ſelves here, and of the Churches
peace throughout the Land abroad. God ſend
that we may find the way to peace.</p>
                        <p>If the right forme of primitive Epiſcopacy
were truly ſtated forth unto us, it would (que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe)
take and lead our judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
therewith.</p>
                        <p>This Biſhop was not ſo much a Lord as a
Father over his charge, ruling with love and
tender bowels: whoſoever did inſtitute this
Epiſcopacy, ſure I am this Biſhop hath and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:123666:38"/>
ever had, a precedency before, and a preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
over others of his owne order.</p>
                        <p>He was one man choſen out among the
reſt, and by the reſt put into a ſeverall <hi>degree</hi>
(not into a diſtinct ſuperiour <hi>Order)</hi> above the
reſt: <gap reason="foreign">

nothing at all in affaires temporall, or ſecular

                        <p>If this Biſhop were not of <hi>Apoſtolicall inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
yet it is undeniable that he was of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall

nor ſhall you ever be able, utterly and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

this <hi>ſoleſhip</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude in ſhort and plaine Engliſh, I
am for aboliſhing of our preſent Epiſcopacy.
Both Dioceſſes and Dioceſan as now they are.
But I am withall (at the ſame time) for reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the pure Primitive Epiſcopall Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
Cut off the uſurped adjuncts of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Epiſcopacy, reduce the ancient Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ſuch as it was, <hi>in puris ſpiritualibus.</hi> Both may
be done with the ſame hand, and I thinke in a
ſhorter Bill then is offered now by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                        <p>Downe then with our <hi>Prelaticall Hierarchy,</hi>
or <hi>Hierarchicall Prelacy</hi> (ſuch as now we have)
moſt of it conſiſting in temporall adjuncts
onely; the <hi>Diana</hi> and the Idoll of proud and
lazy Church-men. This doe, but <hi>eâ lege,</hi> on
this condition, that with the ſame hand,
in the ſame Bill, we doe gently raiſe againe
(even from under the ruines of that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel)
ſuch an Epiſcopacy, ſuch a Preſidency, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:123666:41"/>
is venerable in its antiquity and purity, and
moſt behoovefull for the peace of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</p>
                        <p>This is the way of <hi>Reforming:</hi> and thus by
yeelding to the preſent ſtorme, and throwing
that over-board which is adventitious, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
and undue; Peace may be brought
home unto our Church againe, the beſt of that
building and the truth of ancient Epiſcopacy
may be preſerved: otherwiſe we hazard all.</p>
                        <p>This would be glorious for us and for our

greater, becauſe it redounds unto the God of

                        <p>My motion is, that thoſe ſheets laſt preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>It is very true (as is inſtanced unto you) that
your late order and declaration of the 8 and
9 of <hi>September,</hi> are much debated and diſputed
abroad: perhaps it may be a good occaſion
for us to re-diſpute them here.</p>
               <p>The intent of your Order, to me, ſeemes
doubtfull, and therfore I am bold, for my owne
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:123666:42"/>
inſtruction, humbly to propound two <hi>quaeres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. How farre an Order of this Houſe is
binding?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether this particular Order be
continuant or expired?</p>
               <p>Your Orders (I am out of doubt) are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull,
if they be grounded upon the lawes of
the Land. Upon that warranty, we may by
an Order, enforce any thing that is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
ſo grounded: and by the ſame rule we
may abrogate whatſoever is introduced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the undoubted foundation of our
Lawes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> this Order is of another nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
temper: eſpecially in one part of it. Of
which (in particular) at ſome other time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> There want not ſome abroad, men of
birth, quality, and Fortunes; ſuch as know the
ſtrength of our Votes here as well as ſome of
us (I ſpeake my owne infirmities) men of the

way obnoxious to us: They know they ſent
us hither as their <hi>Truſtees,</hi> to make and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make
Lawes. They know they did not ſend
us hither to rule and governe them by arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
revocable and diſputable Orders: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Religion: No time is fit for that: and
this time as unfit as any. I deſire to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> in the ſecond place, there is a
queſtion whether this Order (whereupon your
preſent complaint is grounded) be permanent
and binding, or elſe expired, and by our ſelves
deſerted.</p>
               <p>I obſerve, that your Order being made 8.<hi>September, </hi>in hope then of concurrence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by the Lords; that fayling, you did iſſue
forth your laſt reſolution by way of declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<hi>9. September, </hi>wherein thus you expreſſe
your ſelfe.<hi>—That it may well be hoped, when both
Houſes ſhall meet againe, that the good propoſitions
and preparations in the Houſe of Commons, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the like grievances, and reforming the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and abuſes in matter of Religion, may be
brought to perfection: wherefore you doe expect
that the commons of this Realme doe in the meane
time—</hi>(what? obey and performe your Order
made the day before? no ſuch thing: but in
the meane time)<hi>—quietly attend the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
intended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are your words, and this my doubt
upon them: whether by theſe words you have
not ſuperſeded your owne Order. Sure I am,
the words doe beare this ſence, and good men
may thinke and hope it was your meaning.</p>
               <p>My humble motion therfore is this: I beſeech
you to declare, that upon this our Re-conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:123666:43"/>
your order of the eighth of September is
out of date: And that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of England
muſt (as you ſay) <hi>quietly attend the Reformation

perfected up into Acts of Parliament. And in
the meane time that they muſt patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

            <p>THe promiſe made (in my laſt) hath not
beene performed in the Houſe, nor is now
like to be. The reaſon is, there is now no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that we ſhall debate the validity of our
order of the eighth of September. A day indeed
(Saterday the ſixth of November) was by order
fixed for that theame, but other affaires diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

my ſelfe, as in this following diſcourſe: but
that order being expired and not revived,
though moved for; I aske pardon if I do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

Excuſe me <hi>Reader</hi> if I be willing fully to expoſe

               <p>ME thinks I am now going to walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ridge of a houſe, a dangerous
praecipice on either hand. On the one ſide I
muſt take heed that I ſpeak neither more nor

on the other hand I ſhall be afraid to
preſume above your better judgements. My
path is narrow: I muſt looke to my footing:
<hi>Dixi cuſtodiam vias meas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 38. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. I ſaid I will looke
to my wayes that I offend not in my tongue.</hi> Thus I
preface, becauſe I foreknow that I ſhall ſpeak
to the diſlike of ſome worthy members of this
honourable Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir:</hi> Two queſtions are before us: Firſt in
generall, how farre an order of this Houſe is
binding <hi>deforis,</hi> not upon our owne members
here, but upon the people, the Kings ſubject
abroad. Secondly, the validity and invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your particular order of the eighth, and
declaration of the ninth of September laſt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt I am clear in this opinion, that
we may enforce any thing that is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded upon the law of the land: Shew
me that foundation, and I will concurre with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:123666:44"/>
you in any reſolution. We may alſo declare
againſt any thing that is introduced contrary
to our lawes. Farther then this I know no
way, unleſſe it be by Bill: and then I know
no limitation, no bound. Thus in briefe for
the generall, I come now to your particular
order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> I ſhall be afraid to <hi>arraigne</hi>
your orders: I have already beene control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
(not for doing ſo, but as if I had done ſo)
yet <hi>(Sir)</hi> I have often heard it in this Houſe,
that <hi>we are maſters of our owne orders:</hi> and then
(I thinke) we may in this place <hi>arraigne</hi> them,
that is, queſtion them, try them, approve, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
reject, or condemne them. Was not our
Proteſtation more ſacred then an Order? yet
that was reviſed, and (to ſtop ſome objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
new ſenced by us. And I take it lawfull
in this place to <hi>arraigne</hi> (if that be the word)
even an act of Parliament, and then <hi>(a fortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri)</hi>
an order of this Houſe.</p>
               <p>Surely <hi>(Sir)</hi> I ſhall ſpeake reverently of all
your Orders when I am abroad: I have done
ſo of this. I am reſolved that my obedience
ſhall therein be found good, although my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
reaſon be rebellant to your concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This is my duty abroad: but here in this
Houſe, within theſe walles, freedome is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:123666:45"/>
and give me leave (I pray) at this
time to uſe a part of my birth-right.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſonableneſſe, and the equity of your
order, both are controverted. You all know
this is a dangerous time to make any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in matter of Religion: whether it
be in the doctrinall, or in the practicall part of
Gods worſhip. Men are (now a dayes) many
of them more wiſe, and ſome of them more
wilfull then in former times. The uſe and
caution is this: Let us take care that what we
do, we do with due and full authority, I would
have nothing new (in this kinde) but by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the three Eſtates: and even then let
us be wary that we ſuit the times with appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
proper and ſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>Hear me with patience, and refute me with
reaſon. Your command is, that <hi>all corporall
bowing at the Name Ieſus—be henceforth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often wiſhed that we might decline
theſe dogmaticall reſolutions in Divinity: I
ſay it againe and againe, that we are not <hi>Idonei
&amp; competentes judices</hi> in doctrinall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The theame we are now upon is a ſad
point, I pray conſider ſeverely on it.</p>
               <p>You know there is<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>no other Name under

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:123666:45"/>
You know that this is<note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 2. 9.</note>

<hi>Mel in ore, melos in aure, jubilum in corde.</hi> This,
it is the ſweeteſt and the fulleſt of comfort of
all the Names and Attributes of God, <hi>God my
Saviour.</hi> If Chriſt were not our JESUS,
Heaven were then our envy, which is now our
bleſſed hope.</p>
               <p>And muſt I <hi>Sir,</hi> hereafter doe no exterior
reverence, none at all, to God my Saviour, at
the mention of his ſaving Name <hi>Jeſus?</hi> why
<hi>Sir,</hi> not to do it, to omit it, and to leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
it is queſtionable; it is controvertible:
it is at leaſt a moote point in divinity. But to
deny it, to forbid it to be done: take heed <hi>(ſir)</hi>
God will never owne you, if you forbid his
honour. Truly <hi>(Sir)</hi> it horrors me to thinke
of this.</p>
               <p>For my part, I do humbly aske pardon of
this Houſe, and thereupon I take leave and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to give you my reſolute reſolution. I
may, I muſt, I will doe bodily reverence unto
my Saviour, and that upon occaſion taken at
the mention of his ſaving Name <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
And if I ſhould doe it alſo as oft as the Name
of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> is named in
our ſolemne devotions, I doe not know
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:123666:46"/>
any argument in Divinity to controll me.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I ſhall never be frighted from this,
with that fond, ſhallow argument: Oh you
make an Idoll of a Name. I beſeech you <hi>Sir,</hi>
paint me a voyce, make a ſound viſible if you
can: when you have taught mine eares to ſee,
and mine eyes to heare, I may then perhaps
underſtand this ſubtile argument. In the mean
time reduce this dainty ſpecies of new Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
under its proper head, (the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement)
if you can. And if I find it there,
I will fly from it <hi>ultra Sauromatas</hi> any whither
with you.</p>
               <p>The words are there, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy
ſelfe any graven Image, or any likeneſſe of any thing
(ullius rei) that is in Heaven—or in Earth—</hi>
Can you here find the Name of God in this

none but theſe, and every of theſe doth ſignify
<hi>Spectrum aliquod</hi> ſome viſible object. And muſt
do ſo, for to ſpeake properly, an Idoll inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is but imaginary <hi>Non ſence.</hi> When you
can bring the object of one ſence, to fall under
the notion and diſhinguiſhment of another
ſence; ſo that the eye may as well ſee a Name,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:123666:46"/>
or ſound, as the eare can heare it: then a name
may be the object of Idolatry: till then this
argument will be too ſublime for my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>God was neither in the <hi>ſtrong and mighty

               <p>I am grieved to ſee that wretched, unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ungodly Pamphlet aſcribed to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Burton,</hi> with that daring impious title <hi>Jeſu-worſhip</hi>
confuted: where by way of a Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sarcaſme, he is not afraid (as with a nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name)
to call Chriſtians <hi>Jeſu-worſhippers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I returne (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> this (as I ſaid) is a ſad
point in Divinity, to forbid exterior wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
unto God. Was it ever heard before, that
any men of any Religion, in any age, did ever
cut ſhort and abridge any worſhip, upon any
occaſion to their God? Take heed <hi>ſir,</hi> and let
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:123666:47"/>
us all take heed whither we are going. If Chriſt
be JESUS, if JESUS be God, all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(exterior as well as interior) is too little
for him. I hope we are not going up the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaires
to <hi>Socinianiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, certainly <hi>ſir,</hi> I ſhall never obey
your Order, ſo long as I have a hand to lift up
to Heaven, ſo long as I have an eye to lift up
to Heaven. For theſe are corporall bowings,
and my Saviour ſhall have them at his Name
JESUS.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>ſir,</hi> before I end, give me leave (I beſeech
you) to take off that, which, by miſtake may
elſe ſticke ſtill upon me. I never liked the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoply
injuctions in the late novell practices,
nor the ſevere Inquiſition upon the bare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of this poſture. The Biſhops did rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
exact it: upon their owne heads the
crime of that enforcement lies. But (I beſeech
you) let not us be guilty in the other extream.
Truly to my ſence it will ſavour leſſe of Piety,
and more of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, conſider (I pray) that it is
a point dogmaticall, not yet fully reſolved by
Divines; let us then be wary in it. And let this
(with many other points) be referred to a
<hi>National Synod.</hi> For one we muſt have, or elſe
we ſhall breake our Religion into a thouſand
pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:123666:47"/>
For this preſent, my motion is (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
that this Order be ſuperſeded, by declaring
to the Commons (as your words in the Order
are) that they doe <hi>quietly attend the Reformation
intended,</hi> and that in the meane time they doe

I have formerly, and againe I pray you,
that we may not engage our ſelves into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination

perhaps it is not proper for us; and for my part,
I doe think we are not herein <hi>Idonei &amp; compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:123666:48"/>
all profeſſions admitted, but the
profeſſion of profeſſions for this worke, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
alone excluded, that we ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon doctrinall points in Divinity? The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology
is not ſo low, ſo facile a trade. Let us
maintaine the doctrines that are eſtabliſhed;
to declare new, is not fit for our aſſembly. And
for my part, I do think I have found daily cauſe
to wiſh theſe reſolutions recommended unto
other reſolvers.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Divines are herein (in dogmatick
reſolutions of Religion) concerned as much,
as well as we: They are a conſiderable party,
and ought not to be bound up un-heard. It
was a prevailing argument with me againſt the
late Canons, that they could not bind us of
the Laity, being a diſtinct ſeverall body, no
way involved in their Votes. Our plea was
that we neither had a <hi>deciſive</hi> voyce to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
with them; not a <hi>deliberative</hi> voyce to
conſult with them: nor an <hi>elective</hi> voyce, in
choyce of their perſons, to make them our
<hi>Truſtees</hi> to determine for us. Nor laſtly, (as at
leaſt we ſhould have) a <hi>ſuſceptive</hi> voyce, in a
body of our own to receive their reſolutions,
and of our ſelves to ſubmit unto them. Theſe
things are of a nature fit to be diſcuſſed by
grave Divines, in a free Synod of Divines, to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:123666:49"/>
choſen by Divines. In the mean time, let not us
be guilty of the ſame which we have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them: we ought not to pay injury with
wrong. They cannot be bound where they are
no way parties: For it is a rule in Nature,
Reaſon, and Religion, <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab
omnibus tractari debet.</hi> I am ſo good a friend to
your Bill, that for the better expediting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

wherein divers paſſages then were,
concerning Religion and the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſome in particular (as I conceived)
very aſperſive to our Religion in the ſolemne
practice of it by our publick Liturgy:<note place="margin">This charge (upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> charging
it <hi>(in hypotheſi)</hi> with <hi>vaine repetition,</hi> and with

ſome of that Committee who framed up that

what thoſe <hi>vaine Repetitions</hi> are in our Liturgy,
and what paſſages of <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing was at all ſaid (as I remember) to

            </p>
            <p>He ſaid that the Lords Prayer is eight, nine or
tenne times repeated. I did (with leave of the
Houſe) reply that ſuch repetition <hi>toties quoties,</hi>
how oft ſoever was (if heart and words did go
together) farre from vaine. That (in my book)
the Lords Prayer was but twice in the whole
morning Service, unleſſe the additionals of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
Churching, Communion, Buriall, &amp;c.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:123666:51"/>
did occurre. That then in every ſeverall act of
Divine Service it was once, and but once repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as the high compleature of all devout ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions:
That this repetition in it ſelfe was
warrantable, as by our Saviours example, who
(although he <hi>had not the Spirit by meaſure)</hi> yet in
the Garden he prayed three times uſing <hi>the ſame
words.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. 3. 34.</note> The further debate of this was ofted to
the next day,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 44.</note> and then it did grow toward a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether all exceptions againſt the Liturgy
ſhould be totally laid by, or further debated. I
did not hold our ſelves the proper determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

we be <hi>Idonei &amp; competentes judices</hi> in doctrinall

                        <p>In my opinion we are not. Let us main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

of both gownes, Phyſitians, Merchants,
Citizens, all profeſſions admitted, or at leaſt
admittable, but the profeſſors of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
excluded, that we ſhould determine upon
doctrines in Divinity.</p>
                        <p>Shall the Clergy hold different doctrines
from us? or ſhall our determinations binde
them alſo? They are a conſiderable body in
this Kingdome; they are (herein ſurely) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

Farther <hi>(Sir)</hi> if Clergy men, among us be
thought fit for no other then for ſpirituall
imployment; How ſhall we anſwer it to God
and to a good conſcience, if we ſhut them out
from that which we our ſelves pretend to bee

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> We cannot brag of an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſpirit: infallibility is no more tyed to

if I may ſpeake Truth, as I love truth with

profeſſe unto you, that I ſhall not
acquieſſe, and ſit downe upon the doctrinall
reſolutions of this Houſe: unleſſe it be where
my own <hi>Genius</hi> doth leade and prompt me to
the ſame concluſions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> We are here convened by his
Majeſties Writ to treat <hi>Super arduis negotiis

ſo take care to ſettle the government, that we
do not unſettle the doctrines.</p>
                        <p>The Short cloſe of all with a motion is but
this: we are poiſoned in many points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
And I know no Antidote, no <hi>Recipe</hi>
for cure but one: a well choſen and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd

                           <hi>Nationall Synod,</hi> and Gods bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
this may cure us: without this (in my poor
opinion) <hi>England</hi> is like to turne it ſelfe into

               <p>THis Remonſtrance is now in progreſſe
upon its laſt foot in this Houſe: I muſt
give a vote unto it, one way or other: my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
bids me not to dare to be affirmative:
So ſings the bird in my breaſt, and I do cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
believe the tune to be good.</p>
               <p>This Remonſtrance whenſoever it paſſeth,
will make ſuch an impreſſion and leave ſuch a
character behinde, both of his Majeſty, the
People, the Parliament, and of this preſent
Church and State, as no Time ſhall ever eat it
out, whileſt Hiſtories are written, and men
have eyes to read them.—How curious then
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:123666:57"/>
ought we to be, both in the matter and the
forme? Herein is a ſevere point of conſcience
to be tryed: Let us be ſure that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſubſtance be a <hi>Truth:</hi> and let us cloathe
that <hi>Truth</hi> with a free language, yet a modeſt
and a ſober language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> This Remonſtrance is in ſome
kinde greater and more extenſive then an act
of Parliament: that reacheth only to England
and Wales; but in this the three Kingdomes
will be your immediate ſuperviſors: and the
greateſt part of Chriſtendome will quickly
borrow the glaſſe to ſee our deformities ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
They will ſcanne this worke at leiſure,
which (I hope) we ſhall not ſhut up in haſte.</p>
               <p>Some pieces here are of excellent uſe and
worth: but what is that to me, if I may not
have them, without other parts that are both
doubtfull and dangerous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>matter, forme,</hi> and <hi>finall end</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
all of them doe argue with me,
not to remonſtrate thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>end:</hi> to what end doe we decline thus
to them that looke not for it? Wherefore is
this deſcenſion from a Parliament to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
they looke not up for this ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courteſie? The better ſort think beſt of
us: And why are we told that the people are

               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:123666:57"/>
I did never looke for it of my predeceſſors
in this place, nor ſhall do from my ſucceſſors.
I do here profeſſe that I do not know any one
ſoul in all that Country (for which I have the
honour to ſerve) who lookes for this at your
hands. They do humbly and heartily thanke
you for many good lawes and ſtatutes already
enacted, and pray for more. That is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
beſt underſtood of them, and moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to them. They do not expect to heare
any other ſtories of what you have done,
much leſſe promiſes of what you will do.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker.</hi> When I firſt heard of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
I preſently imagined that like
faithfull Counſellors, we ſhould hold up a
glaſſe unto his Majeſty: I thought to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto the King the wicked counſels of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Counſellors: The reſtleſſe turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of practicall Papiſts. The treachery of ſalſe
Judges: The bold innovations and ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
brought in by ſome pragmaticall
BB: and the rotten part of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>I did not dream that we ſhould remonſtrate
downeward, tell ſtories to the people, and
talke of the King as of a third perſon.</p>
               <p>The uſe and <hi>end</hi> of ſuch Remonſtrance I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

               <p>What? plain, flat, formall Idolatry? name the

               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:123666:58"/>
Certainly <hi>Sir,</hi> Idolatry (in the practice of it)
is a very viſible ſin; and the <hi>command</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
was either legible or audible. Who hath
read this command? who hath heard this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
who hath ſeen this all-commanded I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry?

               <p>Some ſuperſtition in doctrines, and in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,

give me leave (I beſeech you) in this

               <p>It is I dare ſay, the unanimous wiſh, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
ſence, of this whole Houſe, to go ſuch

abilities, theſe ſeverall ſufficiencies, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſometime meet together in one and the
ſame man. but ſeldome, very ſeldom, ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that you ſcarce can find a very few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thouſands rightly qualified in both.</p>
               <p>Nor is this ſo much the infelicity of our, or
any times, as it is generally the incapacity of
man, who can not eaſily raiſe himſelfe up to
double excellencies.</p>
               <p>Knowledge in Religion doth extend it ſelf
into ſo large, ſo vaſt a Sphere, that many (for
haſt) do cut croſſe the diameter, and find
weight enough in halfe their worke: very few
do or can travell the whole circle round.</p>
               <p>Some one in an age (perhaps) may be found,
who as Sir <hi>Francis Darke</hi> about the terreſtriall
Globe, may have travelled the celeſtiall Orbe
of Theologicall learning, both for controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
and for inſtructive Divinity.</p>
               <p>The incomparable Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
firſt to be named. Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> (whom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:123666:60"/>

another Biſhop never to be forgotten.<note place="margin">As Mr. <hi>Reading.</hi>

                  </note> But <hi>Sir,</hi> theſe be <hi>Rarae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aves,</hi>
there are very few of them.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is evident. For whilſt one man
doth chiefly intend the Pulpit exerciſes, he is
thereby diſabled for Polemick diſcourſes: and
whilſt another indulgeth to himſelfe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of his Pen, he thereby renders himſelfe
the weaker for the Pulpit. Some men ayming
at eminency in both have proved but mean
proficients in either. For it is a rule and a
ſure one,

               <p>Now <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuch a way, ſuch a temper of
Church-government and of Church-revenue, I
muſt wiſh, as may beſt ſecure unto us both: both

               <p>Learning <hi>(Sir)</hi> it is invaluable: the loſſe of
learning, it is not in one age recoverable. You

and juſtly ſo I do: for even from that time

convince our Miſo-muſiſts, and doth evict that
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> by their mutuall ſupport,

               <p>In concluſion, I do beſeech you all with the

               <p>I will not trouble you to repeat the character
of this Biſhop: I have formerly been bold with
you in that kind. He had a precedency. He had

               <p>It is true, that we have made you our Biſhop,
our Overſeer, our Preſident: and now it is as

of the Church of God in all ages. And this being
matter of fact, I do hope that hiſtoricall proofe
will be ſufficient adequate proofe in that which
in its fact is matter of Hiſtory. But proofes herein

But do not think to bring me into a dream of a

               <p>As for them, who ſay that all Epiſcopacy is

               <p>

               <p>Ancient S. <hi>Clement</hi> (whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth his

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Contention about the very name of Biſhop.</hi> I think
the time is now. For my part, I will not make
that my contention: But for the government by
an Epiſcopall preſidency, ſhew me any thing
more agreeable to the holy word: Shew me any
thing more honoured by the holy Martyrs of
the firſt and the latter times: Shew me any more
rationall and prudentiall way of government,
and I yeild unto you.</p>
               <p>Some againſt all Epiſcopacy do plead unto
us, the freſh example, and late practice of our
neighbour Churches. But I beſeech you <hi>Sir,</hi> are
not we herein as fit to give them our, as to take
their example? I am aſhamed to heare yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
example preſſed as an argument by ſome,
and the all-ſeeing providence through all ages
to the contrary turned aſide, by the ſame men,
as not worth an anſwer. Or if an anſwer you
get, it is but this dead one, wherein (as in a
<hi>mare mortuum)</hi> they would drown all reply. Oh
(ſay they) the <hi>myſtery of Iniquity</hi> began to work
in the Apoſtles time. <hi>Ergo,</hi> what? Therefore (ſay
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:123666:68"/>
they) this Epiſcopacy is that myſtery of iniquity:
And ſo they do deſperately conclude with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did never ſupport his Church
with a good government till <hi>Farell</hi> and <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
did drive their Biſhop out of <hi>Geneva:</hi> or ſince
then, untill Presbytery begat independency. But
their Syllogiſme is as true Logick and as Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiall,
as our Kentiſh Proverb, that <hi>Tenterden
Steeple is the cauſe of Goodwin ſands.</hi> Both Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are in one and the ſame mood and figure.
But I return and proceed.</p>
               <p>I have not aſſerted this kind of Epiſcopacy as
Divine, yet I profeſſe that it ſoares aloft,
<q>—Et caput inter nubila condit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been ſtrongly received, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſucceed to the ſeventy Diſciples, and Biſhops
to the Apoſtles. S. <hi>Peter</hi> honours Epiſcopacy, by
entitling the holy Apoſtles thereunto, for <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
is choſen to <hi>take a Biſhoprick</hi> (the very word
there) which <hi>Judas</hi> loſt by <hi>going to his owne place.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1. 20</note>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels you,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a faythfull ſaying,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>If any man deſire a Biſhopricke, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a good worke.</hi> And this S. <hi>Paul,</hi> writes not at
large in an Epiſtle to the body of a whole
Church, as to Rome or Corinth, but this is in
directed unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> then deſigned to be the
particular Biſhop, that is the Preſident and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer
of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:123666:68"/>
Two things are (or may be) here objected. Firſt,
that neither of theſe Texts, nor any other can be
found, expreſly mandatory, requiring the Office
of Epiſcopacy in the Church. Next that the name
of Biſhop is in ſome places plainly given unto
Presbyters. I anſwer.</p>
               <p>If you put me upon this, that you will not yeild
unto Epiſcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill you have a Text expreſly
poſitive therein, conſider if by the ſame rule you
do not let looſe many other points as well as this.
Shew me an expreſſe for the Lords day to be
weekly celebrated. It will be hard to find divers
Articles of our Creed in the holy Scripture <hi>terminis
terminantibus.</hi> What have you there for <hi>Paedo-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</hi>
What precept or example have you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
Saviour, that women ſhal receive the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper? Why ſhould women be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſince the covenant (to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> baptiſme doth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed)
Circumciſion, was a ſeale between God and
men onely? what have you there expreſſe, why I
may not beleeve the Trinity to be three Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as well as three perſons, &amp; but one Almighty?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> the golden rule of <hi>Vincentius Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
is an unfailing guide. <hi>Quod ubique, quod ſemper,
quod ab omnibus,</hi> look what among Chriſtians, hath
been every where at all times, by all men univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
received, <hi>Atque id quidem verè eſt Catholicum,</hi>
and there you may reſt ſecured. So (I ſay) that for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:123666:69"/>
right ſence of theſe Texts, and for warrant of this
Epiſcopacy, the univerſall practice of the whole
Church of God, eſpecially in the Apoſtles times,
and immediately ſucceeding the Apoſtles, is a moſt
undeniable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary to cleare unto us, that this
kind of Epiſcopacy is and was of <hi>Apoſtolicall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
if not of <hi>Apoſtolicall inſtitution.</hi> And thus in
other points doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> argue againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi>
and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt the Donatiſts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond exception is thus. Theſe Biſhops
may well be thought to be but Presbyters, for (ſay
they) the name of Biſhop is given to Presbyters
alſo in holy writ. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Epiſcopacy is not a ſeverall
degree from Presbytery.</p>
               <p>Surely <hi>Sir,</hi> if this argument be a ſound one, then
Apoſtleſhip it ſelfe, was not a ſeverall order and
degree from the 70. Diſciples, and from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and then it had been a vaine thing to take
<hi>Matthias</hi> from a Diſciple into the <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip</hi>
of an Apoſtolate. S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not degrade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of his Apoſtleſhip, when he entitleth himſelf
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a fellow Presbyter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1.</note> That very Office
which is called <hi>a Biſhopricke,</hi>

And if you will argue from community of names
to identity of Office (ſo is done in the titles of
Biſhop and Presbyter) ſurely then we ſhall find,
many more Apoſtles then they who <hi>ſaw the Lord

I conclude that all theſe who are thus called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,

very Apoſtles? No man will ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>By the ſame argument, (from community of
name to identity of Office, which argument by

an Apoſtle and a Deacon to be the ſame Office.

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 7.</note> I conclude, that if Apoſtles be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Deacons,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 23</note> and Deacons be called Apoſtles, and
yet the Offices are, and are reputed to be diſtinct
and ſeverall: So may the ſame men be called ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Biſhops, ſometime Elders or Presbyters, and
yet the two different degrees remain different
and unconfounded. Take heed of enforcing ſuch
argument, to prove a parity in degree by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Appellation, ſince you may read of our

this, I proceed.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I come now in briefe to my third
Epiſcopacy, <hi>Epiſcopus Princeps.</hi> This, this third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:123666:70"/>
age, is the burden of our ſong,
<q>—De duro eſt ultima ferro.</q>
Gold was the firſt: the ſecond was bright and gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering,
a ſilver age at leaſt. But this, this where we
now are, it is Iron, I and ruſty too.</p>
               <p>This is that Clergy Monarch whom we would
avoyd. This ambition of a ſole power, it is a very
old ſin, it began in <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle
complaines that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Primatum dilexit,</hi>
he loved to be a Primate, the firſt, the ſole in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
He <hi>(Diotrephes</hi> alone) did <hi>caſt the brethren
out of the Church:</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle doth
threaten that when he comes,<note place="margin">3 Jo. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>He will bring the
deeds of Diotrephes to remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dangerous ſoleſhip is a fault in our Church
indeed; and this I take to be <hi>Peſtilentia Cathedrae,</hi>
the very peſt and poyſon of Epiſcopacy; this is
that which muſt away, and this being gone, I ſhall
not feare their tyranny.</p>
               <p>If it were not for this, they could neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
good Miniſters, nor preferre dull droanes,
ſcandalous perſons, nor pragmaticall innovators.
If they had not been ſo ſole in power, our many
ſeverall chaires for Religion had not groned with
ſuch number &amp; weight of complaints. But by this,
they have bin able to do miſchiefe above beliefe.</p>

The exemplar piety, the ardent love, and ſweet
humility of holy Biſhops in the firſt foure centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
did worke ſo farre upon the credulous hopes
of both Clergie and Laity, that preſuming to find
in the ſame Chaire a ſucceſſion of the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
they became guilty of a deſperate ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a ſole power of one man, before they knew
what changes, and what conſequences they ſhould
feele.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> the great Biſhop of Antioch, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
his own Epiſcopacy, from an Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
even by this, that he had not a ſoleſhip of
power and authority as they, and therefore hee
ſayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I do not command you as an

               </p>
               <p>This Biſhop keepes a dangerous diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his own Phariſaicall worſhip, and the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
Clergy, who yet are, all in order as good, &amp;
many of them in merit better then his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>To draw this to a point: The firſt Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
we all are vow'd unto. The ſecond, none will
diſſent from, but a lover of Novelliſme: The
third, none can ſubmit unto, but ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

               <p>In a word <hi>(Sir)</hi> we are all quick ſented, we are
all on fire to heare of an arbitrary rule in the civill
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:123666:72"/>
State: I beſeech you, let us all be equally or more
zealous for the Lord of Hoſts: Let us not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of bringing in an arbitrary rule into his Houſe.
Take heed <hi>(Sir)</hi> let us all take heed of ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
parity, as ſome would bring in among us: &amp;
the rather becauſe they preſume to ſet the ſtampe
of divine authority upon that counterfeit mettal.</p>
               <p>Parity of degrees in Church-government hath
no foundation in holy Scripture, &amp; is as abſonous
to reaſon, as parity in a State or family. Indeed it
is a fancy, a dream, a meer <hi>non entity,</hi> it neither hath
nor ever had a being. If it be any thing, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Anarchiſme, and that is nothing, for privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of government is not a government.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary imparity is from Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
our Saviour did plant it, &amp; then I am ſure
it is a plant that ſhould grow and continue. By the
way I preſſe you not w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inſtances of Gods Church
under the law, thogh that, &amp; this under the Goſpel
were both planted by the ſame All-knowing wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
From the equity of which law there, &amp; from
the imparity of governors therein, a moſt ſolid and
unfailing argument may be deduced for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of an imparity alſo under the Goſpell. For
that which is good in it ſelfe, is ever ſo. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all peradventure, if Church imparity did (in its
own being) lye croſſe unto the will of God, or to
the law of his Church, God never would, never
could have commanded it. But that our Saviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:123666:73"/>
ſo in the Evangelicall Church did plant imparity is
moſt cleare. Firſt, he choſe his<note n="a" place="margin">Lu. 6. 13</note> 12. <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

my part, I am cleare and confident in this that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity
in power among perſons officed in the
Church, is both lawfull and expedient, and ought
to be preſerved, if order, decency, Neceſſity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
practice, Apoſtolicall example, and Divine
authority can altogether make but one conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
argument.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I do humbly and earneſtly entreat, &amp;
beg of every member of this Houſe, ſeriouſly and
ſadly to examine his own ſoule (never more cauſe
then in this preſent vote) what end and what ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ayme he hath in this dreadfull Bill. What is
the government his heart doth wiſh for? Three
ways of Church-government I have heard of, and
no more; the <hi>Epiſcopall,</hi> the <hi>Presbyteriall,</hi> and that
new born baſtard <hi>Independency: Non datur quartum.</hi>
The laſt of theſe is nothing but a confounding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxy,
rent upon rent, and a ſchiſme of ſchiſmes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
all Church community be torn into Atomes,
every three men, (<note n="a" place="margin">As may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Spenſers</hi> wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.</note> nay every three women) diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating

                  </gap>, <hi>a wilworſhip</hi>
of their own deviſing, which fondly &amp; madly they
would call a Church. Where and in what corner
of the world hath this aery Independency been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
untill theſe daies? <hi>Quo conſule?</hi> under what
Kings raigne was it born? where may I heare that
it hath a being? where may I read (below the world
in the Moone) that ever it had a being? I will be
bold to brand it with the name of a new-minted
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:123666:74"/>
Seminary for all ſelf-pride, hereſie, ſchiſme, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for all libertiniſme, except an outward
ſeeming ſaintſhip. A peſtilence to all government,
a traiterous and a clouted Anarchy. If this way
have any favourers in this Houſe, let them owne
their Religion and ſpeake for it.</p>
               <p>The next is the Presbyteriall way, a more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and a better tempered novelty then the
other, but a novelty, and indeed but elder brother
to Independency: upon this you had my ſence at
midſomer laſt. It is enough for me that I can point
out when it began: ſince my father was born, or I
am ſure at moſt in my grandfathers days: and it is
my fixed reſolution that ſince (by Gods bleſſing) I
am of the oldeſt Religion, I will never conſent to
any but to the oldeſt government.</p>
               <p>The third way is Epiſcopall: the originall
whereof is high, and beyond my ſearch to define:
yet this I am bold to affirme: it had a Being, and
that an allowed Being in the beſt, the firſt, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
age, and (as I ſaid before) if it be not of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
inſtitution,</hi> yet cleare enough it is of <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
permiſſion.</hi> It will be ſaid that our Biſhops are
nothing ſuch: yet <hi>(Sir,</hi> I pray you) may not they
be eaſier made ſuch, then the Dutch or Scottiſh
Presbytery, or a new-England Independency can
be? what is our work but to reforme? I would the
queſtion were put whether our Epiſcopacy ſhall
be reformed or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:123666:74"/>
But <hi>(Mr. Speaker)</hi> it is true, there are degrees
in Epiſcopacie it ſelf: and to this point alſo, give
mee leave to expreſſe my ſelf, and it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for me ſo to doe, although I am confident,
you are herein prae-reſolved as I wiſh. <hi>Sir,</hi> the
ſtairs are ſo eaſie, and ambition (that firſt made
Divels) is ſo apt to climbe, that ſo long as the
ladder is not taken away; The (1) Prieſt would
be a (2) rurall Deane. He an (3) Archdeacon.
Then (4) a Biſhop. An (5) Archbiſhop. A
(6) Metropolitan. A (7) Primate. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
would be a (8) Patriarch (his owne book
breathed that hope) and once a Patriarch, why
not a (9) Pope? Thus have you nine degrees
of a terreſtriall Hierarchy, ſutable to the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nine orders of a Coeleſtiall Hierarchy among
the Angels. It was a fond fancy to invent them
in the world above, and it will prove a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
folly in us to ſuffer theſe in the world below.
One of the links of this chaine is almoſt burſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder:
<note place="margin">There was then but one Arch-Biſhop and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached for his life.</note> never let that be ſodered again. <hi>Sir,
In uno Syllâ multi Marii:</hi> Cut off but one <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopacie,</hi>
and you ſhall at once deſtroy with it,
both Metropolitan, Primate and Patriarch, and
in time the Pope alſo. Archiepiſcopie! why,
who ever voted that to be divine? nay, who can
give a good morall and prudentiall reaſon for
the ſubſiſtence of Archiepiſcopie? This indeed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:123666:75"/>
is a Prince among the Lordly Prelates, and they
all doe ſwear Canonicall fealty and allegeance
to his ſoveraigne Miter. But I forbear, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
there is a concurrency enough in this
Houſe to vote the Abolition of that needleſſe and
that dangerous degree.</p>
               <p>So then my ſence is thus in briefe. Away with
Archiepiſcopacy both <hi>root and branch.</hi> Away with
my Lord Biſhop both <hi>root and branch.</hi> Touch
not our Paſtor Biſhop. Reform, reduce, replant
our Biſhop Preſident, and with him his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
Give him his ancient, due, and proper
power. Let him ordain &amp; cenſure, but with due aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtancie,
and not otherwiſe. Reaſon and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all exemplar government require this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy:
Shew me a Colledge without a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
A Citie without a Governour: A ſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Pylot: An Army without a Generall: Doe
the States thrive without an Excellency? or doth
<hi>Venice</hi> proſper without a Duke? or can you ſecure
our own Houſe in order without a Speaker?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> I have heard ſome among us ſay, if
then we muſt have a Biſhop, let him be like a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
onely for a voyage: let him be like your ſelf,
a Speaker onely for a Parliament. I anſwer, if but
ſo, yet is it better then any other way that I ſee
yet propounded to you; far better then the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
way of Commiſſioners, that ſhall begin
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:123666:75"/>
now, and end no man knows when. But <hi>Sir,</hi> I
come in againe upon my own ground, and doe
affirme that <hi>ab initio non fuit ſic;</hi> your Biſhop of
old was not occaſionall <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
degraded, nothing ſo: but continued a fixed
conſtant, perpetuall moderator and preſident for
life, unleſſe outed for his own demerits. I am for
the old way, Reaſon and Religion have allowed
it, and the conſtant practiſe of the beſt and moſt
ancient times hath honoured it.</p>
               <p>Take this alſo farther to approve it. If your
Biſhop Preſident be not conſtant, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Pietie and Learning will not be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
Let deſert in the Church have in its own
ſphaere (as deſert in the civil State hath) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
reward of Honour and of Profit. For <hi>Sir,</hi>
Honour and Profit muſt invite forth Learning
and induſtry, or you ſhall have none.</p>
               <p>Thus have you (with my imperfections) my
ſenſe upon Epiſcopall government, the firſt part
of your Bill, I paſſe in brief unto their Cathedrall
Covents, my ſecond diſtribution. <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi>
I have beene diligent and attentive to the whole
procedure of all debates of this nature, yet am
I, juſt where I ever was, nothing moved, not at all
changed, unleſſe this be a change; that by hearing
my owne ſenſe better argued for by others, then
I could doe for my ſelf, it is now deeper fortifyed

One main exception to the quite voting away
our Cathedrals, ever was and doth yet remaine
with me. That which ſticks with me is this: what
certainty, what ſecurity ſhall I have that <hi>Learning</hi>
and <hi>Religion</hi> ſhall have a perpetuall maintenance,
and a ſure reward of <hi>Honour</hi> and of <hi>Profit</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
you will ſay, that your Vote already
paſſed will ſecure me; nothing ſo: You have
indeed voted that <hi>all the Lands of the Deans and
Chapters ſhall be employed to the advancement of
Learning and Pietie.</hi> But in the mean time what
becomes of the Biſhops Lands? They are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
alſo: if you take away the preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor,
what ſhall become of the Land? we ſhall
not rifle for it; Shall we make a gift of what is
none of our own? or ſhall we cure the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
at the coſt of the Church? I heare little
ſaid in the houſe, I hear too much in private.</p>
               <p>But I proceed. This Vote (I ſay) doth not
ſecure mee: It is too generall. My reaſon why I
am not herewith ſatisfied is this, becauſe for
ought this Vote expreſſeth, you may give all the
Land to any one uſe onely, and performe your
Vote; as for inſtance, if all the wealth of Deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
be diſtributed among the Pariſh Miniſters
onely, your Vote is fulfilled; But all the <hi>Learning</hi>
and the <hi>Pietie,</hi> that we are bound to take care of,
is not thereby provided for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:123666:76"/>
This (I ſay) doth therefore ſtick with me, and
notwithſtanding your generall Vote ſo inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that untill I doe ſee and know, how and in
what manner the uſe and the particular diſpoſall
of this great revenue (both Epiſcopall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventuall)
ſhall be, I cannot concurre to vote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the preſent poſſeſſours thereof: No, nor the
future ſucceſſours thereunto. Our Deans and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends
as now they ſtand, or rather, as they have
of late abuſed themſelves, are both burdenſome
and ſcandalous to us, and to our Religion. Yet
I muſt looke upon their revenue, as the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and powerfull encouragement of <hi>Religion</hi>
and of <hi>Learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some would alter and amend theſe cloyſters,
others would <hi>root</hi> them out; ſome would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
their wealth, but doe not tell me whether.
Some would annexe all to the Crown, to enlarge
the royall revenue; Some reputing them incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries,
would out of their forfeited eſtates, pay
our debt of promiſe to the Scots; Some would
diſtribute all that wealth among Pariſh Miniſters
onely; Others have mixt and different deſignes.
And there want not ſome who upon all theſe
Lands doe write,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Touch not, tast not, handle not;</hi>
you know it was urged by a worthy learned Dr.<note place="margin">Dr. Hacket.</note>
at the barre,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 22.</note> that of Saint <hi>Paul, Thou that abhorrest
Idols, committest thou ſacriledge?</hi> This theame I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:123666:77"/>
ſhall decline, and whatſoever my opinion be,
whether man can give unto God a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in a peece of Land or not; yet am I fully
reſolved never to alienate any of theſe revenues,
but to mend the uſes in the way of pietie, ſo that
this ſuppoſed danger of being ſacrilegious ſhall
be certainly out of my doores.</p>
               <p>In the next place, my humble and my earneſt
deſire is, that you will maintain the Pen as well as
the Pulpit; Polemie as well as perſuaſive learning.
If our Cathedrals were rightly temper'd, wee
might hope for admirable fruit of their revenues.
Yong Students in Divinity wander for want of
manuduction. Poore Chriſtians among us want
a godly, ſober, plain and pithy engliſh Paraphraſe
upon the whole Bible. Our Nation, our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all Chriſtendome want the juſt volumns
of a large Latine Commentary. The body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
ſhould be reduced into a ſolid Catechiſme.
Every hereſie might be choked in its firſt breath.
All the Fathers might be reviſed and briefly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſed.
I cannot think of half the happineſſe
we might hope for, ſo long as the rewards of
<hi>Wiſedome</hi> are held forth to invite and encourage
Induſtry.<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Riches and honour are with me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
that knew how to invite. Take then none
of the reward away, either of <hi>Profit,</hi> or of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi>
So much reward as you abate, ſo much
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:123666:77"/>
induſtry you looſe. Who ever went unto the
<hi>Heſperides</hi> onely to fight with the Dragon? onely
for that? for victory, and for nothing elſe? No,
<hi>Sir,</hi> but there was the fruit of Gold <hi>(Profit</hi> as
well as <hi>Honour)</hi> to be gained, to be atchieved,
and for that the Dragon ſhall be fought withall.

               </p>
               <p>Let me here by way of anticipation, prevent

The Vniverſities (it will be ſaid) are amply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:123666:78"/>
Truly <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> excepting ſome of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Profeſſours there, and ſome few of the heads
of our houſes there, who hath deſcended into
this <hi>Areopagus?</hi> There is indeed good training,
good preparatory exerciſings of raw ſouldiers
there; and much valour in counterfeit skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
among them: But for perfect Polemy in letters,
you may gueſſe what our Vniverſities can yeeld,
by obſerving our trayned bands at common mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:
Your graduate in the ſchoole of warre will
tell you, that good Artillery men, though quick
at a dry muſter, and nimble with falſe fires, are
not immediately compleated into true and full
ſouldiers: So every Syllogizer is not preſently a
match to cope with <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> you ſee my heart; I move
not, I plead not for the Deans, nor for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends.
If they will not prove, if they cannot
be turned to be champions in this holy warfare;
then the rich revenue <hi>detur digniori:</hi> Let it be given
to them that will bring forth better fruit. But if
there may be had ſuch a reduction of them, ſuch
a retrenching of them, nay, ſuch a new forming
of them, that we may be alway ſure in all Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke
learning, to have ſome men of valour, <hi>to
goe in and out before us:</hi> Surely <hi>Sir,</hi> let them be ſo
reduced, ſo retrenched, ſo new formed; if not,
if this cannot bee, then let others have the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:123666:78"/>
wealth, that will doe the worke.</p>
               <p>After all this (I beſeech you) let me not bee
miſconſtrued, as if I intended an Apologie for
theſe Cathedrall ſocieties: it is neither in my wiſh
nor power. Theſe Covents are ſtill the ſame with
me they ever were: and the ſhort character of a
Cathedrall Corporation (as now it ſtands abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
is ſtill the ſame it was. A neſt of non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
An <hi>Epicurean</hi> Colledge of riot and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe.
A ſchoole for complements in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but a ſcourge upon the life and practiſe
thereof. They have been the <hi>Aſylum</hi> for ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition:
but the <hi>Scalae Gemoniae</hi> for true Piety. Of
late they have been the ſhame of our Clergy: and
are now almoſt become the ſcorne of our Laity.
Yet <hi>Sir,</hi> for all this (all this ſo bad, ſo true) I am
ſtill where I was. Though the Channell be foule
and muddy, where theſe waters (I meane their
wealth) doth run, yet I cannot wiſh it dried up;
but rather purged and cleanſed, or elſe a new
channel cut, wherein the current of all their wealth
may run on, pure and clean to the holy uſes of
<hi>Religion</hi> and of <hi>Learning. Sir,</hi> many great and
excellent uſes (all for <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Learning)</hi> may be
preſented to you: I beſeech you let us conſider
ſadly on it. For if this wealth be but once like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
powred abroad, no time, no age to come
will ever give us ſuch a ſtock againe. And thus I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:123666:79"/>
end the ſecond of my two generall heads.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all; you ſee I am for the old ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Epiſcopacie, with Presbyteries ſubjoyned
thereunto: and I am for an explicite diſpoſall of
all manner of Church revenues: your bill denies
me both. It denies me my ſtrong wiſhes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
upon me the terror of confuſion. This Bill
indeed doth ſeem to me an uncouth wilderneſſe,
a diſmall vaſtneſſe, and a ſolitude wherein to
wander, and to looſe our ſelves and our Church,
never to be found againe; me thinks we are come
to the brink of a fatall praecipice, and here wee
ſtand ready to dare one another, who ſhall firſt
leape down. And that which encreaſeth my hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and amazement to the height, is to hear men
confidently affirme, that we goe ſafe upon an
even ground, and that all this while the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not changed. Surely <hi>Sir,</hi> either my head
is giddy, or elſe I ſee in this Bill our Engliſh
Church turn round, or rather toſt upſide down.</p>
               <p>Perſwade the King to commit all his Regall
authority into nine Commiſſioners, and tell him,
that he is ſtill a Monarch. Beſide the change of
governors, doe you not give us new rules? doe
you not take away the old? and is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtill the ſame? I will inſtance in one. What
is become of the divine Ordinance of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication?
muſt there be none? there is none
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:123666:79"/>
in all your Bill. Five Lay-men ſhall require five
Miniſters to ordain: is not this new? was this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with us? nay was it ever in the world
before? Five Lay-Commiſſioners muſt judge
and pronounce in matter of hereſie: yet ſtill our
Church government is unchanged. I know not
what to ſay in ſo dull, ſo flat a cauſe. Truly <hi>Sir,</hi>
for my part I doe look upon this Bill as upon the
gaſping period of all good order: it will prove
the mother of abſolute Anarchiſme: it is with me
as the paſſing bell to toll on the funerall of our
Religion, which when it goes will leave this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
ſhreek behind.</p>

if it muſt paſſe, I doe moſt humbly pray, and doe
earneſtly beſeech this Honourable Houſe to
grant me this favour, that I may be admitted to
my Proteſtation againſt this Bill, and ſo recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And (although ſome worthy members of
this Houſe are troubled, as they have cauſe, to
have their names ſet on a poaſt) yet it is my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
that I may as negative to this bill, be poaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:123666:80"/>
To conclude all: ſo great a varietie of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
ſo totall a mutation, of ſo vaſt and ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
a conſequence: it doth amaze me and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
me ſo, that although I muſt ſay <hi>No</hi> to your
Bill, yet I hardly know with what motion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.
But thus I adventure.</p>
               <p>Let the intent and ſcope of Reformation be
divided into two Bills.</p>
               <p>Let the ſubject of the firſt be Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Let the ſubject of the ſecond be the diſpoſall
of Church revenues.</p>
               <p>Let both theſe bills goe <hi>pari paſſu,</hi> hand in
hand together.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I cannot ſo well by word of
mouth and memory preſent them, I doe humbly
beg leave either to read unto you ſuch heads, for
the firſt of theſe bills, as I conceive will well ſtand
both with our Religion, and with the preſent
Lawes of the Commonwealth: Or elſe that you
will pleaſe to take in a new Bill ready formed to
that ſenſe, and I doubt not, but you will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>THus have you a faithfull &amp; a clear expoſure
of my ſelf in matter of Religion, both in what
I have ſaid, and what I wiſh may be done. Let the
candid and ingenuous Reader judge me. Such of
the Prelaticke party as are in love with preſent
pomp and power will be averſe unto me, becauſe
I pare ſo deep: The <hi>Rooters,</hi> the Antiprelaticke
party declaim againſt me, becauſe I will not take
all away. At laſt Midſummer a new Moon did
take theſe men, I did begin to find a different
greeting, a change of ſalutation. Some expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
others condemne: ſome adviſe: others
would ſeeme to condole: all upon occaſion of my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:123666:84"/>
ſpeech 21. <hi>June;</hi> although I find not there (or in
any thing elſe that I have ſaid) any cauſe to make
me the object either of <hi>their</hi> anger, <hi>their</hi> councell,
or <hi>their</hi> pitty.</p>
               <p>The plain truth (as I touched before) is that
immediately upon my approach unto this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſome circumſtances did concurre to leade
my language on upon the Archbiſhop, not any
perſonall paſſages (God and my ſoul doe witneſſe
for me, I have not ſuch a temper) But being ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for that Shire, and in that Dioceſſe where ſome
of his hardſhip then freſh and new was brought
by complaint unto me; The accident of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that complaint did beget me almoſt as many
new friends as he had old enemies: and I know
not what miſconception did thereupon (untruly)
entitle me an enemy to the very function of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie.
I never gave my name in to take away
both <hi>root and branch.</hi> I love not the ſound of a
curſe ſo well. If by the <hi>Rooters</hi> I have been ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
their credulity is not my crime. And their

               <p>Before this Parliament was convened, you
would have joyed upon that day, when the ſting
of ill executed Epiſcopie (the high Commiſſion)
had been taken away; and (the peſt of the chair)
ſoleſhip of power retrenched. One is done, and
both had been effected, if you and ſuch as you had
not overheated a furnace that was burning hot
before; and with preſſing for <hi>Ruine</hi> have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And you that might have had enough, doe ſtill
cry more, more. The greedy Vulture of an inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

it is in your eſteem too faint, too cold a work, it is
