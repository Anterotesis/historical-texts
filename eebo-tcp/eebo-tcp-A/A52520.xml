            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

given order for any to print it, he took upon him to
print it of his own accord, contrary to my conſent or
knowledge, and placed it in Books and Papers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his pleaſure, for his own private advantage, by
which means I have ſuffered ſome prejudice, and have
been cenſured by ſome as if I were guilty of that,
which indeed is <hi>deteſtable</hi> to me. This I thought

            <head>Londons Plague-ſore, diſcovered.</head>
            <l>AS I of late, about the Streets do go,</l>
            <l>I often hear Complainings to and fro:</l>
            <l>In ev'ry corner, more or leſs I hear,</l>
            <l>And many people much ſurpriz'd with fear;</l>
            <l>And ſtill by obſervation I do find,</l>
            <l>That Cares and Fears do grow in peoples mind;</l>
            <l>And Diſcontents, do almoſt ev'ry where,</l>
            <l>Seem to abound within this City here:</l>
            <l>But what's the Cauſe? or, wherefore is it ſo,</l>
            <l>That ſuch Diſtractions more, and more ſhould grow,</l>
            <l>Amongſt a People, which of late did glory,</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Gallant Times,</hi> beyond the reach of Story;</l>
            <l>For Wealth and Strength they had ſo great a ſhare,</l>
            <l>They ſcorn'd that any ſhould with them compare.</l>
            <l>What is the Reaſon ſuch a lofty City,</l>
            <l>Should now be willing to accept of pity?</l>
            <l>Why ſeveral things are urg'd. I pray name one.</l>
            <l>Alas! that's eaſie, Trading's almoſt gone</l>
            <l>Quite out o'th City, whither ſhall we run?</l>
            <l>The Cry o'th Poor is, <hi>We ſhall be undone!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For why already Trading's grown ſo dead,</l>
            <l>Our preſent Gains will hardly yeeld us Bread:</l>
            <l>Our Cares are doubled, and our Hopes are vain;</l>
            <l>Say what you will, here's reaſon to complain:</l>
            <l>And this doth greatly add unto our ſorrow,</l>
            <l>We fear each day, it will be worſe to morrow.</l>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100101:3"/>
            <l>And yet the Great Ones do oppreſs the Poor:</l>
            <l>Such times as theſe we never ſaw before.</l>
            <l>Nay, more than this, the worſt is yet to come,</l>
            <l>We have not yet told all, nor hardly ſome;</l>
            <l>There's ſomething elſe, that loads our hearts to think,</l>
            <l>What Dreadful Cup is fill'd for us to drink!</l>
            <l>Alas, the Plague, the <hi>Peſtilential Plague,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which lately made ſuch havock near the <hi>Hague,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hath croſt the Seas, and found our City out,</l>
            <l>And put our greateſt Champions to the rout.</l>
            <l>Our braveſt Gallants which did ſwagger moſt,</l>
            <l>And with their daring tongues would proudly boaſt</l>
            <l>Of Courage, Valour, Strength and Noble-Blood,</l>
            <l>As if they ſcorn'd to have their wills withſtood,</l>
            <l>Yet when the Lord did with a challenge greet them,</l>
            <l>And ſent them word, <hi>He did intend to meet them,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To ſee if they againſt him would prepare,</l>
            <l>How this ſtrange Meſſage did their Worſhips ſcare!</l>
            <l>O how did this perplex and ſore affright</l>
            <l>Their lofty minds, and made them take their flight,</l>
            <l>And run away from God's appointed place,</l>
            <l>As if they fear'd even to ſee his face.</l>
            <l>For when his <hi>angry Angel</hi> did approach,</l>
            <l>To flee, they ſtrait provide both <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Coach.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then learn this leſſon from it you that can,</l>
            <l>'Tis vain to truſt in any mortal man,</l>

            </l>
            <l>That he long time unto thy ſoul did give,</l>
            <l>That ſo thou mightſt repent, return and live.</l>
            <l>Haſt thou not much deſpis'd his profered Grace?</l>
            <l>Haſt thou not ſpitted in the glorious face</l>
            <l>Of bleſſed Jeſus, when in love he came</l>
            <l>To waſh thee from thy filthineſs and ſhame?</l>
            <l>Haſt thou not <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> greatly ſlighted,</l>
            <l>His <hi>holy Spirit</hi> alſo much deſpighted?</l>
            <l>Haſt thou not <hi>Patience,</hi> alſo, much abus'd,</l>
            <l>And God's dear Servants wofully miſus'd?</l>
            <l>In fine, the Goſpel thou haſt caſt behind thee,</l>
            <l>And ſuffered Satan to bewitch and blind thee;</l>
            <l>And thoſe that were thy beſt and trueſt Friends,</l>
            <l>How haſt thou ſought to bring them to their ends.</l>
            <l>Examine well, and thou maiſt find it ſo;</l>
            <l>Sin is the cauſe of this thy preſent WO,</l>
            <l>And therefore now, while it is call'd, <hi>to day</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Repent, and turn to God without delay:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Break off thy Sins;</hi> Let Righteouſneſs take place,</l>
            <l>It may be yet thou mayſt partake of Grace;</l>
            <l>But if thou ſtill retain thy ſtubborn heart,</l>
            <l>Thou maiſt expect to feel a greater ſmart,</l>
            <l>And this already thou mayſt plainly ſee</l>
            <l>The Bloody <hi>Sword</hi> doth alſo threaten thee,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Famine</hi> ſeems to ſtare thee in the face,</l>
            <l>Impenitence may bring it on apace.</l>
            <l>Then look in time, before it be too late,</l>
            <l>Leſt greater Judgment fall upon thy pate.</l>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100101:4"/>
            <l>Now therefore hark, ye Gallants of the time,</l>
            <l>You that have counted <hi>Godlineſs</hi> a Crime,</l>
            <l>What do you think, or where do y' mean to ſtay,</l>
            <l>That you from <hi>London</hi> make ſuch haſt away?</l>
            <l>Here this from me; If that you take along</l>
            <l>Your Sins with you, you do your ſelves but wrong</l>
            <l>To flee away, for you had better be</l>
            <l>Puniſh'd at firſt, than to go longer free:</l>
            <l>For, don't you know, the longer you provoke</l>
            <l>The Righteous God, the greater is his Stroke;</l>
            <l>Therefore obſerve, the beſt and ſureſt way</l>
            <l>For to eſcape the danger of the Day,</l>
            <l>Is to Repent, and <hi>ſet the Oppreſſed free,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And then perhaps, God may entreated be.</l>
            <l>But if i'th <hi>Country</hi> you in ſin delight,</l>
            <l>And God's <hi>Forbearance</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> ſlight,</l>
            <l>He in the Country will go ſearch about,</l>
            <l>And never leave until he find you out,</l>
            <l>And when the <hi>Angel</hi> takes his Journey thither,</l>
            <l>And findeth you, and all your ſins together,</l>
            <l>The fearful dreggs of this <hi>deſtroying Cup</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Shall be your portion, you muſt drink them up.</l>
            <l>Hence be exhorted, then, to <hi>kiſs the Son,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Make peace with him before your Glaſs be run,</l>
            <l>And then in Life or Death you will be His,</l>
            <l>And your Reward ſhall be ETERNAL BLISS.</l>
