            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HIM, that ſhall think fit to anſwer this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, M. <hi>Condom</hi> deſires, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. to conſider, that to accompliſh his intent,</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> He muſt not undertake to refute the Doctrine contained in it, it not being his deſign to prove, but only to propoſe it in this Book.</q> But I hope if in perſuing the deſign of his Book, in ſome places I obſerve the falſhood or danger of ſome of theſe Doctrins, or the inſufficience of his Reaſons given to eſtabliſh them, it may be allowed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they are but ſuch hints as are as neceſſary for the ſubverting the Deſign of the Treatiſe, as his Reaſons given to eſtabliſh the Doctrine are for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> That it would be a quitting the deſign of this Treatiſe to examine the different Methods, which <hi>Catholick</hi> Divines have uſed to explicate the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the different conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which particular Doctors have drawn from it. But with his leave, if himſelf be no other</q> than a Particular Doctor, (for we can allow him to be no more as yet, till thoſe Approbations collected in the Advertiſement from ſeveral of the moſt principal Divines and others in the Church, and at laſt from
<pb facs="tcp:94907:3"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, which are pleaded for his greater authority, come to be conſidered) it can be no quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deſign of his Book (if any part of it be the Expoſition of the Doctrine of that Council) to take notice, if there be occaſion, of any different Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which others have given of it. For though their Explication being different, does not prove his not to be contained in it; yet firſt it aſſures us, that the words which are uſed by the Council to expreſs its Doctrine are ambiguous, ſince different explications pretend equally to be explications of the Council. And thereby <hi>2ly.</hi> we are left uncertain in what ſenſe the Church holds the Doctrine; which we have no reaſon to take from him, unleſs upon examination it ſhall hereafter appear, that he has a greater authority to declare the ſenſe held by the Church, than the other had.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> That to urge any thing ſolid againſt this Book, and which may come home to the Point, it muſt be proved, That the Churches Faith is not here faithfully expounded, and that by Acts which the Church has obliged her ſelf to rceeive. This laſt clauſe may either</q> plead for my proving, that he himſelf has not expounded it faithfully by ſuch Acts; or that my proof of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Expoſition muſt in all things be made out by ſuch Acts. In the former caſe I ſhall hold my ſelf obliged when I oppoſe him to do it from thoſe Acts produced by himſelf, or others as much owned by the Church. In the latter, preſumptive proofs, that conclude with greater probability for the falſhood, than his for the truth of his Expoſition, are the utmoſt that ought to be required; there being no reaſon, that he ſhould oblige me to proofs of another nature than what he brings himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Or elſe, <hi>4ly.</hi> That it muſt be ſhewn, that this Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leaves all the Objections in their full force, and all the Diſputes untouched. Herein I ſhall be eſpecially</q> careful, ſince he has expreſly obliged me to it, to conſider what Objections are in force, and what Diſputes remain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94907:3"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>5ly.</hi> Or in fine, It muſt be preciſely ſhewn in what this Doctrine ſubverts the foundations of Faith.</q> Of this likewiſe I ſhall be careful, but ſuppoſe in ſome caſes it appear, that in all probability, though not preciſely, it ſubverts the Faith; certainly a Church that ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the preſervation, cannot juſtifie her ſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding things that in every mans judgment tend to the deſtruction of the Faith: and if it appear, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine does, and experience teſtifie it has, greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced the foundations of Faith; ſhall the whole world be obliged to forbear providing for their common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, till all its Foundations be totally overthrown?</p>
            <p>The Author, though he ſeems to acquaint us with his deſign, yet has not poſitively expreſs'd the end he aims at: but ſo far as I can dive into it, it is this. <hi>1st.</hi> To take off that falſe <hi>Idea</hi> which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have framed to themſelves, of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſuch he takes notice they have, <hi>p.</hi> 1. upon which he thinks it benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to explicate to them what the Church has defined in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council upon the main Points in controverſie. And thereby, <hi>2ly.</hi> to gain a good opinion in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Churches innocence. <hi>3ly.</hi> By this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Doctrine to ſhew that the main Diſputes are not ſo material as they have been thought, and that many of them are at an end. <hi>4ly.</hi> That the Matters from which the firſt grounds of Separation were taken, by this Explication being cleared, and appearing not ſo ill as they have been judged, they are no longer juſtifiable Cauſes of a Separation, whereby we are concluded under a neceſſity of joining with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe he intimates as his aim, when he tells us, he had obſerved many had a falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of their Church, whereupon he took a reſolution to explicate their Doctrine, <hi>p.</hi> 1. The third and fourth are implied in the two effects propoſed to himſelf from this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p.</hi> 2. The concluſion, that our diſtance is no longer juſtifiable, is not poſitively inferred by M. <hi>Condom:</hi> But
<pb facs="tcp:94907:4"/>
the Advertiſement as it ſometimes calls for the Removal of our falſe Conceptions, ſometimes for a better opinion of the Church, ſometimes challenges that an end is put to the main Diſputes, does alſo in this clearly diſcover it ſelf and tell us, <q>That we may hereupon be juſtly afraid <note place="margin">Ado. p. 9.</note> to perſiſt in a Schiſm, which is manifeſtly founded upon falſe Principles even in the moſt principal Points.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now no man will oppoſe the firſt intent, it being moſt juſt, that every man be willing to lay aſide his falſe or prejudicate Opinions. Nor the ſecond for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, any further, than to prevent the <hi>ſwallow</hi> of their Errors with this bait. What I intend is to evidence, that there are Matters of that weight in controverſie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the pretence of this Book to have diſcuſſed and anſwered the moſt material; as will abundantly juſtifie the Reformed in their diſtance from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which is more, conclude them under a neceſſity of maintaining that diſtance, as things now ſtand.</p>

            <head>THE ADVERTISEMENT TO THE Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book Conſidered.</head>
            <p>
               <q>THE Advertiſement begins with a Suppoſition, which it thinks we muſt neceſſarily allow; That M. <hi>Condom</hi> has faithfully expounded the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Treatiſe, from his beng a Biſhop in the Church; whoſe Underſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Sincerity ought not to be ſuſpected; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, from his being called to be <hi>Praeceptor</hi> to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> Son to ſo great a King, and Defender of the <hi>Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> But yet he tells us, Though the ſincerer part of the Reformed acknowledged it would take away great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties if approved and owned for their Doctrine; yet they would never believe it ſuch, or that it would be approved at <hi>Rome,</hi> being prepoſſeſſed with Prejudice and falſe Opinion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But without reflecting either upon the Biſhop's Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Sincerity, we have a great deal of reaſon to expect he ſhew us an Authority that warrants him to give us this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and declare it to us as the faithful and true Senſe, and only Doctrine of the Church; ſince the Pope hath peremptorily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <note place="margin">Bulla <hi>Pii</hi> quarti ſuper Confirm. <hi>Concil. Trid.</hi>
               </note> all Prelates of whatever Order, Condition or Degree, to ſet forth any Expoſition of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trent-</hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, reſerving it to the <hi>Apoſtolical See:</hi> Setting then his Authority as queſtionable for the preſent, aſide, I am no more convinced by the Nature of the Expoſition, that it is the genuine Senſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all points, than thoſe who firſt ſaw the Book: Whether it be Prejudice or Prepoſſeſſion, that blinds my Underſtanding, will not appear till after the Diſcuſſion of Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94907:5"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. He tells us of two Anſwers to this Treatiſe, and that both of them agreed in queſtioning M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to expound the Council, and that his Expoſition agrees not with the Deciſions of the Council, nor with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith. Concerning theſe things I ſhall determine</q> nothing till I come to the Particulars.</p>
            <p>But whereas he ſaies, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. <q>That one of them has drawn a wrong Concluſion from thoſe Softnings of M. <hi>Condom,</hi> to confirm themſelves in a better Opinion of the Reformation. I</q> do not think the Inference altogether ſo abſure as the Advertizer pretends it; for do not they in a great meaſure juſtifie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, who call for the Reformation of thoſe Abuſes which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> herſelf pretends to condemn, but will not, or has not rectified?</p>
            <p>The next Thing it endeavors is to prove, <hi>p</hi> 4. <q>That this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s is the true Senſe of the Church; which is grounded, firſt, upon the general Approbation his Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived throughout the whole Church, teſtified by Lerters from all ſorts of People, not in <hi>France</hi> only, but at <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Eight Letters concerning it from Cardinals, and others of great Merit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, taking it for granted, without any further Examination, That all theſe Men, by their Approbations of this Book, do conſent that this Expoſition is the true Senſe of the Church, (which is more than need be granted, ſince ſome only ſay it is a Method very ingenious and good to force the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the (atholick Faith) yet this will not ſuffice, where there are ſo many Writers of as great Authority and Eminence in the Church, as any of theſe, that have, though not perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to expound the <hi>Council,</hi> as this Author; yet to declare and defend a Doctrine much different from this, from the ſame <hi>Council,</hi> and in behalf of the ſame <hi>Church:</hi> And ſuppoſe the Number that approved it, great, yet Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi>'s Letter informs us, that ſome found fault with it; and thoſe he muſt mean, of their own Church, when he gives this Reaſon that he does not wonder at it; <hi>Becauſe all Works great, and above the common Level, find Perſons ſtill to contradict them.</hi> And be the Number what it will, I ſuppoſe he will not, as it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſeek for the Churches Doctrine by counting Noſes.</p>
            <p>Then for the Letter of Cardinal <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> which ſays <q>the Advertizer, ſhews how ill grounded that Scruple is againſt this Expoſition from the Pope's Prohibition to explicate the Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94907:5"/>
To me it rather ſhews how well it is grounded; for his Words are, <q>Certainly it was never his intention to give the interpretation of the Tenets of the Council, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them in his Book rightly explicated, in ſuch ſort that Hereticks may be convinced; and eſpecially in thoſe things which the holy Church obliges them to believe. Which, if</q> it ſignifie any thing, muſt be, That his Expoſition is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Council, obliging any to believe it as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, but a Deſign of explicating it in ſuch ſort as he judged uſeful for convincing Hereticks.</p>
            <p>But if this will not content, we have an Approbation from the Pope himſelf; after which, 'twas needleſs to mention others, ſays the Advertizer; and let me add, without which his others ſignifie little to his Point. The Gentleman calls it <q>a <hi>Breve,</hi> wherein the Pope gives his Approbation, and that ſo expreſs, as to leave no further doubt, and in the moſt authentick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that could be expected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have conſidered it, and yet my Doubt is not vaniſhed; and when the leaſt that could have been expected in reaſon, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difficulty of believing it, expreſs'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed five or ſix years before the Date of this <hi>Breve</hi> from the Pope; as alſo from the Nature of the thing, which being an expoſition of Faith, ought to be ſo received by all, that not one man hold Tenets different from it; as alſo from the former Pope's Prohibition of all Explication of this Council, is that the Pope ſhould have declared, that this Expoſition did perfectly contain the true and whole Faith of the Church in the Points expounded, and that it ſhould be lookt upon as authentick as if made by the Apoſtolick See it ſelf: We may have that Charity for the Advertizer, as to think its his good deſire to have it made authentick, that makes him look upon it as ſuch, and ſuppreſſes all his Doubts: But we who deſire no leſs than he, that it were ſo, have yet ſome peculiar Reaſons to ſee to our ſelves that we are not impoſed on, and therefore to examine what Authority this Approbation gives it.</p>
            <p>All which the Pope here ſaies to approve it, is no more than this; <q>That it contains ſuch Doctrine, and is compoſed in ſuch a Method, and with ſo much Prudence, that it is thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred proper to inſtruct, and to extort even from the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a Confeſſion of the Catholick Faith; but he does not in</q> all this ſay, that it is the true and only Senſe of the Council. And further, <q>That for theſe Reaſons he does not only think it worthy his Commendation, but to be read and eſteemed by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94907:6"/>
all. He does not ſay nor mean <hi>eſteemed</hi> for the only Senſe of</q> the Council; as is plain by the <hi>Latine</hi> Copy. And further, <q>We hope this Work by the Grace of God will bring forth much Fruit, and will not a little help to propagate the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In all which, he neither declares it for the Senſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, nor confirms it as ſuch, nor does any thing to make it au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick; if that be to authorize it as a Truth, throughout the whole Church; which yet is the leaſt that could be lookt for in this Caſe, for the Reaſons given. The utmoſt therefore that can be made of it, is only, that it has the commendation of his private Judgment for a prudent, uſeful, good Book, likely to work no ſmall Effects for the propagation of the Catholick Faith: So that this will be no great prejudice to any Proofs that ſhall be made againſt M. <hi>Condom,</hi> where I may attempt, in oppoſition to him, to ſhew, that he has not fully given the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Church.</p>
            <p>But the Advertizer raiſing himſelf on this Foundation, that <q>this Expoſition is as true and as authentick as he pretends it, and laying on this Preſumption further, that it has moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſerved the Ends it aims at; inſults over the Reformed</q> as if the Day was clearly gained; boaſting the pretended Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not over the Anſwerers only, but all Reformers.</p>
            <p>What particular Advantages he pretends over the Anſwerers, I meddle not with (wanting both opportunity to procure, and capacity to underſtand their Books, if <hi>French)</hi> nor will I be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to concern my ſelf with any pretended to be gotten over any Numbers of the Reformed, either for their falſe Opinions, Doctrines or Conceſſions, in any Caſes, but where the like may ſeem pretended from like Doctrines or Conceſſions of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether he has ſuch real Cauſe to Boaſt, will not appear till the End: But what of his is added to back M. <hi>Condom,</hi> ſhall be conſidered under their particular Heads in the Expoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. He goes on to vindicate M. <hi>Condom.</hi> Firſt, That <q>he has done well to propoſe the true Tenets of the Council, and their Church, and diſtinguiſh them from thoſe that are falſly imputed to her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No body will blame his Aim in this; God forbid that any ſhould refuſe to hear what may inform them, and remove their Prejudices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <q>That he has done but juſt in taking the Doctrine of the Church from the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Nor will any</q>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94907:6"/>
blame him for this, or require him to juſtifie the Council from the great ſuſpitions that are juſtly had of it, for be the Council what it will, it's ſufficient for the Expoſition, that the Doctrine of it is univerſally received throughout their Church. Nor ſhall Father <hi>Pont</hi>'s Hiſtory, becauſe he here is ſaid to be a profeſs'd enemy to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> either prejudice me againſt its Doctrines, or make me call its Deciſions ambiguous, without apparent grounds for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <q>That his choice was not amiſs in pitching upon thoſe Points from which the ſubject of the Reformation was taken. But however, if new Matters have been added by</q> themſelves ſince, which make the diſtance wider, thoſe may well be added as Obſtacles to a preſent Union: and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the Biſhops ſincerity, or accuſing him to have on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe left out the greateſt difficulties, it may be allowed me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others ſo far as they are material to ſhew that ſome great Objections are yet in force, and many great Diſputes untouched. But whether he has been ſo faithful to his promiſe, as to affirm no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make the Council better underſtood, which is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of in the Church, and manifeſtly conformable to it, will appear when the particulars are examined.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more that will greatly affect me as well as the other Anſwers, againſt whom it's urged, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <q>That it's to no purpoſe to object againſt this Expoſition, the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, for that the deſign of this Book (ſays the Advertiſer) has nothing of thoſe Gloſſes and Commentaries, which with great reaſon that <hi>Pope</hi> condemned; ſome of which uſually fill'd the Margins with their own Imaginations, and gave them for the Text it ſelf, and ſuch, for the conſervation of Unity, the <hi>Pope</hi> was obliged not to permit, nothing of which nature is in this Expoſition. But he need not have taken all this pains, if</q> himſelf durſt have relied on his former proof of its authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet to make this of any ſtrength, to back what he had ſaid before, he ſhould have told us by what authority he declares what ſort of Comments and Gloſſes the <hi>Pope</hi> forbids in that Bull, or the Reaſons upon which he did it: Let this be one reaſon; yet what ſhall hinder but Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s may be another, that it was to withſtand the checks which the Council might be ſaid to give to the Papal power, and diſable all from uſing it to the prejudice of the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> To believe which we have greater grounds than Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s bare aſſertion: but much leſs to believe the Advertiſer, ſince the Bull in expreſs words forbids, not only ſuch <q>Interpretations, as Comments and Gloſſes, but all Annotations,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94907:7"/>
                  <hi>Scholia's,</hi> and every kind of interpretation whatſoever: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing likewiſe all ſuch as any ſhould attempt to make witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ignorantly with or by whatſoever authority void and null.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas in the concluſion, <hi>p.</hi> 24. he ſays, <q>That ſuppoſe we call for the Reformation of Abuſes, it is one way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them to ſhew the Truth in purity, not excluding other means. I ſhall here take occaſion to remember out of</q> M. <hi>Verone,</hi> in his Epitome of his Methods, (part of whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod M. <hi>Condom</hi> exactly follows) how little we can propoſe to our ſelves from theſe fair pretences of repreſenting the truth in purity towards this effect: which will alſo ſhew in part upon what grounds this Doctrine of the Expoſition may find that approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it has amongſt them, and yet be far from being ſo truly and univerſally received, as is pretended. This M. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none</hi> is moſt eminent for the uſe of this Method, to ſeparate the Decrees of the Council from the Opinions of all particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever, and the Doctrine he would perſwade as the Churches ſenſe ſeems in all things as moderate as this of M. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> He ſays, they do no further honor Images than as they uſe outward reſpect to the Bible and other ſacred Utenſils, and ſpeaks of Tranſubſtantiation, Merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much after the ſame moderation, and will not have the Infallibility of the <hi>Pope</hi> to be matter of the Catholick Faith. And yet this Perſon, though he <note place="margin">Verone's Epit. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

He tells us likewiſe in the Chapter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Calumniae <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lutae,</hi> That ſome, not of the unlearned only, but learned too, had clancularly aſperſed him, as if he had ſaid it was not matter of Faith, That the Church could not err; That ſhe was not the ſupream and only Judge; That the <hi>Pope</hi> was not Head of the Church; That he ſought the union of Religion by remitting part of the Faith. The cry of this was ſo great, that he tells us he ſet forth a publick <hi>Programma</hi> in his own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he declares his aſſent to thoſe things which he was ſuppoſed to have denied, and ſays they are <hi>Veritates Fidei,</hi> Truths belonging to the Faith, though not defined by the Council <hi>Ipſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimis terminis:</hi> and that he did not intend by any of his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions any ſuch diminution of their Faith, as his accuſers miſtook him to intend, but only uſed this as a neceſſary method to reduce ſuch as were gon aſtray. He often taxes them to ſhew wherein he had expreſly impugned thoſe Truths which they thought him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94907:7"/>
to have betray'd, and tells them their overſight lay in this, that when he ſaid ſuch and ſuch Truths were not <hi>de fide Catholica,</hi> they miſtook him, as though he had denied them to be neceſſary Truths, which he denies himſelf to have the leaſt implied, and declares his own belief of the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility; adding withal, that the Explication which he had given of himſelf, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he would have underſtood with reſpect to all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he had handled, as Tranſubſtantiation, Merits, Images, Adoration of the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This he look'd upon, he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 315. as the moſt expedient Method to propoſe only thoſe Doctrines which the Council expreſly commanded to be held, and paſs the reſt in ſilence, when they expect to win Runnagates to the Faith, whom if they can bring firſt to the admiſſion of this, there will be opportunity gained to prevail with them in the reſt.</p>
            <p>I will not take the advantage given me by this mans fraud, to accuſe M. <hi>Condom</hi> of the like; but only infer in part from hence, that the Doctrine of this Expoſition, which differs not from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>'s, has been look'd on with a jealous eye among themſelves, whatever approbation it may have now; and again, that the Gentlemen have no reaſon to be angry, ſince themſelves have made the detection, if we fear to ſwallow abait that may conceal a hook.</p>
            <p>What was done to remedy thoſe Abuſes, which were in vain complained of, will be better juſtifiable, after examination of the particulars, when we ſhall be capable to conſider on whom the Schiſm and the miſeries conſequent upon it may be moſt juſtly charged.</p>
            <p>I thank the Advertiſer, that he forbears reproaches, though he ſays he could find ground enough for them in abuſes that are among us; for which, although I hope he could find but few, yet I ſhall hold my ſelf indebted to him the forbearance of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, and the ſilence of thoſe Abuſes which ſhall any way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be diſallowed by their Church.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe beg of God that they may read without bitterneſs, and may that God from whom alone is all ſucceſs, who knows the progreſs of Error, and its increaſe, through mens making his Religion ſubſervient to their own ambition, intreſts, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies, ſo effectually touch the hearts of all, that all parties may act and with their utmoſt ſtrength endeavour all which true ſincere Piety and a zeal for God and his glory, free from all other ends and intreſts, does oblige them to for healing the Wounds of his afflicted Church.</p>

               <p>AS to this firſt Section, wherein he mentions his Deſign, having conſidered it in part already, I have little more to add. I confeſs it very expedient to conſider the Grounds of the firſt Separation, and the neceſſity of a Right Explication of their Churches Tenents and that theſe ought to be taken from the publick Acts of the Church, and not from particular Doctors, for the reaſon quoted out of M. <hi>Daille,</hi> That the ſentiments of particular perſons ought not to be imputed to the whole body: only here is one thing wanting which we deſire might be declared, that all Tenents of particular Doctors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any of this which ſhall be delivered as the ſenſe of the Church, are falſe and diſowned by it: for to ſay it is implied is not ſufficient, when a Church pretends to declare her ſelf to her Adverſaries, who charge her with other Doctrines maintained by her.</p>
               <p>But for what he adds from Mr. <hi>Daille,</hi> 
                  <q>That no ſeparation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94907:8"/>
ought to be but upon the account of Articles authentickly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhed to the belief and obſervance of which all perſons are obliged. I muſt here obſerve, That this Conceſſion does not</q> affect the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till it be proved, that by Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf ſhe has departed either from the true Faith, or from ſome authority to which ſhe was lawfully ſubject; not that I hold National Churches leſs obliged to preſerve the unity of the whole, than every particular member that of the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lives: but that I maintain a Church, that is not dependent upon others, can never be ſaid to have done any thing to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the unity of the Catholick Church, by reforming abuſes within her ſelf, and taking the beſt expedients to preſerve the foundations of Faith and promote good life, <hi>ſo that all</hi>

               <p>Whereas he ſays, that what he writes ſhall be approved of in the Church, and be conformable to the Doctrine of the Council; I could wiſh he had promiſed, that it ſhould be the true and only Senſe of the Council, and that it ſhould likewiſe be the whole Doctrine of the Church in the Particulars he treats of.</p>
               <p>Another thing is neceſſary for me to premiſe here, that what Advantages he may take from the Principles of ſome Reformiſts in theſe Diſputes, I think my ſelf not much concerned in, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared that I will oblige my ſelf only to the Conſequences that may be drawn from the Principles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <head>Concerning the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s embracing all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Religion.</head>
               <p>THis Section premiſeth, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes and profeſſes all the Fundamental Articles of Faith; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, thoſe in the Apoſtles Creed: which we are ſo far from denying, that we plead and challenge it, being ſure it will give us this Advantage, that they can never charge us with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor with departure from the Faith, if theſe are all the Fundamental and Principal Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But M. <hi>Condom</hi> pretends that they alſo can draw from hence great Advantages, which we ſeek to deprive them of, by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94907:9"/>
ſaying they deſtroy thoſe Articles by interpoſing others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them. Thus much is ſaid, and yet is more than need</q> be ſaid; for if we ſay only, that they have added others to them, which are not neceſſary parts of Faith, this alone is enough to bar them all Advantages which they may promiſe themſelves from holding the Fundamentals.</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Condom</hi> foreſeeing that it would be urged againſt him, that thoſe Doctrines, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath added to the Faith, do by evident conſequence deſtroy thoſe which it acknowledges as the neceſſary and fundamental Truths; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prevent us this Advantage, by objecting, <q>That M. <hi>Daille</hi> has owned in behalf of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and it is a thing in it ſelf evident, that the Conſequences of a Doctrine ought not to be attributed to a Church that formally rejects thoſe Conſequencs; which Anſwer he concludes will eaſily defend them, when they are charged with Conſequences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Truth. I likewiſe own the Maxime ſo far</q> as it is grounded upon Reaſon: but in Reaſon we ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Perſons that own ſuch Conſequences, and thoſe who do not: Which Diſtinction will enforce at leaſt thus much; that we who, being ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do evidently ſee ſuch Conſequences naturally following any of their Doctrines, can never with ſafety receive them: For though we ſhould grant thoſe Conſequences which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rejects, are not to be charged upon her; yet it were to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon this very reaſon that ſhe profeſſes not to ſee them, and ſhe were to be allowed innocent only ſo far as ſhe ſees them not. So that the ſelf ſame Reaſon that would exempt her from the Charge, would bring us deeply under it, if acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of ſuch Conſequences, we ſhould embrace the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines whence they flow; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is therefore utterly inexcuſable in enjoyning ſuch things on thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they ſee ſuch Conſequences in them as deſtroy the Faith, and is leſs excuſable in its own holding them, the greater Means and Opportunities ſhe has had to diſcern their pernicious Effects.</p>
               <p>Again, Reaſon does oblige us to diſtinguiſh between Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which are only Inferences that may be drawn by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Arguments from an Opinion, and ſuch as have a real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our Practice. An Inſtance will explain my Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Suppoſe for the preſent, the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone did by conſequence infer good Works unneceſſary; he ought not to be charged with this Conſequence who diſowns
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94907:9"/>
it, and diſowning it, ſhews that he thinks them neceſſary, and therefore does them: But if any holding this Opinion, ſhould neglect them out of a dependance on his being juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, I do not think M. <hi>Condom</hi> would account it Calumny to charge him with the Conſequence.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Reaſon M. <hi>Daille</hi> gives, upon which they refuſed not to joyn Communion with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> becauſe their Opinion <hi>has no Poyſon</hi> in it, is not ſo contemptible; for they who joyned Communion with them, joyned not in their Error, nor in any evil Practice conſequent upon it. And be Chriſt's humane Nature never ſo eſſential to Religion, yet the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Opinion did never cauſe them to deny the verity of his humane Nature, nor reach to what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, whilſt it commands the Worſhip of that which we cannot think a lawful Object for us to give it to. So that perhaps it may be a greater difficulty to defend the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this reſpect, than M. <hi>Condom</hi> is willing to believe.</p>
               <p>But this Gentleman has put us to a needleſs trouble hitherto, if he make good his further Promiſe, and ſhew by his Expoſition that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far from ruining the fundamental Articles of Faith, either directly or indirectly, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhe eſtabliſhes them after ſo ſolid and evident a manner, that no one can queſtion her right underſtanding them, without great Injuſtice: I hope he means ſuch a right underſtanding them, as that ſhe holds nothing directly or indirectly prejudicial to them; and hereupon I ſhall go on with him to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Condom</hi>'s Title of this Section is, <hi>Religious Worſhip is terminated in God alone:</hi> But if he had ſaid, <hi>it is due</hi> to God alone, it had been more conſiſtent with his firſt Article, that he is pleaſed to own for Fundamental, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But that Adoration which is due to God alone (he ſays) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches to conſiſt in believing him to be the Creator and Lord of all things, and in adhering to him with all the powers of our Soul, by Faith, Hope and Charity, as to him alone who can render us happy by the communication
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94907:10"/>
of an infinite Good, which is himſelf.</q> The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> teaches and challenges the ſame, as a Truth that indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably binds us to have recourſe in all our Neceſſities to him alone, who is the Creator and Lord of all things, to adhere to him alone with all the powers of our Soul, without dividing our Hearts to any other; to place our Hope and Confidence in him only, who is that infinite and eternal Good which alone can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us; to love him above all things who hath firſt loved us with a Love ſo far paſſing all underſtanding; out of which Love he hath created, redeemed, preſerves us, and hath provided ſuch Rewards for them that love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This interior Adoration (he ſays) has its exterior Marks, of which, the principal is Sacrifice; which cannot be offered to any but God; becauſe a Sacrifice is eſtabliſhed to make a publick Acknowledgment and a ſolemn Proteſtation of God's Sovereignty; and our abſolute Dependance. Granting but</q> this true, that this internal Adoration has ſome exterior Marks, as Sacrifice (for inſtance) which cannot be given but to God alone; it will be very difficult, in my Judgment, to prove, that Invocation, Proſtration, or any other exterior Forms of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which are commonly uſed in Religious Worſhip, are not thus peculiar to God alone. For if the Reaſon why Sacrifice is thus peculiar to him, be this, its being eſtabliſhed to make a publick Acknowledgment and ſolemn Proteſtation of God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and our abſolute Dependance; ſince he cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it thus peculiar barely from God's eſtabliſhment of it, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice being the exterior part of his Worſhip before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and doubtleſs as much his Peculiar then as after; ſo that it depends upon the Reaſon of its eſtabliſhment, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſolid, its having been uſed and determined by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole World for a publick Acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will conclude no leſs for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Signs of Adoration uſed and determined by the like uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent and practice, to expreſs the ſame Sentiment, and declare the like Dependance. For though external Actions ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as the inward Sentiments determine them; yet in all reaſon general Uſe and Cuſtom ought to determine them beyond the Sentiments of private men; and whatever that ſhall have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be given to God as Signs and Acknowledgments of the Worſhip due unto him alone, I cannot ſee how it can be lawful for any upon private Sentiments to direct to another ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially in actions of Religious Worſhip; ſince by ſo doing, they not only ſcandalize and give offence to all thoſe who have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94907:10"/>
appropriated and determined thoſe external Characters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this Acknowledgment they make to God; but do interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively alſo rob God of his Honour, whilſt they appear to men to give thoſe Expreſſions of Honour to others, which the reſt of the World have determined to this peculiar purpoſe of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Acknowledgments of that Honour which is God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Right. Nor will it avail much to ſay ſuch To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens may be and are uſed for Civil Purpoſes in the Honour of Superiors, or the like; for the only reaſon why they may be ſo, is becauſe they are ſo, and to that determined by conſent and practice, as univerſal as that which has appropriated them to Religious Worſhip, ſo that hereby Offence is neither given nor taken, becauſe all conſent; neither can it interpretatively tend to the diminution of God's Honour, becauſe all men know them to expreſs a different intent; which cannot be ſo diſtinctly known when they are uſed in the way of Religious Worſhip, of which God only is by the whole World look'd on as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Condom</hi> goes on, ſaying, <q>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches us, that all Religious Worſhip ought to terminate in God as its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary end. But we ſay, it ought to be given only to him as</q> its neceſſary and immediate object, and upon this point moves the principal difficulty.</p>
               <p>Again, (he ſays,) <q>That if the Honour which he renders to the bleſſed Virgin and to the Saints may in ſome ſenſe be called Religious, it is for its neceſſary relation to God. But we ſay,</q> if in any ſenſe it be Religious, That they have choſen a wrong object, and that the Honour of the Virgin and the Saints has no ſuch neceſſary relation to God's Honour as can oblige us to give them any Religious Worſhip: That therefore, if they have made the Honour of theſe neceſſary to God's Honour, it is without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that likewiſe, if in their own intentions they direct the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to theſe to terminate in God as its neceſſary end, it is not enough to juſtifie them, that they intend and direct that to him which he has not required, eſpecially if this has or may tend to the diminution of that which he does require.</p>
               <p>But, in our way to the particulars, we meet an obſervation which M. <hi>Condom</hi> makes, as very uſeful for his purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That thoſe of the Reformation (oblig'd by the ſtrength of truth) begin to acknowledg, that the cuſtom of Praying to Saints, and Honouring their Relicks, was eſtabliſhed even in the Fourth Age of the Church. That it was eſtabliſhed, is more than any</q> acknowledg that I know of; that ſomething of this nature was in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94907:11"/>
uſe at that time has been ever acknowledged: But if he (obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the ſtrength of truth) will acknowledg it not to have been in uſe before, we ſhall not envy him the beſt advantages he can make of it. <q>M. <hi>Daille</hi> (ſays he) grants thus much in his Book againſt the Tradition of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Religious Worſhip, and accuſes St. <hi>Baſil, Ambroſe, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtin,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Nazianzen</hi> of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving altered in this point the Doctrine of the foregoing Ages.</q> He cannot expect that we ſhould judg of M. <hi>Daille</hi>'s accuſations of theſe famous Men, unleſs he had produced the particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I preſume M. <hi>Daille</hi> has vindicated himſelf. But it would be a great wonder to me, if any Man that has read that Learned Word of M. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould not be convinced, that no ſuch cuſtom, nor any thing like it, was eſtabliſhed in the Three firſt Ages of the Church, which he proves by Arguments inſoluble. Firſt from their conſtant Univerſal Declaration, that God alone is to be Worſhipped and Adored, which he evidences by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as remarkable as any the Church affords, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> (in which cauſe the whole Church was engaged) that Adoration is peculiar to God alone, whereby he proved that Chriſt is God, becauſe otherwiſe he could not be Worſhipped as he has always been of the Chriſtian World, <hi>Lib. 1. cap.</hi> 2. from a conceſſion as Univerſal, that no Created Being is to be Worſhipped or Adored, particularly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced from the remarkable Diſputations of <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> c. 4. from the imputation of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> charged on Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the Heathen for rejecting their multitude of Deities, which they never vindicated but by this anſwer, <hi>That they Worſhipped the true and only God,</hi> cap. 12. for that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were moſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of Images, and the Adoration of any but one God, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſound to have objected againſt the Chriſtians the Worſhip of any ſuch, or of any other but one God (the Caſe of the Trinity excepted,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when he tells us, M. <hi>Daille</hi> does at laſt grant its being in uſe in the fourth Age, he ſhould have told told us likewiſe what more is proved in the ſame place, <hi>cap.</hi> 17. how its ſhewn to have found a conſtant oppoſition in thoſe beginnings and e're ſince, aſcending from the times of <hi>Luther</hi> up to that Age: ſometimes before him by the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the Year 1512. by the <hi>Taborites</hi> the ſame ſort of People, <hi>Anno</hi> 1430. by <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and his Followers in <hi>England,</hi> 1372. That Images were oppoſed by <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> and ſeveral other Emperors, with the conſent of all the Eaſtern Churches, in the eighth Century; and in the ſixth by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94907:11"/>
                  <hi>Severus,</hi> whoſe Fact in breaking Images though <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did not approve, yet he conſented in this, that by all means we were to avoid the Worſhip of them. That in the beginning of the fifth Age, not only Images were oppoſed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but the Worſhip of the Dead by his ſharp reproof of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> Women that offered Cakes to the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> That even in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf it appears that the Honour then in uſe, at leaſt by the Churches approbation, was quite different from what is now pretended, who ſays of the Saints, <hi>Honorandi propter imitationem, non adorandi propter Religionem.</hi> This I have taken liberty to tranſcribe, that we may know the reaſon upon which M. <hi>Daille</hi> grants its growing into uſe in the fourth Age, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges it to evidence by this oppoſition which he ſhews it to have found in its firſt beginning and all ſucceeding times, that it could not be in uſe in thoſe firſt Ages which are ſilent in it, and that it was but then beginning when it met with its firſt oppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When he preſſes M. <hi>Daille</hi> with the improbability of his knowing the ſentiments of former Ages better than they who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeded them.</q> As its not allowable that he that has read the many convincing evidences throughout that whole Book on which M. <hi>Daille</hi> grounds himſelf, ſhould urge againſt him only a bare improbability of his underſtanding the ſentiments of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Ages, without the leaſt confutation of the things on which he grounds himſelf: So neither is it directly to the queſtion, for this does not neceſſarily ſuppoſe that M. <hi>Daille</hi> ſhould know the ſentiments of foregoing Ages better than they; for they might know their ſenſe well enough, and yet embrace opinions which themſelves thought probable, and not preſently apprehend wherein they contradicted the ſentiments of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As for that, <hi>he ſays,</hi> to make it ſtill leſs credible, that M. <hi>Daille</hi> has quoted in his Book ſeveral expreſs Texts, by which it's ſhewn that they pretended, in Praying to Saints, to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Predeceſſors. It's idle either to expect a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</q> anſwer to ſuch an uncertain Diſcourſe, or to hope to gain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when he has not given us the particulars, by which only it can be judged how far it does conclude.</p>
               <p>But now the advantage he takes at preſent from this conſent of this being in uſe in the fourth Age, is only this, <q>That he hopes thoſe of M. <hi>Daille</hi>'s Communion will have more reſpect to theſe Men, than with him in deriſion to give them the name of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quariſts, and that as they dare not accuſe thoſe of Idolatry by Praying to Saints, or of deſtroying that truſt which Chriſtians
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94907:12"/>
ought to put in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo he hopes henceforwards, that they will not caſt the like reproaches on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they conſider they cannot do it without accuſing at the ſame time thoſe excellent Men. This he may promiſe himſelf,</q> that we ſhall not ſhew any thing like deriſion of thoſe excellent Men, nor give them reproachful names: But what he further aims at, depends upon the truth of his ſuppoſition, that by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Idolatrous in this reſpect, we caſt the ſame reproach on thoſe famous Men: A thing, that he who knows the mighty difference we plead between the practice firſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a cuſtom, and thoſe groſs extravigancies to which it is ſince encreaſed, ſhould not have ſuppoſed without ſhewing the practiſes to be the ſame. Which how they firſt began, and by what degrees encreaſed to their preſent height; as, Firſt, From Mens deſires to one another to be mindful of them after-their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; Secondly, From an opinion that ſome help was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Church from the fellowſhip between the Militant and the Church-Triumphant, grounded upon a ſuppoſition, that if Souls departed were mindful of any thing, they bore the ſame affection to their Members as when on Earth, and ſo would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God for them; which, Thirdly, Begun to be more confirmed by ſome miraculous effects which God was pleaſed to work in places where the memory of the Martyrs was had in Reverence: Which, Fourthly, Gave occaſion to thoſe Prayers which were made upon a faint ſuppoſition of their knowing things below, which Prayers were rather Wiſhes than Prayers, as <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam Sancti orent:</hi> And ſo grew by degrees, as Men willing to juſtifie themſelves in what they had gave entrance to, perſuaded themſelves more of the probability by framing ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to themſelves of God's wanting not means to make known their deſires to them; 'till it came at laſt to be received, that God really did make them known by ways beſt known to himſelf; which is now made matter of Faith, and the practiſe thus encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abſolutely commanded: Thoſe who are willing to ſee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular information, I refer to that excellent Book of Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Anſwer to the Jeſuits Challenge; and for the degrees by which the publick Forms now in uſe got poſſeſſion in the Liturgies to Dr. <hi>Chaloner</hi>'s Progreſs of Hereſie.</p>
               <p>This Digreſſion in me I hope is pardonable, ſince M. <hi>Condom</hi> himſelf led me out of the way, with whom I now return to follow the deſign.</p>

               <head>Concerning Invocation of Saints.</head>
               <p>HEre, in the firſt place, he acknowledges, <q>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does teach them, that it is profitable to pray to Saints. Now this the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares to be</q> 
                  <note place="margin">39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle 22.</note> unprofitable, and a vain invention not grounded upon any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>But he goes on and ſays, <q>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches them to pray to Saints in the ſame ſpirit of charity, and according to the ſame order of fraternal ſociety, which moves us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand aſſiſtance from our brethren here on earth; whence their Catechiſm concludes, that if Chriſt's mediatorſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no prejudice from the interceſſion made to the faithful who live with us, neither does it from the interceſſion made to the Saints. But here we muſt take leave to obſerve, that if</q> the ground upon which they found this Doctrine be, as he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that Relation and Fellowſhip which Saints departed have with the Church here, as we the living members have one with another; as I confeſs may be implied in the inſtances given in that Catechiſm of <hi>Job</hi>'s praying for his friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mention'd, before it inſers the concluſion here ſpoken of: yet it cannot be ſaid, that this Church teaches men to pray after no other manner to the Saints than to their brethren that are living, nor with no <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 25. Dec. de Invocat.</note> greater confidence of ſucceſs: ſince the Council expreſly decrees for the <hi>Invocation</hi> of them, and alſo for <hi>Mental Supplication:</hi> and M. <hi>Condom</hi> acknowledges a peculiar acceptableneſs of theſe with God, upon account of their virtues, <hi>p.</hi> 9. and their Catechiſm <note place="margin">Cat. Rom. de Culen &amp; Inv.</note> expreſly teaches, that God confers many benefits upon us for their ſake and merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He paſſes on to ſhew us, from their Catechiſm, the difference between their imploring the aid of Saints, and the aſſiſtance of God, that they pray to Saints, to undertake their cauſe with God, but to God to give them the things they ask, and therefore their Forms are different, that where they are not, the intention of the Church reduces them all to this difference.</q> Not denying, for the preſent, but the intention of the Church may be to reduce them to this diſtinction, yet it ſhall remain que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, whether it may lawfully uſe ſuch Forms, as, according
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94907:13"/>
to their nature, are proper only to God, and by which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves expreſs deſires that ought to be peculiar to him to the Saints with a different intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For a further confirmation of the ſenſe delivered, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the injunction of the Council to the Biſhops, what they ought to teach the people concerning Invocation of Saints, That the Saints, who reign with Jeſus Chriſt, offer up to God their prayers for men, that it is good and profitable to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them after an humble manner, and to have recourſe to</q> their prayers, aid and aſſiſtance, to obtain of God his benefits, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Son, who is our ſole Saviour <q>and Redeemer. After which it condemns thoſe who teach a contrary Doctrine. I ſhall find it neceſſary for my purpoſe, to</q> ſet down the particulars, how it declares it to be impiety, to ſay <note place="margin">Seſſ. 26. D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. de <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that Saints ought not to be invocated, or that they do not pray for us, or that it is folly to pray unto them.</p>
               <p>Hence he again concludes, <q>That to Invocate the Saints, in the ſenſe of this Council, is to have recourſe to their Prayers, for obtaining benefits from God, through Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that in reality they are obtained no otherwiſe than by Jeſus Chriſt ſince through and in his Name. And here M. <hi>Condom,</hi> not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice, that aid and protection are mentioned by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as diſtinct from the Prayers of the Saints, the Advertiſer</q> has, <hi>p.</hi> 13. and tells us, <q>That it is a kind of aid, ſuccour and protection to recommend the miſerable to him, who alone can comfort them. Such protection (he ſays) we may receive</q> from Saints, but yet he does not ſay it's the only protection to be received or expected from them: though, for my own part, I am as deſirous, that this ſhould be the only ſenſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as themſelves pretend to be; ſo they will grant, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what I deſire, that thoſe who have or do place any further reliance on them, or ſeek them for greater purpoſes, are hereby declared to be condemned as Idolaters; which if they refuſe to grant, they argue both to little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>From the premiſes thus laid, he preſumes they ſhall be no more accuſed of forſaking Jeſus Chriſt, when they beſeech his members, who are alſo ours; his children, who are our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and his Saints, who are our firſt fruits, to pray with us and for us, to our common Maſter, in the Name of our common Mediatour. Planſibly, ſaid I, confeſs, but not ſo well</q> conſidered on by one, that ſhould have known, that the hope of our acceptance with God, depends upon his promiſe; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to thoſe that ask of God immediately in his Son's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94907:13"/>
Name: and again, that the honour due to Chriſt, as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is not given him in that acceptable manner, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give it him by means of our own chuſing, as by thoſe applications, which he has taught us to make unto God, through and in his Name and Merits: upon which ground the Church of <hi>England</hi> well argues, That we are to make our application to God <note place="margin">Homily of Prayer.</note> through Chriſt alone, for that the promiſe is made to them that pray in his Name, and the Apoſtles tell us, that he is our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and only Mediator.</p>
               <p>He further informs us, <q>That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhe offers to God the dreadful ſacrifice, to honour the memory of his Saints, does not ſacrifice to them, but God in memory of them, rendring thanks to him for their victories, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their aſſiſtance, to the end thoſe whoſe memory they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate upon earth, would vouchſafe to pray for them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Suppoſe it, and yet hereby is confeſt by their demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</q> the aſſiſtance of theſe perſons, by vertue of this ſacrifice, that they do it in expectation of ſomething from their interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well as from Chriſt's merits; which ſeems to me a groſs abſurdity, that they ſay the benefits they ſeek from the Saints are ſought through Chriſt's merits; and yet when they offer the ſacrifice of Chriſt, which pleads all his merits to God, they ſhould not ſo totally depend on that, but expect another aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Saints.</p>
               <p>From the Doctrine thus propoſed he infers, <q>That they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rob God of the perfections of his eſſence, nor attribute to the Creature any of thoſe qualities which are peculiar to him only; in that they do not, as he ſays, aſcribe immenſity, or the knowledge of the ſecrets of our hearts, to the Saints, as having any ſuch of themſelves; but to ſay a creature may have ſome knowledge communicated to it by God, is not to elevate a creature above his condition; God himſelf by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known future things to his Prophets, having ſhewn, that he can, when he pleaſes, communicate ſuch things unto a creature: whereas none of them hold the Saints to have any ſuch knowledge by their own power. But if this ſhould not</q> be to elevate the creature above the condition it is capable of, if God pleaſe to communicate ſuch knowledge to him, yet it is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſuch a condition, which we are not ſure he has: and whereas, he ſays, they do not hereby rob God of any perfections peculiar to him, becauſe a creature is capable of having ſuch as they give to Saints communicated to it; it is worth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, whether to give perfections peculiar to God till he does
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94907:14"/>
communicate them to ſuch as we are not aſſured he has given them, will not be looked on by God as a Diſhonour to him, if he has really not communicated them; for otherwiſe how can it ever be a Diſhonour to him to aſcribe the peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his Nature to any other, there being none but he can, when it pleaſes him, poſſeſs with them in great part.</p>
               <p>After which, he concludes, <q>They cannot in reſpect of this Doctrine be Idolaters; which he endeavors to prove by an</q> Induction of ſeveral Arguments, the ſtrength of all which depends on theſe Suppoſitions, <q>That the Saints in Heaven do know our De<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ires, and have certainly the Knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs communicated to them by God; that they do and have a power of aſſiſting us by their Prayers; which Power proceeds from their Acceptableneſs in God's ſight, for their Virtues, which are the gifts of his Grace. But if theſe</q> Suppoſitions fail of Truth, as they are altogether without ground, all there ſaid, avails nothing to exempt them from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>Whereas he infers at laſt, <q>That the exterior Veneration which they give to Saints, ought to be judged of from their interior Sentiments. This is a thing that muſt be left in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute</q> for the Reaſon given by me, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Now after our View and Remarks upon M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Particular, it is ſit we ſhould collect the Points in difference; which are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether the Saints have ſuch a certain Knowledge of humane Affairs, as can be ſufficient Ground for us to requeſt their Help?</p>
               <p>Secondly Whether ſuppoſing the Intention of their Prayers to the Saints, be quite different from what they have in thoſe they make to God, this can juſtifie them in the Uſe of Forms couched in the ſame Terms?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> grounds in part theſe Prayers to Saints upon the Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Members one with another, ſo the Invocation of theſe which it requires, be nothing but a bare deſire of them to pray for us; or be not taught to be an humble ſupplicatory Deſire, and a Religious Worſhip, as that ſignifies an Act of Devotion, and piece of Gods Service?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether this ought to be made a part of Faith, that the Saints do know our Neceſſities and Deſires, and all men obliged upon this account to invocate them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94907:14"/>
Fifthly, Whether particular Perſons that do not alwayes maintain this diſtinct intention of the Church, are not chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even with direct Idolatry?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether, if this Diſtinction has not been alwayes maintained by all Perſons, or be difficult to be maintained, the Church, which teaches this from Scripture, does not prejudice the Foundations of Faith?</p>
               <p>Now if to the Points thus collected, we ſubjoyn the Sentiments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall ſee what this Expoſition will make againſt us, and what Differences it hath left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>
               <p>Touching the Firſt then; The Church of <hi>Rngland</hi> declares, <note place="margin">Homily of Prayer, Par. 2.</note> That the Saints have no ſuch Knowledge, as to make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Invocation; that they have no ſpecial Knowledge of the Deſires or Neceſſities of particular men; the Scripture ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us;</hi> and that the inward Deſires in which Prayer chiefly conſiſts, are only known to God.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, She does not ſay what the Sentiments of the <note place="margin">Hom. againſt peril of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, part 3.</note> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are, or that ſome of them may not direct their Intentions as they pretend; but that others of them have not done it, ſhe argues by their appropriating to particular Saints the Tutelarſhip of certain Countries, and Defence of diſtinct Cities; to others the Protection of ſeveral Arts and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to others, the Cure of particular Diſeaſes; all which ſhe looks upon as derogating from Gods Providence, and Evidence of peculiar Truſt in Saints. But that ſuppoſing this Intention of theirs kept entire, their uſe of external Adoration, and ſuch Forms as are only applicable to God, does make them guilty of Idolatry, it ſayes not, only in general, that external Adoration is peculiar to God, and that it ſhould not be given to any thing elſe, and upon what Ground equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Geſtures expreſſive of that Adoration, ought not to be given to any other in Religious Worſhip, I have ſhewed, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Third, Our Church has ſaid, That Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Hom. of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, part 2.</note> (meaning thereby Prayer, as an Act of Devotion) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to God: But in this Point M. <hi>Condom</hi> hath left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient Explication of the Senſe of his Church; he has told us to what end the Council commands us to pray unto them, and that it teaches the profitableneſs of it, and that it pretends not to exclude Chriſt, when it teaches us to have this recourſe to the Saints; but he has not told us what Degrees or Meaſures our Deſires are confined to. I preſume their Church muſt mean
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94907:15"/>
another manner of Deſire than that uſed to our Brethren upon Earth, becauſe the Council decrees Invocation, a Word never uſed to expreſs any Requeſt made to Man; it alſo requires this to be made after an humble manner, and even with Mental Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; but it gives no Bounds to theſe Deſires. And I muſt and do maintain, that he that prays to Saints (though holding the Suppoſition that they pray to God for him) yet if he prays with the ſame Intention of Mind to theſe, as he does to God, either intending to do that to theſe, which they do to God for us, or which himſelf does to God when he prays unto him, comes ſo near to an Idolater, that no man can poſſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them. But as we cannot judge how far the Intent of a man's Deſire goes by any outward Expreſſions, it is God only that can paſs this Cenſure; however the Church has not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provided Means to preſerve this Diſtinction in all its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in that it has left the Deſires of men to go in this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints as far as Superſtition &amp; a blind zeal can carry them.</p>
               <p>As to the Fourth, It denies it to be any part of Faith, that the Saints departed have any certain knowledge of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as I have ſhewed before; and conſequently denies it in the Churches power to make it ſuch, or to oblige any to invocate them upon this account.</p>
               <p>To the Fifth, Such as have not maintained this diſtinct Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but have repoſed Truſt in the Saints, and relied upon <note place="margin">Hom. againſt Idolatry, pa. 2.</note> them for Protection, the Church of <hi>England</hi> plainly declares to be Idolaters. And if this diſtinction of the Intention, be that which makes their Church not to command abſolute Idolatry, the thing which M. <hi>Condom</hi> Pleads for, then all thoſe that do not preſerve and maintain this diſtinction, are Idolaters, when they let it go. So that our Church has caſt no reproach upon them falſly in all her <hi>Homily againſt Idolatry,</hi> unleſs ſhe has falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Matters of Fact, which we have reaſon to think ſhe has not, till they diſprove them; ſince ſhe profeſſes to relate them as things done in that time, the knowledge whereof ſhe may be well preſumed to have; and ſince they are alſo no other, than ſuch as very probably flow from ſuch Principles. And ſuch as theſe ſhe alſo declares to deſtroy apparently Chriſt's Mediatorſhip, who approach the Saints out of a particular dependance on their Merits.</p>
               <p>To the Sixth, The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays of Setters up of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> par. 3.</note> Images, intending no leſs I ſuppoſe of Promoters of Devotion to Saints, if they are Biſhops, or ſuch as have the Care of Souls, it is to ſhew themſelves to have no regard to the Church
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94907:15"/>
of Chriſt, and to account the multitude of Souls redeemed by him, vile, and not worthy their Care. And undoubtedly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far criminal in this reſpect, and the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries or other Abuſes are particularly chargeable upon her; as, Firſt, She teaches, that for profitable Doctrine, and beneficial to Salvation, which is in all probability the contrary, and which Experience has ſhewed otherwiſe. Secondly, As ſhe has not in the judgment of any reaſonable man ſufficiently ſecured that all her Members ſhall preſerve that infinite diſtance between God and his Saints and Angels, of whom they demand the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; which if they do not at all times maintain, they are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, as the Heathens were: And how can it be preſumed that ignorant Chriſtians in the Devotions of their Hearts underſtand that diſtance between God and his Creatures, which is not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Words, which their Teachers can hardly find out a Diſtinction to difference. Thirdly, So far as it has contributed to raiſe the Reverence of Chriſtian People towards the Saints above the Grounds that our Chriſtianity has revealed; for tho' I ſhould in part allow the Diſtinction in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm, <note place="margin">Cat. Rom. <hi>de</hi> Cultu &amp; Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</note> about the Angel's Refuſal of the Worſhip tendered him by St. <hi>John,</hi> that he refuſed only the Worſhip due to God alone; yet it is plain in that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 6, 9. that St. <hi>John</hi> knew the Angel that ſhewed him the Viſion, to be diſtinct from God, that ſent him, which is alſo clear throughout the whole Viſion; and yet he, that had (queſtionleſs) a clear apprehenſion of one God, tendred the Angel ſuch as Worſhip as he refuſed to receive; and there can be no Reaſon to think, but that if the Extaſie of a Viſion carried this Apoſtle ſo much beyond himſelf, wiſe, as well as ignorant, through a blind Zeal, acted by a carnal Spirit, may be carried to the like exceſs in reſpect of the Saints, or any other Object of Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now how far the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be vindicated in the firſt of theſe Reſpects, which render her liable to the Idolatries of her Members, muſt be left to the Jugdment of thoſe, who without all prejudice will conſider what is ſaid by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for the profitableneſs of this Practice to Salvation, from Grounds only proper to Chriſtianity; (Matters of Chriſtian Religion being determinable only from them:) And what is ſaid on the other ſide, of the unprofitableneſs and danger of it, and of its inconſiſtency with Chriſtianity. How far ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in the ſecond, by conſidering whether the Means, if ſhe has provided any, be ſufficient to preſerve in all a juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant apprehenſion of the infinite diſtance between God and his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94907:16"/>
Creatures, whilſt they have recourſe to thoſe in their Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as unto him. In the third, by conparing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, if ſhe has ſet any to this Worſhip of Saints, with what has been done on the other ſide, by Bulls and Indulgences from the Head of the Church, that I may not mention any things of particular perſons tending to this purpoſe, who have publiſhed many things of the ſame Nature with that fulſom Book of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations on Holy Mary,</hi> lately ſent out among us, to raiſe the Devotions of Chriſtians to ſo far above all grounds from our common Faith.</p>
               <p>My further Buſineſs is, only to conſider what of theſe things in difference are taken off either in part or in the whole, by this Explication which M. <hi>Condom</hi> has given us of his Churches Senſe in this Point.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt of them, he only intimates a poſſibility of God's giving them ſuch a Knowledg, though he ſuppoſes it certain that they have it; yet whilſt he tells us the ſeveral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which God can make ſuch Deſires known to them, but dares not ſix upon any by which he does it, it ſhews they have no Aſſurance from their Chriſtianity, that God has given them any ſuch Knowledge; nor indeed has M. <hi>Condom</hi> offered any Grounds for it from thence.</p>
               <p>To the Second, he ſays, That we ought to underſtand them, to reduce all ſuch Forms to the Senſe by them declared. But let that go as far as it will to excuſe them from Idolatry, it will never juſtifie them in the Uſe of ſuch Forms to the Scandal of their Chriſtian Brethren, and to the Reproach even of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf, whilſt they give Religious Worſhip to the Saints as well as God, fly to them in their Neceſſities with the ſame Expreſſions of their Deſires as to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Third he is altogether ſilent in; neither telling us what that Invocation is, nor how far the Deſires of our Hearts are to be enlarged in thoſe Prayers to them.</p>
               <p>As to the Fourth, he has ſhewed us, that their Church teaches, that the Saints do pray for us, and that we are to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, and to fly to their Prayers, Aid and Protection, and condemns thoſe who teach a contrary Doctrine; but ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here to juſtifie it, but ſomething in the End of the next Section: Of which in its Order.</p>
               <p>The Fifth he mentions not, neither will any of his Reaſons given to free thoſe from Idolatry, who maintain ſuch a diſtinct Intention as he argues upon, ever juſtifie or clear thoſe who have not always maintained it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94907:16"/>
In the ſixth he only vindicates his Church in part, in that ſhe has let her people know, by her Catechiſm, a difference between their prayers to God, and to the Saints: but he does not ſhew us wherein the Church has declared what manner of deſires, which are required to be humble, our prayers to them for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are to be made with, nor any bounds that ſhe has ſet to them, nor wherefore ſuch methods have been taken by the Head of the Church, as well as particular members, to advance the Reverence of Chriſtians to Saints, above the grounds taught by our Chriſtianity: nor does he ſhew us the leaſt warrant from Scripture, upon which their Church teaches this, and commands it as a practice beneficial to ſalvation, which in it ſelf is ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive.</p>

                  <q>AS for Images (he ſays) the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> forbids the believing any virtue or divinity in them, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any favour from them, or putting any truſt in them, and ordains the honour given to them to be referred to what they repreſent. Yet it commands <hi>an honour to be given to them,</hi> tho'</q> with a further reference, and thereby either decrees an honour to be given to the Images themſelves, if not for their own ſakes, yet for the ſake of them they repreſent, or at leaſt firſt to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, though not terminated or ſtayed there, but directed further to what they repreſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All theſe words of the Council are as ſo many Characters (he ſays) to diſtinguiſh them from Idolaters, in that they aſcribe no other virtue to their Images, than that of exciting the remembrance of thoſe they repreſent. If theſe are the</q> only Characters that diſtinguiſh them, we may from themſelves conclude, that thoſe who give them any other virtue are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>But then, to confirm this, the only ground on which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Images, he endeavours to ſhew us by examples. <q>Firſt, he ſays, the figure of Chriſt crucified, excites in us a more lively remembrance of him who died for us, upon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance they are moved to teſtifie by ſome exteriour ſigns, how far their gratitude bears them, and by humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94907:17"/>
before the Image, they ſhew their ſubmiſſion to their Saviour: ſo that, in the Eccleſiaſtical ſtyle, their intention is not ſo much to honour the Image, as the perſon whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents in preſence of it: for which he cites the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ſays the honour we render to Images has ſuch a reference to thoſe they repreſent, that by the means of thoſe Images which we kiſs, and before which we kneel, we adore Jeſus Chriſt, and honour the Saints, whoſe Types they are.</q> But, under favour, if he only humbles himſelf <hi>before the Image,</hi> to ſhew what reſpect he has for his Saviour, and does not withal give ſome reſpect <hi>to the Image it ſelf,</hi> he does not anſwer the <note place="margin">Seſſ. 25.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94907:17"/>
then, <hi>We adore thy Croſs, O Lord.</hi> So that M. <hi>Condom</hi> has choſen an ill inſtance to make us believe they give no worſhip to the Image, but only to thoſe repreſented by them: nay if they put the ſame truſt and reliance on other Images, as on their honour of the Croſs, we may conclude they do not think them ſo void of virtue as is pretended, for in reſpect of their honour given to the Croſs, they pray thus, <q>God, who by the blood of thy Son, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> didſt intend to ſanctifie the ſign of the quickning Croſs, grant that they who rejoice in honouring the ſame holy Croſs, may ever joy in the protection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The inſtance of the Bible is wide from the purpoſe, for their Church has no where decreed any Religious Worſhip to be given to that, and though ſome of them may uſe it with a fooliſh or perhaps ſuperſtitious reſpect, does that give excuſe to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant uſe of other things?</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Condom,</hi> preſuming upon the ſtrength of what he has ſaid, concludes, <q>It would be very great injuſtice, to accuſe theſe practices as idolatrous, there being an exceſſive diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſuch as put their truſt in Images, and thoſe who declare they uſe Images only to excite and raiſe their memories and minds towards heaven. All which does enable me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</q> that where this difference is not maintained, this uſe of Images in Religious Worſhip ſhall be abſolute Idolatry.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Images not mentioned by M. <hi>Condom,</hi> though I ſuppoſe not deſignedly omitted, becauſe he is treating about Images commanded to be worſhipped, which thoſe are not; but I am obliged to take notice of them, becauſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Advertiſement, <hi>p.</hi> 14. and alſo becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> charges the making them as a Crime upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Images of God, made for an Hiſtorical uſe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Hiſtories of the Old Teſtament in Forms, which God ſometimes appeared under to his Prophets; ſuch Images, ſays the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ought not to made, becauſe God cannot be repreſented; and <hi>Moſes</hi> forbid the <hi>Jews</hi> to make any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of him, becauſe when he gave them the Law, they ſaw no ſhape. The Advertizer endeavours to defend the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by ſaying, <q>That it does no more pretend to derogate from God's inviſible and ſpiritual nature, than God himſelf when he exhibited himſelf under that form. And poſſibly it may not pretend to it, but yet it may derogate from the glory</q> of his nature nevertheleſs. But he tells us, <q>The Council does not pretend thereby to repreſent or expreſs the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or give it any colours. But 'tis not what they pretend</q>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94907:18"/>
to do, but what they do, that can vindicate them in this matter: now their Catechiſm ſays, <q>The Paſtor ſhall teach the people, that <note place="margin">Cat. Rom. de Cultu &amp; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat.</note> certain properties and actions, which are attributed to God, are ſignified thereby; as for inſtance, when the antient of days, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is painted ſitting on a Throne, with the Books opened before him, they are to underſtand, that thereby is ſignified the eternity and infinite wiſdom of God, whereby he ſees both the thoughts and actions of men, that he may paſs judgment on them.</q> And is not this evidently to do the things they pretend not to do? No Man can ſay certainly the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hieroglyphicks, of which kind were the Statues of their Gods, and to which the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes</hi> may reaſonably be thought to relate, were uſed by them to give a full and perfect expreſſion of the things they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them to repreſent, but rather for ſome ſeeming Analogy which thoſe Natures had with what they intended.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Controverſie before us, and to collect the points in difference, that we may ſee, how much of it M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s explication has put an end to.</p>
               <p>The Firſt diſpute is, Whether Images ought to be ſet up in Churches, and uſed in Religious Worſhip?</p>
               <p>The Second, What ſort of Image-Worſhip is commanded by the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third, Whether that practiſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be not Idolatrous, or does not neceſſarily tend to Idolatry?</p>
               <p>The Fourth, Whether the Idolatrous practiſes of particular Perſons, are not in a great meaſure chargable juſtly on the Church itſelf, whilſt it commands the uſe of Images without warrant from the Word of God?</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares, that in part ſhe would not ſtick to grant them that Images may be <note place="margin">Hom. againſt Idol. 3d. p.</note> made, but with this limitation, that it be ſuch as are not uſed in Religion, ſuch as are not in danger to be Worſhipped nor of any Worſhip'd; but that Images cannot be ſet up in Temples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of Idolatry, arguing, that ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood their Law, which made them ſo zealouſly oppoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors who endeavoured to introduce Images into their Temple; that the Cherubs over the Altar cannot juſtifie the uſe of them, for that we muſt obey God's general Law, and not run to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſpenſations: That ſuch Images as have been ſo ſet up, have been and were at that time Worſhipped, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſet up long without Idolatry, ſince there can be no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to prevent it, ſo long as they are ſuffered, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſo great a proneneſs in Man's nature to Idolatry, and ſo great ſtrength in an Image to draw carnal minds to it.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond, it takes notice only of what <hi>Naclantus</hi> has ſaid upon it, whoſe Doctrine it ſticks not to call Idolatry, <hi>That we are not only to Worſhip before the Image</hi> (as ſome too cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpeak) <hi>but to Worſhip the Image, and that with the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is to be given to the Prototype.</hi> But what the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in this point we have ſeen, that though it be not what <hi>Naclantus</hi> profeſſes, yet it's more than M. <hi>Condom</hi> is willing to confeſs, and is altogether without any warrant from our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>As to the third, our Church ſays not any where that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that to Worſhip before an Image is Idolatry, nor does it ſay that ſort which the Council has decreed is Idolatry; but it ſays in general, that the uſe of Images in Religious Worſhip ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily leads to Idolatry, and let me add, that which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil decrees does lead ſomewhat more to it than the other, in that it's more difficult to give a Worſhip to the Image, and at the ſame inſtant direct it to the object it repreſents; na<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſo great a difficulty, that it ſhall be very hard for a Man to preſerve himſelf from it, in his Devotions to the Saints by their Images; as it's no eaſie matter for a Man to preſerve ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct intentions as are neceſſary to the directing a Reverence to, and yet not fixing it on the Image, but directing it with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to the object it repreſents, which muſt not ſtay there neither, if that object be any other than God or Chriſt, ſo as to fix any truſt upon it, but muſt go further to God, in whom alone their truſt is to be repoſed. But then as to the practiſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, ſhe ſticks not to call them Idolatrous, and fears not to determine it from what ſhe relates of their Pilgrimages to Images, their repairing to them to be healed of Diſeaſes, their hanging up Crutches before them to ſhew the vertue they had found by and from them. Wherein, if ſhe relates true matter of Fact, as that we have great reaſon to believe, we need not fear, that ſhe can be juſtly taxed by any as fixing Calumnies upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, when ſhe ſpeaks of ſo many Idolatries practiſed in it.</p>
               <p>To the laſt, our Church has ſaid, that for Biſhops, whoſe is the care of Souls to maintain or ſet up Images in Churches, is to ſhew themſelves to be careleſs Paſtors, that have no reſpect to the Souls for which they are to be accountable. And undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Idolatries, or other Crimes of particular Perſons in this practice, are highly chargeable on the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94907:19"/>
commands that, as a practice beneficial to ſalvation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thoſe who reject it, which creates ſuch difficulties in the Worſhip of God as make Idolatry almoſt unavoidable: eſpecially in the ſimple ſort, for whom, Who will or can undertake that they ſhall preſerve the Devotions of their hearts ſo entire as they ought for God alone, among ſuch diverſity of Objects and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? It will be to little purpoſe to ſay the Council has taken care to prevent abuſes, when it has enjoyned a practice ſo liable to them, unleſs the neceſſity of uſing them were as evident as the danger. Beſides thoſe remedies, as they have taken but little effect, ſo neither are they likely, whilſt the Church is ſo far from <note place="margin">Cat. Rom. de Cultu &amp; Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> ſeeing or owning any ſuch abuſes, that ſhe commands her Paſtors to teach the People, not only that it is lawful to have Images in Churches, and to give Honour and Worſhip to them, when the Honour is referred to the Prototype; <hi>but that it has been done with exceeding good and benefit to the People unto this very day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what ſatisfactory defence has M. <hi>Condom</hi> made for his Church in all or in part of theſe points? when firſt he preſumes it lawful to uſe Images, and that in Churches and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and acknowledges the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to command Honour to be given to them for the ſake of their Prototypes, (this at leaſt it does command, though he is not willing to own ſo much) but yet ſhews us not the leaſt warrant from Holy Scripture upon which this command is founded. When alſo thoſe very reaſons which he has uſed to vindicate his Church from commanding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Idolatry, do neceſſarily involve all thoſe in it who ever have conceived any vertue in Images, or terminated any Worſhip on them, and likewiſe ſhew it extreamly difficult to avoid Idolatry, and almoſt impoſſible but that the vulgar ſhould be enſnared thereby.</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Condom</hi> goes on, and ſays, <q>That after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ought to underſtand that Honour which they pay to Relicks; but this he ſays without citing the Council, which,</q> 
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 25.</note> had he look'd into it, would have taught him that it ought to be after a quite different manner. Its decree indeed is only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they are to be venerated by the faithful, but when it comes to its Anathema, it not only condemns them that ſay vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought not to be given to the Relicks of Saints, or that theſe and other their Monuments are unprofitably Honoured, but thoſe likewiſe that ſhall ſay, their Memories or Relicks are in vain frequented for imploring of their help. So that if this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to interpret the veneration it enjoyns to be given to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, it is far different from the Honour given to Images, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94907:19"/>
in M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s ſenſe, but even in the ſenſe of the Council, for it declared no vertue to be in, no truſt to be repoſed, nothing to be hoped for from Images: But in theſe it ſuppoſes ſome vertue, ſomething that may contribute help, and encourages Recourſe, yea, Pilgrimages to them for that purpoſe: And this the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms confirms ſo perfectly, that the only argument it brings upon this Subject, is to confirm the People in a confidence of help by them, for it ſays, <hi>If the Veſtments, Towels, yea, the Shadow of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cat. Rom. de Cultu &amp; Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> 
                  <hi>the Saints, when living, did drive away Diſeaſes and reſtore Health, Who dares deny, that God, by the ſacred Aſhes, Bones, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of his Saints, does miraculouſly work the ſame effects?</hi> with more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And having ſhewn this, I need not ſay any thing to what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are brought by M. <hi>Condom</hi> to juſtifie that which is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſenſe of the Council, yet ſo far as they may ſeem to relate to it, I ſhall conſider them in ſhort, after a neceſſary reflection on what is ſaid by the Catechiſm, to build up the People in a vain and pernitious confidence of help from them.</p>
               <p>To this, I ſay, therefore, it is not for them to ask us, Who can deny but God may do this or that? but to ſhew us that he does: No Man will pretend to limit, much leſs deny the effects of God's Omnipotent Power; but every Man ought to look for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence that this or that, is the effect of his Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he believe it, eſpecially before he ground a dependance upon any thing as endued with a vertue from him to work ſuch effects. And then, to what is ſaid before this in that Catechiſm, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the miraculous effects that God was pleaſed to work at the Sepulchres of the Saints and Martyrs in the Primitive times of the Church, I anſwer, That God's doing ſuch things then, is no argument that he does the like now, neither does it give us any more ground to expect the like, than his empowering Men to work Miracles to preſume on him for the ſame power ſtill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we know God was pleaſed, in condeſcenſion to Mens infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to win them over by means that miniſtred to that love of the preſent World and the advantages of it, which Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being received obliged them to caſt off: So that to aſſure Men, or give them hopes of thoſe things from the Saints, which God aſſures them not of from their Chriſtianity, is ſtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Men thoſe affections to the preſent World which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their Profeſſion, and the ready way to cauſe them to ſet up the Saints in the higheſt place of their affection, when they are taught to have recourſe to theſe for ſuch things of the preſent World which God has given them no abſolute promiſe to ſupply.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94907:20"/>
And therefore 'tis in vain for M. <hi>Condom</hi> to urge us to conſider, <hi>That they Honour them as Victims that have been offered to God,</hi> when the Honour that is paid them is not barely upon this account as he would inſinuate, but upon a quite different ſcore, <hi>That of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining help from them,</hi> the hope of which from others may eaſily alienate a Man from God, when he ſeeks not in all his neceſſities immediately to him alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas, he invites us further to conſider, how a Man's love to another propagates itſelf without being divided, to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Friends, and after that, by ſeveral degrees to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of him, to any remains of him, and to any thing that renews it in his remembrance, and that Honour has the like Progreſſion, and that the Exterior Worſhip (he might have</q> added alſo Interior, for ſuch they give to Saints in mental ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſeem to do the ſame when they confide in them, and frequent their Relicks for help) <q>has its ſource in God himſelf, and returns back to him, ſo that this Worſhip which himſelf alone animates cannot create his Jealouſie. To ſay that God</q> himſelf animates a Worſhip which they preſume to frame for him, and fooliſhly give to others, out of a pretence of Honouring him upon ſo little grounds from their Chriſtianity, does very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem a Biſhop. But queſtionleſs he clean forgot himſelf, when he would have us gather from the Progreſs he marks of Love, how pleaſing this Honour, that has the like Progreſſion, muſt be to God; when the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> cap. 14. verſ. 15. has ſhewn us that fooliſh affection thus propagating itſelf to have been one of the chief originals of Idolatry: An inſtance enough to make all Men afraid, how, through a fond zeal and carnal fancy, they frame the Worſhip of God according to their own pleaſing Notions.</p>
               <p>As vain and altogether as unbecoming is his other conceit, <q>That as God is not jealous of the love of Men when they love their Neighbour for the love of him, no more can he be thought to be of his Honour, when out of a reſpect to him we Honour thoſe whom he has Honoured: For dares he ſay, that by the</q> Honour God has given to his Saints he has made them the objects of our Worſhip, as he has our Neighbour the object of our Love? Might not the Phariſees, with greater reaſon and ſhew of wiſdom, have pleaded for their <hi>Corban,</hi> that God being to be Honoured before and above their Parents, what was vowed or deſigned to his Honour, could not without high offence be given to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and yet does not our bleſſed Saviour tell them, that hereby they made void the Commandment of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94907:20"/>
Since M. <hi>Condom</hi> is willing after all to acknowledg <q>a Power in his Church, to abate of theſe things according to the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of Times, that her Children might not be ſlaviſhly ſubject to ſenſible things; as it makes but little for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</q> of his Church, which has endeavoured to impoſe ſuch things on thoſe who only deſired to be diſentangled from them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing them to be Clogs that kept down their Souls, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them in their flight to Heaven; and has thereby cauſed ſo great Diviſion in the Church of Chriſt; ſo I hope it gives us ground to ſay it is now high time to abate them to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have ſo long lain under the Burthen.</p>
               <p>But what great part of our Controverſies are abated by this better underſtanding he pretends to have given us, I am not able to ſee after ſo cloſe a Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Then for the things he concludes with, <q>That it is great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to accuſe their Church of placing all her Piety in theſe Devotions to Saints: It is a great deal more than ought to be,</q> that ſhe places ſo great a part of it therein; and if any have cenſured her, as placing all, or the chief of it therein, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have given too juſt occaſion for this Cenſure, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Means that are uſed among them to make men vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zealous of theſe Devotions.</p>
               <p>But ſuch a Concluſion as he ends with, I ſhould little have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a perſon that has treated hitherto with ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moderation: To ſay, their Church was obliged to condemn all that reject this Practice, as being obliged not to ſuffer any Practice which is beneficial to Salvation, to be deſpiſed; nor a Doctrine authorized by Antiquity, to be condemned by Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, is very ſtrange in a man that has not pretended to prove this Practice beneficial to Salvation, nor at all ſhewed it to be authorized by Antiquity; and has ſcarce been able by all that he has endeavoured, to vindicate from abſolute and direct Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not in the leaſt from leading unavoidably to it.</p>

               <p>NOT to diſpute as yet whether this Point be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, or was propoſed by the Reformers as the moſt eſſential Cauſe of their Separation; if M. <hi>Condom</hi> thought it ſo, he has taken but little pains to repreſent the Doctrine of his Church in a Point ſo material, out of ſixteen Chapters of the Council on that Subject to mention but two Paſſages, neither of which expreſs the Subſtance of their Doctrine. Whereby he has occaſioned me the Trouble of drawing an Abſtract of their Sentiments out of the Council, before I can free my ſelf from his confuſed Expreſſions, or propoſe the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon this Subject, thereby to determine the Matters in Diſpute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Council of Trent</hi> then concerning the Juſtification of a Sinner, Decrees as follows;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THat all Men are lapſed with <hi>Adam (cap.</hi> 1.) That <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſ. 6.</note> hereupon <hi>(cap.</hi> 2.) God ſent his Son Chriſt, whom he doth propoſe a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, for the Sins of the whole World: But though he died for all, <hi>(c.</hi> 3.) yet thoſe only receive the Benefit, to whom the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Paſſion is communicated. That we are to conceive of <hi>Juſtification (c.</hi> 4.) as of the Tranſlation of Man from the State wherein he was born, as a Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> to the State of Grace and Adoption through Chriſt, which Change is not wrought without our being waſhed in the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or deſire ſo to be. That the beginning of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (c.</hi> 5.) in perſons adult, is the preventing Grace of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> his free Calling, whereby Man conſenting, and co-operating with his exciting and aſſiſting Grace, is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to prepare himſelf for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which he does wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and might refuſe. Which Diſpoſition is wrought after this excitement of Grace <hi>(c.</hi> 6.) by believihg willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the divine Revelations and Promiſes; particularly, that <hi>God</hi> juſtifieth the Sinner through <hi>Grace,</hi> and then out of a Senſe of Sin, turning from <hi>God's</hi> Juſtice, to his Mercy,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94907:21"/>
hoping in him for Pardon, and thereupon beginning to love him, and hate Sin, purpoſing to be Baptized, and to begin a new Life. That <hi>Juſtification</hi> followeth this Diſpoſition, <hi>(c.</hi> 7,) which is not only the Remiſſion of Sins, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the inner Man, and hath five Cauſes; the Final, the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and Eternal Life; the Efficient, <hi>God,</hi> who waſheth away Sin, and ſanctifieth, the Meritorious, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who by his Paſſion hath merited <hi>Juſtification</hi> for us, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his Father; the Inſtrumental, the Sacrament of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;</hi> the only Formal Cauſe, <hi>Juſtice given by God,</hi> whereby we are renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, but made truly juſt, every man receiving it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own proper Diſpoſition, receiving together with Remiſſion of Sins, Faith, Hope, and Charity. That when it is ſaid, <hi>We are juſtified by Faith,</hi> and <hi>freely (c.</hi> 8.) it ought to be underſtood, becauſe Faith is the beginning of <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the things that precede it, are not meritorious of Grace. That although it be neceſſary to believe <hi>(c.</hi> 9.) that Sins are not remitted to us but by the free Mercy of <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet we are not to believe they are remitted to him that vaunteth, and repoſeth himſelf only in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and certainty of their Remiſſion; neither ought it to be ſaid, that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is perfected only by Faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all doubt. That thoſe who are thus <hi>juſtified (c.</hi> 10.) by bringing forth good Works, are more <hi>juſtified.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By taking the like View of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this Point, we ſhall eaſily diſcern the things in difference: She then declares,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THat we are accounted righteous before God only for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That by</hi> Juſtification, <hi>She means the Forgiveneſs of our Sins</hi>

                  <hi>and Treſpaſſes. That this being received of God's Mercy and Chriſt's Merits, embraced by Faith, is taken and allowed of God for our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full Juſtification. That nothing on the behalf of Man, does contribute to this</hi> Juſtification, <hi>but only a true and lively Faith, which Faith is alſo the gift of God. But this Faith does not ſhut out Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Hope, Love, Dread, and the Fear of God, from being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94907:22"/>
joyned with Faith in every man that is juſtified, but it ſhutteth them out from the Office, or juſtifying; nor does it ſhut out the Juſtice of good Works neceſſarily to be done afterwards of Duty to God, but only excludes them from deſerving our</hi> Juſtification, <hi>which comes freely from the Mercy and Grace of God, whereby he has provided that Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to be paid by Chriſt, which all the World in any part was not able to pay of themſelves.</hi>

That though we have, and ought to have Faith within us with Hope, Charity, and other Graces, and do never ſo many good Works thereunto, we muſt renounce the Merit of all our ſaid Virtues that are or may be in us, as things too weak and inſufficient and imperfect to deſerve remiſſion of Sins,</hi> i. e. <hi>our</hi> Juſtification. <hi>and muſt trust only in God's Mercy, and the Sacrifice of Christ for the ſame.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>But this Faith that juſtifies, is not a dead or carnal, but a</hi>

                  <hi>living Faith; and this living Faith is a full Trust in God through Christ, which upon the conſideration of the greatneſs of his Mercy, which it apprehends and relies upon, is at the ſame time moved through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to ſerve and pleaſe him, out of this pure and only Principle, the Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he that will conſider and compare theſe Doctrines with each other, will find, that they both agree in the lapſed State of Mankind, and the neceſſity of God's ſending his Son, whom he hath ſet forth to be our Propitiation, and that though he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94907:22"/>
died for all, yet thoſe only are benefited to whom his merit is communicated: but when they come to expreſs the nature of Juſtification, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> conceives it to be, not only the Remiſſion of ſins, but likewiſe the Renovation of the Inward man; the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Juſtification, means only For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: which is the main difference that runs through the whole Controverſie. For hereupon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing it's own notion, makes the beginning of Juſtification to be the anſwer to God's call, and the following his exciting grace to the belief of God's promiſes, thence hoping in him for pardon, and thereupon beginning to love him, and hate ſin, purpoſing a new life: which diſpoſition is followed with Juſtification, of which it ſets up different cauſes, particularly making the only formal cauſe of it, to be Juſtice or Righteouſneſs given by God, whereby we are renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and not accounted only but rendred juſt, every man receiving it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his diſpoſition. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> on the other ſide, holding a quite different ſenſe of Juſtification, declares Chriſt the only meritorious cauſe of it, by what he ſuffer'd for the expiation of our ſins, and Faith, the only means of receiving and applying his merits for this purpoſe, which Faith it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be a full truſt in God's mercy, through Chriſt, for the remiſſion of our ſins, (ſuppoſing always Repentance as neceſſary to make this confidence lively and Chriſtian, not carnal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive) excluding nevertheleſs even Faith it ſelf, as well as all other graces and works, from being any way meritorious of this remiſſion of ſins, which is only wrought by Jeſus Chriſt: not that it does in the leaſt deny, that Chriſt merited grace as well as pardon, or that God by his grace doth infuſe into our hearts, Faith, Hope and Charity, and all other graces, whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the inner man is wrought; but ſuppoſing always, that this ſanctification is wrought by God's ſpirit in all juſtified perſons, it denies any of theſe graces, and all inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to be deſerving of this Remiſſion of ſins, which God gives us freely out of meer grace upon the ſcore of Chriſt's merits.</p>
               <p>Now then, upon a view of the whole, we ſee the ground of the difference lies in the different apprehenſion of Juſtification, and herein certainly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is miſtaken; whilſt ſhe confounds Juſtification with Sanctification, Remiſſion of Sins with the Renovation of our Minds: and taking Juſtification for what it properly ſignifies, Remiſſion of Sins, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has made that the formal cauſe of Juſtification, which has nothing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94907:23"/>
to do in the Remiſſion of Sins, which are not remitted by being extinguiſhed by contrary diſpoſitions, but by the Merits of Chriſt purchaſing their pardon.</p>
               <p>Again, By departing from the Scripture-language, and the true meaning thereof, in making Juſtification conſiſt in the infuſion of Righteouſneſs, which it does not properly ſignifie, there is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reaſon great enough to cauſe men, that are jealous of the glory of God's grace and the merits of Chriſt, to think they claim remiſſion of ſins as due to that infuſed righteouſneſs, by having whereof they ſay they are righteous before God. But yet inaſmuch as it makes Chriſt to be the meritorious cauſe of Juſtication, and ſays in the place M. <hi>Condom</hi> quotes, that it is neceſſary to believe that our ſins are not remitted but by the free mercy of God through Chriſt, I dare not charge it as deſtroying his Merits by this Doctrine; but wherein I do charge them with this will appear in the next <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, it has gone beyond its power in making that matter of Faith, which before was only a poſition of the Schools, and which in it ſelf is not true, eſpecially ſince it has proceeded further to declare that Doctrine of Juſtification which it has thus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Preface to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</note> ſet down to be ſo neceſſary to be received, <hi>that without believing it a man cannot be juſtified,</hi> and has thereupon proceeded to make Canons, whereby they condemn him that ſays, <note n="1" place="margin">Can. 10.</note> We are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally juſtified by the merits of Chriſt. <note n="2" place="margin">Can. 11.</note> That we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, or only by remiſſion of ſins, without inherent grace and charity. <note n="3" place="margin">Can. 12.</note> That juſtifying Faith is nothing but confidence in the mercy of God, who remitteth ſins for Chriſt. <note n="4" place="margin">Can. 24.</note> That Juſtification is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by good works, but that they are fruits only and ſigns of it. All which Propoſitions, though condemned by them, are true, taking Juſtification in its proper notion for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins; for what is a man juſtified by but only the juſtice of Chriſt, and by remiſſion of ſins, if Juſtification be only the Remiſſion of ſins, and that effected only by Chriſt? and, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, what are we formally juſtified by, but his merits? and what is juſtifying Faith elſe, ſuppoſing the ſame, but a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the mercy of God, who remitteth ſins for Chriſt's ſake? and how is Juſtification increaſed by works, if it be the free remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins through Chriſt, without conſideration of them?</p>
               <p>To come therefore at length to M. <hi>Condom,</hi> who ſays, <q>That, ſeeing the Scripture explicates Remiſſion of ſins, ſometimes by God's covering them, ſometimes by his blotting them out by his grace, that makes us new creatures, to form a perfect
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94907:23"/>
                     <hi>Idea</hi> of Juſtification, both theſe are to be joined together.</q> Could he have ſhewn any one place of Scripture, wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins ſignifies their being blotted out, by making us new creatures, I might allow his <hi>Idea</hi> reaſonable. But the place he cites in the Margin, <hi>Tit. 3. v.</hi> 5 6, 7. is not of that clearneſs as to make much for him, when the Scriptures every where diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Remiſſion of our ſins, from our being turned from them; the pardon of them, from our having ſin deſtroyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and conſequently our Juſtification, from our Sanctification, and though both are wrought by Chriſt, yet it ſpeaks of them as things diſtinct, aſcribing the benefit of the one, to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt and God's mercy; the other to the effect of his grace and holy ſpirit: The words in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> are theſe, <hi>But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Christ our Saviour, that being juſtified by his grace we ſhould be made heirs of eternal life.</hi> Now, it's true, the Apoſtle here ſetting forth our ſalvation, effected through the mercy of God in Chriſt, for the manner of it, ſets down no more than the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; but though the laver of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on effects both the remiſſion of our ſins by the death and merits of Chriſt, and the renovation of our minds by the Holy Ghoſt which is ſhed on us, we are not therefore to think of them, as if both were the ſame thing, becauſe both are conferred by the ſame Sacrament, when it's apparent that they are different mercies, one the effect of Chriſt's death and ſufferings, the other the effect of the Holy Ghoſt, which is ſhed on us: nor is it neceſſary, that what the Apoſtle adds of our being juſtified by his grace ſhould be underſtood of the grace of the Holy Ghoſt ſhed on us for the renewing of our minds, but rather of that kindneſs and love of our Saviour to ſave us, and of that mercy according to which he ſaves us without the works of our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>We believe indeed our ſins not only to be covered, but alſo entirely waſhed away by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt and the grace of Regeneration; but we do not think fit to confound Juſtification, which ſignifies the Remiſſion of ſins, and Renovation, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys ſin within us, one with another, nor to think the latter, which is effected but in part in this life, to be meritorious of the former; and ſhould think we did too much leſſen the merit of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94907:24"/>
blood, if by allowing the effect of it to what it ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the working Sanctification in us; we ſhould not conſider it alſo to that other effect of wholly meriting for us the pardon of our ſins.</p>
               <p>Whereas he argues at laſt, <q>That the Righteouſneſs which is in us is truly ſuch, and that even before God; had not I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</q> to ſay as before, that their making Juſtification to conſiſt in the infuſion of Righteouſneſs, gave too great appearance for men to think they claimed Remiſſion of ſins as due in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to their own Righteouſneſs? when M. <hi>Condom</hi> can thus plead for the truth and reality of it, and for its being a righteouſneſs, and that before God. But to give him an anſwer, It is not by us denied to be a Righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, any further than to this effect, that it is not a righteouſneſs that renders us void of ſin, nor that can in the leaſt merit for us the remiſſion of ſins, nor that can abide if he ſhould try it with rigour, or be extream to mark what is amiſs therein.</p>
               <p>When he comes at laſt to acknowledge it too true, <q>That the fleſh rebels againſt the ſpirit, and that in many things we offend all; ſo that though our Juſtice be truly ſuch, yet it is not perfect Juſtice, becauſe of the Combate of Concupiſcence, ſo that we are obliged to confeſs with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That our Juſtice in this life conſiſts rather in the Remiſſion of ſin than in</q> the Perfection of virtues. Though I could wiſh he had expreſs'd himſelf in all the words of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in that place, <hi>That our Righteouſneſs though truly ſuch in the end it aims at and is referred unto, true goodneſs; yet is ſuch in this life, that it conſiſts rather in the Remiſſion of ſin, than in the Perfection of virtues;</hi> for hereby every work, though good, as aiming at a good end, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged imperfect, in that it attains not to it: yet I am glad to find him profeſs ſo much of truth, and could wiſh his Church had made the like declaration, but it ſeems rather to ſpeak the contrary, when it condemns him that ſhall ſay, <hi>the Just ſins, though only venially, in every work,</hi> Can. 25. which I ſee not how it could condemn, if it held our Righteouſneſs not to be Perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by reaſon of the Combate of Concupiſcence: for how can that which is not perfect Righteouſneſs juſtifie its ſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God's Law? and if not, to ſay it is a venial offence againſt it, becauſe not arriving to that abſolute perfection requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it, is as little as can be ſaid.</p>

               <head>Of the Merit of Good Works.</head>
               <p>AS to the Merit of Good Works, it's true, as he ſays, their Church teaches, <q>That eternal life ought to be propoſed both as a grace, which is mercifully promiſed through Chriſt, and as a recompence which is faithfully rendred to our good works and merits in vertue of this promiſe. But whereas he</q> adds, <q>That leaſt humane pride ſhould flatter it ſelf in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of preſumptuous merit, it alſo teaches, that all the price and value of a Chriſtians works proceed from ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace: though it has expreſs'd ſomething of this nature,</q> yet he ſeeks greatly to impoſe upon us, when he tells us, it teaches it for the end he ſpeaks of, <hi>the prevention of preſumptuous merit;</hi> for the Council really adds this as a <hi>reaſon, why eternal life</hi> ought to be propoſed as a <hi>recompence</hi> of our merits. Its words are theſe, <hi>For whereas Christ infuſes conſtantly the power of his grace</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 6. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>into the juſtified, which power does always precede, accompany and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the works they do, and without which they would upon no account be pleaſing to or meritorious with God; we are to believe nothing more wanting to the juſtified, to the end they may be looked on, as having fully, by their works, (which are wrought in God) ſatisfied the Divine Law, with reſpect to the preſent life, and to have truly merited that eternal life, which they ſhall receive in it's time, if they depart the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a ſtate of grace.</hi> It goes on,—<hi>So that hereby neither our own Righteouſneſs is ſet up as properly our own, nor is the Righteouſneſs of God paſſed by or rejected, but the ſame is ſaid to be our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it is in us, and we are juſtified by it; and the ſame is alſo Gods, becauſe infuſed by him for the merit of Christ.</hi> When therefore the Council proceeds thus to ſhew wherein the price and value of good works conſiſts, it does it not intending to take men <hi>from a confidence in the merit</hi> of their works, but with an intent to ſhew the <hi>grounds whereon it ſuppoſes this conſidence may be built:</hi> and what it adds to ſhew, that they ſet not up their own righteouſneſs, refuſing God's, does clearly evidence, they place our Juſtification in the Righteouſneſs that is within us, though they acknowledge its infuſion to be of God; from whence it follows by a plain connexion, that they profeſs a <hi>real merit</hi> and <hi>intrinſick value</hi> in a Chriſtian's works, although they confeſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94907:25"/>
wrought by grace, &amp; that they are meritorious on that account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. It's true the Council adds what M. <hi>Condom</hi> after, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be read with care,—<q>Although Holy Writ eſteems good works ſo much, that Chriſt himſelf promiſes a glaſs of cold water ſhall not loſe its reward; yet God forbid a Chriſtian ſhould glory in himſelf, and not in our Lord, whoſe bounty is ſo great to all men, that he will have thoſe gifts which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them to be their merits. But ſtill it does not deny</q> them to be <hi>merits,</hi> though it owns them firſt as the <hi>gifts of God,</hi> nor does it any where reſolve us what it means by this forbidding a Chriſtian to <hi>glory in himſelf,</hi> and not in our Lord: if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the reſt, it can only ſignifie, that a Chriſtian ſhould not glory in any thing <hi>as done</hi> by his <hi>own power,</hi> but ſhould acknowledge it wrought by the help of grace, and if no more than ſo, he ſtill may glory <hi>in his works,</hi> though not as <hi>wrought by himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he adds out of another Seſſion will come to be conſidered in its proper place, but ſo far as it relates to the point in hand; that they confeſs man has nothing to glory, nor for which he may confide in himſelf, is true; but it is upon this ground they confeſs it, that we can do nothing of our ſelves, but all through Chriſt who ſtrengthens us; not upon any ſuppoſition, that <hi>what a man has wrought through Christ</hi> that ſtrengthened him, may not <hi>be confided in as meritorious</hi> upon that ſcore, for though the Council ſays, we merit and ſatisfie in Chriſt, it can mean no more than <hi>through his aſſiſtance</hi> that enables us to do ſuch works; for it ſticks not to ſay the <hi>fruits</hi> worthy of Repentance have a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> in them, though drawn from him, as wrought by his grace. Beſides, there is ground enough to conceive, that they make ſome diſtinction between the ſatisfactory works of Penance, which are ſpoken of in that Seſſion, and thoſe good works which it ſpeaks of here in the buſineſs of Juſtification; ſo that what is ſpoken of the merit of them, cannot be drawn into conſequence to prove that they underſtand no greater merit in theſe, which are works of a different nature, and whoſe virtue is endeavoured to be ſet forth to a different purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of meriting eternal life, whereas the other pretends only to the ſatisfaction of adebt of temporal puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now then to ſubjoin the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point, which teaches, <note n="1" place="margin">Hom. of good Works, Part 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſuch Works only are good, which are done in obedience to God's Commandments.</hi>

                  <hi>That no Works done without Faith are pleaſing to God, in that the meaſures of them are not taken from the facts themſelves, but from the ends out of which they are done.</hi> 
                  <note n="3" place="margin">Hom. of Juſtifie. Par. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That though a man do never ſo

many good Works, yet we must renounce the merit of all our virtues and good deeds, which we either have done, ſhall door can do, as things far too weak and inſufficient to deſerve at God's hands,</hi> 
                  <note n="4" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> Par. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection being ſo great through original ſin, that all is imperfect that is within us, and therefore cannot merit.</hi> 
                  <note n="5" place="margin">Art. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That albeit good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Juſtification, cannot put away our ſins and endure the ſeverity of God's Judgment, yet are they pleaſing and acceptable to God.</hi> 
                  <note n="6" place="margin">Hom. of Faith, Par. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That true Faith is always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of them, and they are inſeperable from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may frame the compariſon, and find that both agree in this, That good works are neceſſary to a Chriſtian; that they are pleaſing and acceptable to God, being done both in obedience to his will, and out of the power of his grace; that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian works proceed from grace; that a man cannot glory in himſelf on this ſcore, but in Chriſt the Author and Finiſher of them. But then the difference lies, Firſt, in that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, our good works, though pleaſing to God, cannot bear the Tryal, if examined by <hi>the rigour of his Juſtice:</hi> They on the other ſide, That a Chriſtian, by his works wrought in God, <hi>does ſatisfie the Divine Law</hi> with reſpect to the preſent ſtate. We again diſclaim all aſſiance in our works, as things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to deſerve Remiſſion of ſins, or merit for us eternal life: They on the other ſide profeſs our works to have that <hi>intrinſick va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> in them, upon the account of their being the effects of grace, as that a Chriſtian may be <hi>truly</hi> ſaid to have <hi>merited</hi> by them that eternal life which he ſhall obtain in time if he depart this life in a ſtate of grace.</p>
               <p>Theſe being the Two Points whereon depends the Diſpute, I am not moved by any thing ſaid here by M. <hi>Condom,</hi> in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Churches Sentiments, to recede in the leaſt what the Church of <hi>England</hi> has declared and profeſſed concerning them. For though the Precepts, Exhortations, Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel, ſhew that we muſt work out our own Salvation by the grace of God aſſiſting us; yet they ſhew not that what is done by us does merit our Salvation, or can in juſtice claim it of God.</p>
               <p>Neither is it altogether ſo juſt that his Church ſhould uſe the Word <hi>Merit,</hi> to expreſs the acceptableneſs of good Works with God, ſince She limits it to a Senſe different from what was anciently underſtood thereby.</p>
               <p>Nor will I fear to maintain, That thoſe who will have the Works of Chriſtians to <hi>merit</hi> Heaven of their <hi>own intrinſick value,</hi> though ſuppoſing that value ſtill ariſing from its being
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94907:26"/>
wrought by <hi>Grace,</hi> do hold a Tenet prejudicial to the Faith, whilſt they hold not the Grace of God through Chriſt, <hi>again ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> of that to ſuch a reward which the <hi>intrinſick worth of it</hi> does not deſerve, nor his free Mercy in beſtowing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life according to his promiſe. For though the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple producing ſuch works, the help granted through Chriſt, be heavenly, yet ſeeing that <hi>Grace</hi> does not immediately produce the work, but by co-oporating with the Soul of man infected with Concupiſcence, it cannot be ſaid, either that ſuch works are truly perfect, or that they can demand a reward as if they had been the Effects of <hi>Grace</hi> alone, without the Allay that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and humane Weakneſs gives to abate their value. Nor will I decline to ſay, that he that ſhall maintain the Merit of our good works, ſuch as truly merit eternal Life, is thereby injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Merits of Chriſt; for ſince the Scripture not only accounts <hi>Grace, whereby good works are wrought,</hi> to be given us of <hi>his Merits,</hi> but likewiſe that <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is the <hi>Gift of God</hi> through Chriſt: He that ſhall aſcribe his Merits to the <hi>first</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> alone, and not acknowledge them to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> does not make that acknowledgment of the Merits of Chriſt, which the Scriptures do oblige.</p>
               <p>Theſe Gentlemen may hence ſee by this, upon what account we think them injurious to the Merits of Chriſt and his <hi>Grace,</hi> notwithſtanding their Confeſſions that they are not acceptable to God, but by and in him, becauſe they think themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable for the value of their works, which they may ſtill ſay are acceptable in and by him, becauſe Effects of his <hi>Grace;</hi> but we think require a <hi>further Grace</hi> ſtill, the <hi>Mercy of God</hi> through Chriſt, <hi>accepting</hi> them to ſuch effect as they are <hi>not worthy of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do the Three Points, which M. <hi>Condom</hi> thinks ſo deciſive as to this Matter, ſhewn out of the Council, give us any full ſatisfaction; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That our Sins are pardoned us out of pure Mercy for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt: That we are indebted for that Juſtice which is in us by the Holy Ghoſt, to a Liberality beſtowed on us <hi>gratis:</hi> That all the good works we do, are but ſo many gifts of his <hi>Grace.</hi> That the</q> firſt of theſe may give ſome abatement to their Doctrine of <hi>Justification,</hi> ſo as to make it not abſolutely deſtructive of the Faith, I have already owned; but that it ſhould give the like to their Opinion of the Merit of good Works, there is not the ſame neceſſity upon me to acknowledge: And then it is not material to the Point to ſay, all the good works they do, are but the <hi>Gifts</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> unleſs it be added, that they <hi>merit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94907:26"/>
through Grace</hi> withal, <hi>i. e.</hi> not of the <hi>intrinſick Grace</hi> that wrought them, but of the <hi>free Grace of God,</hi> that <hi>accepts</hi> them to that reward which they are not deſerving of. The <hi>Phariſce</hi> in the Parable, that truſted in his own Righteouſneſs, did yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it <hi>not of his own working alone;</hi> for he <hi>thanks</hi> God that he was not an <hi>Extortioner,</hi> &amp;c, nor <hi>as other Men;</hi> and yet he was not <hi>juſtified,</hi> becauſe he had not recourſe to God's Mercy.</p>
               <p>But not to conceal any thing that may encline us to a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſtruction; I muſt alſo take notice, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> at firſt propoſes Eternal Life as a Recompence which is faithfully rendred to the good works and merits of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in virtue of <hi>his Promiſe:</hi> And had it ſtaid there, I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to confeſs it had not decreed any thing prejudicial to the Faith; for having reſpect unto the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> it does thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Grace,</hi> as <hi>promiſing,</hi> though not as <hi>beſtowing</hi> the Gift. But when it comes afterwards to declare an intrinſick value in our works, and that eternal Life is truly merited by them, its Eye is taken wholly off both from the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and the <hi>Grace;</hi> for if it had intended to have ſhewn, that they merit by virtue of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> it muſt have acknowledged, that though they had an intrinſick and real worth, yet it was not ſuch as could render them acceptable for ſo great a reward, <hi>not ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God's Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore who ſpeak of good works as meritorious by virtue of God's Promiſe only, though they uſe an unfit Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot be ſaid to deſtroy the Grace of God. But which of theſe two Opinions ſhall be ſaid to ſpeak the Senſe of the Council?

               <p>But then will not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us by this Conceſſion?

               </p>
               <p>What M. <hi>Condom</hi> inſerts by the way, <q>That our Hope and Confidence in Chriſt, does not wholly extinguiſh Fear on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſelves, I am not obliged to gainſay, that I know</q> of, by any Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> provided I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow that which is decreed, <hi>Can.</hi> 16. <q>If any ſay or believe that he ſhall certainly have by certainty of infallible Faith, the gift of Perſeverance to the end, unleſs he know and have learned it by ſpecial Revelation, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For</q> though a careful and awful Fear does intermix with a Chriſtians Confidence, yet it may be ſuch as may exclude all doubt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Revelation, having no other foundation than that upon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, That <hi>nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>from the Love of God, neither Tribulation, nor Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe out of a certain knowledge of the ſincerity of their own hearts, and the certainty of God's never-failing Promiſe, that he will <hi>never forſake</hi> thoſe who <hi>forſake not</hi> him; they may be certain that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate them from their Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As to that great Advantage therefore which he may be thought to have gotten of us, in that the real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us in theſe two Points, of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and the <hi>Merit of Works,,</hi> may not appear ſo great as it was thought and pleaded by the firſt Reformers, who declared it one of the principal cauſes of their Separation; I anſwer, That I have</q> evidenced a Doctrine generally held in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and expreſt in the Words of the Council in the Point of <hi>Merit of good Works,</hi> whilſt they are taught to be deſerving of eternal Life of their own intrinſick worth, to be deſtructive of the Faith, and injurious to the Grace of God; however in that the Council in one place does mention God's Promiſe to accept of them, I am unwilling to charge it expreſly on the Council, though it ſeems afterwards to leave the Promiſe, and plead a real worth in our works, which are wrought by Grace; however thoſe who ſay they merit <hi>ex condigno,</hi> do certainly deſtroy the Faith, which are the greater number of their Divines: So in the Point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I have ſhewn too great appearance, that their Doctrine taken in the moſt favourable Senſe, does prejudice the Faith. Again, having produced the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> on both Points, ſhe holds no other than ſhe always

Beſides, even in this point he that ſhall conſider, that the Doctrine of Merit <hi>ex condigno,</hi> was received as the common Doctrine of the Schools, and was maintained by <hi>Eckius,</hi> in his Diſputes againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf did not diſown, but that good works were acceptable to God, though not meritorious, nor ſuch as could juſtifie a man before him; and alſo that they were neceſſary, and truly righteous too in ſome reſpect (as appears by his Book <hi>Detriplici Juſtitia)</hi> and diſputed chiefly againſt that Poſition of the Schools, which was generally maintained; and ſhall further conſider, that the Council, which, when it came to determine theſe points, ſhould have examined the affinity that each ſide had with the Truth, inſtead of ſo doing, ſets up a Doctrine in point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> in the School-terms, to the prejudice of the Expreſſions of Scripture Language; and in the point of <hi>Merit,</hi> that which ſufficiently countenanced the moſt extravagant Tenets concerning it: and on the other ſide, with one conſent condemned all they could draw out of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrines upon thoſe Subjects, which ſeemed any way different from it, without conſidering in what Senſe their Words might be true, nor how far they might agree with Truth; and that immediately after the old Doctrine of the Schools was maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Senſe of the Council: whoſo conſiders this, will ſee ſufficient grounds to think the Reformers did not charge their Doctrine with any greater Impiety than what they had juſt cauſe to conceive therein.

Nor if the Differences in this point appear not ſo material as they have been thought, is there any reaſon to preſume ſo much in other Points, before they are as ſeriouſly conſidered. We muſt and ought to overcome our prejudices, but withall muſt uſe our Judgments in diſcerning whether Prejudice or Truth poſſeſs us; nor muſt we hold the Spirit of Contention, but yet may hold our Reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the Spirit of Truth and Wiſdom.</p>

               <head>Of Satisfactions, Purgatory, Indulgences.</head>
               <p>IN Treating of theſe, M. <hi>Condom</hi> explicates to us the Ground upon which their Doctrines in theſe points are founded, to be this; <q>That Chriſt having made full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our ſins, may apply this <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to us ſo fully as by an entire ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to free us from all puniſhment, or ſo as to remit only eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment, leaving us ſubject to a temporal: That after the firſt manner he applies it to us in Baptiſm; but in the ſecond to thoſe who fall into Sin afterwards: That hereupon, the Church taking Cognizance of the Offences of its Members, when ſhe remits the guilt, impoſes revertheleſs upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners certain painful and laborious works, as puniſhments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be undergon in <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the Divine Juſtice; which they therefore call <hi>Satisfactions.</hi> That nevertheleſs out of regard to the favour of the Penitents, or ſome other good works preſcribed them, ſhe many times remits part of thoſe pains, and this Remiſſion is called <hi>Indulgence.</hi> That,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94907:28"/>
God having reſerved this Debt of temporal puniſhment, thoſe who die indebted to the Divine Juſtice, ſome pains which it reſerved, are to ſuffer them in the other Life; for whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief the Church does further think fit to tender God ſuch Services in their behalf, as being acceptable to him, may mitigate his wrath towards them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now as to this, though it be indeed true, that God might, if he had ſeen fit, have reſerved a debt of temporal puniſhment, after his remiſſion of the eternal, yet that he has ſo, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that has no warrant from Scripture. For though God may inflict what puniſhment he thinks fit on Sinners in this Life, as eternal in that to come, yet we are aſſured that the Afflictions of his Children that are reſtored to a ſtate of God's <hi>Grace,</hi> are the Chaſtiſements of his Love, and not the Inflictions of Wrath or Juſtice: So that to hold it for a neceſſary Truth, that God does not ſo remit the Sins of ſuch as fall after Baptiſm, but that he leaves them to ſuffer a temporal puniſhment from his Juſtice, and that ſuch as have not ſatisfied it here, are liable to thoſe Sufferings after Death, in a ſtate they muſt paſs before they arrive to Heaven, is a vain and groundleſs Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It avails nothing to ſay, that our Sins after Baptiſm are the effects of great Ingratitude to God: This might indeed make the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God</hi> appear, had he declared, <hi>that he would deal with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s after this manner:</hi> but it can never ſhew us that <hi>he does,</hi> when himſelf offers us a free Remiſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9, 10. Our Ingratitude indeed does make our Repentance a Work of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulty, neceſſarily cauſeth greater Humiliation in the Soul that is ſenſible of its abuſe of ſo great a goodneſs, and greater Mortification to change its ſelf from Sin to God; but that a true Repentance ſhall not obtain a total Remiſſion of theſe as well as other ſins, we are no where diſcouraged to hope.</p>
               <p>To ſay it is <hi>just</hi> that God might have reſerved a temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be endured by us, may be tolerable; but to ſay, it is <hi>beneficial to our Salvation,</hi> that he ſhould have done ſo, that we may not abuſe the facility of a Pardon, is to preſcribe God Methods, as beneficial, which it does not appear that he has uſed for that end. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhunned not upon the proſpect of ſuch abuſe, to declare the <hi>free Grace</hi> of Chriſt abundant to the pardon of many Tranſgreſſions; and thinks he had done as much as need be to prevent the abuſe, when he replies, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, ſhall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94907:29"/>
Their Tenets then in theſe points being grounded on a falſe foundation, the Penances impoſed by the Church in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and the relaxations of the ſame, can be no way pleaded by them who have aſſigned them to purpoſes quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the ends they are eſtabliſhed to ſerve by our common Chriſtianity: For it's beyond diſpute, with all that know any thing of the exerciſes of the Churches Power in binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing mens ſins in the firſt Ages of it, that Penances had no other ground in Chriſtian Diſcipline than as means for the cure of ſin; which the Church, being obliged to ſee to the performance of that Chriſtianity men profeſt, with good authority obliged thoſe to undergo who had viſibly fallen from that profeſſion; not as <hi>Puniſhments</hi> ſatisfactory to Gods Juſtice, but as <hi>Medicines</hi> to work their cure, and to recover them to the ſtate of Grace and God's Favour, which the Communion of the Church ought to ſuppoſe them in. And therefore, as they were debarred of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when they were fallen from Grace, the Church would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit them to it, 'till by ſubmitting to ſuch works of Humiliation as were likely to produce Repentance, they had given reaſonable Evidence to her of their having recovered the ſtate of Grace, and thereby a right to her Communion. Now thoſe Penitents indeed, who ſhewed ſome extraordinary zeal and fervour in theſe works of Humiliation, or by ſome other eminent acts of Piety, ſhewed themſelves to have truly repented, and that the love of God had taken place in their hearts, were many times admitted to the Communion before their performance of all thoſe acts that had been enjoyned them, and looſed from the further ſeverities of that Diſcipline, that cure of ſin appearing to be wrought in them which the Diſcipline intended. But for Penances impoſed to make ſatisfaction to the Divine Juſtice, and relaxations from them by the application of a ſtock of Merits in the Church, there is not the leaſt appearance.</p>
               <p>After this laying open the foundation, we muſt likewiſe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the building, and enquire what their Doctrine is in theſe points.</p>
               <p>In that of ſatisfaction, it's evident they hold thoſe Penitential Works to be <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> and that to <hi>God's Juſtice,</hi> inaſmuch as they deſign them for payments of a Debt of Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but then after what nature they ſatisfie, is not ſo fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> uſes the words cited by M. <hi>Condom</hi> in the former Section, which I have ſhewn not clear, for they ſay, <q>Theſe Works of Penance have a vertue though drawn from Jeſus Chriſt, and we are ſtill in doubt whether they count them</q>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94907:29"/>
ſatisfactions upon account of their <hi>intrinſick value,</hi> being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the help of Grace; if ſo, they give them a worth which they ought not. Their Catechiſm ſeems to confirm this ſenſe, ſaying, <q>That from Chriſt, through our good actions, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain two great benefits, one, that we merit the rewards of everlaſting glory, the other, that we can ſatisfie for our ſins. And this it ſays illuſtrates the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, whoſe Grace is herein more abundant, that not only thoſe things are communicated to us which himſelf alone, but thoſe alſo which as head over his Members he hath merited and pay'd for his Saints; upon which account, it's evident that the good actions of the Pious are of great weight and dignity. And this alſo</q> their very accounting them <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> to the <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this Temporal Puniſhment does moſt ſtrongly imply. And if ſo, then all M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s Maxims will not clear them from depending on theſe works for that which is not in them: But if we muſt take his word, that after all, what they call ſatisfaction is only the application of the infinite ſatisfaction of Chriſt, we hope to find nothing inconſiſtent with it.</p>
               <p>But here we meet with another Doctrine, that one man may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for another; thus their Catechiſm tells us, <q>That thoſe <note place="margin">Cat. Trid. ſub Titulo Quae ad verum ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact.</note> who are endued with Divine Grace may in another's ſtead pay that which is owing to God, ſo that after a ſort we bear one anothers burthens. And theſe works, by which men ſatisfie for others, are commonly called <hi>works of Supererogation,</hi> which the</q> Church of <hi>England</hi> declares, cannot be taught without arrogancy <note place="margin">Art 14. of the the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> and impiety, inaſmuch as by them men declare, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render to God as much as they are bound, but that they do more for his ſake than of bounden duty is required; whereas Chriſt ſaith plainly, <hi>When ye have done all that ye can, ſay that you are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> She likewiſe deplores that groſs Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition that had crept into the World, by which men were lead <note place="margin">Hom. of good Works. Part 3.</note> to place righteouſneſs in Vows, Meats, Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of which the People were told of a ſtock of merits in the Church of which others made their Markets. And herein I ſhall not fear to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what is ſaid by her, upon the reaſons given, and more, namely, that this conceit of one man's ſatisfying for another, and that thereby there is a ſtock of merits, which the Church, by Indulgences, may allow to the account of thoſe to whom it grants them, is not only without warrant from Scripture, or the practice of the Primitive Church, but is alſo prejudicial to the faith, and injurious to the merits of Chriſt; whoſe merits are the only conſideration of all Pardon and Mercy. Nor will it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94907:30"/>
avail to ſay the merits of the Saints are not ſuch but through him, for then it would be enough to apply his only to that effect; but whilſt his are infinite, thoſe who ſhall pretend to joyn others with them, when God has only propoſed his both as the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his giving mercy and the foundation of our hope, do plainly derogate from Chriſt and delude the People, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other merits than thoſe of Chriſt, vainly purchaſe them as a new means to place themſelves in God's favour.</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Condom</hi> ſpeaks here very ſparingly of Indulgences, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, <q>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> propoſes nothing elſe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved concerning them, but that there is a power in the Church from Jeſus Chriſt to grant them, and that the uſe of them is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to ſalvation, and does withall intimate, that theſe principally regard Diſcipline, which it ſeeks to prevent from being reaſſumed by an over-great facility in granting them.</q> But ſtill it teaches all this without warrant; no power of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to ſuch purpoſes as they pretend to grant them, being ever given to the Church by Jeſus Chriſt, nor any ſuch beneficial uſe of them to be learnt from him upon this ſcore. Nor is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to obſerve, that the Council intimates them to regard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, unleſs we knew how far their Eccleſiaſtical. Diſcipline does extend: If it reach to the impoſing Puniſhments for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Gods Juſtice for the debt of Temporal Puniſhment, <note place="margin">Concil.

All the World knows, that <hi>Luther</hi> in the firſt breach about Indulgences did not deny them as to the relaxing of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Penances, but inveighed againſt the pretences of thoſe that advanced them to a further purpoſe, and that one of his greateſt objections againſt them was, <hi>That the Pope could Pardon no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">95. Theſes Lut. <hi>Anno</hi> 1517.</note> 
                  <hi>but what himſelf in the Church impoſed,</hi> and pleads againſt his Adverſary, that he deſigned to Pardon no other: So that had the Pope then declared their grant to no further purpoſe, we might have had ſome reaſon to have credited M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s expoſition. But when the Council coming to the deciſion of this, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt occaſion of the breach, ought, if any thing, to have been particularly diſcuſſed, has only declared, <q>That there is a Power of granting them in the Church, and commended their</q> uſe, but not determined to what effect, whether to that which <hi>Luther</hi> owned, or that which his Adverſaries pretended, what can we conclude leſs than that it allows them to the effects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe Agents that diſperſed them. Wherein <hi>Bellarm.</hi> fully

               </p>
               <p>But poſſibly they may tell us, however this Council did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable in aboliſhing thoſe unlawful gains that were made by the markets of them. This indeed might have been ſomething, had they deſigned it to aboliſh the Penitential Tax iſſued out of the Apoſtolick Chamber ſometime before, which rates ſins at certain ſums; or had it taken effect to that end, but inſtead thereof we know thoſe faculties to have been ſince renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtill confirmed.</p>
               <p>Concerning Purgatory, the pretended foundation of it is this, <q>That thoſe who depart this life indebted to the Divine Juſtice, ſome pains which it reſerved, are to ſuffer them in another life, that hereupon they offer Prayers for ſuch, by theſe kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions to win God to be more mild to them in thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements.

               <p>Whereas M. <hi>Condom</hi> pretends to argue from that which is done by God's Servants, (many of whom afflict themſelves for the ſins of all the People, as well as for their own, out of a zeal to God and charity to their Brethren, affections that all ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs) <q>That God out of a delight to gratifie theſe his friends, accepts of their Mortifications in abatement of the Puniſhments he has prepareed for others: I cannot but admire to ſee a Man</q> write ſo much without Book, as to infer from hence a power in the Church to apply theſe ſervices to particular Perſons in Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and that theſe ſhall be available to eaſe men of thoſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments they ſuffer for their ſins after death; for to theſe ends he muſt ſay this or elſe he ſays nothing, for it's nothing to his purpoſe, what reſpect God may have to the Prayers, Faſtings and Humiliations of the faithful, to with-hold his Judgments from a ſinful Nation: And if ſaid upon thoſe other accounts, it's alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without warrant from his Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>We ſee then apparently the differences that are unreſolved by any thing ſaid in this explication of M. <hi>Condom,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has advanced a new Article of Faith, upon which it grounds theſe Doctrines and Practices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it abuſes the Penances uſed in the Church to ends not warranted from Chriſtianity, neglecting that upon which they take place in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in pretending to do things in ſatisfaction to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, they have not cleared themſelves from the ſcandal given to their Chriſtian Brethren by ſuch a bold pretence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That by ſetting up a ſtock of merits out of the ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory works of others, they are manifeſtly injurious to Chriſt, whoſe merits are propoſed by God for our only truſt; they even void, in my judgment, the terms of the Covenant of Grace, which requires, That every man prove his own work, in that as to God <note place="margin">Gal. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> every man ſhall bear his own burthen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it pretends to grant Indulgences, to purpoſes which they never ſerved in the Chriſtian Church of the firſt Ages, and to an effect even beyond the preſent life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That it teaches an unknown ſtate after the preſent life, wherein we are to lie under the ſeverity of God's Wrath for an uncertain time; to the manifeſt diſcouragement of us in our

               <head>Of the Sacraments.</head>
               <p>COncerning Sacraments in general, the Church of <hi>England</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Art. 25.</note> holds, <hi>That they are more than badges of our Profeſſion, or than repreſentative ſigns of Grace, being ſure witneſſes and effectual ſigns of it, by which God does inviſibly work in us, and ſeems to allow them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Holy Ghoſt, for it ſays of Baptiſm, that thereby as by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Art. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>an Inſtrument we are grafted into the Church of Chriſt.</hi> Only as to that which renders them effectual to us, we differ in two things, for they ſeem to leave out that which we make abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and on the other ſide make ſomething of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we deny to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94907:32"/>
The Church of <hi>England</hi> neceſſarily requires Faith in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the reſt of thoſe preparations which the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in thoſe that come unto them. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church teaches, that they confer Grace by vertue of the words which are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the exteriour action which is performed, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we put not any impediment by not being rightly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But in that many of that Church have ſince explained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that, when they ſay, the Sacraments do confer Grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> they do not mean to exclude the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith, and all other neceſſary qualifications in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, but only that the Sacraments have a virtue in them from Chriſt's inſtitution, which virtue is not barely the effect of faith in him that receives, but alſo of the promiſe of Chriſt annext to that work: this Controverſie ſeems to be chiefly about words, and their ill and offenſive manner of expreſſing themſelves: for we, as we require faith and other qualifications in the receiver, do alſo in owning theſe Sacraments to be Chriſt's Inſtitution, acknowledge their virtue from that Inſtitution, though thoſe qualifications are requiſite in us to partake of their efficacy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divine Promiſe.</p>
               <p>What they on the other ſide require as abſolutely neceſſary, is the intention of the Prieſt to do what the Church intends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Sacrament is not effectual. This is by us rejected, in that ſince no man has aſſurance of ſecuring the Prieſt's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if this were abſolutely neceſſary to produce the effect there could be no aſſurance of its ever coming to effect upon us. We therefore ſay, that the Sacraments, being of Chriſt's Inſtitution and taking effect by his promiſe, all that preparedly come to wait on him, in the Ordinances of his Church, have warrant of their effect from that promiſe, be the Miniſter's intention what it will.</p>
               <p>As to the neceſſity of theſe Sacraments, we that allow their virtue and efficacy from Chriſt's promiſe to work in us the graces of the Holy Ghoſt, and communicate the benefits of our bleſſed Saviour's death, cannot be thought to think them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or that the neglect of them in any, is not the neglect of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But then as to the number of them we find another difference, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> counts ſeven, Baptiſm, Euchariſt, Penance, Confirmation, Orders, Matrimony and Extream Unction. The Church of <hi>England</hi> acknowledges but two, Baptiſm and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <note place="margin">Artic. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> as ordained of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary to ſalvation: the other five ſhe counts not Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94907:32"/>
of the Goſpel, <q>being ſuch as have grown partly from the corrupt following of the Apoſtles, partly are ſtates of life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not like nature with the other two, for that they have not any viſible ſign ordained by God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There might indeed have been an eaſie end put to this diſpute, if both ſides had but conſidered one anothers meaning, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not put ſo great a bar to this conſideration, by denouncing <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all that ſhould ſay the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more or leſs than Seven, without ſufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference that is really between them. For the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the general, may (ſays our Homily) be attributed to <note place="margin">Hom. of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> any thing whereby an holy thing is ſignified; but in a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, or according to the exact ſignification of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it means a viſible ſign expreſly commanded in the New Teſtament, whereto is annext the promiſe of free forgiveneſs of ſins, and of our union with Chriſt: and in this ſenſe our Church acknowledges but two, and there acquaints us with the reaſons why ſhe does not receive the other Sacraments neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in what manner ſhe does receive them. Abſolution ſhe owns to have the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins, yet ſince this promiſe is not by any expreſs words in the New Teſtament an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to the viſible ſign Impoſition of hands uſed with it, ſhe counts it not a Sacrament as the other. That though there be a grace by promiſe annext to the exerciſe of it, yet there is no particular viſible ſign of neceſſity to be uſed in it, to which that promiſe is confined as to Water in Baptiſm. That though Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has both a viſible ſign, and a promiſe of grace, yet it has not the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> it has a promiſe of grace only to a particular effect, not to the general effect of the Goſpel. That Confirmation, uſed in examining perſons in the Chriſtian faith, and joyning thereto the Prayers of the Church for them, alſo Matrimony, Viſitation of the Sick, are ſtill retained by the Order of the Church, and ought to be, though not as properly Sacraments, yet either as ſtates of life worthy to be ſet forth by publick action, and by the Miniſtry, or as ſuch Ordinances as make for the inſtruction, comfort and edification of Chriſt's Church. Suppoſing hereby undoubtedly, that they want not grace to their proper effects, in what the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to hear the Prayers of his Church may give them leave to hope from thoſe Prayers that are uſed with them. And it is not without reaſon that our Church maintains this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there being ſo vaſt a difference between thoſe Sacraments,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94907:33"/>
which by virtue of our bleſſed Saviour's peculiar Inſtitution are Seals exhibitive of all the promiſes of the Goſpel, and which take effect to this purpoſe from that Inſtitution; and others that are only means of particular graces to this or that particular effect, ſome of which alſo can be hoped to take effect only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Prayers of the Church, and have no other virtue than what theſe Prayers can be hoped to produce.</p>

                  <head>Baptiſm.</head>
                  <p>About Baptiſm in particular, I know but one material difference, for the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſufficiently preſſes its efficacy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and has provided what ſhe can, that none may want it: only ſhe dares not determine it of that abſolute neceſſity, as to deny ſalvation to thoſe Infants that dye without it: The <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> themſelves allow the deſire of it to ſupply the want of it to Juſtification in the adult; and when St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that it is not the waſhing away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God that ſaves us in Baptiſm, why therefore they ſhould not think the deſign of Chriſtian Parents, dedicating them to God's ſervice, and the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſhould not as well ſupply the want of it in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as it does render the waſhing effectual in the uſe of it, I cannot apprehend.</p>

                  <p>Confirmation is not in the leaſt rejected by us, but uſed with ſolemnity becoming ſuch an Exerciſe and intended to the utmoſt effect, that the Biſhops Prayer, and the Suffrages of the whole Congregation joyned with it, can be hoped to procure of that grace, which may enable all that come thereto both to will and to do, what, before their coming to that action, they are taught they muſt then reſolve upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the proſeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their own names, undertaking to abide by it with their lives.</p>

               <div type="sacrament">
                  <head>Penance.</head>
                  <p>Touching Penance we believe, that Chriſt (having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Church the power of binding and looſing mens ſins for edification, and likewiſe committed to her the diſpenſation of the Myſteries of the Goſpel Baptiſm and the Euchariſt) has given
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94907:33"/>
her authority as of admitting to ſo of caſting out of the Church: ſo that when it ſhall appear, that any have viſibly tranſgreſs'd that profeſſion upon which they were admitted members of the Chriſtian Church by Baptiſm, ſhe has full authority to call ſuch to an account, and to exclude them in part, or altogether, from her communion, till they ſhall have ſubmitted to and peformed ſuch acts of humiliation as may both warrant her to admit them to her communion again by ſome aſſurance of their true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and recovery of the ſtate of grace, which alone entitles to it; and likewiſe ſatisfie the Church for the ſcandal given by their Apoſtaſie.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe we believe, that all, who being baptized, have made profeſſion of Chriſtianity, are by that profeſſion obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to this diſcipline, which the Church exerciſes for the cure of ſin. Further, we prove, that when the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds aright in the exerciſe of this authority, excluding thoſe from her communion, who are viſibly faln from the ſtate of grace, and admitting them again into it, after it has wrought the cure of ſin, by enjoyning ſuch acts of humiliation as have wrought a true repentance, ſhe acts according to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and what ſhe does is valid and ratified by him to ſo great effect, that what ſhe binds on earth is bound in heaven, and what ſhe looſes on earth is looſed in heaven.</p>
                  <p>We further ſay, That God, having provided this means for the procuring and aſſuring the pardon of ſin by his Church, does both teach private Chriſtians, what courſe they ought to take for the working in themſelves a true repentance by acts of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſelf-denial; and invite them to bring their ſecret ſins unto the Church, ſo far as they ſhall be convinced within themſelves, that the Miniſtry of the Church may be beneficial to them by her Prayers or Diſcipline to work this effect.</p>
                  <p>But we declare on the other ſide, That though we believe the Church has full authority thus to <hi>act</hi> in the cure of ſin, yet it has no authority to pardon ſin, till after it has wrought the cure: ſo that if it ſhall abſolve any from their ſins, in whom it has not firſt wrought a true repentance, that <hi>act</hi> is null: for the Church, which is only miniſterial to procure, can have no authority to abate that condition, which the Goſpel requires to the remiſſion of ſins, true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>2ly.</hi> we further declare, That though the Churches Diſcipline be of great efficacy to procure this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to the remiſſion of ſins, yet inaſmuch as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to work it in themſelves without it by their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94907:34"/>
Prayers, Humiliation and other Endeavours, aſſiſted by God's grace, that the ſins of ſuch are pardoned by God without this diſcipline of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>3ly.</hi> we alſo declare, That whatever benefit may be in mens laying open their ſecret ſins to the Church in obtaining the pardon of their ſins: yet there is no abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity on them ſo to do, for that their ſins ſhall aſſuredly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given without it, ſo they be truly penitent.</p>
                  <p>Alſo out of a due apprehenſion of the exceeding uſefulneſs of this Diſcipline, <hi>i. e.</hi> Publick Penance in the Church of Chriſt, and the great decay of Chriſtian Piety, ſenſibly fell through the want of it, our Church laments its loſs, and the abominable abuſes that crept into it; of which the iniquity of the age took ſo great advantage as has for the preſent rendred it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, but to the utmoſt effect ſhe can, ſhe does exerciſe it, and to the beſt for the edification of her children. But whilſt we thus lament, that this Diſcipline, left by our bleſſed Saviour in his Church, is in ſo great a meaſure loſt and become impracticable: yet there will not be ſo much reaſon to repent of our Reformation upon this account. It was not the Reformation that caſt off this neceſſary and ſaving Diſcipline; but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of former ages, that had brought in abuſes to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that rendred it not poſſible for the Reformation at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of them, to maintain it in the authority it ought to have had.</p>
                  <p>To what degree thoſe abuſes were arrived, we ſhall be able to gueſs, when we have conſidered thoſe that are ſtill maintained in <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 14.</note> the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which teaches thus, <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> 
                     <q>That thoſe who fall from grace, after Baptiſm, have need of another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to reſtore them, and therefore our Saviour inſtituted this of Penance. <note n="2" place="margin">Cap. 3. &amp; Can. 4.</note> That the Form of this Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the words, <hi>I abſolve thee;</hi> the matter of it is Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Confeſſion, Satisfaction, condemning thoſe who ſay Penance is no other than a Conſcience terrified for its ſins, and faith to lay hold on Chriſt for forgiveneſs. <note n="3" place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> That Contrition is a grief of mind, joyned with the hatred of ſin, and a purpoſe of ſinning no more, which although ſometimes it may reconcile to God, yet that effect is not to be aſcribed to it alone, without a deſire of the other parts of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That <hi>Attrition</hi> nevertheleſs, or ſorrow ariſing from the fear of puniſhment and filthineſs of ſin, which is not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contrition,</hi> ſo it exclude an intention of ſinning again, with hope of pardon, is the gift of God, and though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94907:34"/>
the Sacrament of itſelf it cannot juſtifie us, yet <hi>in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> it diſpoſes a man for receiving the grace of God. <note n="4" place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> That, by the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, an entire confeſſion of ſins is, <hi>by Divine Law, neceſſary</hi> to all that fall after Baptiſm, God having made his Miniſters Judges, to whom all mortal ſins are to be laid open, that they may pronounce the ſentence of their Remiſsion or Non-remiſsion. <note n="5" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> That although their Abſolution be but the Diſpenſation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's gift, yet they are not barely Miniſters to pronounce or declare to the Church forgiveneſs of ſins, but their ſentence is a Judicial act, and to be look'd upon ratified as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Judge, and being of this nature is not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valid, unleſs the Prieſt has a ſerious intention of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſentence of Abſolution. <note n="6" place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> That when God remits the ſin, he does not always remit the puniſhment altogether, that ſo the order of his Juſtice requires him to proceed, that therefore there is a neceſsity of thoſe ſatisfactory Puniſhments or Penances which are impoſed after Abſolution, to appeaſe the Divine Juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by this view of their Doctrine, we may diſcern how far the practice of Penance in this Church differs from the uſe it ought to have in the Church of Chriſt. The ſatisfactions or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential works which by the Church ſhould be <hi>first impoſed</hi> and enjoyned the ſinner to work in him a true humiliation, that, thereby being ſatisfied of his true repentance, it may with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority pronounce him abſolved from thoſe ſins whereof the cure is preſumed; are in this Church impoſed <hi>after it has war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted the Abſolution</hi> to an unheard of end, the <hi>ſatisfaction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice.</hi> Then again, it exceeds its authority in warranting Abſolution, before it has procured the only condition, to which the Goſpel tenders it, Repentance.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does indeed acknowledge Contrition, or the ſorrow that worketh true Repentance, to be a part of this Sacrament, but yet ſhe does not make it <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> but allows it to be ſupplied by ſomething that is not <hi>perfect</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: even the Council you ſee declares <hi>Attrition</hi> to be not only the <hi>gift of God,</hi> but that which does <hi>diſpoſe</hi> a man <hi>for God's pardon</hi> in this Sacrament, which is in effect to ſay, that what is wanting to <hi>true Repentance</hi> is ſupplied by ſubmitting our ſins to the Church in Confeſſion, and the ſentence or acquittal of the Prieſt thereupon. That this is indeed their meaning, is more plain from their <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which firſt, its true, ſets forth <note place="margin">Cat. Trid. de Confeſſ. Sac. Poenit.</note> the great benefit and advantage of <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet afterwards,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94907:35"/>
as if that were not the only condition of pardon tendred in the Goſpel, it requires that the people be further taught, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it must be confeſs'd, that our ſins are blotted out by Contrition, yet inaſmuch as few arrive to ſo great a degree of ſorrow for them as that requires, they are therefore but very few that can place their hope of pardon in that way: wherefore it was neceſſary that our most merciful Lord ſhould provide for the common ſalvation of mankind by an</hi> eaſier <hi>way, which out of his wiſe counſel</hi> he did <hi>when he delivered the Keys of his heavenly Kingdom to his Church. For, according to the Doctrin of the Catholick Faith, it must be believed and conſtantly affirmed by all, that if a man be but ſo affected in his mind, as to be ſorry for the ſins he has committed, intending withal not to ſin for the time to come, although he</hi> have not that ſorrow <hi>which is</hi> ſufficient <hi>to obtain forgiveneſs, yet when he ſhall have duly confeſs'd his ſins unto the Priest, all his ſins ſhall be remitted and forgiven to him</hi> by the power of the Keys: <hi>ſo that it was deſervedly ſaid by our forefathers, that by the Keys of the Church an entrance is opened into the Kingdom of Heaven, of which it is not lawful for anyman</hi> to doubt, <hi>ſince it is decreed by the Council of</hi> Florence, <hi>That the effect of the Sacrament of Penance is Abſolution from our ſins.</hi>

                  <p>Joyn then but this to their Doctrine of Satisfactions, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and Purgatory, and we ſhall ſee how full of Poyſons all this Compoſition of their Diſcipline is: while the people are firſt taught and perſwaded, that their ſins are cured by the <hi>ſentence</hi> of Abſolution once pronounced, that this ſupplies the <hi>defects</hi> of their Repentance, and opens them an entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven; that the Penances after impoſed are not enjoyned as though their ſins were not wholly pardoned, but to extinguiſh a debt of temporal puniſhment; that there is a ſtock of ſatisfactions remaining in the Church performed by others, which they may procure by Indulgences to be applied to themſelves: that having this Abſolution at their death, they are <hi>not to doubt but that their ſins are abſolved,</hi> and ſo there is no more to be feared than ſome pains in Purgatory, and thoſe to be ranſomed too, if any friends after their death will but purchaſe certain Services to give them eaſe, or if themſelves leave but enough to purchaſe theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for their acquittal. Who ſees not that this deſtroys our common Chriſtianity? of which I ſuppoſe M. <hi>Condom</hi> ſo ſenſible, that he durſt not propoſe any thing of his Churches Doctrine in this point, knowing that all his extenuations could not ſecure it from being prejudicial to the truth.</p>

Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, and anoint him with oyl, in the Name of the Lord, and the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Here the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the ſick to call for the Elders of the Church, whom we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be the Miniſters; and this queſtionleſs for their aſſiſtance to thoſe effects which the Apoſtle orders them to aſſiſt them in. The means to which he directs are two, <hi>to pray over them, and anoint them with oyl in the Name of the Lord;</hi> and this in order to two ends, <hi>the recovery of the ſick,</hi> and <hi>the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Now to both theſe effects I ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> does allow the help of the Elders of the Church uſeful to the ſick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has provided that none lack this aſſiſtance: but inaſmuch as the Promiſes relating to theſe effects are different, the Promiſe to one effect being <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>common</hi> to the Church in <hi>all ages,</hi> to the other <hi>temporary,</hi> whilſt God empowered it to work ſuch effects; the Church, which thinks ſhe can only ground her Faith upon God's promiſes, does ſtill retain and declare her power in the cure of ſin, having a continued promiſe of God's grace to go along with its Miniſtry in effecting of it; but not being aſſured, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any promiſe to aſſure it, that its Miniſtry ſhall be effectual to the recovery of <hi>bodily</hi> health, it dares not warrant it to her children, and therefore does not think fit to uſe the Ceremony of <hi>anointing the ſick with oyl,</hi> which was then uſed as a ſign effective of their recovery. Not that ſhe is not ready to pray for this on their behalf, grounding herſelf upon the <hi>general promiſe</hi> God has pride to hear the Prayers of his Church: but not having any <hi>ſure word</hi> of promiſe, to ground a firm Faith upon, as to the <hi>abſolute</hi> recovery of the ſick, and it being <hi>the Prayer of Faith,</hi> to which the Apoſtle here attributes this recovery; (as <hi>Faith</hi> indeed, and that <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> was always neceſſary to all miraculous effects:) ſhe therefore thinks ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe that ſign which was then applied to the ſick, to aſſure him of his recovery by that power which God was then pleaſed to give for the working ſuch cures.</p>

               <head>Of the Real Preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</head>
               <p>NOW we are come to the great Points that are in diſpute about the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> wherein M. <hi>Condom</hi> has greatly enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf, as confident of the Victory.</p>
               <p>Here in the firſt place, he tells us, <q>The Real Preſence of the Body and Blood of our Saviour is eſtabliſhed by the Words of the Inſtitution; which they underſtand literally,</q> and therefore are not to give Reaſons for ſo doing, but expect Reaſons why they ſhould not. We ſhould take this Gentleman off a great Advantage which he preſumes himſelf to have; if we ſhould deny theirs to be the Literal Senſe, and plead ours to be it, and oblige them to give Reaſons for their impoſing a new conſtruction upon them. However, leaving that in queſtion for a time, I muſt at preſent examine the Reaſons he gives to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Senſe he intends.</p>
               <p>The ground he proceeds on, I confeſs is ſuch as muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as vain in this Diſpute; neither muſt it, on the other ſide, be allowed to conclude neceſſarily; for though the correſpondence between the Old and New Teſtament, ought to be greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, yet of itſelf it is not ſufficient ground to build matter of Faith upon: Again, in whatever it be allowed to conclude, it muſt be according to the difference between the Old and New Teſtament, which muſt ſtill be maintained, and which is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably this, That as <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old Teſtament, were the <hi>Iſrael according to the Fleſh,</hi> and thoſe under the New, are the <hi>Iſrael according to the Spirit;</hi> ſo the correſpondence between the Law and Goſpel, may conclude from things that were <hi>carnally</hi> under the Law, that the ſame are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> fulfilled under the Goſpel; but never that they are now to be fulfilled <hi>carnally,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were then. For inſtance, when the Apoſtle argues from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s leaving his own Country to go into a ſtrange Land, that thereby alſo he ſought an heavenly Country; it may with the like force be argued, that we who travel after God's Promiſes, ſhall certainly arrive to the poſſeſſion of that <hi>heavenly Country,</hi> but not that we ſhall as certainly poſſeſs an <hi>earthly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> by the way: So, when he argues from <hi>Adam</hi>'s being made a <hi>living Soul,</hi> that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94907:37"/>
certainly think him to be a <hi>quickning Spirit</hi> in that ſenſe that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>living Soul;</hi> but in a much more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner. This being premiſed, I ſhall conſider his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</p>
               <p>Firſt then, he ſays, <q>That as the <hi>Jews</hi> did not in Spirit only partake of the Victim that was ſacrificed for them, but did in reality eat of the ſacrificed Fleſh, which was to them a Mark of their partaking of that Oblation; ſo Chriſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Victim, would have us really eat his Fleſh, to aſſure us in particular, that it was for us he gave it. Thus much I</q> allow the correſpondence between the Old and New Teſtament may prove, that whereas Chriſt has given us Bread as a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his ſacrificed Body to partake of, that he thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make us partakers of his Fleſh, to aſſure us that for us it was ſacrificed, but not that it ſhall hence follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> eat <hi>carnally</hi> of the Fleſh of their Sacrifices, we muſt alſo eat of his after <hi>the like manner.</hi> Who ſees not upon the difference between the Law and the Goſpel premiſed, that the contrary does neceſſarily follow, that they being the <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh did neceſſarily partake of the Fleſh of their Sacrifices after a <hi>carnal manner,</hi> thoſe therefore that are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit, muſt partake of their Sacrifices not as the others, but <hi>ſpiritually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let then God's prohibiting the <hi>Jews</hi> to eat of the Sin-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe of their Sins not being expiated by thoſe Sacrifices, conclude that now (our bleſſed Saviour having made himſelf an Offering for Sin) we ought to partake of this Sacrifice to aſſure us that the Remiſſion of ſins is accompliſhed for us: yet</q> this ſhall not conclude againſt our partaking of this Victim after a <hi>ſpiritual manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for God's prohibiting the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to eat Blood, becauſe it was given for the expiation of Souls, it being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of eating Blood in <hi>general,</hi> as well as the <hi>particular blood</hi> of their Sacrifices, if it conclude any thing, it is chiefly for the eating Blood in <hi>general,</hi> the reaſon of its being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den being ceaſed; but yet neither for this doth it conclude ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; for then the Apoſtles could not by their Decree have required the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to abſtain from Blood. But ſuppoſe it to conclude for our drinking the Blood of our Sacrifice, yet it does not in the leaſt prove that we are to drink it in a <hi>carnal,</hi> and not in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner; but it will prove if it be allowed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, what will not at all pleaſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe cannot now with-hold the <hi>Sacramental Blood</hi> from us, ſince our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94907:38"/>
Sins are fully expiated by the Blood of Chriſt, for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>contrary</hi> to that upon which it was prohibited the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe this Blood being ſhed, has wrought a full Remiſſion of Sins.</p>
               <p>Therefore upon ſo little that has been yet ſaid to the purpoſe, I admire the Gentleman ſhould tell us, <q>That our Saviour, to free us from the horror of eating humane Fleſh, and drinking Blood in their proper ſpecies, thought fit to cloath them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another ſpecies, but that the conſideration that obliged him to this, did not oblige him in the leaſt to deprive us of the reality of his Subſtance. For by what Authority does he</q> preſume to tell us what conſiderations moved our Saviour, or how far this or that conſideration ſhall oblige him? Or how has he proved that it was ever the intent of our bleſſed Saviour to give us the <hi>Real,</hi> as that ſignifies the <hi>fleſhly</hi> Subſtance of his Body to be by us <hi>carnally</hi> received?</p>
               <p>To accompliſh then the ancient Figures, we confeſs our bleſſed Saviour does give us his Body and Blood to poſſeſs us of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered for our Sins; but to maintain the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel, our eating muſt be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> not <hi>carnal.</hi> It matters not whether it be the plainneſs of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Words alone, or as joyned with other things that are ſaid concerning it in Scripture, that forceth us to confeſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what we do; we need no forcing, for we moſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge all we conceive the Scripture does oblige us to in it; and the Queſtion is, whether any thing ſaid therein will oblige us to take their Senſe, or does not oblige to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter into Diſpute of what the power of Chriſt can do, or whether his Dominion over univerſal Nature, can make his Body preſent in ſeveral places at once, and under ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and not deſtroy the properties of a Body in it; his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence having nothing to do herein any further than it appears his intent to bring ſomething to paſs by it. We may therefore without queſtioning what can be wrought by his omnipotent power, expect an Evidence that what they pretend him to bring to paſs thereby, was <hi>by him intended</hi> to be brought to paſs before we are obliged to believe it.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> will conclude it to be our Saviours intent to make that <hi>Bread</hi> to be <hi>no longer Bread,</hi> but to become the <hi>very Subſtance of his Body,</hi> is the thing in queſtion; which cannot be preſumed before we have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the whole Diſcourſe of our Saviour, and alſo what other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94907:38"/>
things are ſaid of it by his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26. we find it ſet down thus; <hi>Whilſt they were eating, Jeſus took Bread, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bleſſed, broke and gave it to his Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, Eat, this is my Body; and taking the Cup, and bleſſing, gave to them, ſaying, Drink all of this, for this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins: But I ſay unto you, that I drink not henceforth of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.</hi> When St. <hi>Matthew</hi> here tells us, that our Lord took <hi>Bread,</hi> and having bleſſed, brake, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and having took the <hi>Cup,</hi> and bleſſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> Is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he ſays, this <hi>Bread</hi> is my Body? Can <hi>this</hi> demonſtrate any thing, but what he gave to them, broke, bleſt, and took in order to it, when there is no mark given to know that he intended to ſpeak of ſomewhat elſe? Nor will it avail to ſay <hi>This</hi> does not demonſtrate that <hi>he took at first,</hi> becauſe he <hi>bleſſed</hi> after he had taken it, before he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> for at leaſt it muſt be that which he <hi>broke</hi> after he had given Thanks, and that of neceſſity is the <hi>ſame Bread</hi> that he took. Again, his words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> will never bear ſuch a forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as <hi>This Bread is now aboliſhed to make room for my Body;</hi> for his Affirmative <hi>Is,</hi> does not in the leaſt alter it, but requires and ſuppoſes the thing true at the time he ſpeaks it; <hi>This</hi> muſt be <hi>This,</hi> i. e. <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which God's Word demonſtrateth at the time that it is his Body and Blood. But whatever <hi>This</hi> may demonſtrate, it will be impoſſible to prove the Diſciples underſtood it to demonſtrate any thing which the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs not. Now when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> brings in our Lord ſpeaking <hi>after</hi> the delivery of the <hi>Cup,</hi> that he would not drink any more of the <hi>Vine,</hi> does he not apparently ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Wine after</hi> his delivery of it to his Diſciples, or at leaſt when he delivered it? Nor will it at all advantage them to ſay, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> makes him ſpeak it <hi>before</hi> the Conſecration or Bleſſing of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for whether he ſpoke it before or after, or both, it is certain that if St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had underſtood the <hi>Wine</hi> to be <hi>no more Wine,</hi> he could not have placed theſe words of our Lord <hi>after the delivery</hi> of the <hi>Cup.</hi> So when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? the Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> Does not he ſay that it is <hi>Bread</hi> ſtill, though it be the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? Nor ſhall any thing hinder but that the ſubſtance of Bread remaining, we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94907:39"/>
may ſpiritually communicate of his Body? If our Communion were carnal, poſſibly it might be difficult to underſtand; but that being not proved, nor to be proved, for the Reaſons given from the difference between the New and Old Teſtament, no man can find any difficulty in apprehending it?</p>
               <p>So then M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s great Bluſter about our <q>Saviour's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating uſually to his Diſciples what he taught in Parables and Figures, which is not done here; and his Omnipotence</q> to work whatever he ſaid, falls to nothing. For our Lord's Diſcourſe being eaſily intelligible according to our Senſe of his preſenting his Body and Blood under theſe Elements, to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually received; but not to be underſtood ſo eaſily in theirs, they have the moſt need to ſeek for an explication that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them to their Senſe; eſpecially ſince it is thus evident that the Apoſtles underſtood it to be Bread and Wine, as we do, ſo that 'tis they have made the forced Conſtruction by denying it. Nor can our Lord's Omnipotence take place here: till it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what he intended to bring to paſs thereby.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſays, <q>The Laws of Diſcourſe that teach us a Sign receives often the Name of the thing repreſented, yet will not allow it in a Sign that has no relation to the thing, as</q> in this inſtance of a morſel of Bread to ſignifie the Body of man: what if we ſhould ſay, the leſs relation it has to the thing, the further it is from being it; and the more probable to be only a Sign, how would he diſprove us by the Laws of Diſcourſe? which being uſed only to expreſs our Conceptions, can receive no more bounds than they. Yet had he conſidered but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which our bleſſed Saviour gives us his Body, to be the <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> of our Souls, he would not have determined ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, that Bread, which is the <hi>Food</hi> of our Bodies, has no analogy with that which is to <hi>feed</hi> our Souls. He might have found Examples even in holy Writ, where Chriſt calls himſelf a <hi>Door,</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> and a <hi>Vine;</hi> which things have yet not the leaſt analogy with the <hi>Body</hi> of a man, but yet ſufficiently repreſent the purpoſes for which he calls himſelf ſo, and are eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without conceiving him to be changed into a <hi>Door,</hi> &amp;c. or any of theſe to be changed into him.</p>

               <p>But whereas he pretends to take an advantage from an Anſwer generally uſed by us, That this Remembrance does not exclude all kind of Preſence but that which ſtrikes the Senſes; ſo as to make this his own, for that they, though they affirm <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be preſent, yet acknowledg at the ſame time that he is not preſent after a <hi>ſenſible manner.</hi> He muſt give me leave to ſay, that, not determining as yet any thing concerning our Doctrine till after it be explained and conſidered, his Anſwer is perfectly an <hi>Illuſion,</hi> in that though they pretend him not preſent in a <hi>ſenſible manner,</hi> i. e. <hi>viſibly</hi> appearing to their Senſes, yet they own him preſent in a <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>carnal manner,</hi> and to be eaten <hi>carnally;</hi> as if a man ſhould ſwallow a Pill in a Conſerve, the Pill is not taken in a <hi>ſenſible manner,</hi> but yet the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it is taken into the Stomach.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not therefore demand by that <hi>Query</hi> which he is pleaſed to call Equivocal, why they think it not enough to ſay, <hi>The Son of God is preſent to us by Faith;</hi> but by that he confeſſes to be without equivocation, how they come to know by Faith that he <hi>is preſent after a bodily or carnal manner?</hi> And whether his <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> though <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> known by Faith, is not ſufficient to work all the neceſſary Effects in the <hi>just man who lives by Faith?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe then that hold it no more than a bare ſign, and the Celebration and Communion thereof, barely the renewing our Profeſſion, or a remembrance only of Chriſt Crucified whom it repreſenteth, they are wide from the Church of <hi>England</hi> on the one ſide as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other. Nor do thoſe who only hold it a ſign effective to apply the benefits of the death of Chriſt, not ſuppoſing it to tender Chriſt as preſent to us, and to be received by us before we partake in the benefits of his death, expreſs exactly, in my judgment, the ſenſe of our Church: Although there is ſo near a conjunction of Chriſt with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that one cannot well be apprehended without the other.</p>
               <p>I conceive therefore, that in the ſenſe of our Church, not only the benefits of Chriſt, but <hi>Christ himſelf</hi> is tendred to us in this Holy Sacrament, and is to be <hi>eaten</hi> by us before we partake of his benefits, not that we are <hi>bodily</hi> to partake of him for this end, but in that it ſeems to be the intention of our bleſſed Savour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Elements, to give us himſelf and to put us in the actual poſſeſſion of himſelf; ſo that in the uſe of this ordinance as veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a man does bodily receive the earthly Creatures, ſo verily does he <hi>ſpiritually</hi> receive the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For our better apprehenſion of which Myſtery, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary more particularly to conſider, what it is which we do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by receive, and in what manner we are made partakers of it.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, the truth which we hold you ſee is this, that we do not here receive <hi>only</hi> the benefits that flow from Chriſt, but the <hi>very body and blood of Christ,</hi> i. e. Chriſt himſelf Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for as the bread and wine avails not to our bodily ſuſtenance, unleſs the ſubſtance of thoſe Creatures be firſt received, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we partake of the benefits of Chriſt to our ſpiritual relief, except we have firſt a Communion <hi>with Christ himſelf.</hi> This the words of our bleſſed Saviour. <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 57, Encline me to believe, where he ſays, that he that <hi>eateth him</hi> ſhall live by him, intimating that we muſt be <hi>partakers of him</hi> before we can have <hi>life from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94907:41"/>
him:</hi> So the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16, <hi>The bread which we break, Is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> evidently imply that we are therein to partake of Chriſt himſelf. This I take to be that great myſtery of our union with Chriſt, whereby we are made members of <hi>his body,</hi> of <hi>his fleſh,</hi> and of <hi>his bones:</hi> And this I look upon to be that <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the fleſh</hi> and <hi>drinking the blood</hi> of the Son of God in the 6th of St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if it be demanded how we can eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and partake of his body and blood; to conceive this eating in a <hi>carnal</hi> ſenſe, is as groſs an imagination as that of thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6, who asked within themſelves, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> we muſt not think then, that we cannot truly feed on Chriſt unleſs we receive his ſubſtance into our bellies, but muſt conſider that the <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks of muſt be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of his Goſpel, and therefore we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire therein what it is to eat and drink ſpiritually. Now then, if we conſider what appetites are in our ſouls, and what thoſe appetites crave, or ought at leaſt to long after, we ſhall eaſily diſcern what it is to eat and drink ſpiritually. Now we know, that in the 5th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> our Saviour intimates to us, that we ought to have a ſpiritual hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; which appetites being neceſſarily required in us, no man can hence have ſo groſs an imagination, as to conceive that we muſt take in the righteouſneſs thus hungred and thirſted after <hi>at our mouths,</hi> as we do our bodily food. Conſider then withal the words of our Lord, <hi>Joh. 6. 35, 36, I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirst: But I ſaid unto you, You have alſo ſeen me and believed not:</hi> And compare it with <hi>Verſ. 63, 64, It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh proſiteth nothing: The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life. But there are ſome of you that believe not.</hi> And judg from hence, Whether our Lord does not propoſe himſelf as that food which can give ſatisfaction to the ſpiritual hunger and thirſt of our ſouls; and if ſo, whether it can be thought that he is to be received any otherwiſe than <hi>ſpiritually</hi> for the ſatisfaction of thoſe appetites that are <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> And then withal conſider, <hi>Verſ. 27, Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but that which ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to eternal life;</hi> and, <hi>Verſ. 28, What ſhall we do to work the works of God:</hi> And, 29, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And, I ſuppoſe, it will perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that our Saviour ſpeaks not here of any eating but what is ſpiritual, and that, inaſmuch as when the People queſtioned him, <hi>What they ſhould do to work the works of God,</hi> upon his exhorting

them to <hi>labour after the meat that endureth to life eternal;</hi> he anſwers them, that <hi>to do his works is to believe on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> and again tells us, <hi>that he that cometh to him ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on him ſhall never thirſt;</hi> and again, that <hi>his words are ſpirit and life, but <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>at</hi> him is to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>lay hold</hi> on him by Faith. As for the <hi>Corporal eating</hi> we are expreſly told, that the fleſh <hi>thus taken,</hi> if it might be ſo taken, proſiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereas taken after that manner that Chriſt recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to us, it is of ſuch profit that it preſerveth the eater from death, and maketh him to live for ever. It is not therefore ſuch an eating with which every man that brings a bodily mouth can receive him, but a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> uniting of us to Chriſt, whereby he dwelleth in us and we in him.</p>
               <p>Neither is it in the leaſt neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be bodily preſent, which were indeed neceſſary, were our eating corporal or carnal; but being altogether ſpiritual and ſupernatural, there is no neceſſity of his <hi>local</hi> preſence. It is ſufficient for a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> union with Chriſt, that he and we, though diſtant in place, be knit together by that <hi>ſpiritual nexture,</hi> which is intimated to us by St. <hi>John,</hi> namely the <hi>quickning ſpirit,</hi> derived from him our Head, to us his Members, and a lively faith wrought by the ſame ſpirit, proceeding from us to lay hold on him. That this operation of the ſpirit is that which conſtitutes our union with Chriſt, cannot be doubted by any that will conſider, how, the Scripture tells us on the one hand, <note n="1" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> That Chriſt is made unto us a <hi>quickning ſpirit.</hi> 
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Joh. 5. 21.</note> That he <hi>quickneth</hi> whom he will. <note n="3" place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> That he having received the <hi>ſpirit without meaſure,</hi> we all partake of his fulneſs. And on the other ſide, <note n="1" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> That he that is joyned the Lord is <hi>one ſpirit.</hi> 
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> That we are all partakers of the <hi>ſame ſpirit.</hi> 
                  <note n="3" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 13.</note> That hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us by <hi>the ſpirit</hi> that he hath given us. For what can give a more plain evidence than this, that our union with Chriſt is wrought by the operation of this ſpirit of his deſcending from him upon us and working thoſe graces in us, that lift up our ſouls to take hold on and cleave unto him. The ſame is alſo plain from hence, that the Juſt are ſaid <hi>to live by faith,</hi> for are we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to live by that whereby we receive our food? Thus Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>That this is perfectly the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is evident from what I have made appear already in that ſhe teaches, <note n="1" place="margin">Artic. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>That the body of Christ is given, taken and eaten in the Lord's Supper only after an heavenly and ſpiritual manner, and the means
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94907:42"/>
whereby it is received and eaten is faith.</hi> And again, (2.) <hi>That this marvellous incorporation of Christ with us is wrought by the</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>(the</hi> very bread <hi>of our conjunction with Christ) through</hi> faith <hi>in the hearts of the faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus truly received the body and blood of Chriſt by faith, and being hereby perfectly united to him, we partake in all the benefits of his Death and Paſſion, and are put in the poſſeſſion of theſe benefits by our firſt poſſeſſing him.</p>
               <p>But if ſtill it be pleaded by M. <hi>Condom,</hi> that we cannot thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the participation of our bleſſed Saviour, and our participation of the fruits of his Death, unleſs we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the participation of his divine body and all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual participations by faith, and that if we participate of both ſpiritually by faith, we cannot participate of them as things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. I may, upon good reaſon, deny his ſuppoſition, and ſay, that we do perfectly diſtinguiſh them, and yet participate of both by <hi>faith ſpiritually:</hi> for what ſhould hinder, but that a man may conceive he partakes of things diſtinct, and yet partakes of both the ſame way, as a man eats different meats in one way of eating, but yet diſcovers them to be different.</p>
               <p>If he ſhould yet require me to explain what I mean by <hi>eating</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſpiritually</hi> by Faith, he puts me upon a thing very difficult, not becauſe it is not <hi>eaſily</hi> conceived, but becauſe it is moſt <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> to our apprehenſions: for who can by plainer words expreſs what our Saviour means by <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirſting</hi> after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? whereas it is not any difficulty of apprehending his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that makes it thus difficult to be expreſſed otherways, but that thoſe words are ſo obvious to our underſtandings that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can better expreſs it to our conception. But however, to give a more full ſatisfaction, I ſhall endeavour, if poſſible, to be yet more plain.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe therefore I muſt ſuppoſe, That God's <hi>tender</hi> of his Son Chriſt to us <hi>in the Sacrament</hi> does not greatly differ from his <hi>tender of him to the World,</hi> when he became fleſh and dwelt among us, any further than a <hi>general</hi> tender to the whole World from a <hi>peculiar</hi> tender to this or that particular perſon; and an offer of him, as of one that was ſent to be the Saviour of the World from the offer of him, as he has ſaved us: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſuppoſition is not groundleſs, for if God, out of the abundance of his love, ſent his Son into the World, that through him we might <hi>have everlaſting life,</hi> and that the World, through him might be <hi>ſaved,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and his fleſh in the Sacrament be given us, only that we may <hi>live</hi> thereby,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94907:42"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 6. 51. who ſhall deny but that when Chriſt is tendred to the <hi>ſame effect of giving us life,</hi> theſe ſeveral tenders are only different as a general tender from a particular application? eſpecially when we conſider again, that <hi>both</hi> take effect <hi>only</hi> in them that <hi>believe,</hi> as is plain, by comparing <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. with <hi>Chapter</hi> 6. 35. and ſhall it not then from hence follow, that our <hi>receiving</hi> him as firſt tendred by God to the whole World, and our <hi>eating</hi> him in the holy Sacrament, are of the ſame nature, preſerving only that difference I have premiſed? if <hi>believing</hi> be that which makes him ours in both offers, undoubtedly <hi>receiving</hi> in one reſpect and <hi>eating</hi> in the other, are no more than <hi>believing</hi> in both, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the difference between Faith, grounded upon a general Promiſe, and a particular Application. He that ſhall conſider what belief of him was then required, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note> To know the only <hi>true God,</hi> and his <hi>Son Jeſus Christ,</hi> whom he has ſent. <note n="2" place="margin">Joh. 5. 24.</note> To <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>believe</hi> on him that ſent him. <note n="3" place="margin">Rom. 10. 9.</note> To <hi>confeſs</hi> with the mouth the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in the heart, that <hi>God</hi> hath raiſed him from the dead. <note n="4" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> To rely on him whom <hi>God</hi> hath ſet forth to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through faith, in his blood: may eaſily reſolve what it is to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> the body and blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament, namely, that a man does then partake of Chriſt, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the death of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the crucifying of his fleſh, and the pouring out of his blood, with that faith that ſuppoſes all this to be true, and the ends of it to be ſuch as <hi>God</hi> has declared him to be given for, and by a further conſideration of the particular tender of Chriſt that is in this Sacrament, made to him for all thoſe <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> (if Chriſt, who is thus particularly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, be received by him as he ought to be) is induced to reſolve and undertake all which that belief does oblige him to, and with faith, grounded upon that reſolution, lays hold on and firmly relies on Chriſt for thoſe <hi>effects,</hi> for which he was firſt given to the World, and is now peculiarly tendred unto him. Then, I ſay, it is that a man <hi>truly eats</hi> the fleſh and <hi>drinks</hi> the blood of Chriſt: and certainly there cannot be found a more <hi>exact analogy</hi> than is between that <hi>nouriſhment</hi> of the body, in the ſtrength whereof it moves, and thoſe <hi>reaſons</hi> whereupon the mind frames its <hi>reſolutions</hi> to direct our converſation: and then <hi>God</hi> having further promiſed to communicate his holy ſpirit to all that out of a true faith reſolve upon <hi>the doing his will,</hi> and as many as have the holy Ghoſt, having thereby an <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt from whom this ſpirit is derived, have alſo an aſſurance that by <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> that dwelleth in them, their <hi>bodies</hi> ſhall be raiſed <hi>to life

everlaſting,</hi> Rom. 8. 11. whereby they that eat the body and blood of Chriſt are united and incorporated into one body with him, and ſhall not die but have everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>What then have I fully expreſs'd hereby all that the ſpiritual eating of Chriſt by faith implies? no certainly it is not poſſible to expreſs by words that infinite <hi>love of God</hi> wherewith he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Son unto us in this holy Myſtery, nor the myſterious ſupernatural, but efficacious application of him unto us; nor on the other ſide, the ſtrength, the vigor, the reſolution, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of that faith wherewith the pious ſoul (tranſported with that abundant love of <hi>God,</hi> that infinite and peculiar mercy which it ſenſibl<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in Chriſt; nor is it poſſible to expreſs the eagerneſs and impatience of thoſe appetites wherewith it hungers and thirſts after him, <hi>panting as the Hart after the water-brooks,</hi> till it be ſatisfied with him, or thoſe tranſcendent guſts which are taſted in receiving this divine, immortal Food.</p>
               <p>But by what I have been able to expreſs, I cannot but think any man may apprehend my conceptions, and how I clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the participation of Chriſt from the partaking of his benefits, the latter not being to be obtained but by firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the former, although all theſe benefits are indeed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo ſoon as we can conceive a man to have partaken of Chriſt. And that the Church of <hi>England</hi> does fully preſerve this diſtinction, appears more evidently by her Thankſgiving after the Communion, which begins thus, <hi>Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee for that thou dost vouchſafe to feed us who have duly received theſe holy Myſteries with the ſpiritual food of the most</hi> precious body <hi>and</hi> blood <hi>of thy Son, and dost aſſure us</hi> thereby <hi>of thy favour and goodneſs toward us, and that we are very members incorporate into his myſtical body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And hereupon, I conceive, I am enabled to determinate upon what ground he, that eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eats and drinks his own damnation, although he does not therein eat or drink the body and blood of Chriſt, for he diſcerns not the Lords body. For if this was the condemnation when God firſt ſent his Son into the World, that men <hi>believed</hi> not in the Name of the only begotten Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. who can deny but that this ſhall be the greater condemnation to all that come to this Sacrament, wherein Chriſt is pleaſed to make a peculiar tender of himſelf, requiring every one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, that they have not <hi>believed</hi> on, nor <hi>received</hi> the bleſſed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94907:43"/>
Son of God, who is herein ſo peculiarly and particularly, ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and ſo mercifully tendred to their reception.</p>
               <p>I foreſee an <hi>Objection</hi> levelled againſt the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that I have thus explained, which muſt be here anſwered: it is this, That if Chriſt be only here eaten ſpiritually by faith, we have many times faith and the ſpirit of God before, and ſo might eat him without coming to this Sacrament: To which I anſwer, The ſpirit is received in divers meaſures, and faith beſtowed upon us in different degrees, upon which account our conjunction with Chriſt may every day be made ſtraiter, and our hold firmer. To receive the ſpirit not by meaſure, is the priviledge of our Head, we that receive it out of his fulneſs, muſt daily look for it to be <note n="1" place="margin">Phil. 1. 19.</note> ſupplied unto us. <note n="2" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> So alſo the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> from one degree and meaſure of it to another, and conſequently we muſt ſtill labour and pray to him <note n="3" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 3. 10.</note> to encreaſe our faith. As we have therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt, ſo we muſt walk in him, <note n="4" place="margin">Eph. 4. 15.</note> growing up unto him in all things which is our Head, from whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, maketh encreaſe of the body, unto the edifying of itſelf in love: and for this end hath God ordained Publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his Church, <note n="6" place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note> for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt: wherefore God hath made them able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, <note n="7" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> even Miniſters of <hi>the ſpirit</hi> that giveth life, <note n="8" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5.</note> Miniſters by whom we <hi>believe</hi> even as the Lord gives to every man. When we have therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit and faith, we muſt deſire <note n="9" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> to <hi>grow</hi> thereby, and as grown men too, we muſt deſire this food of the Lord's Table to continue our ſtrength; of which, being made partakers, the Lord doth grant us <note n="10" place="margin">Eph. 3. 16, 19.</note> to be ſtrengthened with might by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt dwelling in our hearts by faith, and being rooted and grounded in love may comprehend and know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, and be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</p>
               <p>Hereby therefore all that M. <hi>Condom</hi> argues from the Doctrines of the Reformed in this point falls to nothing, that which he urges againſt thoſe who ſay the Sacraments are <hi>bare ſigns,</hi> proves nothing to the prejudice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I have ſhewn, accounts them to be <hi>Seals exhibitive</hi> of the body and blood of Chriſt. So for the advantage that he builds upon from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94907:44"/>
the <hi>Gallican Catechiſm,</hi> which he tells us, teaches, That though Chriſt be <hi>truly</hi> communicated to us both by Baptiſm and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet nevertheleſs it is <hi>only in part,</hi> and <hi>not fully:</hi> I, for my own part, ſhould not ſtick to ſay as much, and I preſume the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given above for the neceſſity of this Sacrament, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly juſtifie me in it, and that I need not, upon this account, be forced to hold any other participation of Chriſt in the holy Sacrament, than that by ſpiritual faith. Nor ſhould I ſtick to ſay what the <hi>Gallican</hi> Confeſſion does concerning our partaking of Chriſt's ſubſtance, namely, <hi>Although Christ be in Heaven, there to remain, till he come to judge the World, yet we believe that through the ſecret and incomprehenſible power of his ſpirit he nouriſbeth and quickneth us by the ſubſtance of his body and blood, apprehended or</hi> received by faith. Nor need I by this be obliged to allow the ſubſtance of Chriſt to be otherwiſe than <hi>ſpiritually eaten,</hi> or that our union is any other than the participation of his quickning ſpirit. As little is the advantage he pretends from another thing in their <hi>Catechiſm, That the body of our Lord Jeſus, offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God, is now given to aſſure us of that reconciliation;</hi> it having been ſhewn how our bleſſed Saviour is truly tendred to that effect in this holy Sacrament, and yet that Chriſt is to be received ſpiritually and by faith to that effect; alſo that with this Doctrine there may be and is an apparent diſtinction maintained between the participation of Chriſt and that of his benefits.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewn his <hi>Objections</hi> all invalid, I need not enter into a particular diſcuſſion of the large Harangue he makes upon them, which is no other than an illuſion. But to ſhew him that is ſo good at finding out difficulties for us, that we need not ſeek far to find ſome for them. Let him reſolve us according to their Principles, Firſt, How <hi>Christ</hi> being, as they ſay, <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> received by them into their bowels, there ſhould be any need of receiving this Sacrament more than once: They cannot uſe the anſwer inſiſted on by us, for that they plead they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not by faith ſpiritually; and to find a way of ſolving it, they muſt ſhew how <hi>Christ,</hi> that is once truly received into their bodies, goes out again. Again, Let them ſhew us how the body and blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> which being bodily preſent, is alſo bodily received and eaten both by good and bad, ſhould turn to the ſalvation of one, and damnation of the other, when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>whoſo eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> Joh. 6. 54. They cannot ſay the one eats him ſpiritually, the other not, ſince they make the <hi>ſacramental</hi> eating not to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94907:44"/>
ſpiritual, both therefore eating him <hi>ſacramentally,</hi> we are to look for a reaſon of its different effects. Nay, let them ſhew us how, when <hi>Christ</hi> tells us <hi>his fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> (which muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be underſtood, if <hi>carnally</hi> received, according to the groſs conception of thoſe that queſtioned how he would give them his fleſh to eat) their eating it, which is no other than taking the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his fleſh <hi>into their bodies</hi> ſhould be at all profitable to eternal life.</p>

               <p>TO return then, with M. <hi>Condom,</hi> to conſider their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation and Adoration conſequent upon it. I ſhall not diſpute with him whether thoſe ſpecies or accidents that remain, ſuppoſing, according to their Doctrine, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Elements changed, be a ſign or not.

               <p>Nor will it ſignifie any thing to ſay as M. <hi>Condom,</hi> That ſome of the moſt learned and intelligent of the Reformed have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thoſe who are perſwaded of the real preſence of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in the Sacrament, ought to pay him in it their adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who they are that have ſaid ſo much, I am not concerned to ſearch, poſſibly ſome may have ſaid, that if he was indeed really preſent, as they ſay, Adoration ought to be given to him: but none, I believe, that all who are perſwaded of its being ſo, ought to pay it him there, ſo as to imply, that men ought upon a perſwaſion that may be falſe to venture upon an action that is Idolatry, if it ſhould be falſe, without examining the grounds on which they hold ſuch a vain perſwaſion and deſtructive

                  <hi>The offering of Christ, once made, is that perfect Redemption, Propitiation and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, both Original and Actual, and there is none other Satisfaction for ſin, but that alone.</hi> Wherefore the Sacrifices of Maſſes, in the which it was commonly ſaid, that the Prieſts did offer <hi>Christ</hi> for the quick and dead, to have remiſſion of pain or guilt, were blaſphemous Fables and dangerous Deceits. Nevertheleſs it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhe does not ſtick to call the holy Sacrament, <note n="1" place="margin">Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after the Communion.</note> 
                  <hi>A Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thanksgiving,</hi>

Further, She directs us moſt fully to render our ſouls and bodies an acceptable Sacrifice to the ſervice of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>So that whilſt M. <hi>Condom</hi> has thus ambiguouſly explicated their Doctrine, the difference does not appear ſo great as really it is; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not content, if we ſay, that <hi>the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thanksgiving,</hi> or a <hi>comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative Sacrifice, repreſenting that upon the Croſs;</hi> but requires <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Trid.</hi> Seſſ. 22. can. 3.</note> that we acknowledge it <hi>a true propitiatory Sacrifice:</hi> and decrees <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all that do not own it to be truly ſuch. So that when M. <hi>Condom</hi> tells us from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> 
                  <q>That this Sacrifice is inſtituted only to repreſent that which was once accompliſhed on the Croſs, to perpetuate the Memory of it, and to apply its ſaving Virtue for the remiſſion of ſins, which we daily commit: All this muſt be allowed true, and</q> the proper ends of the Inſtitution of the <hi>Holy Sacrament:</hi> But the Council pleads them <q>for the Inſtitution of a <hi>different</hi> thing, a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as diſtinct from a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as is plain in that very</q> 
                  <note place="margin">Seſſ. 22. cap. 1.</note> Chapter: Which is more fully expreſt in the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94907:45"/>
teaches, <q>That the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was inſtituted by our Lord for <note place="margin">Cat. Trid. ſub Titulo <hi>Euch. Sacrif.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Two Cauſes;</hi> one to be our <hi>heavenly Food,</hi> and to preſerve us in our ſpiritual Life; the other, That the Church might have a <hi>perpetual Sacrifice</hi> for the expiation of Sins. Then it</q> tells us <q>that theſe two Ends are greatly different; the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is perfected by the <hi>Conſecration;</hi> but the efficacy of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> conſiſts in its being <hi>offered.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> whilſt it is in the Pyx, or when it is carried to the Sick, is only a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> not a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Again, as a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it is only Matter of <hi>Merit</hi> to them that receive; but as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it is effectual both to <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> for as Chriſt by his Sufferings merited and ſatisfied for us, ſo thoſe that offer <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 22.</note> this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> merit the Fruits of his Paſſion, and ſatisfie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Hereupon the Council further decrees, <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> That this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> be offered as <hi>propitiatory,</hi> not only for the Sins, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, ſatisfactions, and other Neceſſities of the <hi>Living,</hi> but likewiſe for the <hi>Dead</hi> that are not throughly purged from their Guilt. And then <note n="2" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> It approves and commends <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſſes,</hi> wherein the Prieſt alone communicates, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</q> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for all the People. Thence <note n="3" place="margin">Can. 3.</note> It condemns thoſe who ſay, <hi>it is profitable only to them that communicate,</hi> or that ſay, <hi>it ought not to be offered for the Sins, Puniſhments, Satisfactions and other Neceſſities both of the Dead and Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Diſpute then ought not to be reduced to the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> only, as M. <hi>Condom</hi> would perſwade us; but to theſe further Queries.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Upon what ground they make our Saviour in the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his <hi>laſt Supper,</hi> to have inſtituted it to a <hi>different Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> than that of a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> ſo as it may be a <hi>Sacrament</hi> to a man when it is not a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice propitiatory</hi> for them that <hi>partake not</hi> of it as a <hi>Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Upon what ground they make this Action as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice diſtinct from that of communicating, <hi>propitiatory</hi> for the <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Upon what account they attribute a certain Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to this offering of Chriſt, which a man <hi>obtains not by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his Body and Blood</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> whereas if all the virtue be by them confeſs'd to be from <hi>Chriſt's Sacrifice</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> he that is a <hi>partaker of Chriſt,</hi> muſt certainly by being ſo, be partaker of <hi>all the Merits and Satisfaction</hi> of his Death?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Upon what ground they warrant their <hi>private Maſſes</hi> to be propitiatory for particular perſons whether dead or living,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94907:46"/>
for whom they offer them, having no warrant from their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to make application of his Merits to them in <hi>this way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor does any thing ſaid by M. <hi>Condom,</hi> give us the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to theſe Demands; for he ſhews us but a very inſufficient ground upon which he does not doubt but this Action, as diſtinct from that of communicating, makes God propitious to us, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>becauſe it repreſents his Son Chriſt unto him as crucified.</q> For to ground a Hope, he ſhould have ſhewn us a <hi>Promiſe</hi> that God would be propitious upon ſuch a Repreſentation. We doubt not but Jeſus Chriſt preſenting himſelf before the face of God, is powerful in his interceſſion for us; but what aſſurance have we that upon every fancied Repreſentation of ours, we can cauſe him thus to preſent himſelf? For preſume him preſent from the <hi>Conſecration</hi> we cannot, till the <hi>End</hi> to which his Preſence is applied by private Maſſes, be firſt ſhewn to be the <hi>End of Chriſt's Inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing Bread and Wine</hi> to be uſed to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and after ſuch a way. Nor does M. <hi>Condom</hi> pretend to ſhew us by what authority his Church warrants the application of this Sacrifice to the Dead that are in <hi>Purgatory-pains,</hi> or to the Living that come not to partake thereof.</p>
               <p>View then but this Doctrine which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that as it is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it is more available than as a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it is applied to thoſe who <hi>do not partake of it</hi> as a Sacrament, that alſo as ſuch it is <hi>propitiatory</hi> for the ſins, puniſhments, ſatisfactions, and all other neceſſities not of the living only, but likewiſe of the dead: and judge whether this Doctrine does not in effect, yea in reality void the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, who bleſſed Bread and Wine <hi>for this only purpoſe,</hi> that we might <hi>take, eat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and thereby partake of his Body and Blood; in that it not only lays aſide the End of his Inſtitution, but ſets up a new Action of a greater value, as is pretended; in that alſo whilſt it pretends to apply the Benefits of Chriſt's Death by this new means, it takes off the neceſſity of uſing that of our Saviour's own appointment, and occaſions men to be wholly careleſs of it, when hereby they are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to partake of all his Benefits, and incur not the danger they would if they ſhould come to partake of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with impenitent hearts; in that likewiſe it pretends this Sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory for men after Death, thereby in a great meaſure void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of a Chriſtian Life: eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Doctrine which is commonly taught in that Church, that this Sacrifice avails <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that all the Benefits of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94907:46"/>
Chriſt are derived upon the People by the very <hi>external Work done,</hi> the people not being concerned in or aſſiſting to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, either in their Prayers or participation, and withal their practice of ſacrificing for any whatever dying within their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to free them from the pains of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

               <head>Of his Reflections.</head>
               <p>BY the Grounds then upon which I have proceeded, I am little concerned with the Explication he gives of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to ſhew that their Doctrine of the Sacrifice, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all the virtue wholly to the Sacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs, does not impeach or prejudice its efficacy, which the Apoſtle there pleads. Which if it were granted (as that it cannot well be, for that they have ſet up a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which ſhall make God more propitious to us than the <hi>Sacrament</hi> which does poſſeſs us of all the Benefits of Chriſt's Death) yet this could no way juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them in ſetting up a Sacrifice repreſentative of Chriſt's Death to Effects which he had not appointed, pretending thereby to make application of his Sacrifice on the Croſs, which he has not warranted them to apply by ſuch means, and to ſuch perſons alſo as they cannot from Scripture warrant it beneficial to.</p>
               <p>However notwithſtanding M. <hi>Condom</hi> ſeems to remove all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the Word <hi>Offer,</hi> he either ſtill uſes it equivocally, or expreſſes not the Senſe of thoſe of his Communion; for <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> places not the Sacrifice only in preſenting to God Chriſt crucified, but in deſtroying the Elements that were there before, and making Chriſt preſent under their Species as dead on the Croſs: And the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> favours this Senſe, when it ſays, <hi>The Prieſts that ſacrifice act not in their own perſons, but in the perſon of Chriſt, when they make to be preſent his Body and Blood:</hi> So that if we conſider this, eſpecially if joyned with the Doctrine of <hi>Eckius,</hi> that thoſe Repreſentations which the Church makes of Chriſt as dead, by making his Body as ſuch, to appear before God, and his Blood as ſeparate from it by theſe Ceremonies that are uſed in this Action, are the things that conſtitute the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Againſt whom <hi>Chemnitius</hi> diſputes ſo largely from this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> If this be conſidered, it will be evident that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94907:47"/>
in this Epiſtle was not made uſe of to ſuch impertinent purpoſe againſt them, as this Gentleman pretends.</p>
               <p>In his Reflections there is little material for me to conſider, the Grounds of all their Doctrine being overthrown. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he preſſes it ſo earneſtly, I muſt take notice of the main thing in it: Here then, he would firſt perſwade us that the main difference between us, is that of the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi> This we indeed allow, That their Error in this Point is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrines they build upon it; but this makes it not neceſſary, that their conſequent Doctrines and Practices ſhall not be judged more prejudicial to Chriſtianity than their firſt Error. There ſcarce ever was a Hereſie but pretended to deduce all its Errors from ſome Doctrine that had appearance of Truth, and that did not in itſelf expreſly contradict or prejudice the Faith, though by the progreſſion, they drew from it, the whole Faith has been ſubverted.</p>
               <p>But then he farther argues, <q>That the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> is owned by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> though they conſider not the conſequences of it; That the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> themſelves have declared the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Doctrine to have no poyſon in it, and that it does not ſubvert the Foundations of Faith: That further ſome <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> have ſaid, that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> reaſon better, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently than the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> whence he concludes, <hi>It is an eſtabliſhed Truth,</hi> that the <hi>Roman.</hi> Doctrine in this point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing but the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. An Inference that has not the leaſt coherence with</q> the Premiſes: Can any man of Senſe allow this a rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The <hi>Lutherans</hi> hold a <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> the <hi>Calvinists</hi> ſay, <hi>There is no Poyſon in their Doctrine;</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> admit not ſuch Conſequences as we do; the <hi>Calvinists</hi> ſay we reaſon better than the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> therefore it is an <hi>eſtabliſhed Truth that our Doctrine contains nothing but the</hi> Real Preſence rightly underſtood. But to anſwer it ſo far as it may ſeem any way to give him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: The <hi>Lutherans</hi> do indeed hold a <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in a Senſe different from that I have explained; but then they do no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude their Senſe upon others as a neceſſary condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; ſo that we may communicate with them without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their error; nor do they hold ſuch a <hi>Local Preſence</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor does their Opinion lead them to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any Creature, nor do they acknowledge any Preſence of Chriſt therein, but only in the act and to the end of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament; and if this has led ſome to a Declaration that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Opinion does not ſubvert the foundation of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94907:47"/>
Faith, upon this account that it proceeds not to any further Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects deſtructive of it, ſhall this be taken for an acknowledgment that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which obliges to ſuch practices upon it as are inconſiſtent with the Faith, is not ſuch as ought to break communion with her.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe it to have been ſaid that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> reaſon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more conſequently than the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> if it has been ſaid by any of thoſe that allowed Communion with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> it's manifeſt, that when they ſaid ſo, they did not think but that the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine was much more inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity. And that the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may ſee it is ſo, I ſhall tranſcribe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which a <hi>Lutheran</hi> gives us, between the Adoration they tender Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and that which is given by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He places the difference chiefly in two Particulars, <q>Firſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gerhard</hi> Loc. Com De ſacra Caena de Vener.</note> 
                     <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or <hi>all that</hi> which according our Lord's Inſtitution we receive, ſhould be adored with the honour due to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The <hi>Lutherans</hi> on the contrary, knowing the Sacrament to conſiſt of two things, the one earthly, the other heavenly, direct their Adoration not to the Elements that remain, leſt worſhiping them, they ſhould be found Worſhippers of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to Chriſt alone, God and Man, who in that Action gives them his Body and Blood. Secondly, That the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> when they plead for the Adoration and worſhip of the Sacrament, do not principally intend, that Chriſt, God and Man, ſhould be adored in the <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of his divine Inſtitutions but labour to eſtabliſh an Adoration</q> of the bread at other times than in the uſe commanded by Chriſt, namely, when they carry it about in Proceſſions, (which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does in the very <hi>Chapter</hi> wherein it commands the Adoration of the Sacrament.) And then afterwards he fully informs us of the manner of the <hi>Lutheran</hi>'s worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That they look not upon Chriſt as <hi>locally preſent</hi> in the bread, or that there is any <hi>perſonal union</hi> between the bread and the body of Chriſt, but that Chriſt hath promiſed in that action his preſence by his grace after a peculiar manner. Therefore as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  </q> worſhipp'd not the Wood, nor Gold, nor the Cherubims that were upon the Ark of the Teſtimony, but God alone who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his preſence there, ſo the Adoration which they give to Chriſt in the Sacrament is to be underſtood to be directed to him only, not at all to the outward Elements. And the reaſon why they did not worſhip him out of the Sacramental exerciſe, he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94907:48"/>
ſays was, becauſe the promiſe of Chriſt's preſence cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the intent and action which he inſtituted. So that there appears a viſible and moſt conſiderable difference between theſe two, the one cannot be Idolatrous, becauſe it directs not any worſhip to a creature, the other certainly is if the creatures remain, becauſe their worſhip is terminated in the Sacrament as its object.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas M. <hi>Condom</hi> further endeavours to perſuade us, <q>That their Sacrifice is a conſequent Doctrine upon the real Preſence, and that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> underſtand not themſelves ſo well as they, in that they have not admitted it. The Reader</q> may judge which have the better underſtanding, if he does but conſider that the reaſon, upon which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> reject the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, is the ſame upon which they reject Adoration out of the Sacramental Action, namely, becauſe we have no warrant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves Chriſt's Preſence in the Euchariſt, but only in that Action which he commands, and for thoſe ends for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it: This, I remember, is that which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> pleads at large in his Book <hi>de Sacrificio Miſſae.</hi>

               <p>UPon this point, the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares, <q>

                     <hi>of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-People, for</hi> both <hi>the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's Ordinance and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be administred to all Chriſtian men alike.</hi>
                  </q> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing can be more plain from our Lord's inſtitution of this Sacrament (when he bleſſed both bread and wine, and ſaid, <hi>Take, eat, drink, do this in remembrance of me)</hi> that all that are obliged to any part of it are obliged to the whole: There being not the leaſt limitation of the Lawgiver's intent in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept itſelf, nor in any other part of Scripture, nor, which is more, in the practice of the Church originally under the Apoſtles, or generally throughout Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe we are ſo frequently deſired by theſe Gentlemen, to take ſpecial notice of the firſt grounds of the ſeparation, I am obliged to take notice here that this was one of the principal cauſes of it; their with-holding the Cup being that which was univerſally complained of, that which was moſt expreſly deſired
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94907:48"/>
and Petitioned for, both to Pope and Council, but in vain: We therefore may reaſonably expect ſomething ſatisfactory in this Point.</p>
               <p>To anſwer our expectation, M. <hi>Condom</hi> lets us know, <q>That under one Species, all that is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Sacrament is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in that there being now no real ſeparation betwixt the Body and the Blood, we receive entirely him who is ſolely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſatiate us: And this, he tells us, is the ſolid foundation upon which his Church, interpreting the precept of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, has declared, we may receive the ſatisfaction which this Sacrament carries with it, under one ſole Species, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her Children to it. But now if this be the foundation</q> ſhe builds upon, and it be ſolid too, we may well ſeek for it in the Apoſtles, or in Chriſt himſelf, but certainly neither of theſe ſupport the building, nay, the foundation which Chriſt has laid is rejected and laid aſide hereby; For to what purpoſe does this Doctrine ſerve, but to make it appear that our Lord inſtituted this Sacrament in <hi>both</hi> kinds to no end, ſince as much muſt needs be received in <hi>one</hi> as in <hi>both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas he endeavours to ground this Doctrine upon the real Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, it's certain, that if he be really preſent by <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>Conſecration,</hi> he can be preſent only <hi>according to it;</hi> if therefore his words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> make his <hi>body</hi> preſent in the <hi>bread,</hi> and the other, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his <hi>blood</hi> preſent inſtead of the <hi>wine,</hi> then his blood can be no more preſent in the bread than his body in the wine, neither can any thing more be preſent under bread than his body, nor under wine than his blood, according to their Principles, which found the neceſſity of his preſence upon the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of the words. And to how little purpoſe has M. <hi>Condom</hi> laboured to perſuade us, that it is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> becauſe the word of God is the ſpiritual Sword which makes a <hi>myſtical Separation</hi> betwixt the body and blood of Chriſt? if now at laſt there be no <hi>ſacramental Separation</hi> of his blood from his body, but they are both together under one species.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the Church (ſays he) has not thus reduced her Children to one Species out of diſ-eſteem of the other, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to hinder thoſe irreverences which the confuſion and negligence of the People had occaſioned in theſe later Ages.</q> Had he told us what Irreverencies had been occaſioned, that could not have been prevented but by this means, he had ſaid ſomething that poſſibly might have ſhewn the care of his Church; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has not been ſo kind, I ſhall tranſcribe the many, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94907:49"/>
thoſe ſaid to be <hi>great</hi> and <hi>important,</hi> Reaſons which ſhe gives as the account of her ſo doing to her Children in her Catechiſm; <q>Firſt, Becauſe ſpecial care ought to be taken that the blood of <note place="margin">Cat. Trid. ſub Titulo Euch. Sac. quando ſumend.</note> the Lord be not ſpilt on the ground, which cannot eaſily be avoided in adminiſtring to a great multitude. Secondly, Becauſe the Euchariſt being to be kept for the ſick, it was greatly to be feared that the Species of the wine would not keep but might ſour; a thing very greatly to be feared, whilſt the <hi>ſubſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is the blood of Christ.</hi> Thirdly, Many men cannot abide the taſte nor ſmell of wine, wherefore that that which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for ſpiritual health might not prejudice the health of the Body, it was very wiſely enacted by the Church, that all her faithhful Children ſhould receive one kind alone. To this</q> may be added other reaſons, <q>That in ſome Countries wine is ſcarce, and cannot be gotten without long and tedious Journeys. But that which is <hi>moſt of all to the purpoſe,</hi> the Hereſie of ſuch was to be rooted out, as declared whole Chriſt to be under both Species, and ſaid the Body only was contained in the bread and the blood in the wine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But he further tells us, <q>That the Church has reſerved to her ſelf the re-eſtabliſhment of both kinds, according as it ſhould become more advantagious to Peace and Unity. 'Tis well ſhe</q> has kept to herſelf a Power of re-eſtabliſhing that which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had Power to diſ-eſtabliſh, but how forward ſhe has been to do any thing towards Peace and Unity, all the World ſees by her ſirſt occaſioning ſo great a breach by this very thing: And to me her laſt reaſon that ſhe gives, makes it evident, that ſhe ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and juſtifies her Sacriledg, which robs Chriſtians of their Birthright, to the apparent prejudice of Peace, yea, to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Unity impoſſible, unleſs men will part with their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>But it's moſt ridiculous, when he comes to conclude from the conceſſion of ſome Proteſtants, <q>That bread alone might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, in caſe a man made proteſtation of a natural aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to wine; that therefore, according to the Principles of the Reformed, the matter in queſtion regards not Faith, and ſo is altogether in the Power of the Church. For without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining</q> whether their deciſion be right or wrong, can it be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from them that allow the Church may adminiſter it only in one Species, in caſe of ſuch <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that therefore the Church has authority to refuſe adminiſtring it in both whereſoever ſhe pleaſes to refuſe it? Can it be ſaid, that thoſe who allow her a Power to diſpenſe with <hi>ſome</hi> in caſe of <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94907:49"/>
allow her any Power to prohibit <hi>all People,</hi> who are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the caſe, and being not comprehended, look upon themſelves greatly injured by being thus deprived of it? And whereas he infers from hence that it regards not Faith, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as ſtrong, as if becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>not circumciſed</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> it ſhould be ſaid the Synagogue might have diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed afterwards with that Law, and ſaid that Circumciſion was not <hi>eſſentially neceſſary</hi> to a <hi>Jew,</hi> becauſe in a caſe of neceſſity where it could not be uſed, <hi>Jews</hi> had lived without it.</p>

               <head>Of the written and unwritten Word.</head>
               <p>WHereas he ſays, <q>That the unwritten Word was the firſt Rule of Chriſtianity, and when the Writings of the New Teſtament were added, this did not loſe its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that whatever was taught by the Apoſtles by Writing or Word of Mouth is to be received with equal veneration, and that it is a ſign that a Doctrine comes from the Apoſtles, when it is univerſally received by all Chriſtian Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſibility of ſhewing its beginning: I muſt not admit</q> it but with theſe limitations; Firſt, That nothing ſhall be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on us, as a Doctrine coming from the Apoſtles, but what ſhall evidently appear to have been <hi>univerſally</hi> received <hi>by all Chriſtian Churches without beginning,</hi> and that as <hi>fully</hi> to in <hi>all the parts of it,</hi> that ſhall now be pleaded for. For it is in vain to tell us that ſome things were delivered by the Apoſtles by Word of Mouth, and thoſe that have been from the beginning ſo received in the Chriſtian Church univerſally throughout all Ages and Places ought to be looked upon as ſuch; unleſs what ever they would have us ſubmit to as ſuch be made appear ſo to be. Secondly, That theſe Traditions be not acknowledged <hi>of themſelves</hi> ſufficient to build any <hi>matter of Faith</hi> upon, and this for two Reaſons; one, becauſe we cannot have that certainty of theſe as ought to be had to ground any thing as neceſſary to ſalvation; of this all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are an evident proof, for undoubtedly the Apoſtles wrote not any thing to their Churches which they had not by preceding inſtructions gave them ability to underſtand; notwithſtanding which, we ſee thoſe inſtructions are now in great part loſt, though the Scriptures are preſerved, and they were ſo ſoon gone
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94907:50"/>
out of the Church, that in a few Ages after the Apoſtles, we find men giving them divers interpretations: The other, becauſe we are told, <hi>The Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15. which (though ſpoken of the Writings of the Old Teſtament, yet ſince none can deny the Divine Providence to have had the ſame end in ordering and inſpiring the Writers of both, namely, that the Scriptures ſhould be written for our Learning,) is as undeniable a Truth with reference to the New as Old Teſtament, ſo that whatſoever is neceſſary to ſalvation, muſt be either contained in or deducible from them. Whereupon the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſſes, <q>That Holy Scripture contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Art. 6.</note> all things neceſſary to ſalvation; ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to ſalvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe exceptions which were neceſſary, in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes laid down, are altogether needleſs, if we look to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion inferred, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That we ought not to wonder if they, being careful to gather all their Fathers left them, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Depoſition of Tradition as well as that of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Certainly no man ever blamed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for</q> keeping the Tradition ſhe received from the Apoſtles, but for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Traditions that were never depoſited with her, much leſs with the whole Church.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> indeed, in its firſt Decree, is very reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved concerning Traditions, and ſpeaks cautiouſly thus, <q>The Holy Synod (finding Chriſt's Truth and Holy Diſcipline, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scriptures, and partly in unwritten Traditions, which either were taken from Chriſt's Mouth by the Apoſtles, or were <note place="margin">Seſſ. 4.</note> delivered by the Apoſtles themſelves, inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and have paſſed as it were from hand to hand to us, and following the example of the Orthodox Fathers) doth, with the like Religious affection, receive all the Books of the New and Old Teſtament, as alſo the Traditions themſeves pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Faith and Manners: But under this fair pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</q> Traditions either taken <hi>from Chriſt's Mouth,</hi> or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves</hi> and paſſed <hi>from hand to hand</hi> unto them; they make their Decrees by Traditions of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, Traditions of yeſterday, ſuch as appear neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways nor univerſally received, abuſing likewiſe their more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to juſtifie all the abuſes time and ſuperſtition brought in. Thus they pretend their Decree for the Worſhip of Saints and Relicks, and the uſe of Images, according to the <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94907:50"/>
Practice of the Catholick Church in the firſt times,</hi> and conſent of Fathers, and Decrees of Councils; when yet M. <hi>Condom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with Tradition but from the fourth Century, if we would allow it him: And ſo the Gentlemen do well to plead, that we ſhould receive a Doctrine as coming from the Apoſtles, when it is univerſally received without poſſibility of ſhewing its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by all Chriſtian Churches, thereby to obtrude that which had no beginning in it for three hundred years. Thus they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Indulgences to have been in uſe in the Church in the moſt ancient times, when yet they could not but be ſenſible that <hi>the uſe of them</hi> was perverted to a quite <hi>different</hi> purpoſe from its <hi>antient end;</hi> and notwithſtanding their deſire that they might be reſtored to ancient Cuſtom, yet we know the Novel is ſtill the modern practice. Thus for Purgatory the Council commands that ſound Doctrine be taught concerning it from the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when no ſuch thing appears either anciently or univerſally in the Church. And yet at another time, that which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath taught, and was delivered both to and from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſhall not ſerve to make it neceſſary. Thereupon it Decrees, <note place="margin">Seſſ. 21. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <q>That though Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament under both kinds, and delivered it in both to his Apoſtles, yet this does not bind all men to receive it in both.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now then for theſe men to preſs Traditions on us when they will neither let us know what nor how many they are, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe any bounds to them, nor ſix any certain Rules to diſcern them by, nor be obliged themſelves to ſtand by them; and under that pretence, to come now fifteen hundred years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and impoſe on us the ſingle Tradition of one Church, nay, not only her ancient and original Traditions, but Novelties foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in to maintain her corruptions, and theſe as we pretend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Scripture and ancient Tradition: And all this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline an indifferent Tryal by Scripture, under pretence that all neceſſary Truths cannot be found therein without recourſe to Tradition; if putting on, I ſay, ſo fair a diſguiſe to ſo frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent a purpoſe, they urge this Argument, that the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered things by word of mouth which ought to be received, as of any force to oblige us to receive all which they have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to tell us comes from them, What is it but a vain endeavour to impoſe on the World as if all men had loſt common ſenſe and underſtanding?</p>

               <head>Of the Authority of the Church.</head>
               <p>UPon this ſubject M. <hi>Condom</hi> writes after ſo rambling and confuſed a manner, that I muſt firſt be at the trouble to pick out what he deſigns to prove, before the ſolidity of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments can be examined. His aim then I take to be couched in thoſe words, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. wherein he concludes from the Article of our Creed concerning the Holy Catholick Church, <q>That they oblige themſelves to acknowledge an <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>perpetual verity</hi> in the Univerſal Church. Now herein he has neither</q> expreſly told us what this Univerſal Church is, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, or all other Chriſtian Churches with it; nor whether he means the Church collective, the whole body of Chriſtians; or repreſentative, the Biſhops in Council, or the Pope, where ſome fix this Infallibility. But whereas he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confounds the Catholick Church with the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which, by her Decrees, if we believe him, has tied herſelf up, that ſhe cannot make herſelf Miſtreſs of our Faith; I conceive I may, without offence, determine, that the verity he intends to prove is, that there is an Infallibility reſting ſomewhere in the Catholick Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which, if he would oblige us to conſent, it had been but reaſonable to have ſixt this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in ſomething certain, though, at preſent, I will not ſtand upon it, but conſider his Diſcourſe, which begins thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Church being eſtabliſhed by God to be the Guardian of Scripture and Tradition, we receive the Canonical Scripture from her, and let our Adverſaries ſay what they will, we doubt not but it is her Authority that principally determines them to Reverence as Divine Books. Which firſt ſentence is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt</q> contradiction, it being abſolutely impoſſible that that which is eſtabliſhed by God to be the <hi>Guardian</hi> of Scripture, and the <hi>Traditor</hi> of it to others, ſhould be <hi>the Authority</hi> that <hi>makes it Scripture,</hi> which it is before it is put into its Guardianſhip; and certainly its being <hi>Scripture,</hi> or a Writing of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is that which makes them principally reverenced as <hi>Divine Books,</hi> not <hi>that which tells us</hi> that they are ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But then he gives us inſtances of Three Books eſpecially, which he conceives received upon that authority, <hi>The Canticle of Canticles,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude.</hi> Where in the firſt place</q>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:94907:51"/>
the Gentleman does ill to joyn theſe together as believed, or to be believed upon the ſame grounds, the <hi>Canticle of Cantiles</hi> being long before the Chriſtian Church, the others ſince. Therefore I muſt anſwer him diſtinctly. Suppoſing then that which common ſence is able to inform us, that this Book, called, <hi>The Song of Songs,</hi> is more <hi>antient</hi> than the Church of Chriſt; and that the Church never had, as ſhe has never pretended to have, any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Revelation,</hi> whether this Book was written by inſpiration from God, (as we believe the Law and the Prophets) beſide the credit upon which it received it from the Synagogue: it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the only thing queſtionable, is whether it was received by the Synagogue as divinely inſpired; if it appears to have been ſo received it is not any <hi>authority of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> that has made it Scripture, and if the Church had pretended it Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without evidence of its being received from them, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation ſhewn in the caſe, it would have been never the more a Divine Book, nor any man obliged to receive it as ſuch. And I marvel the Gentleman ſhould be carried ſo far by the ſpirit of Contradiction, and deſire to bear down his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brethren, as to ſet up a Principle that betrays our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity, by giving notice to the World that thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Teſtament, whereby the Church pretends to convince the Jews of the neceſſity of becoming Chriſtians, are not to be received for the Word of God, but upon the <hi>authority</hi> of her <hi>own Decrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> rejected by <hi>Luther,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> by others; nothing can be more manifeſt to any that will but take the pains to conſider it, that the Writings of the Apoſtles were firſt kept by and entruſted in the hands of thoſe Churches to which they were ſent, as the Epiſtles to <hi>Corinth, Rome, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> &amp;c. It is therefore reaſonable to conceive thoſe Writings ſo diſperſed, when collected into one body, and ſubmitted to by the whole Church, were ſubmitted to upon the certain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe parts of it, wherein they had been kept, thoſe which had not ſo evident a teſtimony being laid aſide and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only according to the evidence that appeared of their being Divine Inſpirations. Nevertheleſs when they come to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the hands of ſuch particular Churches, who knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have had them from Authors known to be divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, there might be ſome expreſſions in them which might appear not altogether ſo agreeable with our common Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when they came firſt to know them, which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had not. And this was certainly the caſe of <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:94907:52"/>
in refuſing St. <hi>James</hi>'s Epiſtle, notwithſtanding the ſcorns caſt upon him for it, as of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in queſtioning the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But yet there is always means of redreſſing ſuch a miſtake either in any part of the Church, or in any particular member of it, ſo long as there remains means to certifie them from what hand they have been received, and how derived from perſons in whom the Church was aſſured the holy Ghoſt ſpoke: but to ſet up the Churches bare Authority for this, is indeed what our Adverſaries deſire, but what deſtroys all the nature of the holy Scriptures, and makes them to be believed for <hi>another</hi> reaſon than this, that they are the <hi>Dictates of the holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in fine he tells us, <q>It can only be from this authority, that we receive the whole body of the Scripture, which all Chriſtians accept as divine, before their reading of it has made them ſenſible of the Spirit of God in it. But that there</q> is ſome little difference between thoſe that are educated in the Chriſtian Church, and others that turn Chriſtians at years of underſtanding, he might even as well have ſaid, whether the Spirit of God be in it, or not in it. For if the authority of the Church be that which principally determines them to reverence as Divine Books, and upon that authority a man be obliged to receive the whole body of Scripture, before he know the Spirit of God to be in it, he ſhall, upon the ſame grounds, be obliged ſtill to hold the ſame, whether he find it there or not. I am ſorry that he thinks all Chriſtians ſo blind as himſelf, that they build their belief of the Scriptures, on no firmer a foundation than he ſeems to do, and am therefore obliged to ſhew him the ground whereon I build my own belief concerning them.</p>
               <p>When therefore I firſt ſeek whereon to ground this belief, I enquire after the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> not the <hi>Authority,</hi> of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> of all thoſe that make profeſſion of Chriſtianity, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I look after concerning the Scriptures; and when I have found what Writings they agree upon and admit for ſuch, the next enquiry is upon what grounds they ſubmit unto them as ſuch, and this I find to be their having received them from former Ages ſucceſſively together with their Chriſtianity: then muſt I trace this ſucceſſive reception of them from one time to another, till I come to thoſe who firſt received them, and there I find the reaſon upon which they ſubmitted to them to be the evident proofs which the Writers of them had given to ſhew themſelves inſpired by God and commiſſioned to teach his will, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of which they ought to give up themſelves; whereupon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94907:52"/>
they who had ſeen God bearing them witneſs with divers Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, became obliged, as to obey their Doctrine, ſo to acknowledge their Writings for the Word of God, they being Records of thoſe miraculous Actions which they ſaw wrought, and of thoſe Truths which were taught and proved to be the Will of God. And here the very ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives cauſe my belief of the Scriptures, which cauſed thoſe firſt Chriſtians to receive them, and ſubmit unto them; ſo that the ſame reaſon that moves me to be a Chriſtian, reſolves me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture. But if a man ſhall ask me, ſince I believe the Scriptures only upon the works done by thoſe Holy Writers which teſtifie them to have had his Spirit, how I am aſſured that thoſe works were really done? I am not afraid to confeſs my Belief of this to rely on the Credit of God's People, all Ages of Chriſt's Church which have born teſtimony of it ſucceſſively: ſo that I ſubmit not my Faith to any Authority that can command it, but I ſee it reaſonable to allow my Belief to the Credit of the Church as ſo many men of common Senſe atteſting the Truth of thoſe Reaſons which the Goſpel tenders why they ought to believe: Neither is my Faith in either of theſe Reſpects a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith, but the work of Gods Spirit; for as it is that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only which after I have ſeen the Motives to Chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to believe, and become a Chriſtian; ſo it is the ſame Spirit, which having ſhewn me the Evidence that the Scriptures were written by the Meſſengers of God, that works in me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of, and ſubmiſſion to them as the Word of God.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <q>Being inſeparably bound as we are to the holy Authority of the Church, by means of the Scriptures which we receive from her hands, we learn Tradition alſo from her, and by means of Tradition we learn the true Senſe of the Scripture: upon which account the Church profeſſes ſhe tells us nothing from herſelf, and that ſhe invents nothing new in her Doctrines ſhe does nothing but declare the divine Revelation according to the interior direction of the Holy Ghoſt, which is given to her as a Teacher. I profeſs all</q> the Skill I have cannot make this hang together. If by his firſt words he means we are ſo inſeparably bound to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church by receiving the Scriptures from her, that we ought thereupon to receive all that ſhall be commanded by that Authority; I that have ſhewn we do not believe the Scriptures upon her Authority as a Church, but upon her <hi>Teſtimony</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Motives of Faith, as a number of men that would not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94907:53"/>
conſpire to teſtifie an Untruth, can never own it to have an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of itſelf to command our Faith. Indeed as we receive the Scriptures upon her Teſtimony, we learn from the Scriptures that ſhe has an Authority, but ſuch an Authority as perhaps will not content M. <hi>Condom,</hi> which being derived from the Scriptures, can never have power to act againſt them, and being eſtabliſhed only for the Maintenance of Chriſtianity which was before it, can never have power to make that a part of Chriſtianity which was not ſo before the Church was in being. Then again, though we learn Tradition from her, and that Tradition be uſeful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Senſe of the Scriptures, yet we receive not any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon her Authority, as making them Traditions of the Apoſtles, but upon her Teſtimony ſhewing that ſhe has received them from them; and again thoſe Traditions ſhe does deliver, ought not certainly to be received for the Word of God, if not confirmed by the Scripture, becauſe the Motives upon which they were received, cannot be as evident as thoſe of the Scriptures: Queſtionleſs no man can deny the Traditions of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be as uſeful for the underſtanding the Old Teſtament, as any now for that of the New; but then it was they perverted the Uſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, when they taught them for God's Commandments.</p>
               <p>But that which he infers, from this that has given us both ſo much trouble, is juſt nothing, <q>Upon this account the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, ſhe tells us nothing from herſelf, and that ſhe invents nothing new in her Doctrine. Whoever thought that their</q> Church ever profeſſed the contrary, or can conceive that any Church will profeſs otherwiſe? the queſtion then is not what ſhe profeſſes but what ſhe has done; and let me tell him, that his own words are as great an argument againſt the Church's abſolute and Infallible Authority as any can be given. For if upon the account of her being eſtabliſhed by God to be the Guardian of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tradition, and the deliverer of them to her Children, ſhe be obliged to profeſs, (ſuppoſe what may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that ſhe be but obliged to act as ſhe does profeſs) that ſhe delivers nothing new, nothing from herſelf, nothing but by the interior direction of the Holy Ghoſt; Shall not her Authority be confined within theſe limits? Shall ſhe have any power to act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them? or if ſhe be accuſed, as having acted againſt that Chriſtianity that ſhe ought to have maintained, Shall it not be ſhewn <hi>de facto</hi> that ſhe has not? or if that ſeem too apparent, Shall it be pleaded that ſhe is infallible, and cannot have acted againſt it, though it's viſible to all but them that plead ſo, that ſhe has?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94907:53"/>
But he further tells us, <q>That there being a diſpute raiſed in the times of the Apoſtles, the Holy Ghoſt put an end to it by the Church, and the method then taken by the Apoſtles, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it, has taught ſucceeding Ages by what authority all other differences are to be ended; ſo that as often as any diviſions ſhall happen, the Church will interpoſe her Authority, and her Paſtors aſſembled, will ſay after the Apoſtles, <hi>It ſeemeth good unto the Holy Ghost and to us.</hi> What they will ſay I know not,</q> I am ſure this gives them no warrant to ſay the like. It's true, this practice of the Apoſtles has directed the Church upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that have hapned, to aſſemble its Paſtors for the ending them; but I ſee no promiſe here that they ſhall have the like aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Apoſtles, who not only had the Spirit of God at all times in a meaſure, which no man can pretend to have now at any time, but had likewiſe frequently immediate inſpirations: And if a man ſhould think they had an immediate inſpiration upon the place, ſignifying how they ſhould order the matter, he might have grounds for his opinion very conſiderable, inſpirations being then ſo frequent even at the common Aſſemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> being ſo cautions as to <hi>difference</hi> things of <hi>his own</hi> from the <hi>Commands of the Lord,</hi> although he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the ſame time to have the Spirit of God. But whether ſo or not, no Councils can from hence preſume, that the Holy Ghoſt will <hi>lead them</hi> into all <hi>Truth</hi> in whatſoever they take a humour to determine, becauſe Chriſt promiſed to ſend his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to his Apoſtles <hi>to lead them into all Truth,</hi> for the teaching and eſtabliſhing our common Chriſtianity. Father <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of a Proverb, which perhaps this Gentleman may have known to paſs in <hi>France, That the modern Council had more Authority than that of the Apoſtles, becauſe their own pleaſure only was ſufficient ground for the Decrees, without admitting the Holy Ghost;</hi> whether verified in this of <hi>Trent,</hi> I ſhall not ſay, but the ground of it is certainly poſſible, and God, that has promiſed to lead men by his Spirit into all Truth, has not ſaid he will lead them whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>Whereas then he ſays further, <q>That when the Church has ſpoken, her Children will be taught, that they ought not to examine again the Articles ſo reſolved on, but are bound hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to receive her deciſions; and that they are reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> not permitting them to be again diſcuſſed, but teaching all to obſerve the ordinances of the Apoſtles. He would have done well to have ſhewn us, that</q> the Decrees of the <hi>Trent Council</hi> are as much the acts of the Holy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94907:54"/>
Ghoſt as <hi>that of the Apoſtles,</hi> before he had required us to think them act as juſtifiably in teaching them as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did. But by the way, if he ſpeaks this as the fix'd reſolution of all their Church <hi>not to admit a new diſcuſſion</hi> of what has been decided, but to require all to obſerve it; he lets us know an excellent Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church, and how much it is for her turn that differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Religion be everlaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But thus it is, he tells us, the Children of God acquieſce in the Judgment of the Church, believing that from her mouth they hear the Oracle of the holy Ghoſt. This he ſhould</q> have forborn to have ſaid till he had ſhewn by ſomething more than he has hitherto, that God has bid his children to hear his Word from the mouth of any Church, ſpeaking without the Scripture, that contains it: but eſpecially methinks he ſhould not have preſumed to ſay, this is the <hi>ground</hi> why in our Creed, having ſaid, <hi>I believe in the Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghost,</hi> we add immediately, <hi>The holy Catholick Church:</hi> if we had no other ground to believe the Holy Catholick Church, than he has hitherto ſhewn, I am ſure we ſhould have but very little for ſo great an Article of Faith. But no wonder he builds his faith on no better grounds, ſince he has framed a new ſenſe of the Article, of which, if I convince him by the Catechiſm of his own Church, I ſuppoſe he may be inclinable to hear it: even that then teaches him, <q>That the word <note place="margin">Cat. Trid. ſub Titulo. Eccleſia quibus ſiguris.</note> 
                     <hi>Church</hi> in this Article does chiefly denote the whole number of Believers, including both good and bad, not the Rulers only, but thoſe likewiſe who are to obey: and if ſo, I know not how a</q> man is obliged, by believing this Article, to acknowledge any Infallibility in the governours of any Church, or to think that if they err, this Article of our Creed ſhould become falſe, or that he has ever the leſs faith in God, if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or fear leaſt the Rulers of the Church ſhould abuſe their power.</p>
               <p>Whereas after this he endeavours to perſwade us, <q>That the Catholick Church (meaning that of <hi>Rome)</hi> is ſo far from making herſelf Miſtreſs of our Faith, as ſhe is accuſed, that on the contrary ſhe has done what ſhe could to limit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive herſelf of all the means of innovation, ſeeing ſhe not only ſubmits herſelf to the Holy Scriptures, but has obliged herſelf to interpret them in what relates to Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, according to the ſenſe of the holy Fathers, from which ſhe promiſeth never to depart, declaring in all her Councils and in all the Profeſſions of Faith ſhe has publiſhed, that ſhe does not receive any Doctrine which is not conformable to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94907:54"/>
Tradition of all preceding ages. If it be really ſo, that ſhe</q> does in all things thus ſubmit herſelf, what need he have given us all this trouble to prove that ſhe ought, againſt his vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to exempt her from it? Then all that we have depending is only Tryal of Matters of Fact, whether ſhe has really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained herſelf within the bounds ſhe profeſſes ought to limit her deciſions, and this claim of infallibility ought to be by them wholly laid aſide; otherwiſe the World will never believe ſhe has confined herſelf to bounds that ſhe endeavours to claim a power of exceeding; as I cannot think this Gentleman in conſcience knows her to have acted only <hi>within them,</hi> when he takes ſo much pains to create her an authority <hi>above them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe does M. <hi>Condom</hi> tell us, <q>No one pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man amongſt us, but if he found himſelf the only man of a perſwaſion, though it appeared to him never ſo evident, but would be aſhamed of that ſingularity? for is this the caſe</q> of the Reformed part of the Chriſtian World, are they but as one man? But ſince he wiſhes us to conſult with prudence, we may deſire him to do the like, and conſider what prudence it is for a man blindly to give up his judgments to others, and be of a Religion becauſe he has many companions, refuſing out of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either to examine or come to a tryal of that Religion, or fearing the event of ſuch a tryal, reſolving before he enter upon it on a ground from which he will never be diſpoſſeſſed; ſuch as I have too great cauſe to fear himſelf has reſolved on, that what he cannot by his skill make good from Scripture and Truth, he will ſtill believe upon the Authority of the Church. And I think this reaſon (if any thing may be grounded upon humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning God's commands) does more evidently ſhew, that God has never required us to give up a blind obedience to any authority of man; than that given by him that God has ſet up an authority to which every private man muſt ſubject his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all truths, though appearing never ſo evidently unto him.</p>

               <head>Of the Sentiments of the Reformed about the Authority of the Church.</head>
               <p>ALthough I need not concern my ſelf with ſeveral Objections which M. <hi>Condom</hi> makes from ſeveral determinations of Synods in <hi>France,</hi> about the Authority of the Church, yet having ſhewn the Church to have no ſuch abſolute and infallible Authority as he claims for it, I ought to ſet down the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Sentiments, and conſider whether any thing in them is liable to thoſe Objections.</p>
               <p>She then ſuppoſes, that a Church may err even in matters of Faith, and <note n="1" place="margin">Artic. 19.</note> declares ſeveral to have thus erred: nevertheleſs ſhe claims <note n="2" place="margin">Art. 20.</note> for the Church Power to decree Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and even Authority in Matters of Faith; though however it be not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Word, nor ſo to expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another; nor inaſmuch as ſhe is a keeper of Holy Writ, ought ſhe to decree any thing againſt the ſame, or beſides the ſame, to enforce any thing to be believed for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Salvation. <note n="3" place="margin">Art. 21.</note> And even General Councils may err and have erred even in things pertaining to God: wherefore things ordained by them as neceſſary to ſalvation, have neither ſtrength nor authority, unleſs it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now herein you ſee our Church claims a power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and even an authority in Matters of Faith, but then ſhe confines it ſo within the limits of God's Word, that ſhe can decree nothing againſt the ſame, nor impoſe any thing beſides the ſame to be believed of neceſſity to ſalvation. And herein, till it be proved, that ſhe has exceeded thoſe limits which truth obliges her to own preſcribed unto her by God's Word, I ſee but two Objections that will lie againſt her.</p>
               <p>The firſt, How, not claiming Infallibility, ſhe claims Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Matters of Faith? To which I anſwer, That God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left means in his Church, when Matters of our common Faith ſhall become diſputable to end and decide them; ſhe, that has proceeded according to thoſe means, may well require ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to her Authority, whilſt ſhe ſhews herſelf to all to have proceeded aright in the uſe of thoſe means which God has
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94907:55"/>
left in his Church, and there is no more neceſſity that ſhe ſhould be infallible upon this account to make her Authority received, than that ſhe ſhould be able actually and immediately to forgive ſins when ſhe requires a ſubjection to her Miniſtry in working their cure.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, That if ſhe be not infallible in her deciſions, then they may be ſubject to the examination of every private man, and being ſo, any one may find fault with them, and ſo away is open for the introducing as many Religions as men. To which I anſwer firſt, That it is one thing to clear the Truth, another to anſwer an Objection, and if I ſhould not be able to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to this Objection, yet the Truth that I have cleared, will ſtand firm, till the contrary be proved by evident Principles of our Chriſtianity. To this I ſay then ſecondly, That it's an Objection of that abſurdity, that it can never rationally be uſed by any conſidering man. View it but in other inſtances, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may command a Son to do wickedneſs, the Son certainly is not bound to obey him, though he be to obey his Father; any Son may, under this pretence, refuſe obedience to commands juſt and good, but to avoid this inconvenience, ſhall it be made a neceſſary Truth that a Father cannot command an unlawful act? Or go to a greater caſe, All the World knows we have had a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that has pleaded, that the Supream Magiſtrate ought to be obeyed in all his commands; that the Scriptures are not Laws to a People, till the Laws of the Land have made them ſo; that the ſenſe of them is to be interpreted by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; that man may even deny Chriſt with his mouth, ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his heart at the command or compulſion of his Superior; and all upon this ground, becauſe otherwiſe if men may pretend any Laws of God to exempt them from obedience to their King, any man may uſe this pretence, and ſo under a pretence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience all government may be deſtroyed, unleſs the commands of the Supream Magiſtrate be allowed ſuch as are abſolutely to be obeyed. Now what anſwer would a man give to this? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Laws of God are to be obeyed before thoſe of men; that the Chriſtian Religion, though it obliges to obey God, is not deſtructive of Government, becauſe it commands Obedience to the Higher Powers, that therefore no good Chriſtian can or will make a pretence of Conſcience to the prejudice of the Peace, where there is not an abſolute neceſſity, and that he will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit even where he cannot obey. If this be all the anſwer that can be given, as it is all that ever I underſtood to be given in this caſe, yet ſtill there is a <hi>poſſibility</hi> left for ill men to uſe a pretence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94907:56"/>
of Religion to diſturb the Peace: and ſtill the like <hi>poſſibility</hi> will be left and conſequently the <hi>Objection</hi> remain in as much force as that <hi>Poſſibility</hi> gives it, ſo long as there is a <hi>difference poſſible</hi> between the Laws of God and thoſe of our Superiors, and no man will have us I hope to avoid this inconvenience, to acknowledge no other God than our Superiours. I ſay therefore, thirdly, That as every man has a judgment of diſcretion to chuſe his own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo every Chriſtian has the like judgment to conſider whether what he ſubmits to the belief of, be conſiſtent with his Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That having undertaken to be a Chriſtian, he is thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Authority of the Church in all caſes wherein Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requires ſubmiſſion to that Authority, that this having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>means by which,</hi> and ſet her <hi>bounds within which,</hi> and eſtabliſhed <hi>ends for which</hi> ſhe is to determine things concerning Chriſtian Truth, he is obliged to give her Obedience whilſt ſhe provides in all things for that Chriſtianity that ſhe ought to maintain. But if he ſhall perceive her in any thing to have acted beyond her Power, or againſt the intereſt of Chriſtian Religion, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo, how neceſſary it is that a man miſtake not in a thing wherein Chriſtianity is ſo greatly concerned <hi>as it is in the Churches Peace,</hi> and will thereupon ſeek all due and poſſible means of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and if it ſtill appear that the Church requires his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where his Conſcience will not give him leave to pay it, he will endeavour by all the ways of Peace and Meekneſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with his Governours to remove the burthen, and will not make a breach but where he cannot comply and hold his Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And whilſt both <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Governed</hi> ſhall thus <hi>both</hi> regard the Laws of him that is the God of all, the one taking faithful care to provide in all things for the maintenance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Chriſtianity the Church is entruſted to preſerve, the other ſtudying in all things the Will of God, and giving thanks to him for ſo great a help as is the Miniſtry of his Church, and gladly entertaining what is by her ſhewn to be his Will from thoſe Holy Writings wherein he has revealed it; What can be more conducing to the eſtabliſhment of all Chriſtian Truth and Peace?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there ſtill lies a poſſibility for men, upon pretence of Conſcience, to diſturb all our Peace; but the ſame there is of abuſing the greateſt grace of God. And no man, that will not ſet up his own wiſdom above that of God, can <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>preſume,</hi> though every man be bound to <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> a <hi>final</hi> end of <hi>all</hi> Controverſies in Religion, the Apoſtle having told us, <note n="1" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> that there <hi>must be Hereſies,</hi> and our bleſſed Lord, <note n="2" place="margin">Luke 17.</note> that <hi>Offences

No man certainly dares think our Saviour to be ever leſs the Prince of Peace, or ever the leſs ſincerely deſirous of it when he left it as his peculiar Legacy to his Diſciples; for that out of a foreſight of the unhappy Diviſions of the Chriſtian World, he tells us, <note n="3" place="margin">Matth. 10. 34.</note>

               <p>WHereas M. <hi>Condom</hi> aſſerts the Popes Authority from the Primacy inveſted by our Lord in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this Primacy by the Holy Councils and Fathers in the Pope as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor: I need only deny that, which he aſſerts without proof, and am not obliged to evidence by any proofs that he has no ſuch Authority, 'till I am ſhewn what obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is claimed by or given to him, and his title and right thereto.</p>

               <p>Although he is pleaſed to wave thoſe things that are diſputed in the Schools concerning this extravagant Power and Authority of the Pope, as not being Articles of the Catholick Faith; I muſt tell him, it would have removed great jealouſies, if, as he has declared them not Articles of the Catholick Faith, ſo he had owned them to be falſe.

               <p>Men may love <hi>Concord</hi> amongſt Brethren, and yet love <hi>Truth</hi> among Chriſtians, and thoſe that love them both muſt not vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give away the later to ſeek the former by ways not eſtabliſhed by God.

And though the Church ought not to riſe in Rebellion againſt a power that maintains her unity under pretence that ſome have abuſed it; yet undoubtedly it may reject an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation begun with fraud and encreaſed by violence, which it ſees to be no eſtabliſhment of God's, and has experienced deſtructive of his truth.</p>
               <p>As for Epiſcopacy (bleſſed be God) our Church has been able to preſerve it with great advantage to our Chriſtianity. Thoſe of the Reformation in other parts, who had not the like power nor the ſame opportunity of doing it, being yet obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their common Chriſtianity, though they could not bring to effect, in all things, the eſtabliſhment of his Church, I doubt not but God may and does bleſs in the exerciſe of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>HEreby therefore it appears, that M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s explication has given us but a very unſatisfactory reſolution, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Objections being ſtill left in full force, and their Doctrines ſhewn ſome neceſſarily, and others very probably, others abſolutely to ſubvert the foundations of Faith; which abundantly juſtifies that Proviſion made by the Reformation, and makes it abſolutely neceſſary that they let not go that Proviſion, which the maintenance of our common Chriſtianity rendred at firſt, and does ſtill require neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Neither has M. <hi>Condom</hi> mentioned all the material Points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: Two I am ſure there are omitted, as conſiderable as many by him taken notice of. One is the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which requires the Scriptures, which we call <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> to be admitted with like reverence as the unqueſtionable Canonical Scriptures, and to be received as all of one rank, which before had never been enjoyned but with that difference which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been acknowledged in the Church. Which Act, giving to them the authority of Prophetical Scripture, inſpired by God, which they had not before, though it be thereby null in itſelf, (becauſe what was not inſpired by God to him that wrote it, can never become inſpired by him, and that which was not at firſt received as ſuch, can never be known to be ſuch without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Revelation) yet uſurpeth an Authority which was never heard of in the Chriſtian World, and claims a ſubmiſſion which a Chriſtian cannot give to any but ſuch as ſhall prove themſelves to have had an immediate Revelation in the caſe. The other is their Decree, that the Service of God be not performed in the vulgar Tongue: For if the People be obliged to aſſiſt in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (which if they are not, To what purpoſe do they aſſemble?) then certainly the Offices in which they aſſiſt ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them. Poſſibly they will ſay, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is preſerved by the univerſal uſe of one Language, though the Service of God be not underſtood; but then the <hi>end,</hi> for which it ſhould be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94907:58"/>
is not accompliſht, when the Service of God is not, nor can be performed as Chriſtianity requireth, by thoſe who underſtand it not.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is obſervable, that it's M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s way to take theſe Points <hi>ſingle,</hi> and ſpend all his pains in extenuating them as much as poſſible, that they may not appear abſolutely to deſtroy our Chriſtianity, and then to preſs us to compliance with it: But he never looks upon them <hi>together,</hi> nor conſiders, whether with that care of our common Chriſtianity which all ought to take, they can be <hi>all</hi> complyed with and ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>I then have ſhewn even in the Particulas wherein I have gone along with M. <hi>Condom,</hi> That the Invocation of Saints is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from our Chriſtianity, has no Promiſe of any Grace or Mercy, yea tends ſo greatly to the prejudice of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that it ſhall be very difficult for a Chriſtian to preſerve himſelf from Idolatry in the uſe of it, and which Experience has ſhewn to have been Idolatrouſly practiſed by many: That the Uſe of Images again, is no way neceſſary in God's Worſhip, but dangerous, and makes it moſt difficult to avoid that Idolatry which many have really committed in the uſe of them: That the Relicks of Saints have no ſuch virtue by any divine Promiſe as they are frequented for; that the Church therefore ought not to teach or perſwade People to frequent them for ſuch Aid or Helps, ſince their recourſe to them has been experienced to have brought forth much Superſtition, advancing Peoples Devotion to Saints, to the prejudice of that they ſhould preſerve for God alone: That their Doctrine of Juſtification involving a miſtake in the very nature of it, by making <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> the <hi>formal</hi> Cauſe of Juſtification, gives too great appearance that they claim <hi>Remiſſion of Sins</hi> as due to that <hi>inherent Righteouſneſs;</hi> whereas it is only the effect of Chriſt's Merits: That likewiſe by their <hi>Anathema's</hi> they have condemned thoſe who hold the Truth in this Point: That in the Point of <hi>Merit,</hi> if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Council be not expreſly, yet that vulgarly taught in that Communion, is contrary to the Faith, and injurious to Gods Grace, which Doctrine is favoured by the very words of the Council; that herein alſo they condemn thoſe who aſſert the Truth, and deſire to magnifie God's Grace: That their Doctrines of <hi>Satisfactions, Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> are built on a foundation that has not the leaſt ground in holy Scripture, their <hi>Satisfactions</hi> being enjoynd to other ends than thoſe in which they take place in Chriſtianity; being alſo according to the purpoſes by them uſed injurious to the Merits of Chriſt, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94907:58"/>
offenſive to their Chriſtian Brethren; their <hi>Indulgences</hi> granted to unheard of purpoſes and perverted from their primitive uſe; their <hi>Purgatory</hi> a vain invention, and the occaſion of much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; and theſe, taken together with their <hi>Abſolution</hi> in <hi>Penance,</hi> tending directly to the manifeſt prejudice of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſince the Pardon of Sins is preſumed to depend not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Reconcilement</hi> wrought with God before, but on the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> as the ground of it, whereby Abſolution is pronounced before the Church has done any thing to work the Cure of Sin, and the Penances afterwards impoſed for the ſatisfaction of a temporal puniſhment, the Sin being to be ſuppoſed pardoned before, and no eternal puniſhment to remain due, and thoſe to be expiated by ſome eaſie ſatisfactions in the preſent Life, or to be abated in Purgatory by ſome Indulgences purchaſed here, or Services performed by their Friends afterwards; whereby ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Souls muſt neceſſarily be entangled in the Snares of their Sins, there being ſo great likelihood, that Pardon being held forth upon ſuch undue grounds, the corruption of our Nature will take hold of and preſume upon it, when we have not wrought in our ſelves a true Repentance: That in thoſe things which they call <hi>Sacraments,</hi> they will not ſuffer us to diſtinguiſh either in that Grace which the Ceremony ſignifieth, or in the Force whereby they concur to the obtaining of it; whereas our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity requires us to diſtinguiſh between Graces given to this or that particular effect, and thoſe that are given for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and perpetual ſubſiſtence of Chriſtianity, and likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Offices that are effective of Grace by virtue of a peculiar and ſpecial promiſe to thoſe effects, and others that are only uſed by the Church, out of a hope that our Prayers ſhall be heard to thoſe effects: That they conceive Chriſt preſent in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after ſuch a manner, as it does no way appear he promiſed his Preſence therein; that hereupon it is required that Adoration due to God alone, be given to the Sacrament, which if the Elements remain, is by themſelves confeſſed to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore may juſtiſiably by us, who know them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, be ſo accounted: That without warrant they make the <hi>Eucharist</hi> a Sacrifice as diſtinct from a Sacrament, and of a greater virtue as a Sacrifice, than when it is received as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, according to our Saviour's Inſtitution: That they warrant it propitiatory for thoſe who uſe it not according to his Inſtitution, whereby they fruſtrate the End of his bleſſing Bread and Wine, and commanding it to be received, and likewiſe void the neceſſity of a Chriſtian Life, applying the

Benefits of Chriſt's Sacrament to ſuch as come not worthily to partake of it, and pretending it efficacious to eaſe them of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which they are to ſuffer for ſins after Death: That whilſt they with-hold the Cup from the Laity, they void Chriſt's Inſtitution, who enjoyned and appointed both, they likewiſe rob Chriſtians of their Birthright, and cannot warrant one part of this Sacrament beneficial to all thoſe effects for which Chriſt was pleaſed to bleſs both Bread and Wine: That whilſt they plead for Traditions, they thereby endeavour to obtrude upon us their own Corruptions, and by theſe, inſtead of interpreting, pervert the Scriptures, and by Traditions of men have indeed in many things made void the Comandments of God: That by claiming an Authority for the Church above the Scriptures, which they do to juſtifie what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has decreed againſt them, they do indeed advance an Authority that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our common Chriſtianity: That in pleading their <hi>Pope</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, not to ſpeak of their Ambition in this Aim, they require us to ſubmit to an Authority for the ſake of Unity, which is not only none of God's Ordinance, but ſuch as Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has ſhewn to have almoſt wholly deſtroyed that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which Unity ſhould preſerve. Having ſhewn, I ſay, the danger of theſe Doctrines in particular, and their inconſiſtence with Chriſtianity, when I reflect upon them all together, and find that our Union with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> requires ſubmiſſion to them all, muſt conclude that whatever allowance might be made in ſome one of them (provided that the reſt of that Chriſtian Truth which they hold, did ſo prevail over the Error, that it did not take effect in their practices to God's Diſhonour, or the ſubverſion of a Chriſtian Life) yet to ſubmit to them all, as we muſt do if we will have peace with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to redeem the Communion of the Church by tranſgreſſing that Chriſtianity which the Church is appointed to maintain, and abſolutely to proſtitute our own and the Souls committed to our Charge.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is little otherwiſe in thoſe other things which M. <hi>Condom</hi> lets alone as things of themſelves not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter of Separation; theſe if taken together, though ſingly they may not be very conſiderable, render the Means of Salvation very difficult; ſince the Subſtance of Chriſtianity being overwhelmed and choaked with a deal of Rubbiſh Opinions, Cuſtoms, Obſervations, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a thing very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for ſimple Chriſtians to diſcern the Subſtance from the Shadow, and almoſt impoſſible to paſs through ſuch a multitude
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94907:61"/>
of Obſervations, Cuſtoms and Ceremonies, which create ſo much buſineſs in the Practice of Religion, and upon which ſo great Zeal is ſpent, without Superſtion and Will-Worſhip, and a fond Opinion of thoſe Services, placing their hope of God's Favour upon theſe carnal Obſervations and humane Inventions, which indeed are nothing to the Reality of Religion. So that theſe at leaſt muſt be allowed to add to that Maſs of Corruption which they ſeek to obtrude upon us, though of themſelves they are not of ſuch a poyſonous Nature.</p>
            <p>But though we cannot joyn with them without manifeſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our Chriſtianity, yet it is moſt eaſie for them to come to us, and would be for the great advantage of our Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as even themſelves muſt and do acknowledge.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Thoſe Doctrines which are eſtabliſhed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as concern the Foundation of Faith have been in all Ages profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf. This M. <hi>Condom</hi> allows as to Fundamentals, <q>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds all which the <hi>Reformers</hi> do. They further agree</q> with us, <q>That we are to pray unto God through Chriſt: That God may be worſhipped in Spirit without an Image: That we may have recourſe to him in all our Neceſſities without ſeeking the Relicks of Saints: That Jeſus Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification: That men may do good Works, and ſhall never fail of Salvation through not confiding in them: That there be two Sacraments which have the Promiſe of Grace. That Chriſt is really and ſpiritually received by ſome in the Lord's Supper: That Chriſt made an Oblation of himſelf upon the Croſs for the Redemption, Propitiation and Satisfaction of the whole World: And where they with hold the Cup</q> from the Laity, and forbid the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the vulgar Tongue, yet even in theſe they condeſcend to us for the Lawfulneſs of the Practice, even in reſpect to the Law of God, and oppoſe them only in regard of their neceſſity and conveniency, and for that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordained: They acknowledge likewiſe the Authority of written word of God, and the Deſign of Providence in their being <q>written for our Learning: They acknowledge the Church does and ought to act in deciding Controverſies of Faith according to the Scripture committed to her, and to tell us nothing from herſelf, and invent nothing new in her Doctrine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, The Truths we hold (even by the judgment of ſeveral of the Learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> have been in all ages deemed ſufficient to ſalvation; ſo that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94907:62"/>
no Doctrine, the explicit Belief whereof is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. For firſt, <hi>in reſpect of Knowledge,</hi> the Schoolmen hold, <q>That much leſs is needful to be explicitly believed, than what is contained in our Doctrines. For whereas we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</q> and embrace not only the Doctrine of the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> but alſo ſundry other Truths, as appears by our <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> they declare it needful to believe, ſome but the whole Creed, others, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> joyned with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical,</hi> to make a man a compleat Believer; and this, although we go no further than the proper Senſe of the words, and have no great diſtinct knowledge of the Matters; whereof however there is none will deny but the Church of <hi>England</hi> has a perfect underſtanding, as alſo a right apprehenſion of them according to their true Chriſtian Senſe, in which the whole <hi>Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> ever underſtood them. Secondly, <hi>For Practice,</hi> they grant, <q>That we may obtain Salvation without undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Duties as we refuſe. For if one worſhips God without</q> an Image, they do not deny this worſhip to be acceptable: If a man pray immediately to God through Chriſt, they will not ſay this Devotion is fruitleſs: If one perform the beſt works he can, <note place="margin">Bellar. de <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtif.</hi> l. 5. c. 7.</note> (which we alſo require) and ſtand not upon their Merit, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Mercy of God, as we do, they judge it to be not only profitable, but alſo commend it as moſt ſecure. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but ſometimes true Contrition does obtain Pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Penance, or the Prieſt's Abſolution. They cannot deny but <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Trid.</hi> Sèſſ. 13. cap. 8</note> that to receive Chriſt ſpiritually in the holy Sacrament, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to all the Effects of it; for the <hi>Council</hi> places the difference between thoſe that receive it worthily, and thoſe that receive it to their own deſtruction, in this, that the former receive him both ſacramentally and ſpiritually; the other only ſacramentally. Nor I ſuppoſe will they deny, that he that relies only on Chriſt's Sacrifice on the Croſs, has a ſufficient expiation for Sins, whilſt he confides only in him whom God hath ſet forth to be our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation: Nor that we receive the Sacrament aright when we communicate in both kinds. Likewiſe if a man believes no more than is contained in the Scriptures, they confeſs him to believe as much as is neceſſary and profitable to all men. And if a man ſubmits to the Authority of the Church in all things which ſhe acts for the maintenance of that Chriſtianity ſhe ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whilſt ſhe acts according to God's Word, and her own Commiſſion both given and limited by it, they cannot ſay, I preſume, that ſuch aman diſowns her Authority, or voids Gods Ordinance, or that the Church, which profeſſes herſelf to have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:94907:62"/>
no other Authority, but acts according to this which is given her of, and limited by the Scriptures, does not do what ſhe ought for the maintenance of Chrſtianity, and diſcharge of her Truſt.</p>
            <p>Again, Thirdly, The Doctrines which we diſown, were not received as Articles of Faith, nor the contrary judged heretical by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for many hundred years after Chriſt. For <note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm. <hi>l.</hi> 4 de Verbo Dei, <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> that <hi>Church</hi> held at firſt, by our Adverſaries own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, all things which the Apoſtles uſed to preach openly, and which were neceſſary and profitable for all men, to be contained in the Scriptures. <note n="b" place="margin">Greg.

Wherein <note n="f" place="margin">Bell. <hi>l.</hi> 2. de Indu. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
               <hi>Indulgences,</hi> as now practiſed, were not known, nor any inſtance of them till a thouſand years after Chriſt, wherein <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not heard of till the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi> Wherein a thouſand years after <hi>Christ</hi> and more, the Sacrifice in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was ſaid, <note n="g" place="margin">

            <p>Further, It's evident that we run no hazard, neither do we venture upon any dangerous practice, but walk in the ſafe way to ſalvation. There is no danger in offering our Devotions to God through Chriſt, and to him only, as there is in the worſhip of Saints, which is not only without warrant, and moſt likely to be offenſive to God, but is even Idolatry if a right diſtinction be not always preſerved, which is very difficult to be preſerved at all times: nor in omitting the uſe of Images, nor in having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God's Providence only leaving the Reliques of Saints; as is confeſſed to be, if the uſe of Images ſeduce us to believe any divinity or vertue in them, to place any truſt in them or hope any thing from them. Nor is there any danger in relying
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94907:63"/>
on Chriſts Merits and God's Mercy for the Remiſſion of our ſins, not depending upon our own works, but doing what we are able in obedience to God, and after all, ſaying we are unprofitable ſervants, vilifying ourſelves, but magnifying the grace of God; as there may be in truſting to our own Righteouſneſs. Nor in requiring Contrition as abſolutely neceſſary to the Remiſſion of ſins, as there is if we content our ſelves with leſs. Nor whilſt we reject the Adoration of the Sacrament, ſo we offer up our ſouls to Chriſt in Heaven, as may be in worſhipping the Sacrament, which themſelves confeſs to be Idolatry, if the opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantion be falſe. Nor in not relying on the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, but frequenting it as a Sacrament with due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in receiving it in both kinds, according to Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; as may be in ſuppoſing it beneficial, when we uſe it not according to Chriſt's inſtitution, which obliges us to partake of it as a Sacrament, and in withholding part of it when it does not appear that he has left any ſuch power in the Church to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter but a part of what he commanded. Nor in chuſing the Scriptures for a Guide, ſo we ſincerely follow them; as there is if Tradition ſhould lead us, as it did the <hi>Jews,</hi> to void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. Nor does that Church run ſo great a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, which owns the limits that God has ſet her, and acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, as the Church that having acted againſt our common Chriſtianity, or at leaſt being accuſed ſo to have done, claims an abſolute and infallible authority to juſtifie what ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend by God's Word.</p>
            <p>There are but two things wherein they poſſibly can object to us any hazard or danger that we incur. One is, That, if the Church be not acknowledged Infallible, and all obliged to an Abſolute ſubmiſſion, a way is open for men, under this pretence, to caſt off her Authority and ſet up Religions according to their own fancies. This I have ſhewn we labour to prevent ſo far as the Divine Providence has appointed means for its prevention, and we think it not ſafe to ſet up others of our own invention, which may be liable to equal or greater miſchiefs another way. Nor that it is as certainly probable, on the other ſide, That, by advancing an abſolute and unlimited Authority of the Church, our common Chriſtianity may be deſtroyed by Decrees, that may be made, which may ſubvert the foundations of Faith, cannot be doubted; but muſt needs be evident to all that know it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to be led by their own Intereſts or Opinions, and have alſo actually ſeen by what intereſts late Councils have been managed and ſwayed in their Determinations, whereby
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94907:63"/>
men of good intentions have not been able to bring to paſs what they intended and endeavoured for the good of Chriſtianity, being overruled by a greater number of men prejudiced and leſs conſiderate, which has been confeſs'd even by ſincere men of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they tell us, That, according to our Principles, the Churches Authority is inſignificant, it being in every man's power to reject it, ſo that it is a very unſufficient means for Peace, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not the Divine Wiſdom to conſtitute, becauſe not certain to take effect: Not to repeat what is ſaid before, <hi>Section</hi> 19. but only to ſhew them how unreaſonable it is that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to ſhew the Reaſons of the Divine Providence in its Conſtitutions that are evident to us, when the Reaſons of them are not. Let them reſolve us, if the Scriptures be not our Rule of Faith and Manners, or if we cannot underſtand the ſenſe of them without the Churches Authority, why they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or if the Churches Authority be abſolute and unlimited, why it had not been plainly and expreſly told us by God, that we muſt ſubmit our ſelves in all things to this Authority; or why we are bidden to ſearch the Scriptures, why God ſhould have ſuffered the Scriptures to be written, when he could not but foreſee that the pretence of the Churches Authority, claſhing with that of the Scriptures, is that which has and will diſturb our Peace.</p>
            <p>If they tell us of the many Hereſies, Schiſms and Diviſions that are ſeen to have faln out by mens expounding the Scripture for themſelves: They will give us leave, I hope, to tell them of the Idolatries, Superſtitions, and other Irreligious Cuſtoms and Practices, which we ſee to have fallen out through their exalting the Churches Decrees to the prejudice of Chriſtianity. And further, that as to thoſe Hereſies and Diviſions which we ſee and lament among our ſelves, we are beholden to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Emiſſaries in great part for them, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ruin our common Chriſtianity by another extream, only becauſe we would not yield to thoſe things which they have firſt done to the prejudice of it. Beſides, I am apt to think, that even ſuch will have a great Plea at the day of Judgment from the rigorouſneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> extending the Churches Authority beyond all bounds that our common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity will allow, and neceſſitating well-diſpoſed Chriſtians to refuſe ſubmiſſion to it: whereby it becoming viſible, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is not in all things maintained by the Church neceſſarily, and it not being evidently viſible to common ſenſe, what bounds
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94907:64"/>
being kept, her Authority does by God's Law claim ſubmiſſion, they have preſumed upon their own underſtandings for the ſenſe of the Scriptures, and framed their Religion according to them. This I only urge, that they may look about them, leſt they become guilty of the many ſouls that may miſcarry in both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, whilſt they have rendred the means of ſalvation diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult among themſelves, and have, by pretending to juſtifie that, occaſioned others to overſee the due means they ſhould betake themſelves to, and run as dangerous a way in the other extream.</p>
            <p>So then we are altogether as ſafe, yea, much more ſecure than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for we take that way to confute Hereſies and to preſerve the purity of Faith, which the Divine Providence has appointed, appealing to the Scriptures, and uſing the beſt means for the underſtanding them, and declaring the Authority of the Church acting within the limits ſet her by God's Word, and for the maintenance of that Chriſtianity ſhe is eſtabliſhed to preſerve. They on the contrary pretending to maintain their Church in what ſhe has decreed to the prejudice of Chriſtianity, ſeek to eſtabliſh a Power that has already prejudiced even in the foundations of Faith, and may in probability utterly ſubvert our Chriſtianity, and have thereby given occaſion to others to place their Reformation of the Church in the utter renouncing her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Nor are they ever the nearer putting an end to Hereſies hereby, for all their pretences to Infallibility will never end the differences of thoſe that diſown it; and yet it's apparent, that in the mean time they prejudice our common Chriſtianity by thoſe Laws which make the means of ſalvation very difficult, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ineffectual by denying, hitherto, thoſe helps to ſalvation, which thoſe Laws intercept.</p>
            <p>The other danger which they pretend we run, is that of Schiſm, a great crime queſtionleſs, and that which all Chriſtians ought not only to lament but ſeek to remedy, and if it be poſſible, and as much as in them lies, to follow after Peace which by ſo many obligations the Chriſtian Church is bound to preſerve. But we know that both Parties are liable to be charged with the breach, till it appear which is guilty, and the guilt of it will certainly fall on thoſe who have made the ſeparation neceſſary; ſo that if a Church requires ſuch conditions of Communion, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, and ſubvert the Faith it ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they certainly are to be charged with the Crime, who will not ſuffer us to hold our Chriſtianity, together with the Churches Communion. Beſides there is nothing of this Charge can lye
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94907:64"/>
againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'till they prove her either to have rejected any Authority to which ſhe was legally ſubject, or to have departed from the Faith by her Reformation. But the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if ſhe pleaſes to reform herſelf, need not fear this Crime, ſhe may remove thoſe Laws that prejudice the ſalvation of the Members of her Communion, eſtabliſh thoſe for herſelf that tend to the exceeding benefit of Chriſtianity as well as the Peace of Chriſt's Church, and thereby provide for the Purity of Faith and Unity of the Church withal. And I ſee no reaſon why the Church of <hi>England</hi> (being a part of the Church Catholick, but no way ſubject to the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> may not adventure to deſire them to conſider the things that belong to their own Salvation as well as the Peace of Chriſt's Church, and how much they are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obliged by all the commands and bonds of Unity that are obligatory upon Chriſtians, as to lay aſide their claim to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all the Churches of Chriſt, which is not given them of God, and which they chiefly challenge to maintain what they cannot otherwiſe defend, ſo eſpecially to reform all thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Laws and Practices that have been experienced prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Faith, and eſtabliſh ſuch as may advance and promote it, ſince by doing this which is otherwiſe their duty, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that, which themſelves pretend ſo earneſtly to ſeek, and which we acknowledg and pray for as the greateſt bleſſing next to Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, the Peace and Union of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

            <head>Reflections upon his <hi>Paſtoral Letter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere can be but two aims, as I apprehend, in diſperſing this Letter among us; one to perſuade us that there is no ſuch Perſecution of Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> as is pretended; the other, that the Reaſons upon which ſuch multitudes are Proſelyted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or thoſe at leaſt which M. <hi>Meaux</hi> gives in this Letter are ſo convincing, as to oblige the reſt of the World to follow their example.</p>
            <p>What he affirms in relation to the firſt, that <hi>not one among them had ſuffered violence either in Perſon or Goods,</hi> is ſo notorious a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, that I may leave <hi>all thoſe</hi> to believe him <hi>that can.</hi> For none certainly can admit the belief of it, but ſuch as can force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to believe againſt all the evidence of their ſenſes and reaſon.</p>
            <p>Waving this therefore, I ſhall content my ſelf to examine the main thing that concerns us, Whether there be any thing of <hi>ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the motives he gives to confirm his Proſelytes. Though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall not concern myſelf with what particularly relates to the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, or with any advantages that he may ſeem to have over them, but only with ſuch as may be ſuppoſed of equal force againſt the Reformed Church of <hi>England:</hi> my buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to oppoſe the deſign that ſeems aimed at in their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Letter among us.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing conſiderable, is what he ſays, <hi>pag. 4. That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his other Colleagues have this glory which they will not ſuffer to be taken from them, that they have never condemned their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and Preached no other Doctrine than what they received from them: Whereas the Biſhops of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. at their going off from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>manifeſtly renounced the Doctrin of their Predeceſſors.</hi> Now no man will envy them this glory, that they have <hi>obstinately</hi> retained thoſe <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> which their Predeceſſors had admitted: The glory of the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> is this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>purged</hi> themſelves from thoſe corruptions which time, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and baſe intreſts had brought into the Church of God, they now retain the <hi>Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from which the <hi>Romanists</hi> pretending to follow their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors are greatly deviated.</p>
            <p>For though M. <hi>Meaux</hi> has the face to ſay, <hi>That we cannot produce
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94907:65"/>
any one instance of a change in Doctrine, and that thoſe changes we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend are rightly called</hi> Inſenſible, <hi>becauſe we cannot make them out:</hi> Yet the pitiful defence he has made for his Church in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wherein we charge them with <hi>Innovations,</hi> does ſufficiently ſhew them to be <hi>ſuch;</hi> and the inconſiſtency of thoſe Doctrines with Chriſtianity does likewiſe evidence, that though they may have been called <hi>inſenſible changes,</hi> becauſe <hi>inſenſibly</hi> introduced, yet now they are <hi>viſibly</hi> and <hi>palpably</hi> deſtructive of the Faith.</p>
            <p>It's true indeed, as he ſays, <hi>The ſucceſſion of Paſtors and Doctrine ought not to be ſeparated; and, bleſſed be God, our Church of</hi> England, <hi>as it now holds the Christian truth in the Purity of it, has alſo enjoyed as uninterrupted a ſucceſſion of Paſtors as any Church whatever.</hi> But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretences to a ſucceſſion of Paſtors is vain, ſo long as the Chriſtian Doctrine is not preſerved entire, which an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion of Paſtors proves not to be ſo preſerved, whilſt there is a poſſibility for thoſe Paſtors to admit Innovations agreeable to their own Opinions or Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The next conſiderable thing that he urges, is the Authority of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from whom he cites ſeveral paſſages pretended to conclude us under a neceſſity of holding Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to render all that ſeparate from it guilty of Schiſm. Wherein, ſince he blames others for not taking his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine entire, he ought to have been ſincere himſelf, and not have caught up <hi>fragments</hi> of him here and there to adorn his deceitful diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place cited, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does indeed ſay, <hi>That to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the unity of his Church our Saviour ſaid to Peter ſingle, Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. but he ſays likewiſe, <hi>That he gave to all his Apoſtles equal power;</hi> but this M. <hi>Meaux</hi> thought beſt to leave out. His words are, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94907:66"/>
the beginning of it proceeds from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, that it might evidence the Church to be one.</hi> It's evident therefore that St <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intend to acknowledg St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Head of the reſt of the Apoſtles, or that they derived their Authority from him, ſince he ſays, <hi>That they had an equal Power and Authority given them by Chriſt:</hi> His meaning then can be only this, that to evidence the neceſſity of Unity in the Church, our Saviour gave that Authority firſt to <hi>Peter</hi> ſingle, which he afterwards gave to <hi>all together,</hi> to ſhew them that they ought in their ſeveral functions to aim all at the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of his Church.</hi> He ſays indeed, that <hi>Epiſcopacy is one,</hi> but he adds what M. <hi>Meaux</hi> thought beſt for his <note place="margin">Cujus à ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis in ſolidum Pars tenetur Ibid.</note> purpoſe to leave out—<hi>Whereof every one holds a part with full and ample Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays likewiſe, <hi>Adulterari non potest ſponſa Christi, incorrupta est &amp; Pudica,</hi> but he does not ſay it for any ſuch reaſon as this Gentleman pretends, <hi>lest we ſhould imagine ſome caſes might happen, in which it might be lawful to ſeparate from the Church, or reform her Doctrine;</hi> as thought it were impoſſible for a Church to fall into error, or to have need of being reformed. The coherence of the Diſcourſe makes them bear a different meaning, <hi>viz. That the true Spouſe of Chriſt cannot admit this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to be interrupted, will not be corrupted to diviſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Father further ſays, <hi>That he that ſeparates himſelf from the Church has no part in Christs promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. We readily affirm the ſame of ſuch as do it without a cauſe: But no advantage can be hence taken againſt us, 'till M. <hi>Meaux</hi> has firſt proved that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is this only true Church of Chriſt. He would have gained a great point indeed, if we were obliged to take it for granted that the <hi>Roman</hi> is this only true Church of Chriſt, and if the true Church was not to be ſought and known by an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of her Doctrines, and their conſiſtency with the Faith. But he groſly abuſes this good Father, when he would perſuade us that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would not ſuffer men to enquire after the true Church, by examining her Doctrine, but to know her firſt, and then believe we cannot have ſalvation out of her For ſo far as I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he does not give the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thing in his Book, <hi>De unitate Eccleſiae:</hi> And if he ſhould, I ſee no reaſon that any have to ſubſcribe to him, when indeed the Church being a Society profeſſing the Faith of Chriſt, and ſubſiſting for the maintenance of it, there can be no means of knowing which is that Church, but by knowing firſt the Faith of Chriſt, and alſo that this Church profeſſes and holds the ſame. But I need not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about that for which he falſly pretends this Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:94907:66"/>
It's true, in this Book, <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> only urges the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and the Crime of thoſe that break it; but there would be no reaſon to look upon his Arguments ſo ſtrong, if the Church he defends had done any thing to the prejudice of the Faith: and therefore in other places he defends the cauſe of the Church in this caſe by the righteouſneſs of it; by proofs from Scripture of the innocency and lawfulneſs of that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to her as a Crime. And therefore I moſt of all admire, that he could have the face to abuſe thoſe other words of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Antonian,</hi> to ſo falſe an intent, as if he had uſed them to forbid an enquiry after mens Doctrine, and to oblige us to ſubmit to that which the Church holds without enquiry. Whereas not only the caſe St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes upon is utterly different, but even the method he takes in this very Epiſtle to ſatisfie <hi>Antonian</hi> and the connection of his Diſcourſe, ſhew his ſenſe to be as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what M. <hi>Meaux</hi> would impoſe on us as poſſibly can be. For in the beginning of the Epiſtle he tells him, <hi>That his careful and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 51. ad Anton.</note> 
               <hi>ſolicitous enquiry after the truth was not to be blamed, tho' he was in part blamable in that he wavered in the Reſolution he had first taken and certified him and</hi> Cornelius <hi>of, that he would not communicate with</hi> Novatian. After which he proceeds to give him an account of the cauſe of the Church, upon what account they admitted lapſed perſons to the Communion, (which was charged as a crime on the Church by <hi>Novatian)</hi> relating the matter of fact, the reaſons of it, and its conſiſtency with Chriſtian Diſcipline, proving it out of the holy Scriptures. Then he further gives account of the Election of <hi>Cornelius</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> of his Manners and Life, and purges him from the ſcandal his Adverſaries had thrown upon him. And then indeed he ſays, <hi>As for that which concerns the perſon of</hi> Novatian, <hi>ſince you deſire to be informed what Hereſie he has introduced, you must know before all things, that we need not curiouſly enquire what he has taught, ſince he hath taught out of the Church; who or what ſoever he be, he can be no Chriſtian, being out of the Church of Christ.</hi> But in the following words he gives the reaſon of it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had broke the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, by ambitiouſly aſpiring to the Biſhoprick, and getting himſelf made Biſhop by ſome deſerters, and to make a greater party, ſetting up ſeveral other ſalſe Biſhops in thoſe Provinces and Cities wherein were already ſeated Biſhops of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Faith and tried Conſtancy.</hi> Whereupon he indeed ſays, <hi>It was no matter whether</hi> Novatian <hi>introduced any Hereſie or not, ſolong as he was the Author of ſo great a Schiſm.</hi> Whereby it appears, that he is far from ſuppoſing what M. <hi>Meaux</hi> pretends, he only telling <hi>Antonian, That it was no matter what Doctrine</hi> Novatian <hi>taught,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94907:67"/>
becauſe he had ſhewn himſelf unchriſtian, by breaking the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, and making a Schiſm without cauſe.</hi> So that the caſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is that of man breaking the Unity of the Church, be his Doctrine what it will, tho' the ſame which the Church teaches: not a caſe wherein the Church needs a Reformation and the adverſe party has Truth and Scripture of his ſide; as it muſt have been to be applicable to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Reformed.</p>
            <p>It's true St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> likewiſe ſays, <hi>The promiſe of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> to be in the midſt where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſuppoſes them aſſembled in Christ, which he thinks they cannot be, whilst they are ſeperate from the Church of Christ:</hi> But this is beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Queſtion to uſe this againſt us, till it appears that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only True Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But M. <hi>Meanx</hi> ſays, <hi>The Church of which this holy Martyr ſpeaks, is that which acknowledges at</hi> Rome <hi>the</hi> head of her Communion <hi>and in the Place of</hi> Peter <hi>the eminent degree of the Sacerdotal Chair, which there acknowledges the Chair of</hi> Peter <hi>and the Principal Church from which the Sacerdotal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity hath taken its original,</hi> &amp;c. Which any one that reads would think that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſaid theſe things to diſtinguiſh that Church out of whoſe Communion there is no ſalvation: whereas they are only ſome ſcattered Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his uſed upon quite different occaſions, not in the leaſt to mark out the Church, as this man pretends. He ſays not ſo far as I can find in any of the places cited, that the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges at <hi>Rome</hi> the Head of her Communion. 'Tis true, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Antonian,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he ſays, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Ant. 51.</note> 
               <hi>he was made Biſhop when none was made before him, when the place of</hi> Fabian, <hi>i. e. the place of</hi> Peter <hi>and degree of the Sacerdotal Chair was void:</hi> which as it was not ſpoken by him to diſtinguiſh the Church, ſo the utmoſt that can be made of it, is only that he look'd upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Succeſſor to <hi>Peter.</hi> Neither are the words in the Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> uſed to the purpoſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but occaſionally only in writing to <hi>Cornelius</hi> about <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> who, being condemned and cenſured in his own Church, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he calls, <hi>the Chair of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Church, where the Sacerdotal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity hath its original:</hi> yet in that very place he diſowns all Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop above his Brethren, and lets him know, <hi>that every Paſtor had a portion of the flock aſſigned him, which every one was to rile and govern,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ad Corn. Epiſt. 54.</note> 
               <hi>being to give account thereof to God.</hi> Again, ſpeaking of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Antonian,</hi> he highly commends his conſtancy and courage, and lets him know how that he ſate undaunted in the Sacerdotal Chair at <hi>that time, when the Emperor was ſo incenſed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94907:67"/>
against the Chriſtians and the Prieſts of God, that he could leſs endure</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 51. ad Anton.</note> 
               <hi>a Biſhop at</hi> Rome, <hi>then a Rival contending for the Empire.</hi> But he ſays not a word of that which M. <hi>Meaux</hi> ſlyly inſinuates, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's taking on him the Title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> as though the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop was hateful to him only as he was his Rival in the Prieſthood; as if the Chriſtians had then acknowledged the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Chief Prieſt of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>I am not concerned with thoſe Objections he makes againſt the Miniſtry of the Reformiſts in <hi>France,</hi> there being no ſuch preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our Succeſſion in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore may leave them to anſwer for themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The next thing he attempts, is to vindicate their Litanies, wherein they pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Angels, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. to pray for them, from tending to God's diſhonour. But that a</q> man may pray to theſe to pray for him, and yet come little ſhort of Idolatry therein, if he ſets no bounds to his deſires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders not the infinite diſtance between God and his Creatures, has been ſhewn by me, <hi>p.</hi> 22. alſo that ſuch Prayers, tho' the difference be obſerved, do notwithſtanding tend to God's diſhonour, being neceſſarily made upon a ſuppoſition that the Saints are endued with ſuch qualities as are peculiar to God, and are not (ſo far as we know) communicated to them. For which reaſons I do not wonder that M. <hi>Meaux</hi> is ſo willing to paſs over this as a <hi>captious Queſtion,</hi> Whether the Saints <hi>hear our Prayers, or no?</hi> For ſo long as this is a Queſtion, and likewiſe ſo long as it is not revealed, that we ſhould have recourſe to theſe, but only to God, through one only Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus, all their extenuations and ſhifts will never be able to clear this practice from tending to God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and being injurious to Chriſt's mediatorſhip, ſince it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſuch perfections in the Creature, as are not revealed to us to be any where but in the Creator, and is alſo no other than an invention of our own, whereby we pretend to ſeek God by them that he has not directed us to approach him by.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon upon which he calls this Queſtion <hi>Captious</hi> is very inconſiderable, for if we ſhould allow that the Holy Angels hear us and pray for us, I do not think it a Cavil to deny this (if true, which it is not) to be a proof, that the Saints do likewiſe hear us, unleſs he had ſhewn us where he learnt, what he ſo boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, <hi>That the Beatified Souls are united with the Angels in the</hi> ſame Illuminations. Beſides, whilſt he finds ſo great fault with others, for uſing the obſcure parts of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it's much he ſhould make uſe of it himſelf, as if it were a clear proof of his unwarrantable aſſertion. The place cited, is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94907:68"/>
               <hi>Rev. 8. v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. where indeed there is an Angel repreſented with Incenſe, offering it with the Prayers of Saints, and the ſmoke of the Incenſe offered with the Prayers aſcending up before God: But what ground is there from ſuch a Repreſentation, expreſt in a Viſion, very probably to prefigure the Devotions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe Prayers are here repreſented, as coming up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God, and being accepted of him as incenſe aſcending out of the hand of the Prieſt; to infer either that the Angels do preſent our Prayers, or that they hear the Prayers men make to them to Pray for them, or to preſent their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God; when the Scripture has expreſly ſet forth unto us <hi>another High Priest, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne,</hi> to appear in the preſence of God for us?</p>
            <p>Their Uſe of Images is the next thing he endeavors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, wherein he is very unwilling to enter into diſpute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; and therefore laying aſide thoſe Queſtions that ought to have been reſolved in the firſt place: <hi>Whether the Church can command the uſe of Images in Religious Worſhip without warrant from the Word of God; whether it ought not now eſpecially to lay aſide a Practice which hath been experienced to bring in danger of Idolatry:</hi> he ſets his wits on work to find out Similies, and ſuch like Shifts that he thought might give ſome plauſible colour to theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whereupon firſt he asks us, <q>Whether we can believe an injury done to God in the kiſſing, as they do, the Book of the Goſpel, and riſing up to honour it, when it is carried in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony before them, and bowing the Head before it? But now</q> it cannot be ſaid whether they do injure God thereby or not, without a perfect knowledge of their Practice, to which I am a Stranger; yet undoubtedly it may be abuſed to that Superſtition, that God ſhall be diſhonoured thereby, and let them reſolve us whether they think it would not if Divine and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were given to it?</p>
            <p>He further objects, <q>That we make no difficulty of ſwearing upon the Goſpel, when at the ſame time it is not by the Ink and Paper, Letters and Characters that we ſwear, but by the eternal Verity which theſe things repreſent, which we look not upon as any derogation from God, and therefore ſhould not account their uſe of Images ſuch. To which I anſwer, Firſt, That the</q> Caſes are very different; the one, though a ſolemn Action, yet not being any part of God's ordinary worſhip, as the other is. That ſecondly, Though an Oath be indeed a calling God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Truth, yet we never find that he preſcribed any Rules concerning, or forbid the uſe of any Ceremonies in it, but has
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94907:68"/>
left it to the liberty of men to uſe it with what Ceremonies they pleaſe: That therefore this cannot be drawn into conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence where the caſe is not parallel. That again, it does not appear, that this cuſtom of ſwearing upon the Goſpel, did ever occaſion that diſhonour of God, that palpable Idolatry in ſome, and danger of it in others, which the uſe of Images in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip has; that if it did appear, I ſhould think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be uſed any longer.</p>
            <p>But to the pitiful evaſion, <hi>That an Image is but another manner of writing; that therefore this Scripture of Images ſhould be as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable as that which is made upon Paper, Paper and Letters being the work of mens hands, as well as Sculpture and Painting;</hi> I ſhall only ſay this; That if ſuch honour and worſhip were given to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Prints of the Bible, as they give to Images, I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould not be thought highly offenſive to God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he that ſhall look upon this as concluſive, that we may as well uſe theſe in Gods Service, as the writings of Scripture, might conclude by the ſame reaſon, that it was as lawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> to make Images, and ſet them up in their Temples for God's worſhip, as to uſe the Books of the Law and Prophets therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhould you be more ſcrupulous of making your Prayers to Chriſt before an Image, than before a Pillar or a Wall?</hi> He might have forborn this Queſtion, unleſs he had profeſſed the caſe to be the ſame, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> matters not if we give no more reſpect to theſe than to the Wall or Pillar we kneel by; but this I believe he dares not affirm in Behalf of his Church.</p>
            <p>He further tell us, <hi>It is Superſtition to fear that our Devotions ſhould terminate in the Image, when we direct them to Christ.</hi> Now I would willingly know what it would terminate in if Chriſt ſhould refuſe to accept it; and whether he can ſecure us that an intention to do this or that in honour to Chriſt, ſhall be accepted by him, though it be not what he directs us to for his honour, but an invention of our own? But what I moſt of all admire, is, that he ſhould have the <hi>Face</hi> to call it <hi>Superſtition</hi> for us to fear leſt in honouring Images, we ſhould have our hearts drawn from honouring Chriſt, and fix them upon theſe: he might as well have called it <hi>Folly</hi> in <hi>God Almighty</hi> to ſuffer <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> to be the provocation of his <hi>Jealouſie;</hi> for if there be no reaſon for us to fear <hi>its drawing off our hearts from God,</hi> there can be none for God to be <hi>jealous</hi> of us upon that ſcore.</p>
            <p>There will be ſome reaſon for his limiting the Commandment that forbids to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>bow down to Images,</hi> only to the doing this in <hi>the Spirit of Pagans,</hi> believing them filled with a divine virtue
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94907:69"/>
or that the Divinity is incorporated with them; when he ſhall ſhew, what he ſays he eaſily can, <hi>That the Philoſophers that bore above the common Error of Mankind, and declared that they did not worſhip the Image, but uſed them only to put them in mind of God, did indeed</hi> notwithſtanding their Declaration to the contrary, <hi>put their truſt</hi> in the Images themſelves. But till then, for the ſame Reaſons that the Scriptures call the Pagans worſhippers of <hi>Stocks</hi> and <hi>Stones,</hi> though they declared otherwiſe of themſelves; we can account thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome but little better,</hi> whilſt ſome of leſs underſtanding have been known to place a <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in the Images they uſe, and the more intelligent (tho' profeſſing otherwiſe) <hi>have relapſed into it in ſome kind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Impiety of the publick Worſhip, in adhering to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of it.</hi> For it is but a pitiful ſhift to ſay that the abuſe of this Practice among particular perſons, if it be tolerated, yet it is not <hi>approved</hi> by the Church, ſince the Church continues to command that which has been the occaſion of it. Wherefore though I dare not with M. <hi>Meaux</hi> paſs ſo ſevere a cenſure, or pronounce any man <hi>accurſed of God,</hi> yet I am ſure he is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be accurſed of him, who defends a Practice that has been experienced to be the occaſion of Idolatry, and labours notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſeduce men to it; than thoſe who refuſe ſubmiſſion to a Practice ſo manifeſtly deſtructive of God's true Worſhip, and make it their buſineſs to prevent others from the danger of ſuch Snares.</p>
            <p>As to their Ceremonies, which he ſeeks to defend by the uſe of ſome ſuch in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have before obſerved, that it is the multitude of them that makes them ſo dangerous, becauſe they are hereby apt to take up the greateſt part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and draw men off from the ſpiritual Worſhip of God, and thoſe that ſpend too great a Zeal upon them, will be apt to look upon them as all the Services they need pay to God, and thereupon neglect the principal Duties of Religion.</p>
            <p>Whereas he will have it a Calumny on their Church, that they conceal the Myſteries of Religion from the People whilſt they perform the Service of God in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue; that very Decree which he thinks to get off his Church by, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make it the more culpable: For if it be <hi>neceſſary leſt the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones want Bread, that the Paſtors explain to them ſome part of the Myſteries:</hi> This very Reaſon proves that the whole Service of God ought to be performed in the vulgar Tongue, that they may at all times and in all particulars underſtand and joyn in the Services of God, to his Honour, and their own growth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Grace and Virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:94907:69"/>
But at length, he comes to the Doctrine of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and herein compares us to <hi>Socinus,</hi> and the Diſciples of <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatenus,</hi> 
               <q>becauſe we follow our humane Senſe and Reaſon, and are reſolved to believe that Bread and Wine remain, becauſe they appear to our Senſes. But before he had fixt this Charge</q> upon us, he ſhould have ſhewn us as clear a Revelation for the proof of their feigned <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as there is for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and as clear a Command for us to worſhip the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as there is for us to worſhip <hi>Chriſt, God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difference betwixt the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Worſhip of Chriſt in the <hi>Sarament,</hi> and that of the Adoration of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> itſelf, which is the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, has been already ſtated. <hi>p.</hi> 87. For that the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine obliges to worſhip the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Chriſt in the Sacrament,</hi> as M. <hi>Meaux<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> would here inſinuate, has been evidenced already from the Words of the <hi>Trent-Council,</hi> and that ſo the generality of their Authors underſtand it, we are ſure from hence; That they confeſs this their Adoration would be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> if <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were not true.</p>
            <p>There is one peculiar Notion which M. <hi>Meaux</hi> has concerning the manner of the Efficacy of this Sacrament, to wit, That <hi>Jeſus Christ, by uniting himſelf to our bodies, makes his Grace and his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue paſs into our ſouls,</hi> ſuppoſing that his fleſh taken in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becomes incorporated with ours, which does both certainly vacate the neceſſity of our receiving this Sacrament more than once, unleſs it can be ſhewn how that fleſh of his, which is once united to us ſhould become diſunited, and alſo makes it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to give a reaſon why the body of Chriſt, which, according to their Doctrine, is received by all alike, ſhould not be alike effectual to all.</p>
            <p>His Harangue about their being content to Communicate in one kind, may be eaſily turned upon him, by demanding, Ought you not to let us communicate according to our <hi>Saviour's Inſtitution,</hi> as our Saviour communicated his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the <hi>first Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>pious Antiquity</hi> communicated for <hi>ſeveral hundred years?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But in that we own the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have been a true Church, and Salvation to be had in it, he preſumes we are thereby obliged to own, that this Sacrament is adminiſtred to its full effect in that Church, tho' given only in one kind:</q> however, tho' we ſhould allow it to be the mark of a true Church, that it rightly Adminiſters the Sacraments, yet there is no neceſſity that a defect herein muſt preſently cauſe it to ceaſe to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94907:70"/>
a Church, tho' it will be indeed a corrupt one when the Miniſtry ſhall deprive the People of part of that Food that is neceſſary to Spiritual Life; perhaps therefore it may be allowed, that this Sacrament may be effectual in one kind to thoſe that cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any more from the Church, and yet the Church herſelf, by thus depriving her Children of a part of this Sacrament, may lye under the guilt of withholding the neceſſary means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of voiding Chriſt's Inſtitution, and it will be no thanks to the Church, if God, may out of the greatneſs of his mercy, ſupply the want by ſome extraordinary way of thoſe means which the Curch unjuſtly withholds from her Children.</p>
            <p>But, ſays he, <hi>You content your ſelves upon the Faith of the Church as to your</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>in that you are not then plunged and dipt under Water, which the Word</hi> Baptized <hi>doth properly ſignifie.</hi> Whereas the Caſe is very different; for in that of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby of the Eſſence of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> diminiſhed, which depends only upon the waſhing with Water, not upon the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity wherewith we are waſhed; however the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires, that <hi>where the Child is able to bear it, it be dipt under the Water;</hi> whereas in the other a part that eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſtitutes the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is wholly taken away; for as to the quantity of Wine, there would certainly be no Contention.</p>
            <p>Theſe, as near as I could collect them, are all the material things in his Letter; the reſt of it either concerns not us, or is only a Noiſe of Words made to amuſe the Underſtandings, and work on the Fancies of weaker men. It is the uſual way, 'tis true, for the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> having neither Scripture nor Reaſon to alledge, to cant, and make a great Stir with high Words, ſuch as <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, Succeſſor of</hi> Peter, <hi>Apostolick See, Principal Church,</hi> &amp;c. urging theſe as undeniable Proofs of their Churches Authority and Infallibility; whereas indeed they ſignifie nothing, though they have been prevalent with ſome beyond their true force. But ſince after ſo perfect a view of the utmoſt of all they can with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence ſay for themſelves, their Errors and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appear ſo great, none (I hope) will ſuffer themſelves to be frighted into a Subjection to them, by thoſe high Words, which, without the leaſt reaſon they have the confidence to uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to themſelves.</p>
