         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Truly Honourable, And constantly LOYAL (my ever Honour'd Friend,) Sir EDWARD DERING, of SHARSTED in the County of KENT, <hi>K<hi rend="sup">nt:</hi>
               </hi> One of His Majesties Commissioners of the PEACE for the said COUNTY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot so much for your Countenance and Encouragement to Me, (though that's a favour I shall ever covet) as to the TRUTH, do I at this time appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and pray your <hi>Iudgement</hi> in a <hi>Cause,</hi> (which against my will) I am made a PARTY to, by a Learned, yet unknown <hi>AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSARY.</hi> I am (Learned Sir) for the <hi>Truth</hi>'s sake as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted! And I cannot but with an humble security pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise my self, where I have ever found (even in Ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cases) a <hi>Refuge,</hi> that Divine URANIA can never fail of finding her ASYLUM. It is not I therefore, but TRUTH that seeks your Noble PATRONAGE at this <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>ADVERSARY</hi> seems to be a <hi>Benefic'd</hi> Man, though not the <hi>Poor One</hi> he Stiles himself; (that I look
<pb facs="tcp:108979:3"/>
on only as Complement to my <hi>Lord Bishop</hi>) and gives us to understand that he can by the <hi>Canon,</hi> wear a <hi>ShortGown</hi>: (I hope he intends not to <hi>Lengthen</hi> his Garment by Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Furrows</hi> upon the Back of my <hi>Reputation</hi>; I never did him wrong: I do not know him.) But, as for <hi>Me,</hi> (Learned Sir) I have not the Honour of either <hi>Benefice,</hi> or <hi>Gown</hi> to boast of. Yet, when I consider I have your <hi>Favour,</hi> I esteem that every whit as <hi>Great,</hi> and as <hi>Dear</hi> to <hi>Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> tells us as Truly, as Eloquently,— <hi>That all are not</hi> Israel, <hi>that are of</hi> Israel. And I find a <hi>Man</hi> may be in <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Benefic'd</hi> too, and yet have somewhat of the <hi>Salamander</hi> in him, which may make even the <hi>Flames of Contention</hi> his Delight. I could willingly hope better of my Learned <hi>Adversary,</hi> though, all things consider'd, I have but little Reason. For, I believe I am the <hi>First Man,</hi> that have been questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for matter of <hi>Fact</hi> in <hi>Art,</hi> after <hi>Twenty Four years</hi> time; (and I think my <hi>Antagonist</hi> is the <hi>First</hi> CLERGIMAN that ever serv'd any Man so) whereas if either the <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Law had been valuable with <hi>Him</hi> in this matter, a <hi>Seven years</hi> space must have <hi>Limited</hi> us both, and cover'd my Imperfections (had I been guilty) with an AMNESTIA, or a JUBILEE.</p>
            <p>It is my great unhappiness not to be acquainted with that most Noble <hi>Lord</hi> and Excellent PRELATE before whom my <hi>Adversary</hi> hath Arraigned me, that I might have presumed to entrust my <hi>Cause</hi> with <hi>Him</hi>: For I am fully perswaded <hi>He</hi> would do me <hi>Iustice,</hi> as <hi>Fame</hi> tells me <hi>He</hi> doth to the whole World. But I have an <hi>Humble Sign</hi> Ascending at my <hi>Birth,</hi> and dare not be
<pb facs="tcp:108979:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Confident,</hi> but where I am thoroughly <hi>Known.</hi> And that is another Reason (most Honour'd Sir) why I implore your Worthy <hi>Iudgement</hi> between <hi>Me</hi> and my <hi>Opponent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have had, and ever shall have, an Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for the <hi>Church,</hi> and all the Worthy <hi>Dignitories</hi> thereof, esteeming them the Lawful <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of the Blessed <hi>Iesus.</hi> And, could I be Reasonably perswaded that either my STUDY or PRACTICE of ASTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGY were UNLAWFUL, and prejudicial to <hi>Either,</hi> I would never Set a FIGURE, or make an ALMANACK more. So much unwilling am I (Sir) to <hi>Offend</hi> those I ought to <hi>Obey</hi>; So far should I be from <hi>Opposing</hi> the truly <hi>Venerable Persons</hi> of that <hi>Sacred Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, (Learned Sir) when I know that many of our <hi>best Authors</hi> in ASTROLOGY have been DIVINES, who have not only largely <hi>Cultivated,</hi> but liberally <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> the ART, I cannot believe that I ERR in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so <hi>Harmless,</hi> so <hi>Useful,</hi> so <hi>Veritable</hi> a STUDY, <hi>Sed, sub Iudice lis est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> is before you (Honour'd Sir) and your <hi>Noble Iudgement</hi> is <hi>Prayed</hi> in the <hi>Case.</hi> I will not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, or troubled at whatsoever CENSURE you shall please to <hi>Pass</hi>; For I am well assured that your <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in <hi>Art</hi> is such, as renders you a most Proper and Capable JUDGE in this Affair: and I dare believe, That (like <hi>Soloman</hi>) you will Judge <hi>Righteous Iudgement</hi>: Let the <hi>Mothers</hi> of both <hi>Children</hi> (or <hi>Arguments</hi>) Plead, (as animated by their Passions) never so <hi>waywardly,</hi> or in Favour of their own <hi>Cause,</hi> or <hi>Issue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the TRUTHS of ASTROLOGY Rise, and Shine under your <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi>; and, the ERRORS
<pb facs="tcp:108979:4"/>
pretended to belong thereunto, be ever <hi>Banish'd,</hi> and Disown'd, as by your Honour'd <hi>Self,</hi> so, by <hi>All</hi> that shall dare to profess themselves <hi>Subjects</hi> of URANIA.

and not be acquainted with their <hi>Influences,</hi> is to as little purpose, as for a <hi>Physician</hi> to know the names of <hi>Drugs,</hi> and yet be utterly <hi>Ignorant</hi> of their <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of so mean, nay so vain use, is <hi>Astronomy</hi> without <hi>Astrology:</hi> though the <hi>One</hi> be Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally beloved by Men, the <hi>Other</hi> generally disesteemed. So Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, so Partial are Men in their choise of things, that they Elect the <hi>Shell</hi> before the <hi>Kernil,</hi> believe the <hi>Body</hi> to be more Rich and worthy, than the <hi>Soul</hi> that animates and invigorates it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are self tormentors,</hi> (saith the <hi>Learned</hi> Thomas Albius) <hi>who fret that those things are unknown, which are publickly known to others, but are unknown to them; because upon some extrinsecal prejudice they neglect enquiring into what others have said. Which Race of Men is at this day most frequent with the Courtiers of</hi> Science, <hi>but withall most insufferable For what can be viler than to shut the Eyes against things most manifest to the understanding, upon the Calumnies of such as profess they know not these Things, which others constantly affirm are most evidently comprehended.</hi>

            <p>Being sometime since in discourse with a Learned and Reverend <hi>Divine</hi> about this Vain and prejudicate humour of Men.— That meerly because <hi>others</hi> had <hi>condemn'd Astrology, They</hi> would do so too.— He very mildely and Iudiciously Replies,— <hi>That such Persons were Fetter'd in Chains of Darkness: For</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be Ignorant only, is to be in a State of Darkness; but to be in an Ignorant Prejudice, is to be in Chains.</hi>

            <p>The late Right Reverend Father in God, the most Learned Doctor <hi>Saunderson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> happening upon the <hi>Doctrine of Nativities,</hi> was pleased to expend not less than Five hours one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, in the perusal thereof. Which when He had done, His <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's</hi> then <hi>Secretary</hi> (and my very good Friend) prayed his Opinion thereof, and also of the <hi>Art</hi> it self. Whose answer was, <hi>That He thereby perceived there was some Learning in the World of which He was Ignorant. That the Art might be Lawful, if not Unlawfully used. That He knew the</hi> Stars <hi>had Powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, but that Gods Grace was more Powerful.</hi> A most excellent and Divine <hi>Truth</hi>! Worthy the Tongue of so great and so good a <hi>Prelate</hi>! Worthy to be Written in <hi>Letters of Gold,</hi> to be a Memorial for future Generations to follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108979:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>That most Excellent and Pious Martyr, and <hi>Prelate</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> in his Sermon to the <hi>Parliament March</hi> the <hi>17th. 1628.</hi> on <hi>Ephes. 4. v. 3.</hi> gives his <hi>Vote</hi> for <hi>Astrology,</hi> (unless you will believe he made sport with so great a Man as <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> upon so solemn an occasion, and <hi>Burlesqu'd</hi> both <hi>Him</hi> and the <hi>Art</hi> together; which He was too Learned, too Wise, too Good, and too Grave a Man to do.)

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108979:6"/>Here you may see, <hi>Mars was truly in Aspect to the Lord of the Second House,</hi> and in opposition to the Governess of the <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope</hi> also, posited in the <hi>Angle</hi> representing <hi>Fears,</hi> &amp;c. Which proves that this thrice Learned and most Reverend <hi>Prelate</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in the sence he ought to be understood. And it is for that end I produce the <hi>Scheme</hi> of Heaven which <hi>He</hi> in that <hi>His</hi> most Excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> referred to. There is no question but this <hi>Good Bishop</hi> saw other remarkable things in the <hi>Figure;</hi> but because His <hi>Grace</hi> was pleased to omit mentioning of them, and remember only the violent Influence of <hi>Mars,</hi> it will become me also to conceal Them.</p>
            <p>None ever yet condemn'd <hi>Astrology</hi> that thorougly understood it. <hi>Picus</hi> Earl of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> who wrote largely against <hi>Astrology,</hi> tho' a great <hi>Schollar</hi> in the General, yet I dare not allow him such in this Learning. For he died before the thirty third year of his Age And what <hi>Experience</hi> in so <hi>Abstruse</hi> an <hi>Art</hi> could he attain unto in so short a time, had all his years (since his Iudgement began to take place) been imployed in this <hi>Study?</hi> surely very little! Many can talke of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> that cannot shoot in his <hi>Bow. Dwarfs</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tak off <hi>Giants</hi> Caps. <hi>Falshood</hi> may be drest up in as fine words, as <hi>Truth;</hi> and a <hi>Painted Courtezan</hi> may sometimes look more <hi>Glaring,</hi> than an excellent <hi>Native Beauty;</hi> at least to common Eyes.— Let our pretended <hi>Refuters</hi> shew us their <hi>Experiences</hi> they would convince us by, and if upon examination we cannot <hi>clear</hi> our selves, we will submit. But we expect then that <hi>They</hi> will do the like: That is but Reason. <hi>Picus</hi> was a Learned Man and a great <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> and had read and wrote much for his time; but that is not enough to make an <hi>Astrologer.</hi> This Noble Man had an afflicted <hi>Mercury,</hi> which made his <hi>Study</hi> in such <hi>Arts</hi> his <hi>Disease,</hi> not his <hi>Delight:</hi> And such a <hi>Native</hi> can never be a true <hi>Servant</hi> or <hi>Votary</hi> to Divine <hi>Urania. Sextus ab Heminga,</hi> was a very severe and sower <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Stars,</hi> and Truths of <hi>Astrology</hi>: yet the Learned <hi>Morinus</hi> Physician to the King of <hi>France,</hi> is not affraid to pronounce Him therein a very <hi>Ignorant Fellow,</hi> and one that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>Nothing</hi> of the <hi>Science</hi> he went about to Refute. Mr. <hi>John Chambers</hi> wrote a bitter and Sarcastical Discourse against this <hi>Art:</hi> He was Learnedly and Mildly answer'd by Sir <hi>Christopher Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which Book, when he saw, and therein found his Sapless <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry</hi> refuted; he replyed not, but soon after died.</p>

The <hi>Caelestial Clock-work</hi> always goes <hi>True,</hi> though, by reason of <hi>Humane Frailty</hi> we do not always truly observe it.</p>
            <p>This excellent <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Astrology,</hi> (though my <hi>Antagonist</hi> thinks it be now near its <hi>Vertex,</hi> and therein allows some Truths to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by it, though in other cases allows it no <hi>Kin</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> at all: (Let him answer for that) is, God knows, but very <hi>darkly</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely</hi> understood. The greatest of our <hi>Knowledge</hi> in these <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Speculations,</hi> is the least part of what we are <hi>Ignorant.</hi> And that part of it which is known to us (such is the misfortune of all Mankind since <hi>Adam</hi>"s Transgression) we too often apply to a wrong purpose, and by our neglect, haste, or ignorance, <hi>Club</hi> to our own <hi>Deceptions.</hi> We frequently <hi>Cheat</hi> our selves with a <hi>Non-cause,</hi> instead of a <hi>True Cause.</hi> We too commonly give <hi>Judgement</hi> under <hi>Cross Ascendants,</hi> without consideration, and so bring disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto our <hi>selves</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> together.</p>
            <p>But is not all Mankind liable to be imposed upon by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Deception?</hi> Doth not the same misfortunes attend all other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences?</hi> It would undo the Learned <hi>Grammarian,</hi> should he be compell'd to Plead to all the <hi>Actions</hi> that <hi>Priscian</hi> might bring against him in a year. Yes! though he had a favourable <hi>Jury,</hi> and chosen out of his own Fraternity too; if (like our late <hi>Associators</hi>) They, to <hi>Perjure</hi> themselves, did not return an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> The exact <hi>Logician</hi> doth not always <hi>Prove.</hi> Nor can the Quaint <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician</hi> constantly <hi>Perswade.</hi> Doth the Skilful <hi>Physician</hi> always <hi>Cure?</hi> Or is the Curious <hi>Musician</hi> at all times true to his <hi>Notes?</hi> No sure!

            <p>But, what then?

            <p n="1">§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an Excellent Rule, which the Learned Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> gives us in his <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> Lib. 9. cap. 4. p. 461. <hi>That Men should be so modest as not to think That utterly un-intelligible that Themselves for the present cannot apprehend; and believe that God imparted all knowledge to the World for Vse, and not for curious and vexatious Speculation.</hi>— And had my Learned <hi>Opponent</hi> but read, and well consider'd this <hi>Rule, He</hi> would scarce have given <hi>Me</hi> the Honour of this <hi>Literary Combat.</hi> Nay, had <hi>He</hi> either truly known <hi>Me,</hi> or but set so many <hi>Schemes</hi> upon various occasions, or seen so many <hi>different Genitures</hi> as I have done; I am confident <hi>He</hi> would have thought there had been no need of his inviting <hi>Me</hi> to this unhappy (and yet it may be useful) <hi>Contest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. When I had once read this Learned Person's Piece which <hi>He</hi> calls <hi>Cometomantia,</hi> and well weighed the vast and various <hi>Learning,</hi> the quickness of <hi>Fancy,</hi> the commanding and flowing <hi>Eloquence</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi>; and at the same time reflected on <hi>My</hi> own <hi>Inabilities</hi> and want of <hi>Skill</hi> for the maintaining of such a <hi>Duel</hi>; I began to consider what I had <hi>Wrote</hi> that could justly <hi>provoke</hi> so great a <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Muses.</hi> 'Tis not usual for Lofty <hi>Eagles</hi> to catch at Silly <hi>Flies.</hi> And I am the more driven into admiration

that this <hi>Gyant in Learning</hi> keeps himself behind the Curtain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concealing his <hi>Name,</hi> but yet defends <hi>Himself,</hi> and <hi>Book,</hi> with an <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Flaming Sword,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> was pleased to Guard the <hi>Tree of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. I well knew that I never publish'd any thing to the World but with an <hi>upright Mind,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> to befriend it; and if <hi>My</hi> misfortune have been such as not to be plainly and <hi>charitably</hi> understood, yet I hoped never to have incur'd the <hi>Sensure</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding <hi>Frauds</hi> upon it, as now, by this my unknown <hi>Antagonist,</hi> I am charged.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Every Man has as good a Title to his <hi>Reputation,</hi> as to his <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi>; and ought as carefully and zealously to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> it.

            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. This Task I also found incumbent upon <hi>Me</hi> for another Reason; For when I remembred that I had now been a <hi>Student</hi> in <hi>Astrology</hi> more than Thirty years, and had nearly as <hi>Many</hi> (as well as I was able) defended it; and knowing that <hi>Great is the Truth, and it must prevail,</hi> even against the most <hi>Towering Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist</hi>; I could not be easily brought to believe those things to be <hi>False,</hi> which by Experience I had so often <hi>proved otherwise:</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I had taken nothing upon Trust, nor credited any thing because <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> said so, but because by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Experimental proof of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I found they had spoken <hi>True.</hi> Therefore it is that I esteem my self engag'd to give this <hi>Opponent,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> together, (to which also <hi>He</hi> hath render'd <hi>Me</hi> accountable) as clear <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to these things I stand <hi>chargable</hi> with, as I am able: In the doing whereof, I hope to acquit my self of having broached or maintained either <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> or plain <hi>Falshoods</hi> under the specious pretence and <hi>Guarranty</hi> of <hi>Astrological Truths.</hi>

not to <hi>Me</hi> in particular, but to <hi>Astrologers</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> of whom I am <hi>Minimus</hi>: and do therefore hope, if at least there be any need (a thing I question very much, the <hi>Art</hi> having been often and Learnedly defended already,) that <hi>some Person</hi> more worthy than my self (like another Sir <hi>Christopher Heyden</hi>) will step in, and ease <hi>Me</hi> of that <hi>Task,</hi> which I do not esteem to be my particular Province.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. In <hi>pag.</hi> 257. of <hi>Cometomantia,</hi> this <hi>Author</hi> is pleased to fall <hi>Foul</hi> upon the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures</hi> (<hi>my</hi> DIANA <hi>indeed</hi>!) taxing it as liable to <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Deceipt.</hi> In this <hi>He</hi> hath neither injur'd <hi>Me,</hi> nor the <hi>Truth</hi>; for there is no <hi>Science</hi> in the World that can boast of its being free from either: No, not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Divinity.</hi> But not thus content, <hi>He</hi> is pleased to fall roughly upon <hi>Me</hi> by <hi>Name,</hi> citing some passages out of my <hi>Collection of Genitures,</hi> which <hi>He</hi> thinks gratifies his humour and design in dealing with <hi>Me</hi>: but how justly, and with what fair shew of <hi>Reason,</hi> (will, I hope, by God's Blessing,) soon appear.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. This <hi>Doctrine of Genitures</hi> (by the way) is the most Noble, Worthy, and Delightful, of all the parts of <hi>Astrology</hi>; and hath in all <hi>Ages</hi> had many <hi>Great, Wise,</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Favourers and Defenders. And good <hi>Reason</hi> there is for it, since it is daily demonstrated, by <hi>fresh Experiences,</hi> to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> in the various Accidents and Fortunes (good <hi>Reader</hi> be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the word) attending on Humane Kind: I wish all the other Parts thereof, were as well and as truly understood.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. The Great <hi>Oracle</hi> of this present Age, (though lately Deceased, I wish I could not tell the News) The excellent Author of <hi>Religio Medici,</hi> hath given his suffrage for it; and on its behalf, thus Learnedly and Modestly Argues.—
<q>We need not labour with so many Arguments to confute <hi>Judicial Astrology</hi>; for if there be a Truth therein, it doth not injure <hi>Divinity.</hi> If to be born under <hi>Mercury</hi> disposeth us to be Wity, under <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be Wealthy, I do not owe a Knee unto those, but unto the Merciful hand that hath order'd my indifferent and uncertain Nativity unto such benevolent Aspects.</q>
Rel. Med. Sect. 18. And, as if God had inspir'd this Excellent Man with one of his greatest <hi>Truths,</hi> the very <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular verity</hi> here impugned and contended against by my <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist</hi>; Sect. 23 He most truly and happily <hi>predicts,</hi> and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108979:10"/>
according to the Rules of <hi>Art,</hi> thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—
<q>If there be any Truth in <hi>Astrology</hi> I may out-live a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> as yet I have not seen one Revolution of <hi>Saturn,</hi> nor has my Pulse beat thirty years.</q>
This ever to be admired Author was but <hi>twenty eight years Old</hi> when he wrote that curious piece of Learning. Yet, for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proof of <hi>Astrology,</hi> and his excellent Skill therein, <hi>He lived unto almost Seventy years of Age,</hi> to the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> the Father of all <hi>good Arts,</hi> thereby affirming that Divine Axiome, <hi>That the</hi> Sun, Moon <hi>and</hi> Stars <hi>do constantly praise their Maker, and that even by the Science of</hi> Astrology; <hi>Even that Art,</hi> I say, <hi>which only teaches and instructs us how to understand their Influences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. Nor is it hard for an able <hi>Astrologer</hi> to give an account of some, never, or at least, rarely failing Instances of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> which the <hi>Aphorisms</hi> thereof (allowed by this my Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Opponent:</hi> and I thank him for that, for so far <hi>He</hi> is a Friend to what <hi>He</hi> opposes) do most plainly and liberally affirm and prove. I say, the <hi>Aphorisms</hi> allowed by my <hi>Antagonist:</hi> (For, <hi>He</hi> will not sure, own some part of the <hi>Centiloquium,</hi> and disallow the rest.) Which if <hi>He</hi> keep to, then hath <hi>He Warranted</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> which <hi>He</hi> labours to confute; And as for its being liable to <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> I will not refuse to grant him that, that being no <hi>Plea</hi> against its <hi>Verity</hi>; when <hi>He</hi> is pleased in <hi>p.</hi> 282. to concede, that both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Physick,</hi> yea, and <hi>Divinity</hi> too, are subject to the same <hi>Misfortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. What if <hi>divers Astrologers</hi> happen to have <hi>different Opinions</hi> upon the <hi>same Horoscope?</hi> This doth no more annul or <hi>Destroy</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> then the several Judgements of <hi>sundry Lawyers</hi> upon the <hi>same Case,</hi> or <hi>Statute,</hi> does impugne or invalidate the <hi>Law. Bradshaw, Dorislaus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cook, Harrison,</hi> &amp;c. (those sad wretches) understood <hi>Bracton, Fleta,</hi> &amp;c. all in a <hi>Republican</hi> sence, whereby our late Glorious Sovereign (with many of His <hi>Nobility,</hi> and other of His <hi>Faithful Subjects</hi>) was barbarously Murdered. But the Learned <hi>Forster, Mallet, Bridgeman, Palmer, Finch,</hi> &amp;c. Interpreted them in <hi>favour of the King</hi> and <hi>Monarchy,</hi> by which means <hi>Rebellion</hi> hath been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the Church and State supported. <hi>Veritas est Vna,</hi> says; the Excellent and Reverend <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> at the Lord General <hi>Monk's</hi> Funeral; <hi>p.</hi> 3. And I will be bold (with

that <hi>Reverend Prelate</hi>) to affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— That <hi>Truth is but one</hi>; tho' the <hi>Pilates</hi> of the world may always be enquiring <hi>what it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Theologers</hi> do also vary in their <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> on several places of <hi>Scripture</hi>; Raise several Doctrines of different Natures from the same <hi>Text:</hi> as was evident in the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Stillingsteet's</hi> Sermon, called the <hi>Mischief of Seperation:</hi> and the <hi>Opposition</hi> he receiv'd to it from <hi>five</hi> several angry <hi>Antagonists.</hi> Nay, <hi>Curse ye Meroz,</hi> suffer'd the <hi>Rack</hi> in the <hi>late Rebellion,</hi> and was forc'd to speak in the behalf of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi>; when we know it bears another Interpretation, and may be <hi>pleaded</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of <hi>Government</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The truth whereof <hi>Mr. Hickringill</hi> hath prov'd both from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and in <hi>Print</hi>; tho' since indeed he hath been <hi>Anomalous</hi> in some things, though the comfort is he doth not persist.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. If then it be so clear, plain, and <hi>Sun-like</hi> a <hi>Truth,</hi> that the Noblest and most useful <hi>Sciences,</hi> or <hi>Mysteries,</hi> are liable to <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Deceipt</hi> (I will keep to this Learned <hi>Objectors</hi> words) and yet in themselves are not the worse or less serviceable to Mankind. Why should <hi>Astrology,</hi> and therein the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> be rendred the less worthy or useful, or yet thought more cheaply of, for being liable to the same? Let the <hi>chaff</hi> be winnow'd from the <hi>Wheat,</hi> the <hi>Dross</hi> be seperated from the <hi>Oar,</hi> the <hi>good Wine</hi> from the <hi>Dregs, i. e.</hi> Purge and Refine <hi>Astrology</hi> as much as you will, or can; but have a care of destroying it. <hi>Promote no Bills of Exclusion</hi> against Legitimate and long Experienced <hi>Truths</hi>; least the Honour of him who guides <hi>Arcturus</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> be thereby <hi>Eclipsed,</hi> and the native Glory and Influences of the <hi>Stars,</hi> by such <hi>Artifices</hi> come to be <hi>darkened Men</hi> may erre, the <hi>Stars</hi> can not; let not the <hi>Art</hi> suffer for the errour, or insufficiency of the <hi>Artist.</hi> 'Tis <hi>unreasonable,</hi> 'tis <hi>unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. But, to be ingenious, I will confess that among the many things which I have published to the World, I may not possibly have performed all of them with an <hi>equal wariness</hi>: (Shew me that Author that ever did so!) and am very glad if at any time I meet with so much <hi>Civility</hi> from any <hi>Gentleman, Schollar</hi> or <hi>Artist,</hi> as to give me a kind and friendly notice thereof, that I might thereby be taught to avoid the like misfortune for the future. I am not <hi>Obstinate</hi> in Opinion; yet can, and dare <hi>struggle hard</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108979:11"/>
a <hi>Truth.</hi> But am most certain, whatever it be in my Nature (by reason of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression) it is not in my <hi>Will</hi> to promote <hi>Error</hi>: and no Man can chuse his <hi>Temper</hi> or <hi>Complexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. I had <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Sagitary</hi> at my Birth, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in his Domal Dignities, in a benigne <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi>; and <hi>Trine</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> of my <hi>Horoscope.</hi> And to the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and Credit of <hi>Astrology,</hi> I can very justly say, that I abominate <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> both in my self and others; as those <hi>positions</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally incline. I Honour the <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> wherever I find them: and, methinks, when I meet therewith either in <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> I can scarce forbear paying a respect, even to <hi>Adoration</hi>; the <hi>Image of God</hi> (in my Opinion) being there; and, <hi>Magna est veritas.</hi> And if at any time I have been so unhappy as unwarily to <hi>promote</hi> any thing that looks like <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Deceipt,</hi> my <hi>Will</hi> not <hi>consenting</hi> thereunto, I own it a <hi>Fault</hi> to be repented of. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>Crime</hi> to commit <hi>Fraud,</hi> or be guilty of <hi>Deceipt</hi>: but to teach others so to do, <hi>duplicates</hi> the <hi>Errour</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. But here, by the way, I must premise, That if in the <hi>Art I Study,</hi> there should happen to be any <hi>False Principles</hi> shuffled in, and inhabit among the many <hi>True Ones,</hi> and that I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly imbibed any of them, not discovering them to be <hi>such</hi>; (for <hi>Truth</hi> hath its <hi>Counterfeits</hi> as well as <hi>Coin,</hi>) I hope I shall not therefore, by Men of Learning and Reason, be esteemed a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abettor to <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Falshood.</hi> For to suffer such <hi>Censure</hi> upon so poor and weak a ground, would conclude <hi>Costs</hi> and <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> against all <hi>Writers</hi> in any Faculty whatever. What <hi>Science</hi> is there free from <hi>Errour?</hi> Or what Man dares to call himself a Master of <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> in any one Faculty? We are only Men, and must own St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Motto, <hi>Scimus ex parte.</hi> The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named excellent <hi>Prelate,</hi> in his admirable <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mysteries of the Gospel,</hi> most truly tells us,— <hi>The Notions of</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Falshood <hi>lie more abstruse than those of Good and Evil, and Men are more apt to be deceived in their wit, than in their honesty.</hi> p. 14. And in <hi>p.</hi> 26. of the same Sermon, He most justly exclaims,— <hi>Even in</hi> Geometry <hi>and</hi> Arithmetick <hi>how many things are forcibly concluded to be true, which are inexplicable, un-immaginable, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.</hi> And again,— <hi>No</hi> Truths <hi>are so liable to mistakes and prejudice, as the professedly Mysterious.</hi> p. 14. <hi>ut aute.</hi>— In cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108979:11"/>
Speculations it is very <hi>easy</hi> to <hi>Erre,</hi> and to be imposed upon: And of all Liberal <hi>Sciences, Astrology is the most Mysterious.</hi> It is called a <hi>Secret Art,</hi> although it be now so <hi>publickly</hi> Disputed, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>
            <p n="17">§. 17. I was <hi>Condemn'd</hi> by my <hi>Stars</hi> (God so permitting it) to be an enquirer into <hi>Astrology</hi>: The <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> were both <hi>Subterranean,</hi> and in Friendly <hi>Aspect</hi> at my <hi>Genesis</hi>; and as I have been convinc'd of any <hi>Errors</hi> in that <hi>Knotty</hi> and <hi>Difficult Science,</hi> I have abandon'd them, as may be seen in several <hi>Tract's</hi> which I have published to the World, <hi>viz. Britains Royal Star; Nuncius Astrologicus; Obsequium Rationabile</hi>; The <hi>Iust and Pious Scorpionist,</hi> &amp;c. Nor shall I fail to follow the same course for the future; and as I discover any thing therein, really <hi>Rotten</hi> and <hi>Vnsound,</hi> will not be affraid or asham'd to own them, and make them known. But, I must assume the Liberty to tell the World, that what my Learned <hi>Opponent</hi> hath laid at my <hi>Door</hi> for an <hi>Error,</hi> I am so far from <hi>seeing,</hi> or <hi>knowing</hi> it to be <hi>such,</hi> that I doubt not (by God's assistance) to evince it the contrary, by plain and well grounded <hi>Experience,</hi> (for that is the <hi>Foundation</hi> whereon I chiefly build) and that to His and the Worlds Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="18">§. 18. To come more closely to the matter, the Learned <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector</hi> is pleased in the first place to <hi>Question our Principles</hi>; and thereby <hi>He</hi> thinks to disable <hi>Me</hi> for the Contest. <hi>If We</hi> poor <hi>silly Astrologers</hi> were such inconsiderable <hi>Brutes</hi> as <hi>He</hi> seems to make <hi>Vs,</hi> and altogether unable to answer for <hi>Our</hi> selves; yet, it is not fair for him to take away even a Poor <hi>Cripples</hi> feeble <hi>Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and then to beat him with them. <hi>Contra Negantem Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> &amp;c. Against him who denies <hi>Principles,</hi> who shall maintain a Disputation? Let <hi>Me</hi> assume the liberty of Questioning the <hi>nine Digits</hi> in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and I will soon be able to set all the <hi>Masters</hi> of that <hi>curious Art</hi> upon an almost un conquerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how to make any reasonable <hi>Harmony</hi> with their <hi>Numbers.</hi> VVhereas by allowing them, of what excellent use are they found in <hi>Astronomy, Physick, Musick, Trigonometry, Trade,</hi> &amp;c.— But as I have said before, <hi>I will leave the general cause of Astrology</hi> to be defended by some more <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Able Pen,</hi> and only concern my self to <hi>prove,</hi> that the very <hi>Principle</hi> upon which I am <hi>Impeached,</hi> is <hi>Firm</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and so far from being shaken or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108979:12"/>
weakened, though <hi>briskly impleaded</hi> by the <hi>Antagonist,</hi> that it carries the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in it, and ever will be found to do so.</p>
            <p>The PRINCIPLE is this,</p>
            <p n="19">☞ §. 19. <hi>Cardinal Signs possessing all the Angles of a Nativity, renders the Native Famous and Notable in his Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a <hi>Truth</hi> so Conspicuous, Great, and Undeniable, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Genitures</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> but of <hi>Kingdoms, Cities, Castles,</hi> &amp;c. and, in all the other parts of <hi>Astrology,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal Signs on Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> are ever of so <hi>Famous</hi> and <hi>Remarkable</hi> signification and import, that it stands in need of no other <hi>Proof,</hi> than the attestation of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the consent of <hi>Modern Astrologers.</hi> And thus it hath been proved before this Learned <hi>Opponent,</hi> or my <hi>self</hi> were born; and will remain a <hi>Truth,</hi> when <hi>We</hi> shall be no more.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. The <hi>year</hi> it self is govern'd by the <hi>Cardinal Signs,</hi> or <hi>Points</hi> of Heaven. The <hi>Moveable Feasts</hi> of the Church depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Equinoctium Vernum,</hi> the grand <hi>Cardinal Point</hi> of all. The <hi>Church</hi> begins its <hi>Year</hi> at or about the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi> Nay, God hath honoured the <hi>Cardinal Points</hi> of Heaven, by dispensing his greatest blessings and benefits unto the world under them; and thus in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as <hi>Gospel.</hi> The <hi>Iews Pascha,</hi> and their <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>Azymes,</hi> and <hi>Tabernacles</hi> were appointed to be Celebrated under <hi>Cardinal Signs.</hi> God sent his own dear Son (our Blessed Saviour) into the world, and permitted him to <hi>suffer on the Cross</hi> for our Sins, <hi>both</hi> under <hi>Cardinal Signs.</hi> The greatest Actions of the world depend upon <hi>Equinoctial</hi> and <hi>Solstitial Points,</hi> viz. <hi>Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn</hi>; and if instances of Mens <hi>Births</hi> may pass for proof (and I know no reason why they should not) I could produce a <hi>Multitude</hi> to confirm it.</p>
            <p n="21">§. 21.

Yet further, Mr. <hi>William Lilly</hi> (from whom I own to have had this <hi>Geniture,</hi>) was of the <hi>same Opinion</hi> with <hi>Me,</hi> and for the <hi>same Reasons too</hi>; although afterward he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately engaged to write in favour of this fortunately unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Gentleman</hi>; even against his Judgement and Knowledge in Art. <hi>Sed, auri sacra fames.</hi> It may also be remembred, and that most truly,—<hi>That the difference between Mr.</hi> Lilly <hi>and my self had its original before the death of</hi> Oliver Cromwell: And from the commencement whereof I never had the least conversation with him: and therefore could not joyn in Judgement with him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any kindness from him, which could any way gratifie my Adversary, or countenance this his unjust <hi>Sarcasm</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—That I knew nothing of this Gentlemans Destiny until I saw his Scene Acted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">§. 40. It is a wonder to me this Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> did not say as much against me concerning the King of <hi>Sweden's Nativity</hi> (which I own to have had from a Copy that the aforesaid Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> procured in <hi>Germany,</hi> and sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as he received it from the Learned <hi>Olearius, Mathematician</hi> to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and hath done me the honour to shew me the very original <hi>Scheme</hi> under the said <hi>Olearius</hi> his hand. I mention this to satisfie the Learned Dr. <hi>More</hi> how I came by it, which he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108979:17"/>
seemed to wish for, in his <hi>Reply</hi> to Mr. <hi>Butler.</hi>) And His Majesty of <hi>Denmarks</hi> also; <hi>both which I published to the World before Their Scenes were Acted.</hi> So that <hi>Astrologers</hi> are not always guilty of <hi>Post-diction</hi> in the room of <hi>Prediction. Prediction</hi> is as clear as the <hi>Astrological</hi> Day; but some there are who do in <hi>Solecaligare,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">§. 41 But my <hi>Learned Opponent</hi> may answer me to these things, by allowing, <hi>that future Events may be predicted, but not to be attributed to Astrological Skill,</hi> as he doth, <hi>p.</hi> 235.— A pretty Musical distinction! The <hi>Astrologer</hi> predicts future accidents by his Art, but this must not be attributed to <hi>Astrological Skill.</hi> That is, in plain terms, the <hi>Astrologer</hi> knows nothing by his <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> an <hi>Astrologer.</hi> But how will this accord with what my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist allows, in <hi>p.</hi> 227. <hi>That the Stars do point out some Futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to us.</hi> Do they so? yes, they do indeed. And if so, why should not the knowledge thereof be refer'd to <hi>Astrological Skill</hi>? Nay, this Learned Adversary of mine, (for such he is, be he who he will) in <hi>p.</hi> 206. Agrees <hi>Astrology to be a part of natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, which from the knowledge of Caelestial Bodies Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth of Events in the Sublimary Bodies here below; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Actions of Men, who are partly made of these, depend in some manner on their influences.</hi> And again, he acknowledges, in <hi>pag.</hi> 229. That,— <hi>When the</hi> Astrologer <hi>is rightly accomplish'd for his work, his Iudgement may prove successful.</hi> May it so? why then sure an <hi>Astrologer</hi> may <hi>predict</hi> some particulars, and yet not be thought a <hi>Prestigiator</hi>; or his <hi>Art</hi> a meer piece of <hi>Leiger-de-main.</hi> But how must he be accomplished right for his work? I will answer in the first words of the <hi>Centiloquium, à te, &amp; à sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> viz. When he is, not only a Book-learn'd man (though that I acknowledge is of excellent advantage) but also when he is born an Artist. 'Tis <hi>from thy self and Learning! Ptolomy</hi> prefers the accomplishment of <hi>Birth</hi> in the first place; then that of <hi>Breeding</hi> or <hi>Education.</hi> Both together do the Feat to purpose. Nay, my Antagonist (sure the fairest and most worthy Enemy, that ever any man met with!) in <hi>pag.</hi> 273. When he is pleading against <hi>Astrology,</hi> brings in the <hi>Holy Father</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> to support it. This excellent Saint, willing to give <hi>Astrology</hi> its just due, (my Antagonist says) expresses himself thus,— <hi>In ille perspicuitate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum Caelestium non omnes omnino motus Animi latere. That it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108979:17"/>
is possible to arrive to a notice of some motions and inclinations of the mind from the Astral influences of the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">§. 42. But this Learned Gentleman, as if affraid he had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me too much, is pleased to urge, <hi>p.</hi> 217. what no honest, or modest <hi>Astrologer</hi> will deny him, <hi>viz. That no man can be positive in foretelling future Events of the Stars.</hi> [I am sure then they can be foretold no way.] But now if he mean, that they cannot be foretold in <hi>Specie,</hi> I agree with him: but if he mean in <hi>Genere,</hi> that no kind of Events can be foretold; He then, not only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses his own Concessions, but contradicts St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> together.</p>
            <p n="43">§. 43. <hi>None</hi> indeed but <hi>such as are Divinely inspired can predict the particular kinds of things</hi>; as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> most truly says, <hi>Gentil. Aph.</hi> 1. But what then? Nice particulars are not to be Predicted; <hi>Ergo,</hi> nothing can. Is this <hi>Logick</hi>?— Cannot an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> if he sees a direction impending in any man's Nativity, which of it self portends Death, Predict this by his <hi>Skill?</hi> and yet not be positive either to the precise time, or Distemper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, if he sees a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> to have a Glorious <hi>Geniture,</hi> as the <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Frederick <hi>the</hi> III. <hi>of</hi> Denmark <hi>had</hi>: Cannot He say, that this Prince (though he happen to be at present in great troubles) will not only recover Himself from His misfortunes, <hi>Add to the Glory of His Ancestors, and die peaceably possess'd of His Honour, and acquisitions?</hi> And this even by <hi>His Skill in Art,</hi> without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Ptolomy]</hi>'s first Aphorism.</p>
            <p n="44">§. 44. I affirm it for a Truth, that more than 20 years before my late unfortunate troubles which befel me <hi>Anno</hi> 1679. I Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cause of them in my <hi>Doctrine of Nativities,</hi> from my own <hi>Geniture.</hi> and that was <hi>Astrologically,</hi> my <hi>Medium Caeli ad</hi> 
               <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> ☉ by direction, falling on the <hi>twelfth Angle of my Nativity.</hi> Nay, I knew by my <hi>Skill,</hi> that it denoted the <hi>Frowns of Great Persons, Disfavour of Men in great place and Authority, Imprisonment,</hi> &amp;c. But now, I must confess, I could not foresee the <hi>particular preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> I suffer'd: I might as well have pretended to praesage the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prison</hi> I was to be confin'd to. I ever was, and I esteem it all mens <hi>Duty</hi> to be <hi>Obedient to the Lawful Establish'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> both in Church and State; and was certain I neither would, nor indeed could (for it is not in my nature to) Act, speak, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108979:18"/>
commit any thing detrimental, or distasteful to either. I ow'd no <hi>Money,</hi> nor did I ever care to be in Debt. I am of a peaceable cheerful Temper and Disposition, not given to Quarrel; (and yet ♂ <hi>Mars</hi> was Lord of my Ascendent) was resolved not to do any thing that I knew might bring me into the <hi>Disfavour</hi> of my <hi>Prince,</hi> or His <hi>Councellors,</hi> &amp;c. And yet, behold! <hi>how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God is to be Magnified in his works?</hi> He would not alter the <hi>Caelestial clock work</hi> for my sake! But when my Direction touch'd, <hi>a malicious Varlet,</hi> scarce known to me, one that I had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd withal in my life; and, <hi>another</hi> whom I never before saw to my knowledge: These came and swore <hi>High Treason</hi> against me, much to my <hi>amazement,</hi> more to my <hi>wrong</hi>: but to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain verification of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Stars,</hi> so long by me foreseen and expected, though not in the same method it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p n="45">§. 45. Sure this must be imputed to <hi>Astrological Skill.</hi> And yet we renounce the Opinion that maintains,— <hi>The first cause is tied to the Stars, God</hi> is not bound to his <hi>Creation,</hi> but his <hi>Creation</hi> to <hi>Him.</hi> Neither hath the Lord of all Mercy and Goodness bound us his Creatures inevitably to the Destinies. <hi>Gods Grace is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter influence than all the Planets united.</hi> For, had I forborn being concern'd at that time in some very innocent secular affairs, that I might have let alone; I had then not only prevented my own troubles <hi>by Ruling my Stars,</hi> but possibly <hi>saved the Souls</hi> of those <hi>Wretches</hi> that falsly swore against me; which without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance must needs be in a dangerous condition. But yet, we must not say, that because the influences of the <hi>Stars</hi> may be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or diverted, that therefore their natural order and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as God hath pre-appointed to them, cannot be understood by <hi>Astrology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">§. 46. But these are <hi>Truths</hi> the Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> had not the knowledge of. For had he been privy to, or acquainted with them, I fully perswade my self, that He would have <hi>Lessen'd,</hi> or it may be totally <hi>waved</hi> his <hi>Sarcasm</hi> against me concerning the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi> of <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi>; For, I cannot believe he would have had me published the same while the Owner thereof was in the <hi>Saddle of Government,</hi> or yet in his <hi>Fathers time</hi>: That had been a pretty way indeed, to have gratified an Enemy with a proof of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108979:18"/>
the Truth of <hi>Astrology,</hi> and have run the <hi>hazzard of Hanging</hi> for my civility. No! I bless God, I have no such <hi>Foolish or Dismal Stars</hi> in my <hi>Horoscope.</hi> Besides, I had read ingenious <hi>Cardan</hi> his Book <hi>de Astrol. Interog.</hi> where he teaches his Disciples more wit than that comes to, <hi>viz. Principi ne magnum Malum firmiter unquam praedixeris,</hi> &amp;c. And that Gentleman was then (though never by me) esteemed a <hi>Prince,</hi> and own'd so by <hi>Addressers</hi> from most parts of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="47">§. 47. Having answer'd this concerning Mr. <hi>R. Cromwells Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and I hope fully to my <hi>Adversaries</hi> satisfaction, I find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Knot</hi> for me to untie; another <hi>Load</hi> to disburthen my self of, and that is somewhat that I have Printed concerning <hi>Major General Lambert,</hi> which he is pleased to re-mind me of, Thus.— <hi>Major General</hi> Lambert <hi>began his March</hi> 1659. November 3. 10<hi>th.</hi> 15! A. M. <hi>toward the North against General</hi> Monk. <hi>The position of the Heavens most sad, the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> was in a watry sign, therefore he had like to have been drown'd in</hi> Yorkshire, <hi>riding through a River towards his Army.</hi> The words I own, but not as they are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for the Learned <hi>Opponent</hi> hath left the <hi>Marrow</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of my <hi>Words</hi> behind him. Therefore to satisfie him, and acquit my self of being culpable of any crime in this pretended Charge also, I will insert the reason of that my Labour, with the <hi>Story</hi> cavil'd against, together.</p>
            <p n="48">§. 48. The Experiment of <hi>Major General Lambert</hi>'s March, being a great Ornament to the <hi>Doctrine of Elections,</hi> which is very nearly ally'd to <hi>Nativities</hi> (as the Penny is of the same Coin with the Shilling) both have the Impress of <hi>Starry Truth</hi> upon them: and therefore it was I thought fit to subjoyn it to that Gentlemans <hi>Geniture.</hi> Yet not to wrong Him, or <hi>to advance the Truth of Art by a Fraud</hi>; but to gratifie the ingenious Student in Art, with a <hi>Nativity</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> together: which my Learned <hi>Oponent</hi> (if he be one) ought to have thanked me for, and not requited my Pains and Civility with a Witty Droling <hi>Catachrestick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My own Words, un-guelt, are These.</p>
            <p n="49">§. 49. <hi>This was the true positure of Heaven at what time Major General</hi> Lambert <hi>put his Foot in the Stirrup to March towards the</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:108979:19"/>
North <hi>to meet the Valiant Lord General</hi> Monk, <hi>then advancing out of</hi> Scotland <hi>towards</hi> London: <hi>and a sad position it is, and exactly agrees with that Major General's</hi> success he had by that unfortunate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. As the <hi>Moon</hi> was in a watry <hi>Sign,</hi> [in exact <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the cruellest and unfortunatest of Planets.] (All which words are omitted) <hi>He had like to have been drown'd in</hi> Yorkshire <hi>riding through a River toward his Army; where his Horse left him to the mercy of the most merciless of Enemys, the Water, from whence he with much ado escaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">§. 50. So that you see, it was none of my Judgement, nor did I say, that <hi>simply,</hi> because the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 
               <hi>was in a watry Sign,</hi> (as my <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist</hi> is pleas'd to make me speak,) but because <hi>She was in such a Sign in</hi> Conjunction <hi>of</hi> Saturn, <hi>&amp;c. that render'd the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Infaelicitous and Dangerous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">§. 51. What strange <hi>Shifts</hi> and <hi>Slights</hi> will some Men use to put an affront upon <hi>Starry Influences,</hi> and to <hi>puzzle</hi> and <hi>confound the poor Astrologer?</hi> If we publish a <hi>Geniture,</hi> or an <hi>Election</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, and <hi>praedict</hi> any thing that the <hi>Event</hi> shall fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, then the <hi>Devil</hi> is our Assistant (say our <hi>Antagonists</hi>) and stands at our <hi>Elbow</hi> to help us. If we do it when the <hi>Person</hi> is <hi>Dead,</hi> or the thing design'd is <hi>over</hi>; then (say they) we put <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Deceipts</hi> upon the World; being soon able to <hi>make some Star, House, Aspect or other, answer to the Action, and make Those to be certain arguments of These.</hi> Thus is the Poor <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> treated for all his Pains!</p>
            <p n="52">§. 52. After this manner of dealing, how shall I expect to Fare hereafter, if it shall please <hi>God</hi> to lengthen my Life so far, as to <hi>Methodize</hi> some of my <hi>many Hundreds,</hi> or (it may be) <hi>Thousands of Experiments</hi> of several kinds, which I have faithfully made, and with great Labour and Industry accumulated in my long time of Study? In vain have I visited <hi>Goals</hi> and <hi>Hospitals,</hi> and used all other just and proper ways, to gain and heap up <hi>Experiments</hi> in <hi>Art</hi>; if after all, I must hope to be no better dealt with, for those my many years careful and painful endeavours after <hi>Truth?</hi>— If this be all the Portion the Poor <hi>Artist</hi> must expect, all the Reward he shall meet with; He that Studies the <hi>Stars</hi> is the most <hi>unhappy Person in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="53">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:108979:19"/>§. 53. Can my Learned <hi>Adversary</hi> believe all those great and voluminous Treatises which have been wrote by the <hi>Sages of Science,</hi> to be only the works of <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Mad Men. Cardan, Gauricus, Iunctine, Goclenius, Camerarius, Argelus, Rothmannus, Orguinus, Hassurtus,</hi> and of late the Learned <hi>Mormus, cum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis aliis,</hi> &amp;c. All your Learned <hi>Labours</hi> are meer <hi>Trifles</hi>; of nouse at all; meer pieces of <hi>Iuggle</hi> and <hi>Leger-de-main: Mists</hi> before the <hi>Eyes</hi> of Us Poor <hi>Star-gazing Idiots</hi>; vain <hi>Phantoms,</hi> and aery <hi>Idea's,</hi> to make us believe only a <hi>Falshood</hi> for a <hi>Truth</hi>; and force us with <hi>Ixion</hi> to embrace a <hi>Cloud</hi> for <hi>Iuno.</hi> If it be thus, why then our <hi>Adversaries</hi> are in the Right, <hi>and our cause is lost.</hi> But, be it so then, however I am not <hi>alone deceived,</hi> I have a great deal of <hi>Good Company</hi> with me in the same predicament: Nor have I <hi>alone</hi> been a <hi>Deceiver</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>: others have trod the same Stage before me, and with me, and will do after me.— But, to come out of our Dream, we assuredly know,— <hi>That Day unto Day uttereth better Speech than this; and Night unto Night, teacheth more excellent Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">§. 54. But <hi>è diverticulo in viam,</hi> to come to my Point again; my <hi>Adversary</hi> to shew his readiness to load me, and render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the same time Partial, (which for his sake, I am sorry he gives me occasion to mention) He, wholly omits my answer to such a <hi>Foreseen Objection.</hi> (He may see even by this that we <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi> can Foresee something; I wish we could as easily prevent them,) as now he brings against me, <hi>viz.—There are divers Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons about</hi> London <hi>that have heard me relate the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which happen'd upon that Expedition, long before the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof; even as soon us the March it self was beginning.

I cannot imagine what he designs by his unkind curtailing my words and matter, to make me speak as himself pleases, unless he contrive to <hi>Stigmatize Me</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> together.</p>
            <p n="55">§. 55. It is now more than 24 years since this <hi>Praediction</hi> and <hi>Experiment</hi> was made; and therefore 'twill be hard for me to procure <hi>Witnesses</hi> of what was then said or done. Yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I <hi>affirm it an absolute Truth,</hi> without any <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>Design</hi> or <hi>Iuggle</hi>: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I may be able (if occasion require) to produce <hi>some Evidence</hi> thereof; which I might been able to have done, had I been

question'd sooner. But should I be uncapable of producing any, it is sufficient that I affirm the <hi>Truth</hi> there Printed, and deny all <hi>Fraud, Iuggle,</hi> or <hi>Design</hi> therein: And I do not doubt of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it is usual, and satisfactory in the Law, in the Case of <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Issue Father'd on a Man</hi>) very Honourable and Worthy <hi>Compurgators,</hi> who will not be affraid to affirm that they believe I speak nothing in this matter but the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="56">§. 56. But alas! If a Man must be question'd for any thing of <hi>Fact</hi> after such a time, <hi>viz.</hi> 24 years, 'tis odds, indeed (were not the supreme Law of Reason on our side) but that the <hi>Antagonist</hi> would have the <hi>better,</hi> although in the present debate he must be content to be at a <hi>Loss.</hi>— But where all this while is our regard to <hi>Truth?</hi> when we shall offer to Play at Push-pin after this rate with a <hi>Science</hi> more Antient than any other, that the knowing World can boast of? Where is our respect to <hi>Humanity,</hi> when we shall <hi>provoke</hi> one another <hi>unjustly?</hi> Where is our <hi>value</hi> for true <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> when we shall, without colour of <hi>Reason,</hi> fasten <hi>pretended Frauds</hi> of our own Coyning upon the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Reputations</hi> of Men we know not, and that never did us wrong? Where is our <hi>Love to Christianity,</hi> or the blessed Author thereof; who hath taught us better Lessons, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the quiet of another, or to cast <hi>Fiery Bombs</hi> at the Innocent; and this without first asking a Reason of a difference, or fairly proclaiming a War.</p>
            <p n="57">§. 57. Had my Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> (in case of dissatisfaction about any thing I had wrote or published) but sent me a <hi>Letter</hi> of his <hi>Objections</hi>; as the Reverend Dr. <hi>H.

            </p>
            <p n="58">§. 58. But, no more by way of Exclamation or Complaint. This Quarrel will (I hope at least) quickly cease: I wish the <hi>Wars, Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Confusions</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of <hi>Christianity were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be of as short a Date.</hi> For I dare <hi>Augure,</hi> and that without a <hi>Figure</hi> (for in <hi>Schemes</hi> my <hi>Antagonist</hi> takes no pleasure; though I really delight to contemplate them.) That less than 24 years more will cover and conceal both our <hi>Persons,</hi> whatever it may do with our <hi>Errours</hi>: which if either of us have committed any

in Print, they will lay a Title to a larger <hi>Alchocoden,</hi> and not meet their Oblivion so soon. <hi>'Tis natural for Men to live longer in their Issue</hi> (good or bad) <hi>than in their Persons.</hi>

            <p n="59">§. 59. Before I come to the second part of my Defence, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Genitures</hi> promised, I have one or two more parcels of <hi>rubbish</hi> to remove out of the way; which I shall do with all <hi>Speed.</hi> One is this,— My <hi>Antagonist</hi> charges me with having affronted and abused the Learned <hi>Peter Gassendus. p.</hi> 258. These are my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> words, I will recite him faithfully, and wish he had so done by me. <hi>Peter Gassendus,</hi> poor <hi>Man, because he wrote against</hi> Judicial Astrology, <hi>and check'd and confuted the Art of</hi> Genitures, <hi>had all things naught in his Nativity.

It is my <hi>Antagonists</hi> design by this passage to render me guilty of doing <hi>Injury</hi> to the <hi>Ashes</hi> of the Learned <hi>Gassendus</hi>: and to that purpose He insinuates Me to be the real Author of the Judgment given upon <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s <hi>Scheme</hi>; But if He had pleased to have done Me Justice, He should have told the World the <hi>Truth</hi> as I had done, which He could not but see and know, <hi>viz.</hi> That, that Character was none of Mine, but a <hi>Quotation</hi> made use of by Me, (and not in such words neither as He mentioned, but in words far different, as you shall see anon.) The Author whereof was Mr. (now Dr.) <hi>F. B.</hi> a <hi>Learned Physician</hi> and <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,</hi> and very well able to defend his own work. Whose parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words I will relate; together with the Provocation given by <hi>Gassendus,</hi> which occasion'd that <hi>Smart,</hi> but true Animadversion upon his <hi>Geniture,</hi> which himself gave to the Learned <hi>Morinus</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="61">§. 61. The words which I made use of, and annexed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> are to be found in my <hi>Col Geni. p.</hi> 126. and Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, viz. <hi>I shall not need to observe any more on this Figure, then I find already done in an Appendix to an Apology for</hi> Astrology, <hi>published lately by my Loving Friend Mr.</hi> Vincent Wing; <hi>the Author of which</hi> Appendix <hi>is Mr.</hi> F. B. <hi>and my very good Friend also, who hath responded both like an</hi> Artist <hi>and</hi> Schollar <hi>to</hi> Gassendus'<hi>s Objections against</hi> Astrology. <hi>For a sight of which I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108979:21"/>
refer the Ingenious Reader to the</hi> Appendix <hi>it self, and shall only present him with what relates to the</hi> Scheme, viz. <hi>Here you may see the</hi> Malignant Planets ♄. <hi>and</hi> ♂: <hi>have the chief Dominion in the</hi> Scheme; ♄. <hi>is Lord of his</hi> Horoscope; <hi>peregrine Retrograde, and in his Detriment, and unfortunate in ♋. which made his Lungs much oppressed with Flegm, rotten and corrupt, of an ill habit of body, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sickly, subject to Catarrhs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That for Manners, ♄. in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. of ♂. and both in ill aspect of the Ascendant, made him of an evil Disposition, Envious, Suspitious, Revengeful; Angry, Peevish, Contentious, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, Fraudulent; a Lyar, a Calumniator, an Impostor; Covetous, a Robber of other Mens Honours; a false Friend, a perfidious Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; a notorious Hypocrite, an Athiest, and (to say no worse of him, than he does of Mr.</hi> Des Cartes, <hi>though unjustly) a Toad swell'd with Pride and malicious Venom, as you may see in that Book against</hi> Des Cartes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and other of his Works. As he had ☿. in ⚹. ♂. and in the House of ♄. so he had a wit apt enough for Mischiefs, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and contentions, Sharp in Disputation: as in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. to the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. so it was turbulent enough; and had not ☿. applyed to a ⚹ of ♃ also, he had been so ill nature'd, he had scarce been sociable: But that good Aspect gave him so much wit as to dissemble it under Zeal to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and make that seem the severity of his Devotion, which was the Morosness of his Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">§. 62. These are the words contended against by my <hi>Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi>: And I will not refuse to confess they seem to sound some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harsh and severe: what then? The ☌. <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. or ☍. of ♄. and ♂: is a harsh and severe <hi>Aspect,</hi> and that all <hi>Astrologers</hi> know: and so little of the Character could be spared, that I might have gone further in this Discription, without injury to <hi>Astrology,</hi> and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly too, without the breach of good Manners.</p>
            <p>But yet, supposing (which I do not grant) that the words were too harsh, and that the same things might have been express'd in <hi>softer terms:</hi> Yet, I must let my Learned <hi>Opponent</hi> know,— <hi>That it is not customary for any man to speak of his Enemy in the same Key, and Character, as of his Friend.</hi> In such a case the <hi>Satyr</hi> should ever be debar'd the use of his <hi>Whip.</hi> Gassendus <hi>had proclaimed War against</hi> Astrology, <hi>injured the innocent</hi> Truths, <hi>and</hi> Professors <hi>thereof</hi>; not confuted either It, or Them, as my Antagonist thinks. That's a task not so easily perform'd as talk'd of. But besides, what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108979:21"/>
if it be made appear that <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s <hi>Rough</hi> and <hi>Moross</hi> dealing by the <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as by <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> hath pull'd this upon him? He hath indeed given too <hi>broad,</hi> and too <hi>foul</hi> a <hi>provocation</hi> for an <hi>Astrologer</hi> thus truly to depaint him. And that is the second thing I promised to give an account of.</p>
            <p n="63">§. 63. 2. The <hi>Truth</hi> of the matter stands thus.— Dr. <hi>F. B.</hi> in reading <hi>Gassendus Contra Astrologiam,</hi> met with many unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Provocations, Falsifications, Scoffs,</hi> &amp;c. against <hi>Astrologers,</hi> (which he could not possibly without a mark of Indignation pass by,) and among the rest of his scornful and contemptuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, These <hi>Vnsavory, Obscene,</hi> and Ridiculous words,— <hi>Nor are we to say such an Infant was born infected with a foul and contagious Disease, because the sixth House was his Horoscope, but, because his Mothers lower House was Impure and Infectious.</hi> Apol. for <hi>Astrol. p.</hi> 122.— In which words, here is (1.) a <hi>great Truth</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> impugned, which the Author of the Character hath very well answer'd: And (2.) a <hi>Wity Falshood</hi> is made use of in the room of <hi>Reason</hi> to defend it. And can any <hi>Artist</hi> be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such <hi>affronts</hi> as these? Must the <hi>poor</hi> Astrologer <hi>be laughed to scorn by the Waspish</hi> Spleenatick <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and not be suffer'd so much as to speak for himself? or to reply upon his Adversary without being term'd a <hi>Bespatterer of him?</hi> If <hi>Truth</hi> offend either <hi>Gassendus</hi> or my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> I cannot help that? nor shall I Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self so far as to make an excuse for the offence. The <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum Datum</hi> is of <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s side; He began the <hi>Quarrel,</hi> and was the real <hi>Aggressor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="64">§. 64. But I would fain know to what purpose <hi>Gassendus</hi> gave his <hi>Nativity</hi> to <hi>Morinus,</hi> if not to be inspected, and Judged by <hi>Astrology?</hi> And if Dr. <hi>F. B.</hi> meeting with it, happen'd to observe the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. of ♄. and ♂. therein (and that <hi>Artist</hi> must be blind that could not) was it a <hi>crime</hi> for him to <hi>declare the Effects</hi> which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Issue from such a <hi>position,</hi> according to the Judgments of <hi>Astrologers?</hi> Or, for <hi>Me</hi> to Quote it from him with approbation, when I know he hath written like an <hi>Artist</hi>; What? shall <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus</hi> be suffer'd to Spit against <hi>Heaven</hi>? Scoff at <hi>Starry Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi> Bespatter the <hi>honest Students</hi> in that noble Art? Make sport at <hi>Gods Glorious Host?</hi> And shall no Man be permitted (having his <hi>Geniture</hi> too, as given by himself) to acquaint him with <hi>Astral
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108979:22"/>
Cause</hi> of such <hi>Drivels?</hi> May <hi>Gassendus,</hi> as his own <hi>Spleen swells,</hi> be allowed to call the Renowned <hi>Cartesius</hi>— a <hi>Toad swell'd with Pride and malicious Venom</hi>; and for his so fulsome, and Anti-Philosophick a <hi>Character</hi> be esteemed otherwise than <hi>Ill-natur'd?</hi> Had I not seen <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s Nativity, I could easily have Judg'd he had had ♄. ill posited, upon reading such words in him. <hi>Ill Water never flows from wholesom Springs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="65">§. 65. Howbeit, I do really love, my self, to keep within the bounds of <hi>Modesty,</hi> and <hi>good Language,</hi> and <hi>good Manners:</hi> And do heartily wish <hi>Gassendus</hi> had not given the occasiou for so <hi>rough</hi> (though <hi>true</hi>) a <hi>Treatment.</hi> I can look upon an <hi>Ill position</hi> in any Man's <hi>Geniture</hi> with <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> rather than <hi>Scorn</hi> or <hi>Derision:</hi> And bless the God of Heaven, that my own <hi>Nativity</hi> was not such. <hi>It is He that hath made us, and not we our selves.</hi> And nothing but a very <hi>severe provocation</hi> (and not always that) can make Me speak a <hi>Harsh</hi> or <hi>Vnpleasant Truth</hi> of any Man. I affect evenness of Temper in all things.</p>
            <p n="66">§. 66. But now, I wonder much how my Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> could possibly over-look such <hi>Brotherly</hi> in <hi>Gassendus</hi> [as <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lower House being Impure and Infectious,</hi>] and such <hi>Falshood,</hi> (for I allow him too good an <hi>Astrologer</hi> as not to know it to be such) as [<hi>the sixth House was the Infants Horoscope</hi>] or, yet the <hi>Beastly</hi> expression used against <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> [That <hi>He was a Toad swell'd with Pride and malicious Venom.</hi>] I wonder I say, how he could <hi>over-look</hi> all these things, and yet <hi>look</hi> so <hi>critically</hi> and <hi>steadily</hi> upon what was return'd in reply to him?</p>
            <p n="67">§. 67. But letting this enquiry pass, what will my <hi>Antagonist</hi> say, if I produce the Authority of <hi>Astrologers</hi> (for no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is fit or allowable in this case,) <hi>to confirm every part of the Character given</hi> to <hi>Gassendus</hi>; even to the very <hi>Rotten Flegm</hi> mention'd? will he still think that <hi>Gassendus</hi> hath had any wrong done him?</p>
            <p>To this end, let <hi>Forman</hi> be consulted, as Printed in <hi>These: Astrol. p.</hi> 71. <hi>Saturn</hi> (saith He) <hi>worketh his malice more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently in ♋ than in any other</hi> Sign, <hi>because ♋. is his detriment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ☍. to ♑. and ♋ is cold, moist, Flegmatick, and doth aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the cold and Flegm in ♄. and make him more Venomous; for all Venom and Poyson is ♄: and he causes the greatest Venom in ♋.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:108979:22"/>
And, a little further— <hi>♄. in the first 12 Degres of ♋ is cold in the first</hi> (Degree) <hi>and temperate in dryth and Moisture, ingendring Diseases of much Flegm, and mix'd with thin Melancholly, causing Coughs, Stopping of the Stomach, Shivering and Pricking there, the black Plague, by reason the Blood is overcome with Flegm and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. And in p. 114. <hi>He says ♄. in ♋. indicates Flegm Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> &amp;c. This sure may satisfy for the <hi>rotten Flegm</hi> and <hi>Distempers</hi> mention'd in the Character.</p>
            <p n="68">§. 68. Next, for the Manners which ♄. and ♂. conciliated give, let the Learned <hi>Origanus</hi> be call'd to give Evidence, who hath treated both largely and Learnedly of the <hi>Genethliacal</hi> part of <hi>Astrology</hi>; and see if he do not fully justify both Dr. <hi>B.</hi> and my self also in this matter. <hi>Si</hi> Saturno ♂. <hi>associatur in judicio mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, in prospera constitutione efficiuntur homines abs<expan>

            <p>This Description is countenanc'd by all <hi>Astrologers</hi>: and the Experience of all Ages proves it true. It was made before <hi>Gassendus</hi> was an <hi>Embrio</hi>; yet for <hi>Him</hi> too, though not purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or alone for <hi>Him</hi>; but for <hi>all others</hi> that have been, are, or shall be <hi>Born</hi> under the like Malignant Aspects and Positions. So that you see it is not only my single Opinion: And therefore <hi>Gassendus</hi> hath not the least wrong done him; nor need my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist</hi> have been angry with me, for Transcribing this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and Printing it with <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s <hi>Nativity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">§. 70. But, why do I thus labour among <hi>Astrological</hi> Authors to defend the Character of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and free my self from the reproachful Epithete of a <hi>Bespatterer</hi> of him? when my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> hath so fully supported my Opinion, and (had there been never an <hi>Astrologer</hi> in the world left to assist me) made <hi>all</hi> that I had said thereon <hi>Good?</hi>— In his reply to an <hi>Objection</hi> brought by <hi>Gassendus</hi> about the <hi>End</hi> for which <hi>Comets</hi> appear, my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist</hi> tells the world— That <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s <hi>Obiection is a gross mistake, and proceeds from Pride and vain Conceit, from Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and gross Profaneness, as well as Pride; and carries on the Plot and Design of Athiestical Spirits, who would exclude God from the Government and Care of the World?</hi> Comit. p. 133.</p>
            <p>Now, let the Impartial Reader Judge, whether this (though conaise) <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> drawn by my <hi>Opponent, be not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108979:23"/>
Comprehensive of All that my words of him contain?</hi> Why should not now my <hi>Antagnist</hi> be <hi>angry</hi> with himself, and <hi>Write</hi> against his <hi>own Book,</hi> with equal <hi>Fierceness</hi> as He hath done against <hi>Mine</hi>; for having (as he says) <hi>Bespatter'd</hi> the Learned <hi>Gassendus? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus, quos inquinat aequat.</hi> This in Justice he should, and ought to do; though therein <hi>He</hi> imitate the Grave <hi>Cat,</hi> viewing her self in a <hi>Looking-Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will he now offer to say, again, in favour of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and in affront to me, That— <hi>Never was Wretch so Bespatter'd by Man of Art!</hi> Or, hath <hi>He</hi> a priviledge to make Observations on the Manners and Writing of <hi>Gassendus?</hi> And a power to debar the Poor <hi>Astrologer</hi> the same Freedom, when He shall be, not only insultingly <hi>provoked</hi> (as you have heard) but boldly <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged</hi> to the undertaking, by an Haughty imparting of his <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> to <hi>Morinus,</hi> for that very purpose?— I hope my <hi>Opponent</hi> will not now deny, but that <hi>Himself</hi> is the better <hi>Artist</hi> at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spattering</hi>: And therein I submit him the <hi>Waisters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="71">§. 71. But yet, my <hi>Antagonist</hi> will not be so satisfyed; but still supposing himself in the right, and me in the wrong, as to this business of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> he is pleased very briskly to advance against me with another Regiment of arm'd words, in <hi>pag.</hi> 252. Thus,— <hi>What work would this Man make with the Nativity of the worthy Dr.</hi> Henry More, <hi>if he could get a sight thereof? He would read his Life, and all his Writings in it at the first view? He would make the Lord of his Ascendant plainly shew him to be a Retir'd Melancholly Collegian all his days; a Philosopher, and particularly of the Platonick Sect; And</hi> (<hi>which is as ugly a thing as can be in any Mans</hi> Geniture) <hi>a professed</hi> Adversary <hi>to the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and all its corruptions. Thus, but more grievously he should smart for writing against Dear</hi> Urania; <hi>and for daring to insert his confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Judiciary Astrology <hi>into the</hi> Mystery <hi>of</hi> Godliness, <hi>and for Printing it lately by it self.</hi> Thus, between <hi>Iest</hi> and <hi>Earnest</hi> (like another <hi>Heraclitus Ridens</hi>) is my Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>Buffet</hi> me.</p>
            <p n="72">§. 72. A very pretty way hath he here taken, to render me <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> and a <hi>Papist</hi> together.— For what wrong hath Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> ever done me in particular, that, upon the <hi>sight</hi> of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> could I get it, I should be supposed to deal ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108979:24"/>
or unworthily by him? Or, what good hath he done me, that I should trouble my self so far, as to <hi>write his Character by his Nativity?</hi> And, what <hi>injury</hi> have I ever done, either to this my <hi>causeless Adversary,</hi> or to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as establish'd by Law, that he should thus subtilly insinuate me a <hi>Papist</hi>; and that by virtue of my being (supposed) so, I should be oblig'd to <hi>deal unkindly</hi> by Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> because he hath written against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>corruptions?</hi> It is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to me, nor am I concern'd against what, or whom Dr. <hi>More</hi> hath written, as long as he makes me no <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Abettor</hi> to the Quarrel.</p>
            <p n="73">§. 73. But, to reply more particularly to this <hi>grating Sarcasm</hi> (for it is such) as for the worthy Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi>'s <hi>Nativity,</hi> should it fall into my hands, I do assure this my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dr. also, that it should <hi>Fare</hi> much better than <hi>Astrology</hi> or <hi>Astrologers</hi> have done in the hands of the Dr. and of <hi>Gassendus.</hi> But, I should not promise him (in case I should give my self a trouble about it) to do much therein at the <hi>first view</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this occasion given me, and certainly 'tis given me for some <hi>purpose</hi> more than ordinary; or else my <hi>Antagonist</hi> hath troubled both himself, and me, in vain) I will hereby promise the worthy and Learned Doctor, <hi>That if he shall please to impart his true</hi> Geniture, <hi>as freely to me, as Monsieur</hi> Gassend <hi>did his to</hi> Morinus, <hi>I will make no unworthy use of it, but give him the just and plain sence of what it naturally imports, according to the Rules of Art.</hi> I honour the <hi>Doctors</hi> great Parts and Reading; and am not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own to have been embetter'd by his Learned Labours. Nay, I also confess never to have heard any <hi>Ill</hi> of him; excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of his severity against <hi>Astrology</hi> and <hi>Astrologers</hi>: term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Art</hi> a <hi>meer Inanity</hi>; a <hi>Sonorous Nothing,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists Fugitives</hi> and <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="74">§. 74. These are harsh expressions in earnest, and do bespeak a <hi>debilitated</hi> ♄. in the Doctors <hi>Geniture,</hi> let his ☿. be never so good. But such a <hi>value</hi> have I for the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and his <hi>Excellent Learning,</hi> that I am willing to cast a covering over his failings of this kind, rather than either to aggravate, or go about to answer them. Possibly, the <hi>Doctor</hi> being of a searching, curious, <hi>inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Genius,</hi> might, in his <hi>Iuvenile years</hi> be prying into <hi>Astrology.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:108979:24"/>
and probably meet with a <hi>Knave</hi> or unfaithful Fellow for his <hi>Guide</hi> therein; who, under pretence of directing him the right way to <hi>Dear Urania</hi>'s <hi>presence,</hi> might abuse him and bring him to some <hi>Lascivious Housewife,</hi> or common <hi>Strumpet,</hi> who might have the impudence to assume her name: And possibly for this, or some such like Trick, He may have contracted an <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of <hi>Astrology,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mervil</hi> most unhappily <hi>wreak'd his wrath,</hi> and <hi>spit his Venom</hi> at the <hi>whole Clergy,</hi> for being <hi>sham'd upon at Play by a Dignitory of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="75">§. 75. But, in case it should be so, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath in his more unsteady years been <hi>Iuggle'd</hi> with, and perhaps promised more from his <hi>Stars,</hi> than ever he hath found true, or it may be is ever like: (for I know that there are <hi>Fraudulent,</hi> as well as <hi>Honest persons,</hi> pretend to be <hi>Astrologers:</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes</hi> tells us, He had learnt to avoid the <hi>Gulleries</hi> &amp; <hi>Frauds</hi> of such <hi>Fellows,</hi> by that time he was 23 years old.) Yet, I cannot but perswade my self, that upon second thoughts, and more mature considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Doctor</hi> will never account it just or equal to blame or reprobate a <hi>whole Society</hi> for the <hi>Errours</hi> or <hi>Falshoods</hi> of a single Person.</p>
            <p n="76">§. 76. Now for Doctor <hi>Mores</hi> Nativity, it must either be <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Bad.</hi> If it be <hi>Bad,</hi> it is to be Judg'd so by <hi>Astrology</hi>; and my <hi>Antagonist</hi> says, the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath <hi>confuted</hi> that; so that that is no capable Judge of it. If it be <hi>Good,</hi> he need not be <hi>affraid</hi> or <hi>asham'd</hi> to shew it; for no <hi>Astrologer</hi> (allowing his Art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken) can make it either better or worse by his looking on it. So that either way, the <hi>Doctor</hi> may, if he pleases allow us a sight thereof.</p>
            <p n="77">§ 77. But now, a little for <hi>Exercise sake</hi>; what if I should suppose that the Learned <hi>Doctor</hi> hath ♄. in ♈. in his <hi>Genesis,</hi> in ☍. of <hi>active</hi> ☿ in ♎ and violent ♂. in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. of them both. <hi>Marry,</hi> and such <hi>Positions</hi> at the first sight would fright any ordinary man, and make the very <hi>Stars</hi> themselves become his <hi>Disease</hi>; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there were nothing found to alleviate such <hi>Hostile Positions.</hi> I will not, I cannot say, the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath those Aspects in his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi>; but I will Jeopard my small <hi>Reputation,</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> in <hi>Astrology,</hi> that whatever his <hi>Nativity</hi> be, <hi>He hath somewhat more than ordinary to do with the</hi> Cardinal Signs; <hi>Non obstante</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a <hi>Collegian</hi> all his days, and of the <hi>Platonick Sect.</hi> For, it is impossible he should ever have been so <hi>Famous</hi> by his <hi>Pen,</hi> and have wrote so much as he hath done, had not his ☿. been in some <hi>noted Position</hi> of the <hi>Heavens.</hi> And if any of the <hi>Fortunes</hi> should chance to assist ☿. at his Birth, then would his <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> be the more <hi>Exalted, Happy,</hi> and <hi>Flowing:</hi> especially if ♀. were in <hi>reception</hi> of him. And should it also prove true, that ♂. were in ♋ in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. to ☿. and to ♄. both; which Positions do impede the <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> and <hi>disturb</hi> the <hi>Iudgement.</hi> Yet, if ♂. were in <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. and reception of ♃. and his ☿. so supported by ♀. as before supposed; the prejudice would be thereby much lessen'd, if not totally taken away. And so the <hi>Doctor</hi> by his worthy <hi>Accomplishments</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,</hi> may reasonably obtain upon the <hi>World,</hi> and deserve much more <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Advancement,</hi> than the <hi>wearing of a Short Gown comes to,</hi> though possibly he may not <hi>enjoy it.</hi> But then, if ♂. and ♄. both should <hi>Obviate</hi> and <hi>Cloud</hi> the ☉. notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his great and prodigious Parts, his <hi>Honour</hi> would be <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened</hi>; and I should cease to wonder, why the Dr. should be a <hi>Collegian</hi> and <hi>Philosopher all his days.</hi> The ☉ never shone splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly in an <hi>Eclipse.</hi> The same Stars that may denote <hi>Merit,</hi> do not always signifie <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="78">§. 78. Thus, and no otherwise, were the <hi>Doctors Nativity</hi> such, as here suppos'd, and in <hi>my hands,</hi> would I descant upon it. A quite different way should I go to work, to what my <hi>Antagonist Vainly</hi> and <hi>Ludiorously surmises.</hi> Alas! it is not <hi>every one</hi> that hath ♄. and ♂. in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. ☌. or ☍. that must therefore be <hi>Ill natur'd, Moross, Covetous,</hi> &amp;c. or yet opprest with <hi>Corrupt, Rotten Flegm,</hi> or <hi>Sickly,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Gassendus</hi> was.

            </p>
            <p n="96">§. 96. To proceed; well! but the <hi>Doctor must Smart,</hi> saith my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> not only for writing against the Dear <hi>Urania</hi>; but for <hi>inserting his confutation of Iudiciary Astrology in his Mystery of Godliness.</hi>— No reason for this at all neither. The <hi>Doctor</hi> is Lord of, and over his own Labours, and surely may do with them as he pleases. Possibly he may think that <hi>Confutation</hi> (as he is pleased to Christen it) better to become that <hi>Book,</hi> than it may be, I, and some others Opinion. But that shall <hi>break no Squares,</hi> nor breed any difference. If the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and this my Learned <hi>Antagonist</hi> be <hi>contented</hi> with its inhabiting there, I am not <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</hi> Only, by the way, (since my <hi>Antagonist</hi> hath given me this occasion) I must with my wonted <hi>Freedom</hi> tell him, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath <hi>confuted Astrology</hi> in a few Sheets of Paper; I am of belief, that before he have <hi>compleated his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> over it, he must be constrained to write a great many more: and possibly then too, be content to miss of his end. For, alas! The several large <hi>Tomes</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy, Gauricus, Cardan, Iunctine, Garcaeus, Goclenius, Naybode, Origanus, Argol, Morinus, Leovitius, Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Haly,</hi> &amp;c. are not to be blown away with so light a breath, as this my <hi>Antagonist</hi> imagines. The <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>excellent Reasons</hi> of these <hi>Learned Men</hi> will not be <hi>overcome,</hi> or fall into a <hi>Swoun,</hi> at the <hi>Scent of his Perfum'd Socks.</hi>

Let the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mr. <hi>Iohn Butler,</hi> his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> (whose Province it is) take notice of that. Which I am told he will; and also very shortly give the <hi>Doctor</hi> that just satisfaction as it requires. In the interim, I shall take leave to tell the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and my <hi>Opponent</hi> also,— That I have often heard of <hi>Homers Illiads</hi> being comprized in a <hi>Nut-shell,</hi> yet could I never see them <hi>crowded</hi> into so <hi>small</hi> a <hi>Room.</hi> All reports are not to be believed.</p>
            <p n="98">§. 98. But now, my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> to make himself and Friends <hi>merry,</hi> goes merrily on with me, saying,— <hi>But look you now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Uincent Wing published a Piece against Gassendus (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this excellent Mans Objections against</hi> Astrology <hi>are pretended to be answered) and was himself a well willer and Brother Philoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themat. his</hi> Nativity <hi>hath all things good and laudable in it.</hi>— Pray Sir who told you this? not I, I am sure. For where will you find in my Writings that I say, <hi>that Uincent Wing's</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity <hi>hath all things good and laudable in it?</hi> I beseech you, <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>whose Nativity</hi> can that be, that can claim a <hi>Title</hi> to so much happiness? such a <hi>Native</hi> must be no company for <hi>Mortals</hi>! All <hi>Genitures</hi> have the <hi>Malefiques</hi> as well as <hi>Fortunate Stars</hi> in them, although not alike posited.</p>
            <p n="69">§. 69. What strange kinds of <hi>Fetches</hi> hath this Gentleman? <hi>And</hi> what <hi>Wiles</hi> doth he make use of, to <hi>fasten</hi> something upon me (though he scarce know what) to my <hi>disparagement</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me contradictory to my self? I have spoken nothing but the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Uincent Wing.</hi> And had the Learned <hi>Gassendus</hi> been blessed with the like <hi>Stars</hi> for <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> as was the <hi>Laborious</hi> and <hi>Ingenious</hi> Mr. <hi>Wing</hi> I should not have refused to have mentined them.</p>
            <p n="100">§. 100. Yet, A little further, my watchful <hi>Antagonist</hi> is at me again in these words,— <hi>He tells us, that William Lilly, his Enemy, though Fellow</hi> Astrologer, <hi>had the Moon in Pisces, a Wet and Drinking Sign, which made him a piece of a Good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi> Behold! How this Gentleman seeks a quarrel against me! I am so far from charging Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> with this as a Crime (as my <hi>Antagonist</hi> inculcates, or else, in this, he hath said nothing) that I only in my <hi>Collection of Genitures,</hi> subjoyn to Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108979:29"/>
Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s own words, and what himself hath said of his having the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Pisces,</hi> (in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to his Almanack 1645.) <hi>which he says, made him a piece of a good Fellow,</hi> And this my <hi>Antagonist</hi> might have seen Quoted by me, if he had pleased. But none so blind as they that won't see.</p>
            <p n="101">§. 101 But, where doth my <hi>Antagonist</hi> find the words— <hi>Wet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Drinking?</hi> I am very sure my <hi>Book</hi> furnisheth him not. That was my <hi>Opponents</hi> own wity addition for the <hi>Iests</hi> sake. And let him be <hi>merry</hi> with all my heart. And if he delight to <hi>Burlesque</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> let him also be as <hi>Free with me</hi>; much good may it do him; <hi>I cannot suffer in better company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="102">§. 102. Nay, this my <hi>Antagonist</hi> may, if he please find, that in my <hi>Obsequium Rationabile,</hi> or defence of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> where I have occasion to bring in the Learned Doctor <hi>Fisk</hi>'s <hi>Geniture,</hi> who also had the <hi>Moon in Pisces,</hi> I very plainly tell Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> (with a tacit reprehension for his jesting with serious things;) <hi>That the</hi> Moon in Pisces, <hi>signifies something else, besides a good Fellow.</hi> Neither had I, of any man, any reason to make sport with the <hi>Moon in Pisces,</hi> (unless with the <hi>Bald Knight</hi> in the <hi>Apologue,</hi> I resolv'd to laugh at my self) it being one of the best <hi>positions</hi> in my <hi>Geniture</hi>; and of which I have no cause (I bless God) to be ashamed.</p>
            <p n="103">§. 103. I will now make my <hi>Adversary</hi> himself Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath dealt truely with me, in laying at my Door the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of another? as also his soon after suggesting,— <hi>That such Fancies are oftentimes the products of a Capricious and Fanciful, of a Spightful and Malicious Brain.</hi> Good Sir! not too fast. <hi>Festina lente.</hi> Fair and softly goes far. Either what you have urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, must be True or False. If <hi>True</hi>; I beseech you prove it to be such. If <hi>False</hi>; it will appear then, that it is not my <hi>Brain</hi> that is <hi>Capricious, Fanciful, Spightful,</hi> and <hi>Malicious</hi>; but <hi>Yours.</hi> In pure Justice Sir, I expect your Retractation as you are a <hi>Clergyman</hi> and a <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="104">§. 104. My <hi>Antagonist,</hi> as if he had been in the right all this while, Rears another Story upon the former Sandy-Foundation, for me to Demolish: affirming thus,— <hi>And for this reason, as well as some others (particularly because these Men have undertaken to Calculate the Nativities of Buildings as well as of Humane Bodies; of hard Stones no less than of soft Flesh:) the most Learned and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108979:30"/>
Iudicious</hi> Astrologers <hi>have not ascerted the</hi> Doctrine of Genitures; <hi>although in other things they have defended</hi> Astrological Judgements. <hi>p.</hi> 260. Commeto.</p>
            <p n="105">§. 105. Would not an ordinary Reader believe there were <hi>some Truth,</hi> at least, in a Story so <hi>smoothly</hi> told? And that the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures</hi> was really <hi>Renounced</hi> and <hi>Reprobated</hi> by the most Learned <hi>Astrologers?</hi>— How hard is it for any man, even the most Learned, to <hi>oppose the Truth</hi> and escape undiscover'd? 'Tis difficult (Learned Sir) to kick against <hi>These Pricks,</hi> and not to come off wounded.</p>
            <p n="106">§. 106. If I should demand of my <hi>Opponent, what Learned and Iudicious</hi> Astrologers <hi>those were which he talks of, that have denied</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures?</hi> I am perswaded it would very much <hi>puzzle,</hi> if not <hi>confound</hi> him, to name them.— Sure, he doth not mean <hi>Picus, Erastus, Gassendus,</hi> Doctor <hi>More,</hi> &amp;c. for his <hi>Learned and Iudicious Astrologers?</hi> These have been all <hi>Enemies</hi> unto the <hi>Art</hi>; and have wrote most violently against it. And, I am very certain, that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Iunctine</hi> (both which he produces to confront <hi>Astrologers,</hi> and confute their Follies in some things) can be none of the Persons he means: for both of Them very largely <hi>Assert</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures.</hi> Yes, and those of <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> too: Of <hi>hard Stone,</hi> no less than of <hi>soft Flesh.</hi> And this I hope most fully to prove from them, if that will satisfie the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Objector. Who sure talks at this <hi>strange Rate,</hi> not that he <hi>believes</hi> what <hi>he says,</hi> but only to <hi>try</hi> what acquaintance I have with those <hi>Learned Authors</hi>; and how <hi>able</hi> I am to <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>Art</hi> I profess.</p>
            <p n="107">§. 107. First then for <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Astrologers,</hi> as this <hi>Antagonist</hi> most truely Stiles him. That he is no renouncer of the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> but on the contrary, a great <hi>Friend</hi> to the <hi>Genethliacal</hi> part of <hi>Astrology</hi>; as the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Books</hi> of the <hi>Quadripartite</hi> most egregiously prove: For in them he <hi>Handles</hi> the <hi>whole Art of Nativities.</hi> And what thinks my <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist?</hi> can this be true, and yet he no <hi>Friend</hi> to the Subject? Let but my <hi>Opponent</hi> seriously, or indeed but cursorily consult those <hi>Books,</hi> (and if he please, <hi>Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Naybode</hi> their Commentaries upon them) and he will quickly find cause to <hi>Retract</hi> this his <hi>Rash</hi> and <hi>Vnadvised Ascertion.</hi> And, if he do not take all <hi>Genethliaques</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108979:30"/>
for <hi>Mad-men</hi> or <hi>Fools</hi> (and my self for the greatest among them) he would never sure once offer'd to have <hi>impos'd</hi> such an <hi>Ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon the World to believe, and upon <hi>Me</hi> to answer.</p>
            <p n="108">§. 108. A little further: the <hi>Centiloquium</hi> (which my <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> allows to be <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s, and makes <hi>use</hi> of it as <hi>such,</hi> for Proof of his Doctrine of <hi>Comets,</hi> &amp;c.) abounds with <hi>Genethliacal Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms.</hi> And, among the rest, the 36 and 54 <hi>Aphorisms</hi> do evince most plainly the <hi>Nativities of Buildings</hi>; proving to us, that <hi>hard Stone,</hi> no less than <hi>soft Flesh,</hi> is liable to <hi>Caelestial Energy.</hi> Hear how he speaks in opposition to my Learned <hi>Adversary,</hi> thus,— <hi>Aph.</hi> 36. <hi>In Condendis Vrbibus stellis Fixis, quae conferre habeunt utere.

               <p>And here, I cannot but call to mind, how, and by what kind of accident, I came <hi>first</hi> to <hi>Study</hi> the delightful, yet abstruse <hi>Art of Astrology</hi>; by the Practice whereof I have gained many Enemies; and among the rest, the <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of this my Learned Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist. And the true <hi>proximate occasion</hi> was thus,— In the year 1650, as I well remember, I was one night reading in my Bed (as it was my custom then to do, in some Book or other) in the <hi>Anatomy of Melancholly</hi>: And coming to this passage of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which I have but just now cited, <hi>viz. Of his having Iupiter in the Sixth House, which made him a Physician</hi>: I was really non-plust, and <hi>Planet-struck</hi> for that bout; and forced to lay aside my <hi>Book:</hi> being unwilling to read what I could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. I then endeavour'd to go to my <hi>Rest,</hi> but in <hi>vain</hi>; My <hi>active Genius</hi> was <hi>Watchful,</hi> and constantly <hi>sollicited me,</hi> even in my <hi>Dreams,</hi> to enquire, and discover if I could, <hi>what Iupiter in the Sixth House meant?</hi> Nor could I be at <hi>quiet</hi> when <hi>awake,</hi> until I had received some satisfaction about it. I had then (and blessed be God that I had) some small acquaintance with the Learned Dr. <hi>Nicholas Fisk,</hi> unto whom I repaired and imparted my difficulty: who presently gave me such <hi>satisfaction</hi> in the Point, as I was then capable of receiving; that I hold my self obliged, even in <hi>Gratitude,</hi> to own and remember his <hi>civilities</hi>; which was so agreeable and delightful to me, that from the <hi>same time</hi> I became his <hi>Pupil,</hi> and that <hi>little of Astrology</hi> which I understand, I Learnt from <hi>Him.</hi>

I held my self constrain'd to make some further reply to him. He says, <hi>The pretenders to</hi> Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy <hi>go beyond the Wisest</hi> Patriachs <hi>and</hi> Founders <hi>of their</hi> Art. <hi>They exceed the Limits of their</hi> Science; <hi>and Sentence is passed against them by their own Iudges.</hi> And to prove this, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to name two of Them, <hi>viz. Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Iunctinus.</hi>—
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108979:48"/>
You may remember I have, but a little before, refuted my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents</hi> Opinion of these two Learned Persons touching their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures.</hi> I shall now enquire what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther service or assistance they are able to afford him for the strengthening his present pretences</p>
               <p n="137">§. 137. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> (saith this Gentleman) tells us in his first Aphorism, <hi>That Generals only can be foretold by Art, and those alone who are Divinely inspired, are able to praedict particular Events. An</hi> Astrologer <hi>may tell the Propension and Inclination of a Man from his natural Temperature, and this from the</hi> Stars. <hi>But he cannot from that general Inclination, tell what determinate Effects will ensue. He ought to content himself with a general Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not be definitive in special cases, in particular and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual accidents. This</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Decision of the great Father of</hi> Astrologers.</p>
               <p>Unto all which I do not know one <hi>Astrologer</hi> that will not most readily set his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal.</hi> And how then can this make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Astrologers?</hi> or any way favour their <hi>Adversaries Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="138">§. 138. Why, (says my <hi>Oponent</hi>) it makes against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Horary Questions, which descend even to the most particular and personal Affairs.</hi>— He goes on, If this Doctrine of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s be true, <hi>what resolution is to be expected about the Marriage of such an Individual Couple? The particular Events of this Famous Voiage? That Councellors Cause? This Merchants Adventure? That Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Engagement,</hi> &amp;c.— And, why did not he put in, of that <hi>Patients Distemper too?</hi> Which sure he would have done, but that he had before granted, <hi>That the careful observing, and due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of the Times of the Heavenly Aspects and Influences, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useful in Physick. p.</hi> 117. And how can they be <hi>useful</hi> in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> I pray, and not in other Affairs relating to <hi>Health</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?</hi> Since the <hi>times</hi> of the <hi>Aspects</hi> and <hi>Influences</hi> are <hi>Vniversally</hi> Operarive, and may as well, and as certainly be observed in <hi>These,</hi> as in the other. <hi>Heaven</hi> hath as many <hi>Salutiferous Aspects,</hi> and <hi>Influences,</hi> as it hath <hi>Valetudinary:</hi> and must therefore be <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>effective</hi> to Mankind, in the <hi>One sence</hi> as well as the <hi>Other,</hi> we being subject to both equally.</p>
               <p n="136">§. 136. No! says my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> that must not be admitted: For then we allow of, and introduce <hi>Horary Questions.</hi> A thing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108979:49"/>
                  <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is against, if at least my <hi>Opponent</hi> do not mis-represent him. But, Sir, are you sure that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is against <hi>Horary Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>? Yes, saith he, not only in the <hi>First Aphorism</hi> (as you have heard) but in the <hi>Fifth</hi> too: Which runs in these words,— <hi>Potest qui seieus est, multos stellarum effectus avertere, quando naturam earum noverit, ac seipsum ante illorum eventum praeparare.</hi> A <hi>wise Man</hi> may <hi>avert</hi> many (not all) the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Stars,</hi> when he <hi>knowing</hi> their <hi>Natures,</hi> doth happily <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>prepare himself</hi> before the happening of the <hi>Event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="140">§. 140. I am glad my <hi>Antagonist</hi> alloweth the <hi>Centiloquium</hi> to be <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s. for by that Concession I am arm'd powerfully to demand of him, <hi>how he knows</hi> Ptolemy <hi>to be against Horary Questions?</hi> For if the <hi>Centiloquium</hi> be his, the <hi>Question</hi> is at an <hi>End.</hi> Let him be pleased to peruse these several <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> seriously at his leasure, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14.17.28.32.45.57.64.83.90.91.93.94.97. And then tell me whether <hi>Ptolemy</hi> doth Reprobate the <hi>Doctrine of Horary Questions?</hi> And let him also consider what will become of <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Florid Nothings</hi> written against them.</p>
               <p n="141">§. 141. But, I beseech you Sir, what <hi>Astrologer</hi> is he, who pretends, in opposition to <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> to foretell <hi>particular Events?</hi> As for the several seeming <hi>Musical Objections</hi> here brought, if they are rightly consider'd and examin'd there is nothing of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> in them. If by his <hi>Individual couple in Marriage,</hi> he means a <hi>couple</hi> already Contracted; It is then no Question in <hi>Astrology</hi>; if they are not <hi>contracted,</hi> they are no <hi>Individual couple.</hi> So that the <hi>Objection</hi> is (as Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> says of <hi>Astrology</hi>) a mere <hi>Sono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="142">§. 142. Then for the <hi>Seamans Voyage</hi> objected; no man, sure, was ever so <hi>Mad</hi> as to pretend to Praedict the particular <hi>Events</hi> thereof. The <hi>Astrologer</hi> can only consult in the <hi>General,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Successful,</hi> or <hi>unkind?</hi> He cannot tell how far <hi>Successful</hi> or <hi>disadvantageous?</hi> He may as well pretend particularly to know when he shall arrive at <hi>Cales, Lisbon, Iamaica,</hi> &amp;c. which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> is not <hi>Science,</hi> but <hi>Witchcraft</hi> to do. But I hope to satisfie the World in this Point more fully in my <hi>Astrological Seaman.</hi> In the mean time, I shall adventure to affirm, that—</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:108979:49"/>§. 143. <hi>He</hi> that contends against <hi>Horary Questions,</hi> are vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Ptolemy</hi> for his <hi>Authority</hi> doth nothing but <hi>Fish in the Air,</hi> And we may easily <hi>guess</hi> what a <hi>Fry</hi> he is like to <hi>catch,</hi> or be <hi>Master</hi> of.</p>
               <p n="144">§. 144. I wonder that any man of Learning should offer to use <hi>Ptolemy</hi> thus! But this is of an equal Stamp and Currency for <hi>Truth,</hi> with his being brought in to oppose the <hi>Doctrine of Genitures,</hi> as well of <hi>Men</hi> as of <hi>Buildings.</hi>— Poor <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> you see, is dealt <hi>ill</hi> by in both! And much worse than my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist</hi> charges <hi>Me</hi> to have <hi>dealt</hi> with the Learned <hi>Gassendus.</hi> I would advise all Persons for the future, that shall pretend to write against <hi>Horary Questions</hi>; First to consult <hi>Haly,</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> those Learned and Volluminous Authors, who of all <hi>Others</hi> have most liberally <hi>Ascerted</hi> and most largely <hi>Taught</hi> them. And when they have fairly refuted these <hi>Two,</hi> I will then say, They may be called the <hi>Cozen-Germans</hi> of <hi>Hercules.</hi> In the mean time we will keep unto the <hi>Truth</hi> of what <hi>Ptolemy</hi> warrants concerning <hi>Horary Questions,</hi> and to what our <hi>Assiduous practice</hi> confirms; and that <hi>sometimes</hi> even to <hi>Amazement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="145">§. 145. Having found how unfit <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is for the ungrateful service which my Author hath put him upon, we will hear what he says from <hi>Iunctine.</hi> And here he acquaints us, for the support of the present <hi>Objection,</hi> That (<hi>p.</hi> 164.) <hi>Iunctine</hi> says— <hi>Those</hi> Astrologers <hi>who will needs know, and praedict all kinds of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, are Fools.</hi>— Marry, and so say I. And what <hi>Astrologer</hi> is there doth my <hi>Adversary</hi> suppose, that will offer to gainsay <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> Junctinus <hi>in this?</hi> For my own part, I shall be so far from denying it, that I will even adventure to add to it, and enlarge <hi>Iunctinus</hi>'s Censure of such kind of Men, <hi>viz. They are, not only the greatest of Fools, but of Mad-men too!</hi> For what is a poor simple Man, whose Breath is in his Nostrils, and cannot absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise himself to meet the <hi>Sun</hi> the next day: (vile Dust and Ashes that he is!) What is he, I say, That he should dare presume to <hi>Predict all Things</hi>? To do so, is the Priviledge of a <hi>Deity</hi> only.

In these words. <hi>Those</hi> Astrologers <hi>who are subject to a bad Fate (though their Skill may be good) are apt to Err in their Iudgements</hi> (<hi>it is one of the</hi> Aphorisms <hi>in</hi> Gadbury) <hi>a ticklish business indeed! We had need first consult Mr.</hi> Astrologers <hi>Nativity, before we desire him to search into our own.</hi> In answer whereto, I demand, doth <hi>He</hi> think it impossible for an <hi>Astrologer</hi> to be liable to a <hi>bad Fate</hi>? If <hi>He</hi> do, my before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd late <hi>unhappy Troubles</hi> (at my Cost) resolves his <hi>Doubt.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>need</hi> for <hi>Him</hi> to consult Mr. <hi>Astrologers Nativity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he go to him; <hi>Common Fame</hi> will inform him whether he be <hi>Labouring</hi> under <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad Influences</hi>; as it doth of a <hi>Lawyer, Physician, Merchant,</hi> &amp;c. But to retort his <hi>witty Quibble,</hi> if himself be ignorant of <hi>Astrology,</hi> to what purpose would he <hi>consult the</hi> Astrologers <hi>Nativity?</hi> If he <hi>understand</hi> it, Then may he be his <hi>Own Astrologer,</hi> and save the labour of going any where else. Oh! the <hi>wondrous Wit of an Enemy to Astrology!</hi> What a <hi>ticklish business</hi> hath he got by the end to make himself <hi>Sport</hi> withal? or rather to render himself a <hi>Sport</hi> to Others? If neither <hi>Divine, Physician,</hi> or <hi>Lawyer</hi> be at all times equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Vnerring Advise</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> Then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108979:51"/>
neither is the <hi>Astrologer. Sed verum prius, Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. And thus we have freed our other <hi>Innocent Aphorism</hi> again, and do affirm it (as before) for a <hi>splendid Verity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="153">§. 153. I have now <hi>done:</hi> and that <hi>something</hi> more than at <hi>First</hi> I intended; and, it may be, <hi>more</hi> than my <hi>Antagonist ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi> And shall leave his more <hi>numerous Objections</hi> against <hi>Astrology in General,</hi> to be answered by some more <hi>able Pen and Brain.</hi> Resting satisfied to have said thus <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>little</hi> rather, in <hi>defence of my self and Labours,</hi> which I found most unjustly, and unreasonably <hi>assaulted.</hi>
