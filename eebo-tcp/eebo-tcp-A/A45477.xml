            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was very oppoſite to publiſh my ſelf to the world a fool in print, reſolving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wait the determination of the Supreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (and not by railing invectives) we muſt be tryed, than to have expreſſed ſo much indifferency as to have carped unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably at the proceeding of theſe inhuman, ingratefull, and blood-ſucking Sectaries, which mention God in their lips, but their hearts are farre from him; but that I ſee daily a broaching of lyes, one confederating and in the neck of another, which begets belief amongſt many, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a vulgar applauſe along with their action, the only way theſe people ever pitched on to effect their deſigns, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they credited by our ſilence.</p>
            <p>We deſire to ſatisfie every man, and eſpecially our worthy friends the noble <hi>Virginians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> (for in <hi>Virginia</hi> they are ſufficiently informed) and that by their unbyaſt diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and relations they may undeceive ſuch as the hypocricies of theſe fellows hath deluded.</p>
            <p>This, and the inward vexation which perplexeth me to read what they write, to hear what's reported, awakes me, as knowing more of their deceits and proceedings than any man living. I have at this preſent written, lying by me an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call relation of the tranſactions of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52149:3"/>
under the Government and Tyranny of <hi>Richard Bennet</hi> and Colonel <hi>Claiborn,</hi> with many remarkable paſſages of ſuch State-policies as they and their creatures uſed; but will for a while forbeare to publiſh, as rather deſiring this pen-jarring may ceaſe; but if any of this rout ſhall any more diſturbe the world (for us they cannot do) with their ſeeming-ſanctified lies, I will then not ſpare to acquaint the world what they are, and how they live, and give each of their Characters to open view, which now lyes masked under the hood of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and good diſpoſition, in which I ſhall ſomewhat more largely anſwer <hi>Leonard Strongs Babylons fall,</hi> the Book of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia and Maryland,</hi> and other objections and allegations of theirs, being all full of impudence and ignorance.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Heamans</hi> ſhould dare to write amazes me, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his imbecillity, his villany, and therefore I ſhall in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to him, briefly and in his own tone anatomize and lay him open to the world a fool, to the State a Knave, to God a notorious offender, whoſe unfeigned repentance I cordially wiſh, and that his future portion of Grace may over-ballance his former talents of wit and honeſty, in the want of which the poor man hath been too too unhappy. But to the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger Heamans</hi> gives a great account in his whole relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his extraordinary vigilancy and diligence in mannaging of his charge, and the truſt impoſed on him by his owners, but omits to inſert what a diſordered Ship and company he had, how mutinous and quarrelſome they were amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and how upon every drunken bout they had, what Swords were drawn, what challenges made between the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their great Commander, inſomuch that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants obſerving their carraiges, with deriſion and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reported of the fantaſtickneſſe of <hi>Heamans</hi> and his rude ungoverned Ships Company.</p>
            <p>The inſolencie of theſe were ſuch towards the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, (obſerving the licentiouſneſſe of thoſe parts) and taking occaſion thereby, that they would ſell commodities to whom they liſt, and lighting on greater prices, would of their own accords (after delivery made) repoſſeſſe themſelves again,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52149:3"/>
ſcoffing at any pretence of Law or Juſtice, ſaying, (as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proved too true) that their Ship was of force enough to awe the whole Countrey, inflicting puniſhments on the Planters, and robbing houſes as they went, all which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved by Depoſitions already taken.</p>
            <p>He relates how civilly he entreated Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governour <hi>Stone,</hi> who refuſed the title of Governour from him, informing him that one Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Province, and intimates, that from that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he bends to <hi>Fuller,</hi> as Governour ever after. How diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon this is, let any judge that know reaſon, that know the paſſages, that know Captain <hi>Stones</hi> temper.</p>
            <p>At ſuch time as <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Claiborn</hi> came into <hi>Maryland,</hi> and had compacted to take the Government out of the hands of Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> after he had notice of the power they had gathered, he likewiſe impowered himſelf for defence, and was in poſſibility to have cut <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Claiborn</hi> and all off, but thoſe few Papiſts that were in <hi>Maryland</hi> (for indeed they are but few) importunatly perſwaded Governour <hi>Stone</hi> not to fight, left the cry againſt the Papiſts (if any hurt were done) would be ſo great, that many miſchiefs would enſue, wholly referring themſelves to the will of God, and the Lord Protectors determination; &amp; although the Proteſtant party with indignation to be ſo fooled, ſubmitted to what their Governour was perſwaded to do, yet could not but complaine in that particular againſt the cowardize of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>After they had diſpoſſeſt Governour <hi>Stone</hi> of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and had by promiſes to diſ-bandon their party, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to do the like, they preſented him with a draught for reſignation under his hand, which when he refuſed, their whole party upon notice given, on a ſudden returned, to the aſtoniſhment of himſelf, and affrightment of his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and required perenitorily to ſubſcribe to what they had written, which he did, ſaying, It matters not what it is, I will, being thus enforced, write what ye will have me, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be binding nor valid; Lo here the obſervance of <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Claiborns</hi> promiſes, and after this they would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52149:4"/>
him as Governour from them, which with ſcorn he refuſed; nor did Governour <hi>Stone</hi> ever in his own eſteem, nor in the eyes of thoſe that had been faithfull to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, look on himſelf as leſſe or otherwiſe than Governour, nor ever received other title, how be it he ceaſed to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he heard further from <hi>England</hi>; yet in <hi>Heamans</hi> his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aboard that Ship which he calls himſelf Commander of, Governour <hi>Stone,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Hatton</hi> both, had ſome words with Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi> the new-made Commander, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their injurious aſſuming of the Government, and taking away of the Records, threatning, that unleſſe they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them again, they would compell them away. How then did he diſ-own his Government? and for him to point to <hi>Fuller</hi> as Governour, had not only been baſe, but ridiculous; for neither <hi>Fuller</hi> himſelf (untill after their murtherous aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinations) nor the Commiſſion he had from <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> did own or make him ſo; for after Governour <hi>Stone</hi> refuſed to derive or meddle with power from <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Claiborn,</hi> they erected no Governour at all, but gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ten men, <hi>Fuller</hi> being firſt in that Commiſſion, to be conſervators of the peace, untill further order; then how is <hi>Heamans</hi> relation true?</p>
            <p>He next after ſome frivolous relations proſecutes his feigned narration of what his Governour <hi>Fuller</hi> (for untill <hi>Heamans</hi> made him one he was never any) had done in his abſence, what Meſſages he had received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Governor, how obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he was to the ſupreme command of <hi>Fuller,</hi> how carefull to follow his Merchants buſineſſes, and yet how charitable and relenting to thoſe poor-diſtreſſed ſouls that begged his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. — <hi>Hear this O ye Heavens</hi>!</p>
            <p>At ſuch time as Captain <hi>Samuel Tilman,</hi> (a man ever to be honoured) arrived into <hi>Maryland,</hi> he repaired to Governour <hi>Stone,</hi> acquainting him, that the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> had not loſt his Countrey as was bruted abroad, and brought him ſome inſtructions and certainties of his Highneſſes owning him the ſaid <hi>Stone</hi> for Governour, and when he was reproved by one Captain <hi>John Smith,</hi> then High Sheriff, for giving Captaine <hi>Stone</hi> the frequent appellation of Governour, he replyed, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52149:4"/>

            <p>You can in nothing deal truly, the Letter you pretend you received, my ſelf writ, I procured another, now happily arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to tranſcribe it, which the Governour ſigned, the contents whereof were, That he had been informed upon ſight of a Letter pretended to come from you, that you intended ſome diſturbance in the Province, and had promiſed Mr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> the aſſiſtance of your Ship, Ammunition and Men, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived it was a forgery, and you abuſed, than that any ſuch things really were, and hoped you came for a peaceable Trade, and to follow your imployers buſineſſe, and not to meddle with the differences of the Country, promiſing you all encouragement and juſtice that could poſſibly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and earneſtly intreating, that if you had any ſuch reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you would declare it, which had you done, and not treacherouſly coloured it over with promiſes to wait on the Governour, he had retired, no blood had been ſpilt.</p>

            <p>Concerning the firing of your Ship (I ſpeak to the abuſed World, not to <hi>Heamans</hi>) he knows already what I writ is true, that at tryall of the Governour and Councell, one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Findall</hi> upon examination did acknowledge, that after <hi>Heamans</hi> Treachery to ſhoot at them having diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an enemy, he undantedly told them that himſelf, could he have compaſſed it, would have fired his Ship.</p>
            <p>But how prettily do they forge? <hi>Fuller</hi> he ſayes informed him that Captain <hi>Stone</hi> intended to fire his Ship, and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute between the Hireling and the Maſter muſt be taken as a truth, and come likewiſe to the Preſſe, and yet <hi>Heamans</hi> and they bargained before: Here, if it had been truth, you again ſhew your ſelf a fool, to ingage becauſe <hi>Fuller</hi> affrighted you.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould Captain <hi>Stone</hi> think of firing your Ship, had you not been a declared enemy? or if he had ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, why did he by Letter addreſſe himſelf to you to ſtand Newter? before this addreſſe <hi>Fuller</hi> and yee fomented theſe

The cauſe of your Seaman <hi>Helies</hi> running away, I know not, but have been informed the Fellow was of an honeſt temper, and that your fantaſtick domineerings was the cauſe he rather choſe to loſe his Voyage, than longer to continue under you. In your whole relation of commands and arguments between you and your imployers, you ſo impudently juggle, that you raiſe both laughter and anger in me; I ſhall not ſwell this to deſcant on each frivolous paſſage.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52149:9"/>By this it appeares how great care hath been by His Highneſſe uſed to prevent blood-ſhed, yet nothing will prevaile, and although by this in appeares that <hi>Bennets</hi> pretended power ceaſed, and any derived from him, yet will not <hi>Leo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strong,</hi> the Munkle-Agent of Providence (as he calls himſelf) ceaſe to be an Agent, but will juſtle this high command and revocation; he peradventure at laſt will pretend his deafneſſe, that he never heard it, but cannot alleage blindneſſe, for he had and ſhall again ſee what it is.</p>
            <p>Were not their actions very juſtifiable when they ſhold keep men in priſon untill they ſhould ſubmit to an Oath impoſed on them, never to write for <hi>England,</hi> or to the Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> what had been done? and ſuffer none to depart for <hi>England</hi> but what got away by ſtealth? my ſelf being proſcribed by Proclamation, and a great reward for him that ſhould bring in my head, yet was I never in armes, nor never was an Inſtigator againſt any of them in all theſe hurliburlies. We have many authentick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies diſcovering all their actions and proceedings, which are too voluminous to be inſerted into an Anſwer to ſuch an Ideot as the Commander of the <hi>Golden Lion</hi>; we hereby endeavour to give you onely a hint that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> hath abuſed the World with his Pamphlet, not a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable whereof is truth; how he hath deluded his owners with pretence of his care; how he hath ſpurned at and belied the Supreme Authority; how he hath intruded himſelf without any lawfull call, into the Seat of Juſtice, and there acted the part of a bloody and aggravating Murtherer, condemning Innocents and trampling on the ſouls of them he hath betrayed to death, for without his combination nothing of this had happened, and our ſelves had without rigor, without blood-ſhed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Obedience to the Supreme Command of His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under the Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> whom we with all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity proclamed, and under whoſe protection we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52149:10"/>
as our Soveraign Lord; iſſuing out generall Pardons in commemoration of that great and happy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>
            <p>And therefore we do and ſhall juſtly charge this <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with all the blood ſpilt in our Province, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Author, with all the ruines, the baniſhments, the ſequeſtrations of Eſtates, and the heart-breaking griefs he hath yeelded our Wifes and Children, to whom if ever we return again, it is through many dangers and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</p>
            <p>For the cry of <hi>Hey for St. Maries, hey for two Wives,</hi> if any rude Souldier in thoſe of any other termes were abuſive, it muſt not colour your matchination, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by no order of the Governours, nor from the mouthes of any of quality, themſelves were civill and atractive, nor was ever any party afoot without ſome abſurd expreſſion, or diſordered language; but theſe are weak flouriſhes, and will only bear you out in weak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes.</p>
            <p>Your obſervation of Captain <hi>Stones</hi> dejection, and his renunciation of the Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> the dead-heartedneſs of the Priſoners, being onely affirmed by your ſelf, is of as little credit as any thing elſe you have related; nor are you and your compacted theeviſh Ships company, to be evidences one for another, and no better than Theeves and Murtherers, to juſtifie you you have none; the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rejoycing you mention, is no otherwiſe than ſuch prayers and rejoycings as Theeves and Gamſters at or after their enterpriſes uſe, and as acceptable to God; but ſeeing <hi>Heamans</hi> was a Judge to condemn, and now is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Writer, I ſhall no longer dwell on <hi>Heamans</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I ſhall conclude with that fearful wo denounced by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> againſt ſuch as you are,
