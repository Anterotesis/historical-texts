         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

such a harmony in both their motions, that though in quantitie
they differ farre, they agree in qualitie: and though the one was
made somewhat before the other, yet are they so like, that they

               <note place="margin">The siluer age</note> was worse then the former: the change
of mettalls brought in the change of maners: for now men pluckd

the Seasons, into quarters, moneths, weekes, dayes and

Princes did now by course rule the year:<note place="margin">4<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> seasons of the yeare.</note> two of them milde, two

full of beautie: the other two were hard fauour'd, dogged,
addicted to melancholly, to diseases, to hate mankinde, to hurt the
earth, and to rob both of all, that the former two had giuen
to them. This <hi>Siluer-age</hi> of the worlde, was the worlds Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and therfore like a childe it grew wayward and inconstant:
It was apt to fall out, and soone to be pleased: as you may see the

men dare not encounter, So in this second playe vppon the great
<hi>Theater</hi> of the worlde, men shewed like shepheards (Simple) they
had power to doe hurt, but not a will to doe it: a care they had
more to prouide for them-selues, then to iniurie others. If this
siluerthred of mans life had still bene spun, man had liued in a

and so at length into a loue of them, beeing rather deceiued
with the goodly shapes they carryed, then delighted with their

            <p>This was the lustie age of the world, when men knewe their
strengthes, and had desire to trie them: their veines were full of
blood and itched to be let out: but warre was not yet begotten,

            <p>With this ill-fauoured hag came enuie into the worlde: they
both are twins, and both looke like Staruelings: in bodies they
somewhat resemble one another, but differ in mindes, for the one
couets to haue all to herselfe, the other cares for nothing: but
pines away to the bare bones, with very griefe and madnesse, to
see another inioy any thing.</p>
            <p>The last of these two furies (Enuie) was begotten by a player,

Presently vpon this, priuate quarels were first pickt, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

who had stood so many yeares vnshaken and vndishonoured,

bread and salt, keeping their state in the middle of the board. The
roome it selfe was not sumptuous but hansome, of indifferent
bignes, but not very large: the windowes were spread with
hearbs, the chimney drest vp with greene boughes, and the floore
strewed with bulrushes, as if some lasse were that morne to be

By this time, the fumes of Ale which had distempered her

her lookes and speech shewing that she did not now dlssemble,

for her <hi>Discouerie,</hi> counselled her to change her discomfortable
<hi>Lodging,</hi> and to dwell in a place more inhabited (which she

               <p>Looking therefore with more pearcing eies into the <hi>Country-life,</hi>
I began to hate it worse then (before) I loued it, I fell to
dispraise it faster then euer I did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mend it. For I found it full
of care, and full of craft: full of labour, and yet full of penurie;
I saw the poore husbandman made a slaue to the rich farmer,
the farmer racked by his landlord: I saw that couetousnesse
made deere yeares when she had fullest barnes; and to curse
plentie for being liberal of her blessings. I had heard of no sinne
in the Cittie but I met it in the village; nor any <hi>Vice</hi> in the
tradesman, which was not in the ploughman. All places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being haunted with euill Spirrits, I forsooke the fields &amp;
the Mountaines<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and tooke my iourney back again to the citie
whose customes (both good and bad) I desired to be acquainted
with. It was my fortune to trauell so late, that the Moone had
climed vp to the very top of Midnight, before I had entrance
into the gates of the Citie, which made me make the more hast

aske him why with such a Iangling and balling, and beating
at Mens doores, he went about to waken either poore men
that were ouer-wearied with labour, or sick men that had

his walking vp and downe in the night time, a preuention to
the Cittie oftentimes of much and many dangerous fires. I
liked wel that thus he praised himselfe, because in those praises
lay the commendation of an honourable, ciuill, and politicke

some other stoppe force them to stay, and to runne against their
kinde; for without <hi>Cater Trea,</hi> 5. or 9. you know can neuer
come. Here some may imagine, that by this meanes he y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> hath
the first Dice in his hand, may strip all that play at the Table of
their money; but this must be their helpe. An odde diecalled a
<hi>Flat Cater Trea,</hi> (and no other number) is to be ready at hand,
for granting the <hi>Trea</hi> and <hi>Cater</hi> to be alwaies vpon the one die,
then is there no chance vpon the other die, but may serue to
make 5 or 9. and so cast forth and lose all.</p>
               <p>The Cheater therefore marketh well the <hi>Flat,</hi> and bendeth
a great part of his studie to learne when he is abroad, for so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g
as that is stirring, he will neuer cast at much: the shift which
<pb facs="tcp:16563:22"/>
a <hi>Cheater</hi> is driuen to, in conueying the <hi>Flat</hi> in and out, is a
notable <hi>cunning,</hi> and in their trade is calld <hi>Foysting;</hi> which is
nothing else but a fleight to carry <hi>Dice</hi> easily in the hand so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as the <hi>Foyster</hi> listeth; so that when either he or his partner
casteth the <hi>Dice,</hi> the <hi>Flat</hi> comes not abroad till he hath made a
<hi>Great hand,</hi> otherwise the <hi>Flat</hi> is still sure to be <hi>One,</hi> vnlesse
the <hi>Cheater</hi> of purpose suffers the silly <hi>Nouices,</hi> with whome
he playes, to cast in a hand or two to giue them courage and to
liue in hope of winning.</p>
               <p>The damnable <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Quarrells</hi> that waite at the table
of <hi>Gamesters,</hi> are occasion that many men forbeareto venture
mony in those sports, who otherwise would play<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the <hi>Cheater</hi>
therefore (being a cunning obseruer in all fashions) wil seldome
sweare (if he haue gotten a <hi>Gul</hi> into his company whome he is
loath to anger for feare he loose him) and as seldome swagger,
but wil rather put vp an open wrong, then by a foolish braule to
breake off the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pany and so hinder himselfe and his consort of
purchase: But if he sweare, you would take him for a puritane,
for his oaths are <hi>Of honestie, Of troth, by Saint Martin. &amp;c.</hi>
And take this note, that when he sweares affirmatiuely, he
means alwaies the contrary. As for example, if I say vnto you
when the <hi>Dice</hi> come to your hands, <hi>Of honestie cast at al,</hi> my
meaning is, you shall cast at the table, or else at very little: or
if when one being stript out of all his mony, offer to pawne a
<hi>Ring</hi> or a <hi>Iewell,</hi> and I sweare by <hi>Saint Martin</hi> I thinke it is
fine gold, then do I mean that it is pure copper, and so of the
rest: He that is drawne in to venture his money, is (amongst
this cursed brotherhood of <hi>Cheaters</hi>) tearmed a <hi>Cosen,</hi> and is
handled so kindly, as if he were a Cosen indeed: if he once set
in a foote, and that they fall to <hi>Hunt</hi> him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> then al the craft is to
make the <hi>Cony</hi> sweate, that is to say, so wisely to handle him,
that he may haue a desire more and more to play and to keepe
company; yet so warily to increase this appetite in him that
he <hi>Smoake</hi> not the <hi>Cheater,</hi> which is, that he smell not what
knauerie is bent against him and so slip the coller like a <hi>Hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d,</hi>
and shake off the company for euer.</p>
               <p>At the taking vp of a <hi>Cosen,</hi> the first <hi>Veny</hi> that a <hi>Cheater</hi>
giues him, is to learne before he play what store of <hi>Bit</hi> he hath
in his <hi>Bay,</hi> that is, what mony he hath in his purse, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:16563:23"/>
it be in great <hi>Cogges</hi> or small: that is in gold or siluer, and
at what game he will soonest stoope; for that being knowne, his
humor is fed, and he is choked with the meat he loues best. For
some that will not play a groat at <hi>Nouum,</hi> will loose a hundred
pound at <hi>Hazard,</hi> and he that will not loose a shilling at <hi>Dice,</hi>
will play away his patrimony at Cardes: for which cause the
<hi>Cheater</hi> furnisheth himselfe for all voyages, but especially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
for fine <hi>Cheates,</hi> and to atchieue which with more ease,
he acquaints himselfe with Dice-makers, that worke in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
(U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Dice makers,</hi> arme the <hi>Cheater</hi> with the foresaide 14 wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and then he is a <hi>Cheater compleat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One notable policy is (as a <hi>Rule</hi>) set downe in this <hi>Schoole</hi>
of <hi>cheating,</hi> &amp; that is, <hi>A Cheater neuer discouereth the secrets
of his Art to any,</hi> vnlesse it be to such a one who being left by
his parents rich in money and possessions, hath to the musicke
of square rafling bones danced so long, that he hath danced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into the company of beggers, and is brought to such want
and misery, that he would leaue no stone vnturned to finde a
pennie vnder it. Such a wretch is instructed in those <hi>Villanies,</hi>
by which he himselfe hath bene wrought to infamy: the poyson
y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> once he swallowed doth he now cast vp to kill others with it.
Neither doth the <hi>Cheater</hi> bestow this learning vpon his yong
Scholler, out of a commiseration of his low estate, but onely to
make vse of him, euen in the height of his extremitie. His <hi>lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man</hi> therefore doth he make him, and because the <hi>Cheater</hi>
is happily a man so noted in al companies, that few or none wil
venture money where he playes, the <hi>Nouice</hi> is taught to play
his schollers prize, whilst the other stands by and lookes on, yet
so, that the <hi>Cheater</hi> hath the sw√©etnes of the gaines. The <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:16563:24"/>
seemes to be a landed man his part is to second what the taker
begins, and to giue countenance to the act.</p>
               <p>4 The <hi>Barnard</hi> is the chiefe player, for he counterfeits ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts in one, and is now a drunken man, anon in another
humour, and shifts himselfe into so many shapes, only to blind
the Cozen, and to feede him with more delight, the more easily
to beguile him.</p>
               <p>5 The <hi>Rutter</hi> is as arrant a knaue as the rest, his part is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
when hee hath begun a fray with his owne shadowe,
whilst the rest that haue made a younger Brother of the poore
Cozen, steale out of sight. Now to the countrie it selfe: The
Prologue of which if it goe off well, there is good hope all shall
end well: All the cunning thereof is how to begin, and to do
that, the Taker studies his part at his fingers endes. The
Stage on which he plaies his prologue is eitherin <hi>Fleet-street,</hi>
the <hi>Strand,</hi> or in <hi>Paules,</hi> and most commonly in the after-noon,
when Countrie Clyents are at moste leasure to walke in those
places<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or for dispatching of their businesse, trauell from Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer

               <p>In this heate of running to and fro, if a plaine Fellowe
well and cleanely apparelled, either in home-spunne Russet

giues the on-set vpon my olde <hi>Penny-father.</hi> Sir, God saue
you: you are welcome to London, how doe all our good friends
in the Countrie? I hope they be well: the <hi>Russetting</hi> amazed
at these salutations of a stranger, replies: Sir, all our friendes
in the countrie are in health, but pra'y pardon me, I know you
not beleeue it: No (answers the Taker) are you not a Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire

and he giues him more line to play with: if he say no, then
the Taker hath about with another weapon, &amp; sweares sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In good sooth sir I know your face, &amp; am sure wee haue bene
merie together, I pra'y (if I may beg it without offence) bestow
your name vpon mee, and your dwelling place. The innocent
man, suspecting no poison in this gilded cup, tels him presently
his name and abiding, by what Gentleman he dwels. &amp;c. which
<pb facs="tcp:16563:24"/>
being done, the <hi>Taker</hi> for thus interrupting him in his way,
and for the wrong in mistaking him for another) offers a quart
of wine: if the <hi>Cozen</hi> bee such an asse to goe into a Tauerne,
then hee is sure to bee Unckled, but if hee smack my <hi>Taker,</hi>
and smell Gun-powder traines, yet wil not be blown vp, they
part fairly, and then to the <hi>Verser</hi> goes the <hi>Taker,</hi> discouering
what he hath done, and deliuers the mans name, countrie, and
dwelling to the <hi>Verser,</hi> who boldly stepping to him, or crossing
the way to meete him full in the face, takes acquaintance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
of him, salutes him by his name, inquires how such and
such Gentlemen doe, that dwell in the same towne by him, and
albeit, the <hi>Honest Hobnaile-wearer,</hi> can by no meanes bee
brought to remember this new friend, yet will he nill he, to the
Tauerne he sweares to haue him, and to bestowe vpon him the
best wine in London.</p>
               <p>Diuers other pullies (if these two faile) haue they to drawe
simple men into their company, as by dropping a shilling in the
open way, which being taken vp in the Countrie-mans sight,
must be spent in wine, because he shall haue his halfe part, or
by intreating him to step into a Tauerne till the <hi>Verser</hi> haue
writ a word or two into the Countrie, which h√©e must carrie
to his friendes, offering the Cozen a shilling for his paines. But
the conclusion of all is, that if they thinke his bag is well lined
with siluer, to the Tauerne by one subtill hooke or other, they
will pull him, where being set with the <hi>Verser,</hi> and the <hi>Taker,</hi>
and wine called for: In comes the <hi>Barnard</hi> stumbling into the
Roome, as if it were by chaunce, seeming to be halfe drunke:
and crying the companye mercie for beeing so bolde with them,
they modestly answere no hurt is done, and aske him if hee
will drinke with them? hee takes their offer, and sweares to
pay for a pinte of Wine, which they by no meanes will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Barnard</hi> telling them he has money for what he cals,
and vsing phrases fit for a drunken man, out flies some 20. or
40. Angels on the board, which he puts vp presently againe and
saies, s√©eing they will not suffer him to paye for a pinte, hee will
play at cardes for it with any one of them at a new game which
he learnt but now, with the losse onelye of a pot of Ale. The
rest of his consort (making as though what they doe is to bee
<pb facs="tcp:16563:25"/>
rid of him are content to play for a pinte and no more. The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
or the <hi>Verser</hi> is the man must play with him, the Cards
are fetcht, <hi>Mumchaunce</hi> or <hi>Decoy</hi> is the game: the first wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is wine, the second two pence in money, from two pence
they rise to a shilling from that to a pound, and hauing drawn
some good store of gold from the <hi>Barnard,</hi> the <hi>Cozen</hi> (allured
with the sweetnes of gaine, and hope of winning, seeing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
halfe drunke, as he imagines) is offered to be half in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is woon: he stoops to this lure, but the bush is so well
beaten by these subtill fowlers, that in the end, all the birds are
flowne out of the Cozens hand, and hee hath not one pennye
left him in his purse: if then he smell the knauerie, and fall to
calling for a Constable, swearing the drunken rascall hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened
him (for the <hi>Barnard</hi> you must knowe carries away all
the money) then enters the <hi>Rutter,</hi> who picking some idle qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell

sharing of the purchase in another Tauerne) is the <hi>Epilogue</hi>
to their commedie, but the first entrance to the poore countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

               <p>These Comedians strowte likewise vp and down the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

<hi>Brainford, Kingston, Croyden, Rumford,</hi> &amp; such other places
neerest London vppon the Market daies onely, and at the ende

of this crew ouertake them in ryding, and light at some town
of purpose to mend his girt, to remooue a shooe of his horse, or
vppon any other excuse, intreating the company (with whome
he is newly acquainted) to stay and drink a pot with him in the
meane time. And in these countrie voyages doe they saile by
other points of the compasse, the windes are not so boisterous,
nor the Seas so rough as the former, for heere is there neither
one that plaies the drunkard nor any that swaggers, but these

either with them who play with him that are as crafty knaues

to stoope to the blow the sooner. Besides, if any honest

feare to haue the worst and suspect the others play to be better

giue such a moisture to the bank, that hee who offers to strike a

the moysture of the Bancke hinders the proportion of his Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

This is their phrase, this the Rhethoricke of our English
Rogues and this (vpon aduice or ocasion) they varrie, putting
out some words, &amp; in their stead inuenting others more new.
This was none of the language that was spoken at the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of tongues, but this is a meere confusion in it selfe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you haue no Dictionaries to giue you the English of these
wordes, you shall haue the selfe same companions speake the
same Dialogue in their owne naturall language.</p>
