            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diſſwades from, is from

Theſe truths, are preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
Firſt, that the holy

as the ſecond Perſon is
in Chriſt man;<note place="margin">The ſpirit in us.</note> for then the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17917:21"/>

only: for ſo he is in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
nor yet is in us onely
by ſtirring up holy moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but he is in us myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
and as Temples dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to himſelfe: Chriſts
humane nature is the firſt
temple, wherein the Spirit
dwels; and then we become
temples by union with him.<note place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, and in us.</note>
The difference betwixt his
being in Chriſt &amp; us, is, that
the Spirit dwels in Chriſt in
a fuller meaſure; by reaſon
that as a head he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
ſpirit into all his
members. Secondly, the
Spirit is in Chriſt intirely
without any thing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
the Spirit alwayes
findes ſomething in us, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17917:22"/>
is not his owne, but readie
to croſſe him. Thirdly, the
Spirit is in us derivatively
from Chriſt, as a fountaine
we receive grace at ſecond
hand, anſwerable to grace
in him.<note place="margin">How the Spirit was in <hi>Adam</hi> in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> The holy Ghoſt
was in <hi>Adam</hi> before his
fall, immediately; but
now hee is in Chriſt, firſt,
and then for Chriſt in us,
as members of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
whereof Chriſt is the
head: &amp; it is well for us that
he dwels firſt in Chriſt, and
then in us: for from this it
is that his communion with
us is inſeparable, as it is
from Chriſt himſelfe, with
whom the Spirit makes us
one. The holy Spirit dwels
in thoſe that are Chriſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another manner then in
others in whom he is in,<note place="margin">How in carnall men.</note> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17917:22"/>
ſome ſort by common
gifts; but in his owne, he is
in them as holy, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them holy, as the ſoule
is in the whole body in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of divers operations;
but in the head onely as it
underſtandeth, and from
thence ruleth the whole
bodie: ſo the holy Ghoſt is
in his, in regard of more
noble operations, and his
perſon is together with his
working, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally;
and though the
whole man be the temple
of the holy Ghoſt, yet the
ſoule eſpecially, and in the
ſoule the very Spirit of our
minds, as moſt ſuteable to
him being a Spirit. Whence
the Apoſtle wiſhes <hi>the
grace of Chriſt to be with
our Spirits,</hi> the beſt of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17917:23"/>
delight moſt in the beſt
of us, which is our ſpirits: in
the Temple the further
they went, all was more
holy, till they came to the
holy of holieſt. So in a
Chriſtian the moſt inward
part the ſpirit is,<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt dwels not in us as in ordinary houſes, but as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The holy ſpirit makes all holy, where ever he comes.</note> as it were
the holie of holies, where
incenſe is offered to God
continually. What a mercy
is this that he that hath the
heaven of heavens to dwell
in, will make a dungeon to
be a temple; a priſon to be a
paradiſe; yea an hell to bee
an heaven? Next to the love
of Chriſt in taking our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and dwelling in it; we
may wonder at the love of
the holy Ghoſt, that will
take up his reſidence in
ſuch defiled ſoules.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17917:23"/>
is that the holy
Spirit being in us after hee
hath prepared us for an
houſe for himſelfe to dwell
in,<note place="margin">The ſpirit a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and to take up his reſt

in all our doubts, a
Comforter in all diſtreſſes,
a Solicitor to all dutie, a
guide in the whole courſe
of our life, untill we dwell
with him for ever in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
unto which his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here in us doth tend: he
goeth before us as Chriſt
did in the pillar of the
cloud and fire before the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third ground is, that

            <p>

is, that we may and

and circumſpection, ſo to

courſe, that we ſhall
not grievouſly offend the

ſpirits. We may avoid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
laſhes and blowes, and
many an heavy day which
we may thanke our ſelves
for, and God delighteth in
the proſperity of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and would have us
walk in the comforts of the
holy Ghoſt, and is grieved
when we grieve him: that
then hee muſt grieve us to
prevent worſe griefe. The
due and proper act of a
Chriſtian in this life is to
pleaſe Chriſt, and to bee
comfortable in himſelfe,
and ſo to be fitted for all
ſervices.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, it
is eaſie to conceive the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive
from grieving the
holy ſpirit. For the better
unfolding of which, we wil

wherein we ſpecially grieve
the Spirit. Thirdly, how
we may know when wee
have grieved the Spirit.
Fourthly, what courſe we
ſhould take to prevent this
griefe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt: The holy
Ghoſt cannot properly be
grieved in his own perſon,<note place="margin">What it is to grieve the Spirit.</note>
becauſe griefe implyes a
defect of happineſſe in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
that we wiſh remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
It implyes a defect in
foreſight, to prevent that
which may grieve. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
paſſion, which is
ſoon raiſed up, and ſoone
laid downe: GOD
is not ſubject to change;
it implyes ſome want
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17917:25"/>
of power to remove that
which we feele to be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance:
and therefore it is
not beſeeming the Majeſtie
of the Spirit thus to bee
grieved. Wee muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

we are ſayd to grieve God,
when we doe that which is

we are ſaid to deſtroy our
weake brother, when wee
do that which he taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at, is apt to miſleade
him, and ſo to deſtroy him.
Secondly, we grieve the
Spirit, when wee doe that
whereupon the Spirit doth
that which grieved perſons
doe; that is, retireth and
ſheweth diſlike, and returns
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17917:26"/>
griefe againe. Thirdly,
though the paſſion of griefe
be not in the holy Ghoſt,
yet there is in his holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a pure diſplicence and
hatred of ſinne, with ſuch a
degree of abhomination as
though it tend not to the
deſtruction of the offender,
yet to ſharpe correction: ſo
that <hi>griefe</hi> is eminently in
the <hi>hatred</hi> of God in ſuch
a manner as becomes him.
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as in us.</note> wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of the Spirit as hee
is in himſelfe in heaven,
and as hee dwels and

as hidden in himſelfe,
and as revealed in his Son,
and in his word; and as we
may conceive of Chriſt as
the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17917:26"/>
ſo likewiſe of the holy
Ghoſt as in himſelfe, and
as in us, God, in the perſon
of his Sonne: and his Sonne
as man, and as Miniſter of
Circumciſion, was grieved
at the rebellion and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his owne people.
The holy Spirit, as in us
grieveth with us, witneſſeth
with us, rejoyceth in us,
and with us; and the ſpirit
in himſelfe, and as he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in us hath the ſame
name, as the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the comforts of
the Spirit are called the
ſpirit; even as the beames
of the Sunne ſhining on the
earth are called the Sunne:
and when we let them in,
or ſhut them out, wee are
ſaid to let in or ſhut out the
Sunne. We may grieve the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17917:27"/>
ſpirit, when we grieve him,
as working grace, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
comfort to us: the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Spirit have the
name of the Spirit whence
they come, as the Spirit of
love and wiſdome. Again,
our owne ſpirits, ſo farre as
ſanctified, are ſaid to be the
Spirit of God: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, not in it ſelf, but
in <hi>Noah</hi> did ſtrive with the
old world; and ſo we grieve
the Spirit, when we grieve
our owne or other mens
ſpirits, ſo farre as they are
ſanctified by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now the ſpirit as in us
worketh in us,<note place="margin">How the Spirit worketh in us.</note> according to
the principles of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as underſtanding and
free creatures, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the free manner of
working proper to man;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17917:27"/>
and doth not alwaies put
forth an abſolute preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power, but dealeth
with us by way of gentle
and ſweet motions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions;
and leaveth it in
our freedome to imbrace
or refuſe theſe inferiour
workes of the Spirit: and
our hearts tell us it is in our
power to entertaine or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the motions: which
when we doe in our owne
apprehenſion, we churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offend the ſpirit, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to draw us to better
waies; and wee cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies
judge of this, but
as grieving. God in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with men, puts his
cauſe into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that by
our prayers and otherwiſe,
wee may helpe or hinder
him againſt the mighty.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17917:28"/>
And Chriſt puts himſelfe
into our hands in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and in the poore;
counts himſelfe regarded
or neglected in them: ſo the
holy Spirit puts as it were
his delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our power, and
counts when we entertaine
his motions of grace or
comfort, we entertain him;
and when we refuſe them,
wee grieve him. And the
holy Ghoſt will have us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
our refuſing of his
motion, to be a refuſing of
him; and not onely a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of him, but of the Son,
and of the Father, whoſe
ſpirit he is. Oh, if we did
but conſider how high the
ſlighting of a gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reaches, even to the
ſlighting of God himſelfe:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17917:28"/>
it would move us to give

eſpecially, when they are

the Spirit to enlighten, to
ſoften, to quicken, and to
ſanctifie; when wee give
content to Sathan, it puts
the holy Ghoſt out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
The office of the holy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17917:30"/>
Ghoſt is likewiſe to bee a
comforter: it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but grieve the holy
Spirit, when <hi>the conſolations
of the Almightie</hi> are either
forgotten, or <hi>ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

by cavelling objections:
They take pleaſure to move
objections, inſtead of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

reaſons that might raiſe
them to comfort: and take
Satans part againſt the
holy Spirit, and their owne
ſpirit: and againſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are miniſtred,
by thoſe that are more
skilfull in the wayes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17917:31"/>
then themſelves.
How little beholding is
the holy Spirit to ſuch,
who pleaſe themſelves in a
ſpirit of oppoſition? and
yet ſo ſweet is this holy
Spirit, that after long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hee overcomes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and makes them at
length with ſhame, lay
their hands upon their
mouthes, and bee ſilent.
Yet that is one reaſon they
ſticke ſo long in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and are kept ſo long
under <hi>the Spirit of bondage.</hi>
Thoſe likewiſe cannot but
grieve the Comforter, that
leave his comforts, and
ſeeke for other Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
that thinke there is not
comfort enough in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but will bowe downe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17917:31"/>
to the world, ſuch as linger
after the liberties of the
fleſh, after ſtolne waters;
as if God kept houſe not
good enough for them. It
is a great diſparagement to
preferre huskes before the
proviſion of our fathers
houſe, and to die (like
fiſh out of their proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
if wee want carnall
comforts. But above all,
they grieve the Spirit moſt,
that have had deepeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Spirit;
and have received greateſt
favours from the Spirit.
When the holy Ghoſt
comes in love, and wee
have given way to him to
enlighten our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and when in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
wee have taſted of
the good things of God,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17917:32"/>
that the promiſes are ſweet,
and the Goſpell is good.
When we have given ſuch
way to the Spirit, then
to uſe him unkindly; this
grieves the Spirit. Where
the holy ghoſt hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet up a light, but given
a taſt of heavenly things,
and yet we upon falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
will grow to a
diſtaſt, it cannot but grieve
the Spirit. And this makes
the <hi>ſinne againſt the holy
Ghoſt</hi> ſo deſperat, becauſe
there hath beene a ſtrong
conviction and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinnes of Profeſſors.</note>
Therfore of all ſinnes,
the ſinnes of Profeſſors of
Religion, grieve the Spirit
moſt; and of all Profeſſors
thoſe that have moſt means
of knowledge: becauſe
their obligations are dee-per,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17917:32"/>
and their ingagements grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The deeper the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath entred, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the griefe muſt needs be
in unlooſing. The offence
of friends, grieves more
than the injuries of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And therefore the
ſinnes that offend God
moſt, are committed within
the Church; where is the
greateſt ſinne of all, the ſin
againſt the holy Ghoſt
committed, but within the
Church? and where there is
the greateſt light, and
the greateſt meanes. Sinnes
againſt knowledg grieve
moſt, eſpecially, if there be a
malicious oppoſing: for
there can be nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
it. The malice of the
will maketh the ſinne of the
deeper die, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the ſpirit, as it is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17917:33"/>
Spirit of goodnes, &amp; hence
is it, that preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſins ſo
much grieve the ſpirit, for
by ſuch ſins we abuſe the
ſweeteſt Attribute of Gods
Spirit, his Goodneſſe, and
be therefore evill becauſe he

are either ſuch as are
1. Directly againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as when we will not
underſtand what we ſhould
doe, becauſe wee will not
doe what we underſtand:
ſuch put out the candle, that
they may ſinne with the
more freedome. This kind
of ignorance doth not free
from ſinne, but increaſeth
it: ſome men will not heare
the Word, nor reade good
Bookes, leſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17917:33"/>
ſhould bee awaked:
this affected ignorance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
the voluntarineſſe.
Againe, when we maintaine
untruths for any advantage,
knowing them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths;
as many learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
cannot but doe. What
a great indignity is it to the
Spirit of GOD to <hi>ſell the
truth,</hi> which we ſhould <hi>buy,</hi>
yea with the loſſe of our
lives: and to prefer the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of a baſe man, or ſome
gaine to our ſelves before a
glorious <hi>beame</hi> of GOD?
Other ſinnes if wee know
them to be ſinnes, are ſins
againſt knowledge, not ſo
directly,<note place="margin">2 Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</note> but collateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
yet this will bee the
chiefe aggravation, when
our conſciences are once
awaked, not ſo much that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17917:34"/>
we have ſinned, as that we
have ſinned againſt the
light, when the will hath
nothing to plead for it ſelfe,
but it ſelfe; it would, becauſe
it would, though it knew
the contrary. Involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
takes away ſomething
of the hainouſneſſe of ſinne:
when there is ignorance,
perturbation, or paſſion,
there is leſſe ſinne, and leſſe
grieving of the Spirit: but
when there are none of
theſe, but a man will ſinne,
becauſe he will; accounting
it a kinde of ſoveraignty to
have his will, this will prove
the moſt miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for not to have the will
regulated by him that is the
chiefeſt good, is the greateſt
perverſeneſſe, and will end
in deſperation.</p>

and Gods juſtice
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17917:37"/>
cannot better be ſatisfied,
than by puniſhing them
moſt againſt their wils,

            <p>In this reſpect it is,<note place="margin">Sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond Table in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they grieve moſt.</note> that

Though corrupt nature hath

Chriſtians indeed,
have their failings; but if a

that every day he intends

            <p>It is a dangerous grieving

countenance us in ſome

to make God of our mind,
that wee may go on with

This is your judgment, but

if men ſlight the

            <p>This grieves the holy

When men ſet upon

they will be guides, and

that when Gods Spirit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates

that aſide, the ſinne it ſelfe
of a godly man is leſſe, for
his temptations be ſtronger,

eager againſt him, and his
reſiſtance of ſinne greater;
all which doth abate the
hainouſneſſe of the guilt.
The more reſiſtance from
within, argues a ſtronger
party from within, in the
godly, the force of ſinne is
broken from within: take a
godly man at the worſt,
there is ſome worke of the
Spirit in him, that in ſome

Spirit without him: the holy
Spirit hath ſome hold in

him, by which he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him. A wicked man
proceeds from grieving to
quenching, and from
quenching to reſiſting. The
Spirit hath no party, no ſide

they can follow their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

            <p>Sometimes God leades

griefe proves medicinall;
the griefe which ſinne
breeds, conſumes the ſinne

They have that in them
whereby they hate the

whereas others hate the

doe, and love the ill which

Howſoever they are drawn

this is the way to make the

The walkes of Gods Spirit
are, in the meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hearing the Word
preached, and holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
one with another: the

therefore if we will have the

muſt attend upon the Word.
Men grieve the Spirit by
neglecting the Word, and
holy conference, &amp;c. It is
with the Word and Spirit,
as with the veynes and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17917:67"/>
arteries: the veynes have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
that as the veyns car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

carry the ſpirits to quicken

dead without the Spirit, and
therefore attend on the
Word; and then wait on the
Spirit to quicken the Word;
that both Word and Spirit
may guide us to life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Motions of this kinde
come from the Spirit: as it

in the world, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
brawles, and breaches.
What is the cauſe? a ſpirit
of envy, and oft times a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of pride. So men runne
into the danger of others,
by wronging them, what is
the cauſe? worldlineſſe,
baſe earthly-mindedneſſe.
Men thinke not of the root
of ſinne, but dwell upon
the act done, we ſhould be
led from the remote
ſtreames, to the Spring, and
ſourſe of all, and bewayle
that eſpecially.</p>
            <p>This care will be helped
by ſpirituall wiſedome,
whereby we may diſcerne
both wherein we <hi>have</hi> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Spirit, and wherein
for the time to come we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17917:71"/>
may. We cannot maintaine
friendſhip in perfect and
ſweet termes with any,
whoſe diſpoſition we know
not, what will pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
them; therefore we
ſhould ſtudy the nature and
delight of the Spirit, and
wherein we are prone both
to forget our ſelves and
the Spirit. We eſteeme not
much the friendſhip of
thoſe who are ſo much
friends to themſelves, as
they paſſe not much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friends be contented
or diſcontented. The Spirit
dwels moſt largely in that
heart that hath emptied it
ſelfe of it ſelfe: the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
felt not the ſweetneſſe of
<hi>Manna,</hi> till they had ſpent
their fleſh pots and other
proviſion of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17917:71"/>
of Gods Spirit is holy;
as it is holy, ſo delighteth
onely in holy Temples:
thoſe therefore that ſet up
any <hi>Idoll of jealouſie</hi> in their
ſoules againſt God, that do
not <hi>preſerve their veſſels in
holineſſe,</hi> cannot thinke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
communion with the
Spirit. The Spirit is jealous
of our affections, and will
have nothing ſet up in the
heart above God; though
the Spirit ſtoopes to dwell
in us, yet we muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the reſpect due to ſo
great a Superiour, but reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
entertaine what ever
comes from him. Reverence
and obedience is the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
due to a ſuperiour, and
where this diſtance is not
kept, a breach will follow.
We ſhould reverence our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17917:72"/>
ſelves for the ſpirits ſake,
and thinke our ſelves too
good for any baſe luſt to
lodge in; that heart that the
Spirit hath taken for it ſelfe,
ſhould turne off all contrary
motions with abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
what ſhould pride, and
envy, and paſſion doe in an
heart conſecrated to the
ſpirit of meekneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe?</p>
            <p>Vpon any breach,<note place="margin">Renew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> wee
muſt firſt looke by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repentance, and faith in
Chriſt, to renew our peace
with God, before wee can
expect the grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Spirit. For as the
Spirit commeth from the
Father and the Sonne, and
is procured by the death
and ſatisfaction of the Son
to the Father, without
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17917:72"/>
which, we could never have
expected the gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
ſo ſtill we muſt have an
eye to this ſatisfaction by
Chriſt, and reconciliation
through it, before we can
recover communion with
the Spirit, as being the beſt
fruit of the love of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
through Chriſt.
We ſee <hi>David</hi> in the 51.
Pſalme, firſt importunes
God for mercy againe and
againe, and then for the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and for the <hi>joy of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

            <p>And take heed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of our ſoules that may
grieve the Spirit of God:
ſome things come in to us
that grieve the Spirit; the
corruptions wee receive
from others: ſome things
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17917:73"/>
come out of our hearts that
grieves Gods Spirit, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
thoughts, &amp; ſpeeches,
that indeed is the ſcope of
this place, <hi>Let no corrupt
communication come out of
your mouthes, &amp;c.</hi> and then
follows, <hi>And grieve not the
holy Spirit of God.</hi> And after
againe he ſaith, <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
and wrath, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
be laid aſide;</hi> inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that one way of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spirit, is by ill and
corrupt language. We can
never talke with company
that is not ſpirituall, but
they will either vexe, and
grieve us, or taint, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
us; unleſſe it be in ſuch
exigences of our calling as
requires our converſe with
them. But I ſpeake of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
choyce of ſuch as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17917:73"/>
ſavour not good things.
Many men to pleaſe their

            <p>Let no man ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Here is
ado indeed, duty upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
this will make our life
troubleſome.</p>
            <p>The life of a Chriſtian
is an honourable,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
ſweet life: indeed
it requires the moſt care,
and watchfulneſſe of any
life in the world, being the
beſt life, it is begun here, and
accompliſhed in an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17917:74"/>
life in heaven. Nothing
in this world, neither our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
nor our favour with
great perſons, can be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
without watchfulneſſe:
and ſhall we thinke to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the chiefe happineſſe
of our ſoules without it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo many enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and within, that labour
to draw us into a curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
            <p>Therefore to ſtirre us up
to the practiſe of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">Motives not to grieve the Spirit.</note>
that we may give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to ſo ſweet a
gueſt, conſider what reaſon
we have, to regard the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and his motions, from
the good we have by them.</p>
            <p>The holy Spirit of God
is our guide: who will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
his guide? A ſweet
comfortable guide that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17917:74"/>
leades us through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
of this world; as
the cloud before the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
by day, and the pillar
of fire by night: ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
us to the heavenly
Canaan; if we grieve our
guide, we cauſe him to leave
us to our ſelves. The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
would not goe a ſteppe
further then God by his
Angell went before them.
It is in vaine for us to make
toward heaven without our
bleſſed guide; we cannot
doe, nor ſpeake, nor thinke
any thing that is holy and
good, without him: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is holy, and pious, it
growes not in our garden,
in our nature, but it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the
world ſo great and ſweet a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17917:75"/>
friend that will doe us ſo
much good as the Spirit, if
we give him entertainment.
Indeed he muſt rule, he will
have the keyes delivered to
him, we muſt ſubmit to his
government. And when he
is in the heart, he will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
by little and little all
high thoughts, rebellious
riſings, and deſpairing fears.
This ſhall be our happineſſe
in heaven, when we ſhall be
wholly ſpirituall, that <hi>God
ſhall be all in all;</hi> wee ſhall be
perfectly obedient to the
Spirit in our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
wils, and affections.
The Spirit will then dwell
largely in us, and will make
the roome where he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
ſweet, and lightſome,
and free, ſubduing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is contrary; and bring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17917:75"/>
fulneſſe of peace, and joy,
and comfort. And in the
meane time in what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſoever we are, we ſhall
have ſuteable helpe from
the Spirit. We are partly
fleſh, and partly ſpirit, God
is not all in all, the fleſh hath
a part in us, we are often in
afflictions, and under clouds.
Let us therefore prize our
fellowſhip with the Spirit.
For are we in darkeneſſe? he
is a Spirit of light: Are we
in deadneſſe of ſpirit? he is a
Spirit of life: Are we in a
diſconſolate eſtate? he is a
Spirit of conſolation: Are
we in perplexity, and know
not what to do? he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wiſedome: Are wee
troubled with corruptions?
He is a ſanctifying, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing,
a mortifying Spirit:

               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:17917:77"/>
in what condition ſoever we
are, he will never leave us,
till he hath raiſed us from
the grave, and taken full
poſſeſſion of body and ſoule
in heaven; he will prove a
comforter, when neither
friends, nor riches, nor any
thing in the world can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us. How carefull ſhould
we be to give contentment
to this ſweet Spirit of
God?</p>
            <p>No Chriſtian is ſo happy
as the watchfull Chriſtian
that is carefull of his duty,
and to preſerve his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God: for by entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, he is ſure to have
communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne. It is
the happieſt condition in
the world, when the ſoule
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17917:77"/>
is the Temple of the holy
Spirit; when the heart is as
the holy of holies, where
there be prayers, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
offered to GOD. The
ſoule is as it were an holy
Arke, the memory like the
pot of <hi>Mannah</hi> preſerving
heavenly truths. It is an
heavenly condition, a man
proſpers to heavenward,
when the Spirit of God is
with him. You know <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi>
when the Arke was
in his houſe, all thrived
with him: ſo while the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and his motions are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by us, we ſhall be
happy in life, happy in
death, happy to eternity.
For it is he</p>
            <p>By which you are ſealed to
the day of redemption.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſealeth this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17917:78"/>
grave admonition by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
taken from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
ſealing of them to the
day of redemption.</p>
            <p>We are all by nature in
bondage to ſinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
we all are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from ſinne by the firſt
comming of Chriſt, and are
to be redeemed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
by the ſecond.</p>
            <p>There is a day appointed
for this glorious worke.</p>
            <p>In the meane time GOD
would have us aſſured of it
aforehand.</p>
            <p>This aſſurance is by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>And this ſealing is by the
Spirit, none elſe need do it,
no meaner perſon can doe
it.</p>
            <p>And what reſpect is due
to the Spirit, for doing ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17917:78"/>
gracious a worke, that wee
grieve him not; and not
onely ſo, but that we inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſo to pleaſe him, as he
may with delight goe on
with this bleſſed work that
it hath pleaſed him to take
upon him.</p>
            <p>As the dutie is ſpirituall,
ſo the arguments that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
it are ſpirituall; and the
argument here is fetched
from that which hath a moſt
conſtraining force, love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the ſweeteſt fruit
of it, and the ſtability of it
ſealing, and ſealing to the
day of redemption, as if the
Apoſtle ſhould reaſon thus;
God the Father hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you to ſalvation by the

have the comfort of it in the

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17917:80"/>
promiſed to us, but fitted

prepareth no good for any

not only an outward autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing

and repreſentation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of him that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>The perſons ſealed are
firſt Chriſt, and then thoſe
that are given to Chriſt.
Chriſt is ſealed,</p>
            <p>1 By the Father,<note place="margin">The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt.</note> Chriſt
was ordained by him to be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17917:80"/>
a Saviour in our nature,
predeſtinate to be the head
of the Church. Wherefore
he often ſaith he came to do
his Fathers will. <hi>Him hath
the Father ſealed. Ioh.</hi> 6. 27.
anointing him, calling him,
ſetting him forth, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him by the ſpirit, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way fitting him with
all grace to be a Saviour.</p>
            <p>2 He was ſealed, by the
fulneſſe of the Godhead
dwelling in fleſh, abaſed,
and exalted for us, ſo as his
fleſh is the fleſh of the Son
of God, and his bloud the
<hi>bloud of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Sealed by a teſtimony
from heaven of all three
Perſons:<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28</note> by the <hi>Father, This
is my welbeloved Son:</hi> by the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> deſcending like
a dove, by himſelfe, to his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17917:81"/>
humane nature dwelling in
all fulneſſe in it. Chriſt is
ſealed by miracles done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and by him, by his
baptizing and inſtalling into
his office, and by giving
himſelf up to ſhed his bloud
for ſinne, by which bloud
the Covenant is eſtabliſhed
and ſealed.</p>
            <p>4 In being juſtified in the
ſpirit, being raiſed from the

be the Sonne of God mightily
with power,</hi> and then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
there for ever for
us, ſheweth not onely his
habilitie and willingneſſe
to ſave us, but that it is done
already: Wee may ſee all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17917:81"/>
what ever wee can looke

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtians are ſealed.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As Chriſt was ſealed and
fitted for us, ſo we are ſealed
and fitted for Chriſt. There
is a privy ſeale in predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
this is knowne onely
to God himſelfe: <hi>The Lord
knoweth who are his.</hi> And this

When firſt by his Spirit
hee convinceth us of what
wee are in our ſelves, and
of our curſed condition;
and thereby layeth us
low by ſorrow and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
for ſinne, as the

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17917:82"/>
pardon is more to us then a
Crowne; then we will wait
for mercy, and continue ſo,
and begge for mercy, and
that upon Chriſts own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
by denying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
any thing of our
owne, then Chriſt is Chriſt
unto us. Indeed after this, it
pleaſeth Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to open <hi>a doore of hope,</hi> and
give ſome hints of mercy,
and to let in ſome beames
of love; and withall, to raiſe
up the ſoule by a ſpirit of
faith, to cloſe with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mercy opened and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Spirit, whereby
the ſoule ſealeth to the truth
of the promiſe, <hi>Ioh. 3. Hee
that beleeveth hath ſet to his
ſeale that God is true.</hi> It is
ſtrange, that GOD ſhould
ſtoop ſo low as to receive
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17917:82"/>
(as it were) confirmation by
our beleefe: but thus GOD
condeſcends in the phraſe of
Scripture; As we are ſaid to
helpe God, <hi>curſe ye Meroz,
becauſe they came not to helpe
the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> God ſtoopes
to be helped by us, and to
have his truth, and power,
and goodneſſe ratified, and
confirmed by us, when we
beleeve the promiſe of God
in Chriſt (though it be by
the helpe of the Spirit) we
ſeale Gods truth. And then
God honoureth that ſealing
of ours, by the ſealing of
his Spirit; <hi>After you beleeved,
you were ſealed,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle;
that is, the gracious
love of Chriſt was further
confirmed to them. GOD
honours no grace ſo much
as faith; Why? becauſe it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17917:83"/>
honours God moſt of all
others; it gives GOD the
honour of his mercie, and
goodneſſe, and wiſedome,
and power, and of his truth;
eſpecially he that beleeves
in God, by beleeving ſeales
that God is true, and God
honours that ſoule againe
by ſealing it to the day of
redemption: God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<hi>Thoſe that honour me,
I will honour.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Hee
that beleeveth hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in himſelfe,</hi> that grace
promiſed, belongeth to
him, for he carries in his
heart the counterpaine of
the promiſes; he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
and beleeveth ſhall
have mercie. I beleeve,
ſaith the ſoule, therefore
the promiſe belongs to me,
my faith anſwering Gods
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17917:83"/>
love in the promiſe, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſo much to me. The
Spirit not onely revealeth
Chriſt, and the promiſes in
generall, but in attending
upon the ordinances by an
heavenly light: the ſpirit
diſcovers to us our intereſt
in particular, and ſaith to
the ſoule, God is thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and inableth the ſoule
to ſay, I am Gods: <hi>I am my
beloveds, and my beloved
is mine.</hi> Chriſt loved me,
and gave himſelfe for me.
Whence came this voyce
of Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> It was the
ſtill voyce of the Spirit of
God; that, together with
the generall truth in the
Goſpell, diſcovered in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Chriſts love to him.
It is not a generall faith that
will bring to heaven, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17917:84"/>
there is a ſpeciall worke of
the Spirit (in the uſe of
meanes) diſcovering and
ſealing the good will of
God to us, that he intends

            <p>This is excellently ſet

Chriſt beare good will to
all beleevers (though that
be the ground, and generall
foundation of all, and a great
preparative to the ſpeciall

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17917:85"/>

There is a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
men, in Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

not us to meddle with,
further then to know it in

but in time the holy Spirit
diſtinguiſheth, and rankes
men, as they were diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17917:86"/>
his, which deſtroyeth the
old Image and print that
was in us before. Holy and
good men by this worke of
the Spirit are diſtinguiſhed,</p>
            <p>1 From civill men by the
worke of holineſſe, which
meere civill men have not
at all, but deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
good men, by the
depth of that worke, the
Spirit of God workes a new
nature in them, whereby
they are diſtinguiſhed. Now
nature in every creature is
carried to one thing more
then to another. There is a
diſtinct propenſion in a
good man, to God, to grace
and goodneſſe, his aymes,
and bent are diſtinct: and
thereupon he hath a greater
inlargement of heart ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17917:86"/>
to his great aymes; hee
looks above the world and
worldly men; they are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
low, baſe ſpirited men,
the beſt of them.</p>
            <p>Againe, things by nature
worke from within: Herein
painted hypocrites are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from a true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Chriſtian: he workes
from a principle within, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
man is moved as the
<hi>Automata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Simile.</note> things of motion,
Clockes, and the like, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of wit, that move from
a weight without that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them: if they doe any
good, it is from ſomewhat
without that ſwayeth their
aymes and ends, and not
from an inward principle:
nature workes from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

goe upward, and heavie
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17917:87"/>
things downeward, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
artificiall things are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Thus good men are
diſtinguiſhed from thoſe
that are ſeemingly holy;
there is a new nature
wrought in them.</p>
            <p>Againe, nature is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
what is done natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is done conſtantly: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
bodies goe alwayes
downward, and light bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
upward: every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
works according to his
nature; an holy man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in holineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
becauſe he doth it
from an inward principle,
from a worke and ſtampe
within. Different things
may ſeeme the ſame; as
wilde hearbs may have the
colour and forme of thoſe
that are planted in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17917:87"/>
but there is difference
in the vertue of them:<note place="margin">Similie.</note> the
ſeeming graces and actions
of an hypocrite, they have
no vertue in them: as there
are ſome drugges without
vertue, dead things. But
there is a diſtinguiſhing
vertue in the faith of a
Chriſtian, wherby he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the world and his
luſts, whereby he doth all
duties, prayes, and heares,
and is fruitfull in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
in all his graces,
there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
vertue.<note place="margin">Similie.</note> True gold
hath the vertue to comfort
and ſtrengthen the heatt,
that Alchymy gold hath

grand difference; the one
doing them from the ſeale
of the Spirit, from a deeper

the other if from the Spirit,
yet it is but from a common
work at the beſt. Some dyes
cannot beare the weather,
but alter colour preſently;
but there are others that

the grace God workes in us:
common gifts and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and favours of the

eſtimation. If God ſhould
give a man kingdomes, and

               <p>But becauſe in time of

we are in a miſt, and cannot

Chriſt after ſome triall and

whereby we may know we

untill which time the heart
ſees nothing that is good,
and ſeemes to be nothing

ſometimes in ſuch a ſtate
as <hi>Paul</hi> and his company

when they ſaw neither
Sunne nor ſtarres many

all hope. So a Chriſtian may
for many dayes together,
ſee neither Sunne nor ſtarre,
neither light in GODS
countenance, nor light in

iſſuing from God, no grace
carrying the ſoule to God,
though even at that time
GOD darts ſome beame
through thoſe clouds upon
the ſoule: the ſoule againe
by a Spirit of faith, ſees
ſome light through thoſe
thickeſt clouds, enough to
keepe the ſoule from utter
deſpaire, though not to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it in peace.</p>
               <p>In this darke condition,

               <p>Though by reflecting
upon our ſoules we are able
to diſcerne a ſpirit of faith,
GOD may hide himſelfe
from the ſoule in regard of
comfort: Nay, a Chriſtian
may know himſelfe to bee
in the ſtate of grace, and
yet bee in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
As in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, hee
knew his Redeemer lived,
and he reſolved to truſt in

you ſhall not take my

for the preſent hee ſaw no

pleaſed GOD to reveale
himſelfe in ſpeciall favour
to him. There is alwayes
peace and joy in beleeving,
yet not in that degree
which gives the ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
untill by honouring
God in beleeving and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſtill his good time, hee
honoureth us with further
ſence of his favour, and
powreth forth his Spirit to
us, manifeſting his ſpeciall
love towards us: and this is
a further degree of ſealing
of us, confirming us more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17917:96"/>
ſtrongly then before.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why we can
neither have grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
nor know wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
nor when we know
we beleeve, enjoy comfort
without a freſh new act of
the Spirit, is becauſe the
whole carriage of a ſoule
to heaven is above nature,
where the Spirit makes a
ſtand, we ſtand and can goe
no further; we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from right grounds
without ſome helpe of the
Spirit, ſome doubts, ſome
feares will hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to our ſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as thoſe that live in
ſome damnable ſinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but grant that thoſe
that live in ſuch a ſinne ſhall
never inherit heaven: and
their conſcience tels them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17917:97"/>
they live in ſuch a ſinne, yet
ſelfe-love blindes them ſo,
that they will not conclude
againſt themſelves that they
ſhall be damned; ſo true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
cannot conclude for
themſelves without divine
light and helpe.</p>
               <p>It pleaſeth God thus to
keepe every degree and act
of ſealing in his owne hand,
to keepe us in a perpetuall
dependance upon him, and
to awe us, that wee ſhould
not grieve the Spirit of
grace, and cauſe him to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
either act of grace or
comfort.</p>
               <p>Ioy and ſtrong comfort
come from a ſuperadded
ſeale of the Spirit. The
works of the Spirit are of a
double kinde: either in us
by imprinting ſanctifying
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17917:97"/>
grace; or upon us, by ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon our ſoules in
ſweet feelings of joy: what
the Spirit worketh in us is
more conſtant, as a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is alwayes like
it ſelfe, and worketh uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely:
but comfort and
joy are of the nature of ſuch
priviledges as God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
that one time, and not
another, to ſome, and not to
others.</p>
               <p>This degree of ſealing
in regard of joy hath its
degrees likewiſe: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is ſo cleare and
ſtrong, that the ſoule que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioneth
not its ſtate in
grace ever after, but paſſeth
on in a triumphant manner
to that glory it lookes for.
Sometimes after this ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there may be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17917:98"/>
of comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
ſo farre as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
our condition: yet this
calling into queſtion comes
not from the Spirit, which
where it once witneſſeth
for us, never witneſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, but it is a fruit of
the fleſh not fully ſubdued,
it is a ſinne it ſelfe, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a fruit of ſome former
ſinne. For howſoever wee
ſhould not doubt after a
former witneſſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yet there will bee ſo
much weakening the ſence
of our aſſurance, at there is
yeelding to any luſt. The
knowledge of our eſtate in
grace and comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
though it may bee
weakened by neglect of
our watchfulneſſe, yet ſtill
it hath the force of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17917:98"/>
to aſſure us when the
Spirit pleaſeth to direct us
to make uſe of it, becauſe
Gods love varies not as our
feeling doth, and a fit doth
not alter a ſtate. The childe
in the wombe ſtirres not
alwayes, yet it lives, and
that may be gathered from
the former ſtirrings.</p>
               <p>This degree of ſealing
by way of witneſſe and
comfort, is appropriated
to the holy Spirit: every
perſon in the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
hath their ſeverall
worke; the Father chuſeth
us, and paſſeth a decree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole ground-work
of our ſalvation. The Sonne
executeth it to the full. The
Spirit applyeth it, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
our intereſt in it by
leading our ſoules to lay
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17917:99"/>
hold upon him, and by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up our ſoules in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of it, and by breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cheriſhing ſweet
communion with Father
and Son, who both of them
ſeale us likewiſe by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
This joy &amp; comfort is ſo
appropriated to the Spirit,
as it carrieth the very name
of the Spirit, and is one of
the three Witneſſes on
earth, that witneſſeth not
onely Chriſt to bee a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
but our Saviour. The
three witneſſes on earth are
the <hi>Spirit, water, and bloud:</hi>
for the better conceiving
of which place, wee muſt
know that the great worke
of Chriſt of redemption
and juſtification was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the old Teſtament
by bloud; and the great
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17917:99"/>
worke of our ſanctification
typified by their waſhing:
To anſwer which types,
when Chriſts ſide was pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
there came forth both
bloud and water, ſhewing
that Chriſt came not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by bloud to juſtifie us,
but by water to ſanctifie us.
Hereupon bloud and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
have the power to bee
witneſſes. The bloud of
Chriſt being ſprinkled on
the heart by the Spirit doth
pacifie the conſcience in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
it that God is pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by bloud, as <hi>being offered
by the eternall Spirit:</hi> this
quieting power ſheweth
that it was the bloud of
God, and ſhed for me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>The witneſſe of water is
from the power the Spirit
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17917:100"/>
hath to cleanſe our nature;
which no creature can doe
but the Spirit of GOD;
change of nature is peculiar
to the Author of nature. If
wee feele therefore our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
altered, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
become holy, in ſome
meaſure wee may know
we are the children of God,
as being begotten by the
Spirit of Chriſt, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us to his owne holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
our ſpirit as ſanctified
can witneſſe to us that we
are Chriſts.</p>
               <p>But oft it fals out, that
our owne ſpirits, though
ſanctified, cannot ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a ſubtill temptation
ſtrongly inforced, God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-addes
his owne Spirit:
guilt often prevailes over
the teſtimony of bloud,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17917:100"/>
that of water by reaſon of
ſtirring corruptions runneth
troubled. Therefore the
third the immediate teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to witneſſe the Fathers
love to us, to us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
ſaying, <hi>I am thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thy ſinnes are pardoned.</hi>
And this teſtimony the
Word ecchoeth unto, and
the heart is ſtirred up, and
comforted with joy unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeable.
So that both our
ſpirits and conſciences, and
the Spirit of Chriſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in one ſtrongly, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
our condition in grace,
that wee are the ſonnes of
God.</p>
               <p>In this threefold teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the order is this; bloud
begets water: ſatisfaction
by bloud procures the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17917:101"/>
from God, as a witneſſe
of Gods love; and by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the power of bloud
and water, we come to have
the Spirit witneſſing, and
ſealing our adoption unto
us to eſtabliſh us in the ſtate
of grace againſt ſtormes
of temptation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
The Spirit perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to looke unto bloud,
convinceth the heart of the
efficacie of it, and then qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eteth
the ſoule, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it ſelfe up to Chriſt
wholly, and to whole
Chriſt: and thence feeles
his heart eſtabliſhed againſt
carnall reaſon, ſo as he can
and doth oppoſe Chriſts
bloud to all the guilt that
doth ariſe. And this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Spirit comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſoule is the moſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17917:101"/>
familiar, and affects moſt.</p>
               <p>If we feele it not (as oft
we do not) then riſe upward
from want of this joy of
ſpirit to water, and ſee
what worke we finde of the
ſpirit in clenſing our ſoules,
and if wee finde theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not to runne ſo clearely
as to diſcerne our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them; then goe to the
witneſſe of bloud, and let
us bathe our ſoules in it, and
then we ſhall finde peace in
free grace procured by
bloud: for oft times a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is driven to that paſſe,
that nothing can comfort
him, within, or without
him, in heaven or earth, but
the free and infinite mercy
of GOD, in the bloud of
Chriſt, whereon the ſoule
relyeth when it feeles no
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17917:102"/>
comfort, nor joy, of the
Spirit, nor ſees no worke
of ſanctification: then it
muſt reſt on the ſatisfaction
wrought by the bloud of
Chriſt, when the ſoule can
go to God, and ſay, If we
confeſſe our ſinnes, thou
art juſt to forgive them, and
the bloud of Chriſt ſhall
cleanſe us from all ſinne.
Therefore though I feele
not inward peace, nor the
worke of the Spirit, yet I
will caſt my ſelfe upon thy
mercy in Chriſt. Hereupon
we ſhall in Gods time come
to have the witneſſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the Spirit more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
made cleare unto
us.</p>
               <p>The Spirit it is that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with bloud, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with water, and by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17917:102"/>
water, whatſoever of
Chriſts is applyed unto us,
by the Spirit, but beſides
witneſſing with theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
the Spirit hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
witneſſe by way of
inlarging the ſoule: which
joy in the apprehenſion of
Gods fatherly love: and
Chriſts ſetting the ſoule at
libertie. The Spirit doth
not alwayes witneſſe unto
us our condition by force
of argument from ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
as the ſight of a friend
comforts without helpe of
diſcourſe: the very joy from
ſight prevents the uſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>This teſtimony of the
Spirit containeth in it the
force of all, word, promiſe,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17917:103"/>
oath, ſeale, &amp;c. this is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the promiſe, as a
ſeale is more then our hand;
&amp; as an oath is more then a
mans bare word. The ſame
that is ſaid of Gods oath in
compariſon with his bare
promiſe, may bee ſaid of
this ſealing in compariſon
of other teſtimonies. That
as God was willing more
abundantly to cleare to the
heires of promiſe their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
hee added on oath,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 18. So for the ſame
end he added this his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as a ſeale to the promiſe,
and to the other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Our owne graces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if we were watchfull
enough, would ſatisfie us:
The fountaine is open as to
<hi>Hagar,</hi> but ſhee ſeeth it not,
&amp;c. howſoever the Spirit,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17917:103"/>
if that commeth, it ſubdueth
all doubts.</p>
               <p>As God in his oath and
ſwearing joyneth none to
himſelfe, but ſweareth by
himſelfe: ſo in this witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe
he taketh in no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to confirme it, but
witneſſeth by himſelfe.
And hence ariſeth joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable,
and glorious,
and peace which paſſeth all
underſtanding; for it is an
extract of heaven when we
ſee our being in the ſtate of
grace, not in the effect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               <p>In that grand inquirie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

by Chriſt: I am
Gods, and Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
mee; and never
thinke of the action of the

which is the neereſt

is neareſt unto us. And ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17917:113"/>
fetch their firſt riſe where
they ſhould ſet up their laſt
reſt. Whereas wee ſhould
begin our inquirie in the
worke of the third perſon,
which is next unto us: and
then upon good grounds we
may know our redemption
and election.</p>
               <p>The holy Spirit is both a
Spirit of Revelation, and of
Sanctification together, as
hath beene ſaid: for toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with opening the love

for communication with
them.</p>
               <p>People out of ſelfe-love
will have conceits of the

ſevered from the worke of
the Spirit upon their hearts
which will prove a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

illuſion. Although the
whole worke of grace by
the Spirit ariſe from the
Fathers and Sonnes love,
witneſſed by the Spirit, yet
the proofe of the Fathers
love to us in particular, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from ſome knowledge
of the worke of the Spirit:
the errour is not in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Fathers and

by a pleaſing powerleſſe
thought of it againſt the
worke of grace by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which their corruption
withſtands. So they will
carve out of the worke of

their heart were upright,
they would for this very

of the Iubile, and thoſe that

when we ſhall recover all
that we loſt, for ever to
keepe it, and never to loſe
it againe as we did in the

In a true beleever, after he

There is the act of faith,
and the fruit of faith; the
act of faith is to caſt our

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17917:125"/>
in Chriſt, the fruit of faith
is in beleeving to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

that faith is one thing, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
another, they may
have faith, and yet want a
double aſſurance: firſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of their faith, being
not able to judge at all
times of their owne act,
likewiſe, ſecondly, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their ſtate in
grace, as in time of deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and temptation: a ſoule
at ſuch a time caſts it ſelfe
upon Chriſt, as knowing
comfort is there to be had,
though hee be not ſure of
it for himſelfe: and this the
ſoule doth out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though not out of
feeling, as the poore man

the ſoule often times out
of the deepe, cryes, and in
the darke truſts in GOD
and this is the bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of faith, the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
whereof is <hi>Chriſt</hi> held
out in a promiſe; and not
<hi>aſſurance;</hi> which ſpringeth
from the firſt act when it
pleaſeth God to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſoule, and is a reward
of glorifying Gods mercy
in Chriſt by caſting the
ſoule upon his truth and
goodneſſe. Aſſurance is
GODS ſeale, faith is our
ſeale, when we ſet to our
ſeale by beleeving, he ſets
to his ſeale, aſſuring us of
our condition: we yeeld
firſt the conſent and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of faith and then God
puts his ſeale to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract:
there muſt be a good
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17917:126"/>
title before a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a planting before a roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and eſtabliſhing, the
bargaine before the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Some would have
faith to be an over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
light of the ſoule,
wherby undoubtedly they
beleeve themſelves to be
Chriſt, and Chriſt to be
theirs: which ſtumbleth
many a weake, yet true
Chriſtian, for this is rather
the fruit of a ſtrong faith,
then the act of a weake,
which ſtruggleth with
doubting, untill it hath
gotten the upper hand.
True it is, there muſt be ſo
much light let in to the
ſoule, as the ſoule may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
upon Chriſt, and this
light muſt be diſcovered
by the Spirit, and ſuch a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17917:127"/>
light as ſhewes a ſpeciall
love of Chriſt to the ſoule.
And againe, it is true that
we are not to take up our
reſt in the light, untill the
heart be further ſubdued: as
many are too haſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
of a good condition
upon uncertaine ſignes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

we muſt not deny faith
where this ſtrong aſſurance

if there be deſires, putting

there will be an unceſſant

                  <hi>We may upon the knowledge of

ſuch, he ſees here wee goe

               <p>When the Iſraelites were

ſuch as he had ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Iuſtification, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Aſſurance that all
ſhall worke together for
good, that nothing ſhall bee
able to ſeparate us from the
love of God in Chriſt: all
duties tend to aſſurance, or
ſpring from aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Gods intendment is to
bring us to heaven by a way
of love, and cheerefulneſſe;
as all his wayes towards us
in our ſalvation, are in love.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17917:142"/>
And this is the ſcope of the
covenant of grace; and for
this end he ſends the Spirit
of adoption into our hearts,
that we may have a childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
liberty with God in all
our addreſſes to him. When
he offers himſelfe to us as a
father, it is fit we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our ſelves to him as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
nature teaches a child,
the more he deſires his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
love, the more hee
feares to diſpleaſe him. And
hee is judged to be grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
that will therefore
venture to offend his father,
becauſe he knowes he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can, or will diſinherit
him. Certaine it is, the more
ſurely we know God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will worke upon our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17917:143"/>
to take all to heart that
may any way touch him:
this wrought upon <hi>David,</hi>
when the Prophet told him,
God hath done this &amp; this
for thee,<note place="margin">2 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more, if that had beene too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
it melted him preſently
into an humble confeſſion.
Thoſe that have felt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on their hearts, will both
by a divine inſtinct, as alſo
by ſtrength of reaſon, be
carried to all thoſe courſes
wherein they ſhall approve

Inſtinct of nature ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>To conclude this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

               <p>2 What God doth for us,<note place="margin">1. Meanes.</note>
he doth by grace in us, he wil
preſerve us that we ſhall not
fall from him by putting the
grace of feare into us, <hi>Ier.</hi>
Hee will keepe us, but by
what meanes?<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The peace of
God which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſhall guard our
hearts.</hi> God maketh our
Calling and Election ſure in
us,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> by ſtirring our hearts up
to be diligently exerciſed in
adding one grace unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in growing in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grace, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt attend upon
all ſpirituall meanes of
growth and quickening:
ſo ſhall you have a further
<hi>entrance into the kingdome of
Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> that is, you ſhall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17917:144"/>
have more evident know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your entrance into
the kingdome of grace here,
and likewiſe into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glory hereafter.
Thoſe that doe not ſo, ſhall
have no comfort either
from the time paſt, for they
ſhall <hi>forget they were purged
from their ſinnes,</hi> or from
thoughts of the time to
come, for they ſhall not be
able to ſee things <hi>farre off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 If aſſurance be in a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
degree,<note place="margin">2 Meanes.</note> yet yeeld not to
temptations and carnall
reaſonings: if our eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be not ſo faire, yet wee
will not part with our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
Coynes, as old
groates, that have little of
the ſtampe left, yet are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
We loſe our comfort
many times, becauſe wee
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17917:144"/>
yeeld ſo eaſily, becauſe we
have not ſuch a ſtrong and
cleare ſeale of ſalvation as
we would, to be born down
that we have none at all, is
a great weakeneſſe: exerciſe
therefore the little faith
thou haſt in ſtriving againſt
ſuch objections, and it will
be a meanes to preſerve the
ſeale of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>3 Becauſe this ſealing is
graduall,<note place="margin">3 Meanes.</note> we ſhould pray as
<hi>Paul, Epheſ. 1. for a ſpirit of
revelation,</hi> that wee may be
more ſealed: (the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were ſealed, for whom
<hi>Paul</hi> prayes, and ſo the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians;
yet) that GOD
would reveale to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
more their excellent
condition.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 2.</note> There are <hi>riches
of aſſurance;</hi> the Apoſtle
would have them to labour
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17917:145"/>
not onely for aſſurance, but
for the riches of it; that will
bring rich comfort, and joy
and peace. Times of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and tryall may
come, and ſuch as, if wee
have not ſtrong aſſurance,
we may be ſorely troubled,
and call all into queſtion.
This may be the ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods own children,
and from this, that in times
of peace, they contented
themſelves with a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of this aſſurance and
ſealing.</p>
               <p>4 Laſtly,<note place="margin">4 Meanes.</note> bee watchfull
over your owne hearts and
wayes, that according to
what you have now lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
you grieve not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>for by it you are ſealed;</hi>
intimating, that if in any
thing wee withſtand and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17917:145"/>
grieve the ſpirit, we ſhall in
ſo doing, prejudice our
ſelves, and ſuffer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and evidence of our
ſealing.</p>
