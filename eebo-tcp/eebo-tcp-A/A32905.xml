            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Dear Brothers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMongst the very
many diversions
which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
to mitigate
and attemper the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
which do still
oppresse me, for the loss
<pb facs="tcp:55027:3"/>
of my Children, and
especially of that <hi>One,</hi>
so precious to me. I
have found nothing
that has afforded me a
greater consolation then
<hi>this:</hi> That it pleased
God to give me oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
and such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to work upon, as I
cannot but hope he has
in mercy accepted. And
truly when I seriously
contemplate the felicity
of all those which are
<hi>Well</hi> out of this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
world, I find the
griefe which wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
for their absence
<pb facs="tcp:55027:3"/>
to be a meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
does nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them whom we
mourne for, that have
served God, their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
with honour,
and left a memorial
without reproach. You
have, Brothers, both of
you lost Children, but
none of them for
whom you had reason
to be so sensible as my
selfe; because they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Infants, and could
not so intirely engage
your affections, as if
they had arrived to yeers
of more maturity, and
<pb facs="tcp:55027:4"/>
the Spring had flattered
you with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a fruitful harvest
as me it did.</p>
            <p>But because we are
all obnoxious, and that
<hi>Cuivis potest accidere, quod
cuiquam potest,</hi> be assured,
That of al the afflictions
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can touch the heart
in this life, one of the
most superlative is the
loss of a hopeful child;
and till I had the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of this my self, I
have often wondered
That <hi>David</hi> should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himselfe to be so far
transported for the death
<pb facs="tcp:55027:4"/>
of a Rebel, that had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated
all the Relations
which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Son and a most
indulgent Father. I
know well that another
cause might contribute
to the effect, but all who
shall read that sad story,
cannot but impute as
much to his paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as by man could
be expressed. These
are, <hi>Brothers,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
(which since
we can never be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
perfectly of) have
caused me to seek the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
which I presume
<pb facs="tcp:55027:5"/>
here to have at last en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred,
and which I
here likewise affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
present unto you.
Let us make our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
fit for God, and
then let us not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
whensoever he
takes them from us.
<hi>Deus nobis illos educandos
non mancipio dederat.</hi> There
are a multitude of other
precepts, that I might
recollect out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory
Writings which
are at hand, <hi>Plutarch</hi> and
<hi>Cicero, Seneca</hi> and others.
But all their <hi>Topicks</hi> (S.
<hi>Hierom</hi> and some few
<pb facs="tcp:55027:5"/>
Christians only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
are most of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <hi>Philosophy,</hi> the
pride and courage of
another <hi>Institution,</hi> and
afford us but uncertain
consolations in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
estimate of things.
So that hereby we may
be less troubled in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the writings of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,
Clitomachus, Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Possidonius</hi> upon the
same Subject; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing capable
truly to compose the
mind of a good man for
the absence of his friend
or of his Child, like the
<pb facs="tcp:55027:6"/>
contemplation of his
undoubted felicity.</p>
            <p>It is that which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavor here to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
in offering to you
this <hi>Golden Book of S.
Chrysostom,</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
afforded me soe
great a consolation, I
cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hope may
be likewise acceptable
to you, and useful to as
many as have either bin
touched with the like
resentiments, or that
do establish for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

That those who are
well and rightly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
do easily become
good men. And the
thing is verily of so
great importance, That
some have taken <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for <hi>Religion</hi> it selfe;
<hi>All</hi> for another <hi>Nature;</hi>
which he that shal read
of the <hi>Laconick</hi> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
will not easily
dispute. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That were this one
thing well secured, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
would have good
<hi>Subjects, Fathers</hi> good
<hi>Children, Wives</hi> good
<hi>Husbands, Masters</hi> good
<pb facs="tcp:55027:7"/>
               <hi>Servants, God</hi> would be
sincerely served, and all
things would be well
with us. And here I
would now end, did
not my Affections a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
transport me, and the
hopes that you will yet
indulge it, if whilst I
erect to my dear <hi>Child</hi> no
other <hi>Monument,</hi> I shew
to the world how neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I concurr'd with the
Instructions of this <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Book</hi> (before I had
seene it) and what may
be expected from a
timely Education, if
(now that we may both
<pb facs="tcp:55027:7"/>
read and have it) we
with diligence pursue
it.</p>

But this I can truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
He was little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>five</hi> years old, and
he did excel many that I
have known of <hi>fifteene.
Tam brevi spatio tempor a
multa compleverat.</hi> He was
taught to <hi>pray</hi> as soon as
he could speak, and he
was taught to <hi>read</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:55027:8"/>
soon as he could pray.
At three years old he
read any <hi>Character</hi> or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whatsoever used in
our printed Books, and
within a little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any tolerable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

(by heart) before he
was five years of age se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight hundred
<hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words,
as I have since calculated
out of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>Declensions.</hi> I
entred him then upon
the <hi>Verbs,</hi> which in four
months time he did
<pb facs="tcp:55027:8"/>
fectly <hi>conjugate,</hi> together
with most of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
excepted in our
<hi>Grammar;</hi> These he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
with incredible
delight, and intelligence
of their use: But it is
more strange to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that when from
them I thought to set
him to the <hi>Nouns,</hi> he had
in that interim (by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
learned both the
<hi>Declensions</hi> and their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi>
their exceptions,
<hi>Adjectives, Comparisons,
Pronouns,</hi> without any
knowledg or precept of
mine, insomuch as I
<pb facs="tcp:55027:9"/>
stood amazed at his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
and memory.
This engaged me to
bring him a <hi>Sententiae Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriles</hi>

learned to <hi>Construe</hi> and
<hi>Perse,</hi> as fast as one could
well teach and attend
him: for he became
not onely dextrous in
the ordinary rules by
frequent recourse to
them (for indeed I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

any of them by heart as

Books were too difficult
for him, he wept for
very grief, and would
hardly be pacified: But
thus it is reported of
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> when those
noble <hi>Muses</hi> were recited
in his hearing, at one of
the most illustrious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of <hi>Greece,</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:55027:10"/>
whence was predicted
the greatness of his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
To tell you how
exactly he read <hi>French,</hi>
how much of it he
spake and understood,
were to let you onely
know, that his Mother
did instruct him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any confusion to
the rest. Thus he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Catechism and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prayers, and read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
More to bee
admired was the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his judgement,
that being much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>Diagramms</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55027:11"/>
in <hi>Euclid,</hi> he did with
so great facility interpret
to me many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Postulata,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,</hi>
which he would
readily repeat in <hi>Latine</hi>
and apply it. And he
was in one hour onely
taught to play, the first
half of a <hi>Thorough Basse,</hi>
to one of our Church
Psalmes upon the <hi>Organ</hi>
Let no man think that
we did hereby crowd
his spirit too full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Those things
which we force upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
children, were
strangely natural to him
<pb facs="tcp:55027:11"/>
for as he very seldome
affected their toyes; to
such things were his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Recreations, as the
gravest man might not
be ashamed to divert
himself withal. These
were especially the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus</hi>
of <hi>Aesop;</hi> most of
which he could so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
recount, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Stories, as you
would admire from
whence he produced
them: But he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
without some Book
or other in his hand.
Pictures did afford him
infinite pleasure, above
<pb facs="tcp:55027:12"/>
all a <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink</hi> with
which he now began to
forme his Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus
he often delighted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in reciting of <hi>Poems</hi>
and <hi>Sentences,</hi> some
whereof he had in
Greek, Fragments of
<hi>Comedies,</hi> diuers Verses
out of <hi>Herbert,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> his
Beloved, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
<hi>Ecce quam Bonum:</hi>
and indeed he had an
ear so curiously framed
to sounds, that he would
never misse infallibly
to have told you what
<hi>Language</hi> it was you did
<pb facs="tcp:55027:12"/>
read by the <hi>Accent</hi> only,
were it <hi>Latine, Greek,
French, Italian</hi> or <hi>Dutch.</hi>
To all I might add, the
incomparable sweetness
of his countenance and
eyes, the clean fabrick
of his body and pretty
Adresses: how easily he
forgot injuries, when
at any time I would
break and crosse his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
by sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the midst
of some sweet or other
delicious things which
allured him; that I
might there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> render
<pb facs="tcp:55027:13"/>
him the more indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though these he seldom
quitted without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and advantage.
But above all, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conspicuous was his
affection to his younger
Brother, with whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
he would
continually bear, saying
he was but a child, and
understood no better.
For he was ever so smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
cheerful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
good humour,
that it might be truly
verified of him, as it
was once of <hi>Heliodorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Gravitatem morum, hilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
frontis temperabat.</hi>
But these things were
obvious, and I dwel no
longer on them: There
are yet better behind;
and those are his early
Piety, and how ripe he
was for God. Never
did this Child lye in bed
(by his good will) lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then six or seven
Winter or Summer;
and the first thing he
did (being up) was to
say his French Prayers,
and our <hi>Church-Catechism;</hi>
after <hi>Breakfast</hi> that short
Latine Prayer, which
<pb facs="tcp:55027:14"/>
having encountred at
the beginning of our
<hi>Lillies Grammar,</hi> he had
learned by heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any knowledge or
injunction of mine, and
whatsoever he so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to memory, he
would never desist till
heperfectly understood;
yet withall this, did he
no day employ above
two houres at his Book
by my order; what he
else learned was most
by himselfe, without
constraint or the least
severity, unseene, and
totally imported by his
<pb facs="tcp:55027:14"/>
own inclination. But
to return, Wonderful
was it to observe the
Chapters which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
would choose, and
the Psalmes and Verses
that he would apply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasions, and as in
particular he did to some
that were sick in my
family a little before
him; bidding them to
consider the Sufferings
of Christ, how bitter
they were, and how
willingly he endured
them. How frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would he pray by
himself in the day time,
<pb facs="tcp:55027:15"/>
and procure others to
joyn with him in some
private corner of the
house apart? The last
time he was at Church
(which was, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
at <hi>Greenwich</hi>)
at his return I asked him
what he brought away
from the Sermon; He
replyed, That he had
remembred two good
things, <hi>Bonum Gratiae,</hi>
and <hi>Bonum Gloriae,</hi> which
expressions were indeed
used, though I did not
believe he had minded
them.</p>
            <p>I should even tire
<pb facs="tcp:55027:15"/>
you with repeating all
that I might call to
mind of his pertinent
answers upon several
occasions: One of the
last whereof I will only
instance, when about
<hi>Christmas</hi> a Kinsman of
his related to us by the
fire side some passages
of the presumptuous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of certain <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts</hi>
about <hi>Colchester,</hi>
whilst we were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some admiration at
the passage, That, sayes
the Child (being upon
the Gentlemans knee,
and as we thought not
<pb facs="tcp:55027:16"/>
minding the discourse)
is no such wonder, for
it is written, <hi>Man shall
not live by bread alone,
&amp;c.</hi> But more to be
admired was his perfect
comprehension of the
sacred <hi>Histories</hi> in the
Method of our <hi>Golden
Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> so as it may be
truly affirmed of this
Child, as it was once
said of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Quod à
puero Sacras liter as noverat</hi>
Nor was all this by rote
onely (as they term it)
for that he was capable
of the greater mystery of
our salvation by Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:55027:16"/>
I have had many infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
indications. And
when the Lords day
fortnight before he died
he repeated to me our
<hi>Church-Catechism,</hi> he told
me that he now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his <hi>God-fathers</hi>
were dis engaged; for
that since he himself did
now understand what
his Duty was, it would
be required of him, and
not of them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And let no man
think, that when I use
the term <hi>Dis-ingaged,</hi> it
is to expresse the Child
meaning with a fine
<pb facs="tcp:55027:17"/>
word; for he did not
only make use of such
phrases himself; but
would frequently in his
ordinary discourse come
out with such expresions
as one would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
how he came by
them; but upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have produced
his authority, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Bible, or
some other Booke
shewed you the words
so used. How divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did this pious Infant
speake of his being
weary of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb facs="tcp:55027:17"/>
world (into
which he was scarcely
entred) and whilest he
lay sick, of his desires to
goe to <hi>Heaven;</hi> that the
Angels might convey
him into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
passionately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
those that
tended him to dye with
him; for he told them
that he knew he should
not live: And, really,
though it were an <hi>Ague</hi>
which carried him from
us (a disease which I
least apprehended find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him so lively in his
<hi>Intervals;</hi>) yet the day
<pb facs="tcp:55027:18"/>
before he tooke his
leave of us, he call'd to
me, and pronounced
it very soberly; Father
(sayes he) you have
often told me that you
would give me your
house, and your Land,
your Bookes and all
your fine things; but I
tell you, I shall have
none of them, you wil
leave them all to my
Brother. This he spake
without any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or passion, and it
did somewhat trouble
me, that I could not
make him alter this
<pb facs="tcp:55027:18"/>
conceit which in <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
would be esteemed
prophetick. But that I
may conclude and shew
how truely jealous this
child was. Least he
should offend God in
the least scruple, that
very morning, not
many howers before he
fell into that sleepe
which was his last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the midst of his
<hi>Paroxcisme,</hi> he called
to me, and asked of
me whether he should
not offend, if in the
extremity of his pain,
he mentioned so often
<pb facs="tcp:55027:19"/>
the name of <hi>God,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ease; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God would accept
his prayers if he did not
hold his hands out of
bed in the posture of
praying? Which when
I had pacified him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
he prayed, till
his prayers were turned
into eternal praises.
Thus ended your Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
being but five
years, five monethes
and three dayes old, and
more I could stil say. <hi>Nam
quem Corpore non valemus
recordatione teneamus, et

Child is borne,
the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirs
himself, not
that he may
rightly take order about his
Education, but that he may
magnificently set him forth,
and adorn him with Jewels
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55027:24"/>
and Rich Apparel. <hi>O vain
Man,</hi> Wherefore dost thou
this? Be it that thou thy self
art cloathed with all these
things, why dost thou instruct
thy Child, as yet free from
this madnesse, in these trifles?
For what purpose dost thou
put that Ornament about his
neck? He needs the care of
a diligent Tutor, who may
compose and regulate his
manners, he hath no need of
Gold. And thou dost nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
him a lock of hair behind
like a Girle, effeminating thy
Son even from the very cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
Softning thus the vigor
of his Sex, engraftest into
that tender age a superfluous
love of riches, and dost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to the pursuit of
those things which are totaly
unuseful. Why dost thou
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55027:24"/>
spred for him so large a snare?
Wherefore dost thou so
charm him with the love of
corporal things? <hi>If a man</hi>
(saith he) <hi>wear long hair it is
a shame unto him.</hi>

               </gap>tis a thing

the Practice of Gentil super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.
But many there be
who hang gold in their ears,
I would that were wholy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
even by the female Sex,
you infect boies with this pest
also; nay and there are very
many who deride these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
as if they were smal
matters; <hi>I tell you,</hi> they are
not small matters but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great, and very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

her Fathers house, becomes
impertinent to her husband,
and very troublesome, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to more charges
then the very <hi>Publicans.</hi> I
have already told you, that
it is therefore a difficult thing
to reform a vice, because there
is no body which takes the
care of Children, no body
discourses to them about
Virginity, no body concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Modesty, no body of
the contempt of Riches and
Glory, and no body speaks
to them of those <hi>blessed</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
which are made in the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>If therefore Children be
from their Infancy deprived
of Governors, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them? If some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55027:25"/>
from the Womb even to their
old and decrepit age, having
been instituted, are not yet
arrived to perfection, what
will not they perpetrate, who
from the beginning of their
life have accustomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to hear such discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses!
Now indeed that their
children may be instructed
in the Arts, Letters and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
every one doth studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
contend; but that they
may cultivate their minds few,
or none are at all solicitous.</p>

And though thou art

them. Make a Champion

I say not so; I wish it indeed
and would with all my heart,
that every man could receive
it; but since that may seem
a burthen <hi>too great for him to
support,</hi> I do not compel.
Bring up a Champion (I say)
for <hi>Christ,</hi> and whilst he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in this world, instruct
him from his very cradle. If
whilst he is yet young thou

able to efface them when he
becomes more firme, being

fearful and revering thy very
looks, thy words and every
little beck. Treat him as
thou shouldst at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
If thou have a good

City, if one should constitute
Laws giving liberty and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity</hi>
to Thieves, it would
soon subvert all: And if the
Souldiers pursue their fury
without respect to what is fit,
all things fall to confusion;
and if every one quitting his
due order, take upon him to

prosecute that which belongs
to another, by this usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and avarice he violates
and utterly spoiles the whole
Government. It is truly no
otherwise in that which we
have spoken.</p>
            <p>The Mind of a Child is
therefore a City, a City new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built and <hi>furnished,</hi> a City
full of new inhabitants, and
as yet wholly unexperienced.
'Tis an easie matter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and model such: for
those which have been at first
possest and grown up with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
principles, such as are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
old persons, are truly
with great difficulty reformed
though neither is that impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
(for even they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may be converted if
they will) but such as are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55027:29"/>
ignorant, will with ease
embrace the Laws which you
enjoyn them.</p>
            <p>Establish Laws therefore in
this City, and for those who
are <hi>Denisons</hi> of it formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and severe Lawes, which
if any shall dare to violate,
approve thy self a Governor
and revenge it; for it is to no
purpose to enact Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Punishment be also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted:
Make Laws then,
and look diligently to your
Work; for <hi>know,</hi> that wee
impose Lawes upon no lesse
then the <hi>Universe it selfe:</hi>
To day we build a City, let
the four <hi>Senses</hi> be the Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
and the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and
let all the rest of the Bodie
be as the Walls. Now these
Gates, are the Eyes, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55027:30"/>
Tongue, the Eares and the
Nose, and (if you please)
also the Touch. Through
these overtures it is that the
Citizens go out and in at;
that is to say, by these Ports
it is that our cogitations
are corrupted or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Go to then, And first let
us go to the Gate of the
<hi>Tongue,</hi> since this is of all
the rest the chief and the
greatest Port; let us now
prepare for it the doors and
its barres, not of wood nor
of iron, but of Gold, for
the very City it self which is
thus built, is of Gold, and
not any man, but he that is
the King of the Universe shall
keep his Court in this City,
if thus you prepare it: and

you shall perceive by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

parts of this City to consig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
him a Palace. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make the Doores and the
Barrs for it of Gold I say;
namely the Oracles of God, as
the Prophet speaketh.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 103.</note> 
               <hi>The

               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 11</note> 
               <hi>above Gold and
much precious stone.</hi> Let
us teach them to have these
things continually in their
mouths and wheresoever they
stir, and that not slightly, nor
perfunctorily or seldom, but
without ceasing. Nor is it
yet sufficient that the doors
be overlayed with Gold, but
they must be framed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of solid gold, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the precious stones fixed
one against another without.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55027:31"/>
Let the <hi>Crosse</hi> of our Lord
be the barre of these Gates,
which is indeed every where
inchased with stones of price:
let this then bee put athwart
the middle of the Gates; and
when we shall thus have
made the doores fast, solid,
and of Gold, and shut to the
bolt, let us then make them
worthy Citizens; namely by
instructing the Child to speak
gravely and piously, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all strangers out of Town,
lest otherwise a certain impure
and infected rabble enter, and
commix themselves with our
Citizens, such as are reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
words, injurious and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
filthy speeches, secular
and worldly, all these let us
eject; nor, besides the King
only, permit any to passe
these Gates; but to him, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55027:31"/>
to all his Retinue let them be
still opened, according as it
is said of it,<note place="margin">Psal. 117. 20</note> 
               <hi>This is the Gate
of the Lord, the Rightious shall
enter into it.</hi> And with the

               <hi>If there be any

            <p>But which way shal we now
effect all this? and from
what <hi>Topicks</hi> shall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them? If we become
severe Judges of the actions
which they do; for in a child
there is an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility.
How? He contends
not for wealth nor for glory:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55027:32"/>
He is yet a child: not for a
Wife, not for Children, not
for an House; therefore what
occasion hath he to injure or
traduce any one? He only
contends with his equals. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
him a Law immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That he wrong none,
that he defame none, that he
do not swear, that he be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and if you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him to transgresse this
Law, Chastize him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imes
with a sterne counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
sometimes with sharp
reproofs, such as may go to
the quick, and upbraid him,
and now and then sooth and
flatter him with promises.
Treat him not alwayes with
blows, nor accustome thy
self so to chastize him; for
if thou art used to correct
him every day, he will soon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55027:32"/>
learn to despise it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once learned to do so it
utterly marres all: rather
cause him alwayes to fear the
rod, not alwayes to feel it:
shake indeed the scourage,
but touch him not with it,
neither from threats proceed
to the work: But let him not
know that your words are
only menaces; for then
threatnings are only proper,
when children believe they
will proceed to deeds: For
if the Offender once under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this oeconomy, he will
soon contemne it: Let him
therefore expect to be chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
but yet let him not be
chastized, lest it extinguish his
reverence; rather let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
like a glowing fire,
and every where burn up the
thornes, or like a keen pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55027:33"/>
let it dig to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
And when once you
perceive that you have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any fruit by fear, remit a
little, for there is due even to
our very natures some relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Teach him to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and courteous; but if
you perceive him to do any
injury to his servant, connive
not at it, but check even your
child though free; for hee
that shall see he is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to reproach his very <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey,</hi>
will much lesse dare to
injure or miscal one that is
free-borne and his equal.
Lock up his mouth from ill
language; if you find him
accusing of any, stop the
mouth, and convert your
tongue against her own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55027:33"/>Admonish his mother,
his Paedagogue and his
servant, that they still
speak and inculcate the same
things to the child, that
they may all of them be his
keepers together, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
observe that none of
those evil cogitations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from his mouth, and
those golden portals.</p>
            <p>Do not imagine that the
thing requires so much time,
provided that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
thou presse it earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon him, threaten, and
dost constitute so many
Guards over him. Two
months will be sufficient, all
things will be redressed, the
business established, and pass
into very nature it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55027:34"/>By this means will this gate
be made worthy for the
Lord, when there shall be
neither filthy speech, scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
nor folly, or any such
thing, but all as becomes such
a Master. For as those who
traine up their children to
serve the State in the Wars
immediately instruct their
Warlike Youth in the Art of
shooting, to put on the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slet,</hi>
and manege the great
Horse, their age and stature
being no impediment. How
much rather then those which
are entred into the heavenly
<hi>Militia,</hi> ought they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themselves with these
Accoutrements for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
of their King?
Learn him therefore to sing
<hi>Praises</hi> to God, that he
have no leisure for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55027:34"/>
Songs and foolish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</p>
            <p>And be this Gate thus
guarded, and such Citizens

               </gap>cted; the rest let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
within, as the Bees do
the drones, not suffering
them to go forth, or once to
buz at home.</p>
            <p>But now let us proceed to
the next Gate; What is
that? even that which is the
next, and of neer affinity
with it, I mean the <hi>Hearing;</hi>
for that Gate indeed hath Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
which passe out from
within, but none that have
admission through it; but in
this they enter in from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and there are none
which by it do sally
forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55027:35"/>This therefore hath great
affinity with the other; For
if no filthy nor polluted thing
be suffered to climb up by
this Portal, there will be no
great difficulty to preserve
the other; since he which
doth not heare filthy and
wicked things, does not
likely speak wicked things:
but if these lie open and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, the danger will
be great, and give distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to all that are within.
This then peradventure were
first to have been spoken of,
and the Entrance to have bin
secured.</p>
            <p>Let Children therefore
heare nothing impertinent,
neither of their Domesticks,
nor their Governors, nor
their Nurse: For as Plants
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55027:35"/>
have then most need of care,
when they are yong and
tender, so have Children.
Provide them careful and
virtuous <hi>Nurses,</hi> that a good
Foundation be laid at first,
and that from their very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
they receive nothing

(sayes he) gave such a one a

his little Daughter did this,
and this; permit them to

but other things they may
hear, so they be related with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and with all fidelity. They
may indeed hear the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

but 'tis not fitting to mix

with all promiscuously, and
with the Domesticks in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
but let them be

Statues.</p>
            <p>For if it be necessary that

shall we now when we are

sports, remember thou
bringst up a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and
a <hi>Champion,</hi> and a <hi>Citizen</hi> of
Heaven. Discourse therefore
with him, and tell him, Once
upon a time at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
a Father had two Sons,
both of them Brothers.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55027:37"/>
Here pause a little: then go
on, They came both out of
the same Belly, one of them
was the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Yong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. The first
was a <hi>Husband-man,</hi> and his
brother was a <hi>Shephard</hi> that
us'd to lead out his Flock
upon the Downes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the thickets (sweeten
then your discourse with
some pretty diversion, that
the child may take delight
in what you say, and least
it become tedious) The other
sowed seed in the ground
and planted trees. But upon
a time they went to serve <hi>God,</hi>
and the <hi>Shephard</hi> taking
the very best Lamb of
all his Flock, offered it
up to God. Is it not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times better to discourse
these things to them, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o

amuse them with I know
not what wonders of the
<hi>Golden Fleece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the like?
Then encourage his attention
again; for the narration it
self is a very serious matter,
there is nothing in it false, all
is out of Scipture. Now
because he offered to
God the firstling and prime
of his flock, there came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fire down from he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven
and snatched up all that lay
upon the Altar.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Elder Brother</hi> did
not behave himself in this
manner, but out he goes,
and reserves for himself the
best and first-fruits of his
labours, offering the second
and the worst to God: and
God accordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gly had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but slighted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55027:38"/>
and turned from it; letting
it lye still upon the Ground;
when as the <hi>others</hi> he received
up to himself. Just as it
happens with those who are
the Stewards and Bailiffs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our farmes, when they
come to present their fruits:
One of them his Master ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and brings him in to
the house, the <hi>other</hi> he lets
stand regardlesse without.
Just so it fell out here. But
what followed this now?
Why, the <hi>Elder Brother</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
dejected, and as one
that saw himself despised
and not approved of, walks
melancholy out. And God
sayes to him, Wherefore art
thou so sad, knowest thou
not that thou didst offer to
God, why then didst thou
me that Injury? What hadst
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55027:38"/>
thou to complain of? How
comes it to pass that thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredst
the <hi>refus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to me? Here
if you think fit to descend
more to his capacity, you
may a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, That he having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to reply, held his
peace and answered not a
word.</p>
            <p>A little after this, spying
his <hi>Yonger Brother,</hi> he sayes
to him, Come, prithy, let us
walk a little out in the fields;
and when they were there,
surprizing him treacherously,
and being stronger, he kills
his poor <hi>Brother,</hi> and thought
that he should conceal it all
from God. But God comes
to him, and askes him, <hi>Where
is thy Broeher?</hi> What can I
tell, replies he, <hi>Am I my
Brothers keeper?</hi> Then sayes
God to him, <hi>Behold thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55027:39"/>
blood cryes to me from the
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Mother</hi> sit by
whilst the mind of the child
is moulding with these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
that she now and
then interpose, and praise that
which is recounted. But
what follow'd all this? God
took him up into heaven,
and he being dead, lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
for ever. By this
means the child will begin
to learn the Doctrine of the
<hi>Resurrection;</hi> for they use to
relate such stories in <hi>Fables:</hi>
They made her (sayes one) a
<hi>Demi-Goddess,</hi> and the child
believes it, and though he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>now not what a <hi>Demi-God</hi>
is, yet he imagins it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is more then a
man, and he wonders present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55027:39"/>
at the hearing of it: How
much more then when he
shal hear of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi>
that his Soul ascended into
heaven, and that God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
took him up?
But as for the <hi>Murtherer,</hi>
having lived many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
miserably unfortunate,
and continually in fear and
trembling, he suffered innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
evils, and was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
every day. Speak to
him conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning the punition
with terror, not gently. That
he heard God say, Thou
shalt be groaning and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the face of the
Earth. The child indeed
knows not what this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
at first: But say it
however. As you,
when you st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd perplexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Master, shortly to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55027:40"/>
be whipped, tremble and
fear; so he lived all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
after he had thus offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
God. And hitherto
shall suffice for the first.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, one evening
as you are at Supper, talke
of this again to him, and let
his <hi>Mother</hi> repeat the same
things; and then when he
hath heard it several times
over, require it of him. My
Son, recite me th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Story,</hi> and,
the more to encourage him,
when you find he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it, you shall propose
him some reward. The mind
will indeed upon the first
narration of this History,
gather some fruit by you, as
you make the deduction.
After this, say thus, Do you
see, child, what a horrible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55027:40"/>
thing it is to envy ones. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Do you perceive what
a crime it is to think one can
hide any thing from God?
for he sees all things; yea,
even those things which are
committed in secret.</p>
            <p>So that sowing this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
onely in the child,
thou wilt have no need of a
Paedagogue, since the feare
which the Deity doth hereby
work in him, will affect the
child beyond any other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
whatsoever, and
extreamly move his mind.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, you
shall lead him also to Church,
and then especially when
this Less<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n is read: How
you shall perceive him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
dance and rejoyce, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55027:41"/>
what every body does not
know he does, out-running in
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s understanding the words
of the Minister, and arguing
that he knowes that already,
and receiving wonderfull
fruit by it. And by this the
thing will become sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fixed in his memory;
There are many other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to be reaped from
this Narration.</p>
            <p>Let him be taught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by you, that from the
very beginning, from the
death of this child, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
not to grieve when we
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fflicted, seeing he who was
thus accepted, was by death
received up into Heaven;
When this Narration shall
be well rooted in the mind
of the child, introduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55027:41"/>
as that of other two
Brothers, and say, There
were also other two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
an Elder also and a
younger; The Elder of them
was a Hunter, the younger
was a keeper and a lover of
home; and this hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of more delight in it
then the former (as being
full of more variety of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies;
and the Persons
which manage it being more
in yeares then the former.)
Now these were also two
Brothers, and both of them
twins: But when they were
born the Mother loved the
younger, but the Father was
more fond of the Elder who
was wont to passe his time
abroad in the fields: but the
younger kept altogether at
home; Upon a day, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55027:42"/>
being now very aged, said
to him whom he loved, Son,
Seeing I am now an old man,
goe thy way I pray and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for me some Veni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on:
That is, take me a Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>buck,
or an Hare, and bring it to
me, that when I have eaten
of it I may blesse thee: But
to the younger he said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all.</p>
            <p>Now the Mother o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-hearing
all that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calls her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
son, and says to him, Son,
Since thy Father has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thine elder-Brother
to bring him some Venison,
that eating of it he may give
him his blessing: Hearken
what I say to thee, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sten
immediately to the flock,
and fetching thence some
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55027:42"/>
young fat kids, bring them
hither to me, and I will
make such as thy Father
loves, and thou shalt carry
it to him, that when he has
tasted of it, he may blesse
thee; For the Father was
dark through extremity of
Age.</p>
            <p>Now when the younger
had brought her the Kids,
his Mother stewed them,
and putting the viands into a
dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, delivers it to her Son
who carried it in: And she
also clad him with the skins
of the Goats, least he should
be discovered, seeing he was
smooth, but his brother was
all hairy and rough; that by
this meanes it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and his Father not
discern the imposture, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55027:43"/>
thus accoutr'd in she sent
him; now the good old man
supposing him to have been
the Elder, having eaten the
meat, Blessed him: And
when he had made an end of
blessing him, in comes the
Elder brother bringing the
Venison: but perceiving
what had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pned, roaring
out aloud he wept lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>Observe now what a world
of benefit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is will produce,
&amp; do not recount all the story
at once: but see what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
will spring from this. For
in the first place, children
will learn to reverence their
Parents, perceiving how
they contended for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and will rather indure
a thousand stripes, then once
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55027:43"/>
to hear their Father curse
them.</p>
            <p>If you fill their thoughts
with such like stories, so as
they may imagine them
worthy of beliefe (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are very truths)
how will it not affect and fill
them ful of reverence? By this
also they will learn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
gluttony (for that is
likewise to be told them) and
that he gained nothing by
heing the first borne and the
Eldest, since by the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his belly, he betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the excellency of his
birth-right.</p>
            <p>Now when the child shall
have throughly remembred
this, upon some other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
thou shall require
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55027:44"/>
him to repeate this story of
the two brothers. And if
he begin to speak of <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abell,</hi> recall him, and
say, I do not mean this, but
that of the two other, whom
the Father gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his blessing
to; thus giving him some
hints, but without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the names, and when he
has recited it all, add as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and say,</p>
            <p>Mark now what hapned
after this, This also sought
to have slain his brother, and
for that end expected onely
his fathers decease, which the
Mother coming to hear of,
and fearing it, caused her son
to flee away. Much Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
far exceeding the
apprehension of the child,
may be hence (with a little
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55027:44"/>
condescention) implanted
into the Spirit of the child,
so that the Narration be
skilfully and dxteronsly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
Thus therefore let us
tell him.</p>
            <p>This same Brother went
his way, and came to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place having no body
with him, not so much as a
servant, no Fosterer no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
nor any person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
Being arrived to the
place, he prayed, and said,
O Lord, give me, <hi>I beseech thee</hi>
bread and cloathing, and
save me; and having said thus,
overcome with sorrow he fel
asleep; and there he saw in a
dream a Ladder reaching up
from the earth to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the Angels of
God as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ending and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and God himselfe stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55027:45"/>
at the top of all. Then
he said, Bless me, and he
blessed him, and called him
Israel.</p>
            <p>It comes happily into my
mind, and now I remember,
that from the very Names
another <hi>Instruction may be</hi>
inserted, and what is that?
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That from the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
we presently intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a certain emulation of
Vertue in children. Let none
therefore be forward to name
their children for the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their Fathers, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or Grandfathers: but
of the Righteous, of the
Martyrs, Bishops and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Be this also their emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
let this child be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
by the Apellation of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55027:45"/>
some Holy man, and talke
not to me of the Gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names;
for (<hi>believe it)</hi> it is
no small reproach, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of derision, when in a
Christian Family some hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Ceremonies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and they light up the
lamps, and watch which of
them shall first go out and be
spent, with other the like fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries,
which bring no little
detriment to those which
practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem; For do not
imagine that these are small
matters or trifles which are
done.</p>
            <p>This therefore I require of
you, that you impose the
names of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghteous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your children, for it was
the custom in the beginning
(<hi>not without reason)</hi> that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55027:46"/>
they called their children by
the names of thetr Ancestors,
it being a kind of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against Mortality, that
he which was gone seemed
still to live, by reason of
his name: but now this
custome is quite out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>

And moreover
neither do we find any other

besides this only, That it

Why so? Because thou art
a Father of Nations. And

us begin our care over our
Children, and institute their
lives.</p>
            <p>But as I said, He saw a

and touching it: let the

enter into your houses, by the

            <p>But if any man come in
with a false Tale, by no

admitted. If you find a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
speaking filthily before
him, chastise him for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and be thy self a
severe and bitter Censor of
whatsoever evil they do. But
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55027:48"/>
if by chance thou espy a
young maid (yea rather let
there no such approach him)
let her not so much as light
the fire; unless it be some
old woman, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to attract a young
Man: From a young maid,
I say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ie rather then from
the fire, and by this means it
will come to pass, that he
which hears nothing imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
will speak nothing
impertinent. Thus therefore
let them be brought up.</p>
            <p>But we proceed now to
another <hi>Port.</hi> The <hi>Smelling,</hi>
For this also brings a very
great inconvenience with it,
unless timely barr'd; such
are Odours and Incense;
there being nothing which
more dissolves the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rame and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55027:49"/>
tenor of the mind, nothing
that more softens it, then if
thou be affected with sweet
smells: What then says he?
Ought one to take pleasure in
dirt? I do not say so, but
neither with this, nor that.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore bring
him sweet Ointments, for as
soon as that once affects the
Brain, it effeminates and sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
all the rest: Hence also
Lusts are incited, and in that
do lurk innumerable snares.
Therefore lock up that Gate
securely. For the faculty of
Smelling is to breath the Air,
not to receive Perfumes.
Some there are which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
will deride all this,
as though whilest we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of this nurture, we
trouble our selves about tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles:

But in truth the matter
is not small; but the very
Basis, Instruction and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the whole world,
that these things be duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>There is likewise another
Gate, more specious then the
former, but of exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to guard, namely, that
of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> as being rais'd
on high, set in the front, and
beautified. This has many
smaller Leaves, by which it
not onely sees but is seen, if
it be gallantly framed. Here
then there is great necessity
of Laws, one of the principal
whereof let be, never to send
the Child to the <hi>Theater,</hi> lest
thereby he receive an entire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
at once, both by the
Ears, &amp; by the Eys: and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whilest he passes through the
by-Lanes and Streets, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that he never fall into
that debauchery.</p>
            <p>Now to the end he may
receive no harm by being
seen, there are divers things
to be considered. Deprive
him of all over-costly Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
and superfluous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
let him wear his Hair
modestly short, and if the
Boy take it hainously, as if
he were disfigured by it,
teach him this first, That it
is the greatest Ornament.</p>
            <p>Now that he may not
gaze, sufficient to preserve
him will be those stories of
the Sons of God, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55027:50"/>
happened on the Daughters
of Men, and of the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
Hell, and such like
instances. Here then must
the Governour and he that
waits on him, be wonderfull
carefull and sollicitous, shew
him therefore other beautifull

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts, drawing away his
eyes from these things: Such
as are the Heavens, the Stars,
the Flowers of the Earth, the
Meadows, fair Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
These therefore let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
his eyes withal; and
there are many other objects
besides, which are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive:
For it is a Port ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
difficult to guard;
for as much as it has a fire
burning within, and a kind
of natural necessity as I may
say. Teach him some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Verses. And thus, unless
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55027:51"/>
he be inwardly incited, he
will not care to be seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
Be sure that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

permit him to haunt their

            <p>Let him often hear the

and now learn the things
which concern the Kingdom
of Heaven: What a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
there's laid up for those
which are Chast. Promise

that you will make him your

disobedient: And talk thus
to him. We shall never

and an access of Virtue. If

amongst many persons is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

onely excepted: Suffer him
to be hold no Woman. Give
him no Gold, let nothing
that is sordid once enter into
him: but teach him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
pleasure, and all such
like things.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Gate
behind, which hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
to the former;
but which goes through the
whole body. We call it the
Touch. Indeed one would
imagine it shut, yet as if it
were of all the rest the most
open, it admits entrance to
all. Let us neither suffer this
to be acquainted either with
soft clothing or bodies; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him more hardy, we are
bringing up a Champion,
and let us seriously mind it:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55027:53"/>
permit him neither to use soft
coverings, nor soft garments,
and thus let matters be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Go to then, and entering
into this City, let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
Laws, and make Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
For now the Gates
are in posture: And in the first
place take we diligent notice
of the Houses, &amp; of the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
where the Citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
those which are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect,
and those which are dissolute.</p>
            <p>They report, that the place
and habitation of Anger is
the Breast, and the Heart,
which is in the Breast, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
in the Liver, and
the Understanding in the
Brain. The first is both a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55027:54"/>
Virtue and a Vice. Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Modesty is a Vertue;
Rashness and Morosity a
Vice. Likewise the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtue
of Concupiscence, is Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Luxury a Vice. The
Virtue of the Intellect is Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the Vice, Folly. Let
us there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore have a care that
Virtues be produced in those
places, and that they bring
forth such as are good, not
evil Citizens. For these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns
are as it were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parents of all our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But let us now proceed to
the Tyrant, Anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that to be altogether
cut off in a Youth, nor upon
all occasions to be used: But
thus let us instruct him from
the Cradle, That being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55027:54"/>
he bear it patiently, and
that when they perceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man wronged, they
stoutly revenge it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the person is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
in a due and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
manner take his part. But
how should this be? when
they are train'd up to it in
their own servants. Being
under-valu'd, are not impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
being disobey'd, are
not outragious; but rather
vindicate that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against others: But
in these Cases let the Father
be always A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>biter, and when
they transgress the Orders
it behoves him to be sharp
and severe, as when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and observe them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be kind and gentle,
enticing and alluring the
Child with many rewards:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55027:55"/>
For with this method God
governs the world, by the
fear of Hell, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Kingdom; and so
should we our Children,
permitting them to be vexed
now and then, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and tryal of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y may learn
how to govern their Passions
amongst the Domesticks.</p>
            <p>And as in a wrestling place,
before they play the Prize,
they daily exercise with their
companions, that making
their party good with them,
they may the more easily
vanquish their Antagonists:
So should a Child be educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at home. And let his
Father or his Brother fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cross his humours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the rest, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55027:55"/>
contend for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or else some other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him that he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in that other person;
thus the servants may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
provoke him, right
or wrong, that so he may be
taught every where to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and qualifie his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
seeing if the Father one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incite him, it will be no such
great matter: For the very
name of Father praepossessing
the mind, does not suffer
him to turn again and make
head; but let his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and servants, and such
as are ingenuously born do
it, that by them he may be
taught moderation.</p>
            <p>There is yet another. What
is that? When ever he is
angry, put him in mind of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55027:56"/>
his proper Passions: When
he is offended against a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
whether he himself ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed a fault, and
what he would be, if he were
in his place: But in case he
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him striking the Servant,
meet him with revenge; and
if he extreamly wrong him,
chastise him again for it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffer him to be too soft
and remiss, nor over churlish
and morose; in as much as
he is a Man, and should be
affable and courteous. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
indeed he may have a
worthy occasion for his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as if hereafter he should
have Children of his own,
or himself be a Master of
Servants, in such a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Anger were very usefull.
Then onely it is unprofit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble,
when we revenge our selves.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55027:56"/>
And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> never
made use of it himself, but
for their sakes only who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the wrong. Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
seeing his brother injured,<note place="margin">Exod. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

had recourse to his anger, and
that stoutly;<note place="margin">Num. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men the most meek: but
when afterward he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
injured, he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it, but fled away. These
Discourses inculcate into
him. For whilst we are thus
trimming the Gates, they
have great need of such plain
narrations. But when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the City, we begin
to Discipline the Citizens,
'twill then be fit to discourse
to them of sublimer matters.
But let this Law be fixed in
him, that he never revenge
himselfe being injured or
wronged, nor ever permit
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55027:57"/>
him to despise another who
suffereth the like.</p>
            <p>His very father shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
better, who by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in these matters,
may himself be instructed;
or in case he do it for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, he shall become
better then himself, least he
set a bad example before his
child. And therefore let him
learn to be despised, and to
suffer contempt, exacting
nothing of the servants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
himself is Free-born:
but upon many occasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns
serve rather himself. Let
his servants take care only of
such things, as he cannot so
handsomly perform in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
For instance, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should not be his own
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook; for it is not decent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55027:57"/>
that quitting those Studies
which become a Gentleman,
he should give his mind to
this inferior employment.
But if there be occasion to
wash his feet, never let him
make use of a servant, let
himself do it. And by this
means, thou shalt render
him ingenuous, mild, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
to the servants. Nor
permit any body to bring
him his cloths, nor in the
Bath to use any Ceremony
to him; but let him perform
there all necessaries himself.
This will make the youth
robust, not disdainful, but
affable and meek. Teach
him also those things which
concern Nature, What a
Servant is, What a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Say to him, Child,

            <p>It is now time that we
speak of <hi>Concupiscence.</hi> Here
also <hi>Chastity</hi> is two-fold,
and the violation of it a
double loss. I conceive that
young Men should neither
be dishonestly loved, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestly
love young Maids.
Physitians say, That pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the fifteenth
year, youths are vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inflamed with the Lust
of Concupiscence. How
shall we now fetter this

put on it? I know of no

               </gap>
it self. First therefore, let
us be carefull that he neither
see nor hear any thing which
is filthy; nor by any means
suffer an ingenuous Youth to
frequent the <hi>Theater.</hi> But if he
seek for these pleasures, if you
know of any his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries
which deny themselves
that vanity, shew them to
him, that by their example
he may be reduced: For
there is nothing in the world
which does sooner redress it,
then Emu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation, no, not
any. And in every thing
else let us observe this rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
especially if you perceive
him to be of an emulous
disposition. It is a great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55027:61"/>

fear, or promises, or
whatsoever else.</p>
            <p>To these let us devise some
other innocent divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
bring him to Holy
Men, grant him relaxation,
and give him rewards, that
thereby his mind may be the

               </gap> troubled at it; And in
stead of these Spectacles,
propose to him some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Story; Talk to him of
Meadows, of sumptuous
Buildings, and afterwards
wheel off your Discourse
with an Application. Tell
him, These Spectacles, Son,
are for base and servile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to behold naked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
speaking immodestly.
Promise me that thou wilt
not hear nor say any thing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55027:62"/>
that is dishonest, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thee to go: But it cannot
be, it is impossible, that
thou shouldest there hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is vile. The
things that are there acted,
are unworthy thy Eyes (my
Son.) And in saying this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
let us kiss and embrace him,
that he may perceive how
dearly we love him.</p>
            <p>With all these stratagems
let us entice him. What
then? As I said already, let
a young Maid never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him, nor do any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
about him, but some
ancient Maid or Woman
that is well stricken in years.
Discourse to him concerning
the Kingdome, and of such
as have been illustrious for
their Chastity; as well those

without <hi>the Pale,</hi> as amongst

let us perpetually fill his

that excel in Chastity
and Sobriety, propose them
likewise for Examples, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would be a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
that a Servant should
be modest, and that a free

               </gap>,
and what is it? Let
him learn to Fast, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
yet twice a Week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> at
least: Cause him to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Church. And
when the Father walks with
him abroad, towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
at the time that the
Shows are done, and the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55027:63"/>
               <hi>Theaters</hi> dissolved, let him
shew him those that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
away, and laugh at the
old Fools, who as yet have
not the discretion of Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and at the young Men
who are fired with filthy
lusts. Then let him ask the
Boy, What he thinks all
they have gain'd? Truly
nothing at all but shame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and damnation. This
will prove of no small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to Chastity, that
he abstain both from the
Spectacles, and from the
Discourse.</p>
            <p>But besides all this, let him
be taught another thing, and
that is, That he pray to God
with all diligence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction.

many encouragements;
and of this let his Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all that hear it: Let
the Virgins seeing him, look
on him with a reverend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem:
Besides, the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the awe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the promises which are
made, and with these the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
reposited for him of

conduce to the repute of
Chastity and all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
wonderfully restrain
the mind of the young Man,
and produce in us most chast
cogitations.</p>
            <p>There is one more yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
let us therefore now
proceed to that which is the
chief of all, and which keeps
all entire; and what is that?
Namely, <hi>Prudence.</hi> Here
must be infinite care used,
that he be discreet, and that
he abandon and banish all
folly; and this is a special
and grand point of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
that he comprehend
those things which are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and what there is laid
up for the future: Of Hell,
and the things which concern
the Kingdome of Heaven,

Judgement in secular and
humane affairs as is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This, this is the very
sum and top of all Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
That he be not taken
up with impertinent and

therefore that Riches avai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing, worldly Glory no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
Power nothing; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
Death; nothing, this
present Life: Thus he shall
indeed become a Wise Man.
And if educated in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
we conduct him to his
Nuptials, consider how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a portion thou bringest
to his Bride.</p>
            <p>But let us now celebrate
the Marriage, not with Pipes,
and Harps, and Dancing;
with these kind of things to

disgrace the Bridegroom thus
educated, it is highly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous:
Let us rather invite
Christ thither, such a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
is worthy of him; let
us bid his Disciples: These
things well become him. And
now let him henceforth thus
learn to instruct his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

and they theirs; and thus it
will become a Golden Chain
indeed.</p>
