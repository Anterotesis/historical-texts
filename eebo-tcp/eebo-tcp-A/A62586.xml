            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUR Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> (who are pleased to call themselves <hi>Unitarians</hi>) having not only Disputed, but most Blasphemously Ridiculed the Doctrine of the <hi>B. Trinity;</hi> for the Conviction of such <hi>Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers,</hi> and the Confirmation of <hi>Others,</hi> it is thought fit to Publish the following Discourse, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Collected from the Learned Works of <hi>Archbishop</hi> TILLOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, and <hi>Bishop</hi> STIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINGFLEET.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE <hi>B. TRINITY.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> WHY do you believe the Doctrine of the Trinity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because it is a very Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Doctrine, that is, there is the highest Reason to believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49529:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you mean by this word <hi>Trinity?</hi> And, What Doctrines concerning it are proposed to our Belief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I shall Answer this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the very words of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I am fully perswaded, is Orthodox and Catholick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without Body, Parts, or Passions; of infinite Power, Wisdom and Goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in Unity of this Godhead there be Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of One Substance, Power and Eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi> 
               <bibl>Art. 1.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49529:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>The Catholick Faith is this, That we worship one God in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons; nor divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one; the Glory equal; the Majesty coeternal. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not Three Gods, but One God.</hi> Athan. Creed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is very meet, right, and our bounden Duty, that we should at all times, and in all places give thanks unto thee, O Lord Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Everlasting God. Who art One
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49529:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, one Lord; not one only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but three Persons in one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For that which we believe of the Glory of the Father, the same we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, without any difference or inequality.</hi> Pref. on the Feast of Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O holy, blessed and glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Three Persons and One God, have mercy upon us miserable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Lit.</p>
            <p>This is what we believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Trinity. And that this is very Rational Doctrine; and that we have the highest Reason thus to believe, I shall endeavour to evince, when I have first explained the Nature of <hi>Faith</hi> in General, by shewing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49529:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
What it is to <hi>Believe;</hi> and what this act <hi>Believe</hi> doth denote when applied to any Object.</p>

               <q>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49529:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I could never have known it, unless it had been Revealed; and now it is Revealed, I am not able to comprehend it) yet since it is testified and declared by an All-knowing, and most just and faithful God, who can neither deceive nor be deceived, I do therefore give my Assent unto it, as a most credible Truth, and as such, I do firmly believe it.</p>
            <p>Now that God, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Wisdom and Knowledge, doth fully know himself, and perfectly understand his own Nature: And also, that <hi>He</hi> who is infinitely Good and Faithful cannot deceive us (<hi>for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

for God to Lye</hi>) this I shall not pretend to prove, but can fairly suppose it, as being granted by the <hi>Socinians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The only thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>us</hi> to prove, and which <hi>they</hi> deny, is this, <hi>viz. That the Doctrine of the Trinity is Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Almighty God.</hi> For if we can make it appear, that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Wise and Faithful God hath Revealed it; we shall then easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince them, That there is the highest Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How then do you prove that God hath Revealed it? Where hath God told us, That there are Three distinct Persons, in the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49529:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Divine Essence and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Were I to Discourse an <hi>Atheist,</hi> or a <hi>Deist,</hi> then, since all Conviction must be <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessis,</hi> I ought to prove these <hi>Two</hi> Things,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Possibility and Necessity of Divine Revelation.</item>
               <item>2. That the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> which by way of Eminency we call the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, do contain this Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. And that in these Books God hath Revealed so much of his own Nature, as is necessary for us to know in order to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49529:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>But since these <hi>Unitarians</hi> do profess themselves Christians, and consequently to believe the Holy Scriptures, I shall have so much Charity for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as to suppose it: And shall treat them as such. And then the only thing I am to prove, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Doctrine of the Trinity is Revealed in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But neither the word <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> nor the word <hi>Person</hi> are to be found in Scripture. How then can you pretend to prove a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Persons from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>Though neither the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> nor perhaps <hi>Person,</hi> in

the Sense in which it is used by <hi>Divines</hi> when they treat of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> be any where to be met with in <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet it cannot be denied but that <hi>Three</hi> are there spoken of by the Names of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in whose Name every <hi>Christian</hi> is Baptized, and to each of whom the highest <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi> attributed. And these <hi>Three</hi> are spoken of with as much distinction from one another, as we use to speak of <hi>Three</hi> several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So that though the word <hi>Trinity</hi> be not found in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> yet these <hi>Three</hi> are there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49529:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expresly and frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And <hi>Trinity</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Three</hi> of any Thing.

                  <hi>Three</hi> several <hi>Persons,</hi> I cannot
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49529:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
see any reason why in the Explication of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> which purely depends upon Divine Revelation, we should not speak of it in the same manner as the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth. And though the word <hi>Person</hi> is now become a <hi>Term of Art,</hi> I see no cause why we should decline it, so long as we mean by it neither more nor less than what the <hi>Scripture</hi> says in other words.</q>

                  <hi>We assert Three Persons in the Godhead,</hi> Not because we find them in the <hi>Athanasian Creed;</hi> but because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath Revealed that there are <hi>Three,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to whom the Divine Nature and Attributes are given. This we verily Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Scripture hath Revealed; and that there are a great many Places, of which we think no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sense can be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and therefore we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert this Doctrine on the same Grounds, on which we believe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49529:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Scriptures. And if there are <hi>Three Persons</hi> which have the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> attributed to them; what must we do in this Case? Must we cast off the <hi>Unity of the Divine Essence?</hi> No, that is too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and plainly asserted for us to call it into Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Must we reject those Scriptures which attribute Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to the Son and Holy Ghost, as well as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? That we cannot do, unless we cast off those Books of Scripture, wherein those things are contained.</q>

               <q>Whatever speaks a direct Repugnancy to any of the Fundamental Dictates of Nature, cannot be of Divine Revelation.</q>

               </bibl> And therefore since Truth is never contrary to it self, is it not impertinent to prove this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49529:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Trinity by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which is not only <hi>above</hi> Reason, but plainly <hi>contrary</hi> to it?</p>

               <q>As to its being <hi>above</hi> Reason, which they are loth to admit any thing to be; this I think will bear no great Dispute: Because if they would be pleased to speak out, they can mean no more by this, but that our <hi>Reason</hi> is not able fully to comprehend it. But what then? Are there no <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> in Religion? <hi>That</hi> I am sure they will not say, because God, whose Infinite Nature and Perfections, are the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greatest <hi>Mystery</hi> of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49529:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all other, and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible. But <hi>we</hi> must not, nay <hi>they</hi> will not for this reason deny, that there is such a Being as God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Religion, it is no reasonable Objection against them, that we cannot fully comprehend them: Because all <hi>Mysteries,</hi> in what kind soever, whether in <hi>Religion,</hi> or in <hi>Nature,</hi> so long, and so far as they are <hi>Mysteries,</hi> are for that very reason incomprehensible.</q>

               <q>There are many things likewise in our <hi>Selves,</hi> which no man is able in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to comprehend, as to the manner how they are done and performed. As the <hi>Vital Union</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> Who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49529:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can imagine by what device or means a <hi>Spirit</hi> comes to be so closely united, and so firmly link'd to a <hi>Material Body,</hi> that they are not to be parted without great force and violence offer'd to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? The like may be said of the Operations of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> of <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and especially of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of our <hi>Wills.</hi> And yet we certainly find all these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in our selves, though we cannot either comprehend or explain the particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the several Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of them are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus you see, by these <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> that it is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reason to believe a great many things to be, of the manner of whose Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence we are not able to give a particular and distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And much less is it repugnant to Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49529:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those things concerning God, which we are very well assured he hath declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, though these things by our Reason should be incomprehensible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And this is truly the Case as to the matter now under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. We are sufficiently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and that this <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is therein declared to us. Now that we cannot comprehend it, is no sufficient Reason not to believe it. For if it were a good Reason for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, then no Man ought to believe that there is a God, because his Nature is most
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49529:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certainly incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But we are assured by many Arguments that there is a God; and the same <hi>natural Reason</hi> which assures us, that <hi>He is,</hi> doth likwise assure us that <hi>He is incomprehensible;</hi> and therefore our believing him to be so, doth by no means overthrow our Belief of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In like manner, we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the truth of this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> and being once assured of <hi>that,</hi> our not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able fully to comprehend it, is not reason enough to stagger our belief of it. A Man cannot deny what he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49529:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sees, though the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of admitting it, may be something which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend. One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the frame of this World which he sees with his eyes, though from thence it will necessarily follow, that either <hi>that</hi> or something else must be of it self: Which yet is a thing, which no man can comprehend how it can be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And by the same Reason a man must not deny what God says, to be true; though he cannot comprehend many things which God says: As particularly concerning this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> It ought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49529:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then to satisfy us that there is sufficient Evidence, that this Doctrine is delivered in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and that what is there declared concerning it, doth not imply a Contradiction. For why should our <hi>finite</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings pretend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> or to Know all the real <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> that are consistent with the <hi>Unity</hi> of an Infinite Being; or to be able fully to explain this <hi>Mystery</hi> by any similitude or resemblance taken from <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Beings?</hi>

of it, in which the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go, beyond what God hath thought fit to reveal to us in <hi>Scripture</hi> concerning it, the more we are entangled; and that which men are pleased to call an explaining of it, does, in my apprehension, often make it more obscure, that is, less plain than it was before.

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49529:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet I dare not pretend to that, knowing both the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and danger of such an Attempt, and mine own insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All that I ever designed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument, was to make out the Credibility of the Thing from the Authority of the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out descending to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explication of it than the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath given us: Lest by endeavouring to lay the <hi>Difficulties</hi> which are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy started about it, new ones should be raised, and such as may, perhaps, be much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be removed, than those we have now to grapple withal.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49529:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nor indeed do I see that it is any ways necessary to do more; it being sufficient that God hath declared what he thought fit in this matter, and that we do firmly believe what he says concerning it to be true, though we do not perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the meaning of all that he hath said about it.</q>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 'Tis a seasonable Service to the Christian Church in general, and our own in particular, that a Person so eminent for Learning and Prudence, hath at this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture undertaken the Defence of the B.

which he could not see any just occasion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For however thoughtful Men may think to escape some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Difficulties better, by going out of the common Roads; yet they may meet with others, which they did not foresee, which may make them as well as Others judge it, at last, a wiser and safer course to keep in the same way, which the Christian Church hath used ever since it hath agreed to express her Sense in such <hi>Terms,</hi> which were thought most proper for that purpose.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I shall draw up the Charge in their own Words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Theirs,</hi> they say, <hi>is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable and Reasonable Faith, but that of the</hi> Trinitarians <hi>is absurd, and contrary both to Reason and to it self; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only false but impossible.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49529:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>But wherein lies this <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?</hi> That they soon tell us. <q>
                  <hi>Because we affirm that there are Three Persons, who are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and each of them true God, and yet there is but One true God. Now,</hi> say they, <hi>this is an Error in counting or numbring, which when stood in, is of all others the most Brutal and inexcusable; and not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it, is not to be a Man.</hi>

               <q>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49529:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For, <hi>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>saying, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, yet not Three Gods, but One God; a man first distinctly numbers Three Gods, and then in summing them up, brutishly says, not Three Gods, but one God.</hi> V.

               <q>This is their Charge. And 'tis very freely spoken, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, not merely to our Church, but the Christian World; which owns this Creed to be a <hi>just and true Explication</hi> of the Doctrine of the Trinity. But there are some Creatures as remarkable for their untoward Kicking, as for their Stupidity.</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is strange boldness in men to talk thus of Monstrous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in things above their reach. But some have so used themselves to the Language of <hi>Jargon, Nonsense, Contradiction, Impossibility,</hi> that it comes from them, as some men swear,

            <p>But that the Rudeness of these <hi>Unitarians,</hi> in thus condemning the Christian Church, may more fully appear, let us proceed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry distinctly to examine this matter. Do <hi>you</hi> therefore, <hi>First,</hi> give their Objection its full strength, and <hi>then,</hi> through Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance, I'll return you my Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are not <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Three distinct Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis granted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49529:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are not <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Three distinct different Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Who doubts it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not a Contradiction to say, That <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>James,</hi> or that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are <hi>Peter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This likewise must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not a Contradiction to affirm, That <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> being Three Men, are but One Man? And is it not equally absurd to Declare, That One Man is these Three Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Sure I cannot be mistaken in the Notion of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Three.</hi> But am most certain, That <hi>One</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49529:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not <hi>Three,</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> are not <hi>One.</hi> But what of all this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Observe what follows. Are not the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (according to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasian</hi> Creed) Three distinct different Divine Persons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I firmly believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And if these Three Divine Persons, <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are <hi>Three</hi> Gods, is it not a Contradiction to say, there is but <hi>One</hi> God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To say, there are <hi>Three</hi> Gods, and yet but <hi>One</hi> God, is doubtless a Contradiction. But who affirms, There are <hi>Three</hi> Gods?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49529:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. That Creed expresly saith, There are not <hi>Three</hi> Gods, but <hi>One</hi> God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If you will not renounce your Reason, I do thus prove it to you. <hi>The Father is God, There is</hi> One. <hi>The Son is God, There is</hi> Two. <hi>The Holy Ghost is God, There is</hi> Three. Are not here <hi>Three</hi> Gods? Do you think me such a Fool, that I cannot count, <hi>One, Two,</hi> and <hi>Three?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thus indeed the <hi>Unitarians</hi> do wisely argue. <q>But can these
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49529:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Men of Sense and Reason think, that the Point in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy ever was, Whether in Numbers, <hi>One could be Three,</hi> or <hi>Three One?</hi> If they think so, I wonder they do not think of another thing; which is, the begging all <hi>Trinitarians</hi> for <hi>Fools;</hi> because they cannot count <hi>One, Two</hi> and <hi>Three;</hi> and an <hi>Unitarian</hi> Jury would certainly cast them. One would think such Writers had never gone beyond <hi>Shop-books;</hi> for they take it for granted, that all depends upon <hi>Counting.</hi> But these terrible Charges were some of the most common and trite Objections of Infidels. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> mentions it as such
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49529:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he saith; <hi>The Infidels some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interrogant enim nos aliquando Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles, &amp; dicunt, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem quem dicitis, Deum dicitis?

                  <hi>ask us, What do you call the Father? we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, God. What the Son? we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, God. What the Holy Ghost? we answer, God.</hi> So that here the Infidels make the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and draw the very same Inference. <hi>Then,</hi> say they, <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are three Gods.</hi> But what saith St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49529:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this? Had he no more skill in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> than to say, <hi>there are Three, and yet but One?</hi> He saith plainly <hi>that there are not three Gods. The Infidels are troubled, because they are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; their heart is shut up, because they are without Faith.</hi> By which it is plain, he look'd on these as the proper Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Infidels, and not of Christians.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But St. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth not give it over so. <hi>When you begin</hi>

the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> being <hi>Three</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are <hi>One</hi> God; as it is to say, that <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> being <hi>Three</hi> Persons, are <hi>One</hi> Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If I rightly apprehend them, their Argument is this. <hi>Three Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Persons are Three Men,</hi> Therefore <hi>Three Divine Persons are Three Gods.</hi> And this they repeat with great Triumph in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Pamphlets.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49529:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their words; they join so much Confidence with so very little appearance of Reason.

Do they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Divine Nature capable of such <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> by Individuals, as Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is?</q>
            </p>

For it is a good Rule of <hi>Boethius, Talia sunt praedicata, qualia subjecta permiserint.</hi> We must not say that there are Persons in the Trinity, but in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; and if that be not capable of <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> then the Persons must be in the same undivided Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. </q>

the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Nature. The <hi>Humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being <hi>finite,</hi> is capable of Division, Multiplication and Separation.

               <q>Now the Divine Essence is that alone which makes God; <hi>that</hi> can be but <hi>One,</hi> and therefore there can be no more Gods than One. But because the same Scripture, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us of the Unity of the Divine Essence, doth likewise join the Son and Holy Ghost in the same Attributes, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Worship, therefore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49529:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to the mutual Relations, we may reckon <hi>Three,</hi> but as to the Divine Essence, <hi>that</hi> can be no more than <hi>One.</hi>

               <q>To understand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rightly, we must consider that when the <hi>Socinian Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets</hi> first came abroad, some years since, a Learned and Worthy Person of our Church,

who had appeared with great Vigour and Reason against our Adversaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the late Reign (which ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten) undertook to defend the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>History of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> and the <hi>Notes of the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Creed:</hi> But in the warmth of Disputing, and out of a desire to make this matter more intelligible, he suffer'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himself to be carried beyond the ancient Methods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Church hath used to express her Sense by, still retaining the same Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of <hi>three Persons in one undivided Essence,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

For if every Person must have a peculiar Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his own, and there be Three Persons, there must be Three peculiar Substances.

But where these things cannot be, there the <hi>same Essence</hi> must remain

undivided; but with such <hi>Relative Properties</hi> as cannot be confounded.</q>

Beings.</hi> So true it is, that whosoever acknowledges Three Persons in the Godhead (if he takes the word in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must admit Three Gods.

               <q>The full and adequate Definition of a <hi>Person</hi> (from which the <hi>Learned Doctor</hi> doth. draw his Argument, and the <hi>Unitarians</hi> their Objection) is not this, as they suppose, <hi>viz. A Person is an Intelligent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49529:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For this is but part of the Definition. But the full and adequate Definition of a <hi>Person</hi> is this. <hi>A Person is a compleat Intelligent Substance, with a peculiar manner of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.</hi> So that, An <hi>Individual Intelligent Substance,</hi> is rather supposed to the making of a <hi>Person,</hi> than the proper Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of it. For a <hi>Person</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to something which doth distinguish it from another <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Substance</hi> in the <hi>same Nature:</hi> and therefore the Foundation of it lies in the <hi>peculiar manner of Subsistence,</hi> which agrees to One, and to none else of the kind; and this is it which is called <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality.</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:49529:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, I say, in a meer <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being,</hi> but in that <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner of Subsistence</hi> in that Being, which can be in no other. So that the proper Reason of <hi>Personality,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one Person is constituted and distinguished from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is the <hi>peculiar manner of Subsistence,</hi> whereby one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath such Properties as are incommunicable to any other.</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>V. Vind. p.</hi> 260, <hi>&amp;</hi> 72.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>From these Premises we are instructed, Why in the Blessed Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are <hi>Three</hi> Persons, and yet but <hi>One</hi> God. The Reason is this,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49529:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, are but <hi>One</hi> God; because the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence, Nature, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which alone makes God, is intirely <hi>One,</hi> and is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Separation, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication or Division. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there can be no more Gods than <hi>One.</hi> But since these <hi>Three,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, have each of them <hi>a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner of Subsistence;</hi> That is, each of these <hi>Three</hi> hath <hi>a peculiar Property, incommunicable</hi> to any other; Therefore as to their mutual Relations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonalities they are <hi>Three,</hi> but as to the Divine Essence and Godhead, they are but <hi>One.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49529:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this is so far from being contrary to Reason, as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> pretend, that it is highly Rational to Believe, <hi>a Trinity in Unity.</hi> That is, <hi>Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons, and yet but One God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> The <hi>Unitarians</hi> pretend that the Case is parallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Pray give me their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their own words; and then I shall instruct you, what Answer to return to these Men of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 
               <q>I find that the Belief of a Trinity does Contradict Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

as much as Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now who should not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an Opinion perfectly parallel with Transubstantiation, and equally fruitful in Incongruities and Contradictions? Well then, if the Trinity implies no less Contradiction than Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; why can't we say, that it cannot be contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? We say, Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because it is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to our Reason; but if the Trinity be also a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to our Reason, why shan't we be allowed to say, that it cannot be contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>V.

were the Press as free for the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> as 'tis for other Protestants; how easily would they make it appear, that the Follies and Contradictions so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged on Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; are neither for Number, Consequence, nor Clearness, any way comparable to those implied in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed; and that the Trinity hath the same, and no other, Foundation with Transubstantiation?

               <hi>A.</hi> You must give me leave to add; <q>I did not expect to have found this <hi>Parallel</hi> so often insisted upon, without an Answer to <hi>Two Dialogues</hi> purposely written on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, at a time when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was used as an Argument to bring in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as that is now

now alledged for casting off the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But I must do them that right to tell the World, That at that time a <hi>Socinian</hi> Answer was written to those <hi>Dialogues,</hi> which I saw, and wished it might be Printed, that the World might be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about it and them. But they thought fit to forbear. And in all their late Pamphlets where this <hi>Parallel</hi> is so often repeated, there is but once, that I can find, any notice taken of those <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and that in a very superficial manner: for the main Design and Scope of them is past over.</q>

               <hi>Q.</hi> First; Let us examine, whether there be equal Reason for the Belief of these Two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>If this Suggestion of theirs be of any force, we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49529:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must suppose that there is equal Evidence and Proof from <hi>Scripture</hi> for these <hi>Two Doctrines.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How do you prove there is not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>From the Confession of our Adversaries themselves. For several Learned <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> can neither be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly proved, nor necessarily concluded from <hi>Scripture.</hi> But this the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did never acknowledge concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> but have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49529:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
always appealed to the clear and undeniable Testimonies of <hi>Scripture</hi> for the Proof of these <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And then the whole force of the Objection amounts to this; That if I am bound to Believe what I am sure God says, though I cannot Comprehend it; then I am bound by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe the greatest Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity in the World, though I have no manner of assurance of any <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> You think then, that as there is not equal reason for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, so neither is there equal reason for the rejecting of these Two Doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49529:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>This the <hi>Objection</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; Which yet cannot be supposed but upon one or both of these Two Grounds. Either
<list>
                     <item>1. Because these Two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are equally <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.</hi> Or,</item>
                     <item>2. Because they are equally loaded with <hi>Absurdities</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> As to the First; Is not the Trinity as Incomprehensible as Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and as such equally to be rejected?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49529:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>It is not good ground of <hi>rejecting</hi> any <hi>Doctrine,</hi> merely because it is <hi>Incomprehensible;</hi> as I have abundantly shewed already. But besides this, there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween plain matters of <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> concerning God. And it does by no means follow, that if a man do once admit any thing concerning God which he cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,</hi> he hath no reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to Believe what he himself <hi>Sees.</hi> This is a most unreasonable and destructive way of arguing, because it strikes at the Foundation of all Certainty, and sets every
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49529:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Man at Liberty to deny the most plain and evident <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> if he may not be humoured in having the absurdest things in the World admitted for true. The next step will be to persuade us, that we may as well deny the Being of <hi>God,</hi> because his Nature is <hi>incomprehensible</hi> by our <hi>Reason,</hi> as deny <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> because it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>contradicts</hi> our <hi>Senses.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> As Transubstantiation evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contradicts our Senses; So these <hi>Unitarians</hi> pretend, that the Trinity as evidently contradicts our Reason. And then, <hi>say they,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49529:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not these Two Doctrines load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the like Absurdities and Contradictions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>So far from this, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as it is delivered in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and hath already been explained, hath no Absurdity or Contradiction either invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, or necessarily conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is big with all imaginable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity and Contradiction.</q> As the <hi>Unitarians</hi> themselves do acknowledge: And therefore I am not now concerned to prove it.</p>

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49529:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> However you are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend the <hi>Trinity.</hi> The Contradictions and Absurdities of which (as these <hi>Unitarians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) are as great as those of Transubstantiation.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> I cannot help their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.

And that I may do it the more effectually, I shall desire <hi>You</hi> (as their Advocate, and in their Name) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce those Absurdities which appear the most dreadful.</p>

               <q>I shall reduce all to these Two, which comprehend the rest.
<list>
                     <item>1. How there can be Three Persons, and but One God.</item>
                     <item>2. How these can agree in a Third, and not agree among themselves.</item>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>For the</hi> First, <hi>it seems very absurd, that there should be Three Persons really distinct, whereof every one is God, and yet there should not be Three Gods. For nothing is more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious, than to make Three not to be Three; or Three to be but One.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>

               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>I hope now you will give me leave to make an Answer to your Difficulty, as distinct as possible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is very true, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Arithmetick, <hi>Three cannot be One, nor One Three.</hi> But we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bare Numeration, and the Things numbred. The repetition of <hi>three Units,</hi> certainly makes <hi>three</hi> distinct Numbers; but it doth not make <hi>Three Persons</hi> to be <hi>Three Natures.</hi> And therefore as to the Things themselves, we must go from the bare <hi>Numbers</hi> to consider their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49529:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <q>We do not say, that <hi>Three</hi> Persons are but <hi>One</hi> Person, or that <hi>One</hi> Nature is <hi>Three</hi> Natures; but that there are <hi>Three Persons in One Nature.</hi> If therefore One Individual Nature be communicable to Three Persons, there is no appearance of Absurdity in this Doctrine. And on the other side, it will be impossible there should be three Gods, where there is one and the same Individual Nature. For Three Gods must have Three several Divine Natures, since it is the Divine Essence which makes a God.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 
               <q>But yet you have not Answer'd the other great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Point of Reason, <hi>viz. That those Things which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or disagree in a Third, must agree or disagree One with the Other.</hi> And therefore if the Father be God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God; then the Father must be Son and Holy Ghost, and the Son and Holy Ghost must be the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49529:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Father. If not, then they are really the same, and really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct; the same as to Essence, distinct as to Persons; and so they are the same, and not the same, which is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>Now I think you have drawn out the most refined Spirits of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> to make the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> parallel, because, you say, it implies a Contradiction; Which is the nearest Parallel you have yet offered at. But this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Argument is grounded on this mistaken Supposition, viz. <hi>That the Divine Essence is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49529:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no more capable of communicating it self to Three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, than any Created Being is.</hi> The Reason of that <hi>Axiom</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That Created Things, by reason of their finite Nature, cannot diffuse or communicate themselves to more than one; and therefore those which agree in a Third, must agree together. But supposing it possible that the same finite Nature could extend it self to several Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, it would be presently answered; The <hi>Axiom</hi> did hold only, where they did adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reciprocally agree, and not where they did agree on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Essence,</hi> but differ'd in the manner of <hi>Subsistence.</hi> For
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49529:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where a different manner of Subsistence is supposed possible, in the same Individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Agreement in that cannot take away that Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is consistent with it; which we attribute to the unlimitedness and perfection of the Divine Nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 
               <q>But you can bring no other Instance but the thing in Question; and therefore this is a <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> or taking that for granted which is in Dispute.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 
               <q>I do not think it to be so, where the Reason is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed from the peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Divine Nature,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49529:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to which there can be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. And I think it very unreasonable in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to send us to Created Beings for the Rules and Measures of our Judgment, concerning a Being acknowledg'd to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 
               <q>Are not the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Infinite, as well as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? And therefore as Created Persons do take in the whole Nature, so Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will do the Infinite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>

               <q>No question, but the <hi>Persons</hi> are Infinite in regard of the <hi>Nature</hi> which is so; but if

               <q>I answer; that infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Number is no Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and as to the Number of Persons, we follow not our own Conjectures, nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; but <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> which hath assured us, that there is but <hi>One God,</hi> and yet <hi>there are
