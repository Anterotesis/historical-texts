            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AS to our Meeting Yeſterday, the Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came about Ten in the Morning: Proclamation was made. The Meeting not departing immediately thereupon he cauſed the Doors to be Nailed up upon them, (having firſt ſent ſeven Men Friends hither) and ſo kept Eight<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and fourteen till three in the Afternoon, (which was five Hours in that Confinement in their Meeting Room) allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way out for any Neceſſity: Which was not only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, but an Inhumane Act.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon, the Meeting was at the Door of the other Meeting-houſe; whereto came <hi>Tilly,</hi> &amp;c. This Meeting began, as uſual, about Twelve. Friends not departing on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were Faſtened in, there alſo; and kept in the Rain (it being an open Court) till between four and five in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. And then many, or moſt of them, were had to the <hi>Tolzey,</hi> before the Deputy Mayor <hi>John Hix.</hi> Who after a while was pleaſed to let them all go home, to appear to day, which many of them did. The Proſecutors aime to make a Riot of this Afternoon Meeting: Becauſe when the Door was opened, our Friends preſſed to go out, to go to their Homes. The Juſtices to day could not accord about it: So they were diſmiſt till to Morrow Morning. A more punctual Account, I hope ſome Friends will ſend up. The ſeven men were ſent for from hence alſo, and Diſcharged. Doubtleſs its not the Kings mind, that under colour of Execution of the Law, we ſhould be abuſed contrary thereunto. We are now Nineteen Priſoners here.</p>

               <p>LAſt Poſt a ſhort Account was given of the Diſturbance of our two Meetings the laſt Firſt day, the Iſſue of which was not determined till Yeſterday, when a Jury was Impannelled, in order to Enquire after a Riot. <hi>Patrick</hi> the Abuſive Conſtable and Informer, Swore at a great rate, and ſo did another, (whoſe Name I have not yet an Account of.) The ſubſtance was, that about Thirty of the Women came and forcibly opened the Door, and laying Hands on him, they Reſcued themſelves from the place they were Confined to.</p>
               <p>The Juſtices were not very Credulous of the Informers, knowing the Improbability of our Women Friends laying Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109683:2"/>
Hands on the Officers; ſo gave the Women liberty to make their own Defence, which was performed in good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and very Succinct. They told the Juſtices, how they were there Peaceably met. And how the Officers and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Guarded the Door, and Impriſoned them; by reaſon they did not immediately depart, after their Proclamation. That after this Confinement, they took liberty to call out ſix or eight, (one while) and diſmiſs them. Then to call again, and do the ſame to another, ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Further, the one Informer commanded ſeveral of them to <hi>Bridewell:</hi> And yet <hi>Helliar</hi> called them back, after they were far on their way; and remanded them to the Confinement at ther Meeting place. That when the uſual time was come for their Departure. They roſe in a Body, and were going Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably away. That ſome of them were got almoſt as far as the Street, without any moleſtation. And that then, they were all brought back again to the Confinement of the Meeting place, and there kept in the Rain. The Informers, without regard to their Sex; Age or Quality, (ſome of which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as <hi>Martha</hi> the late Widow of Sheriff <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ne,</hi> her Siſter <hi>Sarah Can, Mary Gouldney, Mary Wall,</hi> &amp;c. taking up the places of ſhelter, to Drink Ale, and Smoak To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco in. In ſhort, the defence the Women made, had ſo effect, that firſt the Juſtices were divided, and ſome argued for them, Old Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> in particular. (For which he was Abuſed on the Bench, and had Reflection caſt on him, by <hi>Brand</hi> the Sheriffs Companion.) And next, the Jury would not believe the Informers; ſo brought in their Verdict <hi>No Riot,</hi> but guilty of an Unlawful Aſſembly. This Verdict ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Sheriff, that he Menaced the Jury with having them up to <hi>London:</hi> Saying, <hi>If he could not have Juſtice here, he would have it there.</hi> The Jury's Verdict is grateful to the moſt Diſcreet, Subſtantial Magiſtrates and the Sober Citizens; though the Informers Huff at it, taking all amiſs, that doth not quadrate with their wicked deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Inhumanity and Baſeneſs of <hi>John Helliar,</hi> Sheriff <hi>Knight,</hi> &amp;c. Is much cryed out againſt, in that they brought Nails and Hammer to Nail up the Morning Meeting-houſe, and there kept the Women and Men together, well nigh ſix Hours, without any Conveniency of Eaſe or Refreſhment to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109683:3"/>
Nature. And this <hi>Hilliar</hi> was ſo ſenſible of, that he told them, next time they ſhould Chamber-Potts. Its too large to inſiſt on all their Sordid Abuſes. So I refer to another time. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the Meeting again Diſturbed: And on the occaſion of an Ancient man ſpeaking two or three words, their Names taken, and the Meeting made a Conventicle; which is what they greedily aim at.</p>
