         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

with my ſmall ſtrength, for intercepting theſe deſpitefull <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims,</hi>
which continually labour to damme vp theſe ſacred Wells

the ſpeciall characters of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and demonſtrated

pretended by <hi>Ieſuites</hi> for the erection of it, ſhould (as the manner
was to demoliſh leſſer religious houſes for building others more

as common to Chriſtians, Iewes, and Turkes; that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb facs="tcp:7902:5"/>
of ſuch infallibilitie as they Deifie her with ſhould be
more incompatible with Chriſtianitie then any Idolatrie of the
Heathen; that ſuch as abſolutely beleeue all her decrees without
examination, truely beleeue no article of this <hi>Creede;</hi> with the like
principall branches of Antichriſtianiſme; were points, for ought
I knew, rather touched by the way, or propoſed as clear in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the indifferent and ingenuous, that iudge of the Romiſh
Church by the knowne picture of her miſſe-ſhapen limmes, then
proſequuted at large, or with purpoſe to pull off that artificiall
painting, wherewith late Ieſuites haue ſo beautified this vgly
Monſters face, that the world bewitched with gazing too much
on it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but loue her other deformities though in themſelues
moſt loathſome. For though the practiſes enioyned by her bee
ſo vile, as would haue cauſed Rome Heathen to haue bluſhed at
their mention, or her other doctrines ſo palpably groſſe, that her
owne Sonnes heretofore haue derided them, and as yet ſpare to
ſpeake ought in particular for their defence: yet to ſalue all this it
muſt ſuffice, that the Church, which cannot erre, hath now au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
them.</p>
            <p>If any thinke I preiudice the truth of moderate accuſations, by
laying ſuch heauie imputations vpon this doctrine, as make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more deteſtable then any other, hee ſpeakes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequently
to his poſitions, if hee hold the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> was
infallibly aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, or that the Pope in <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi>
reſolutions cannot erre. But, he which thinkes foule impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may bring Romiſh Prelates out of fauour with the ſpirit of
truth, and make them as obnoxious to errors as others are, or can
perſwade himſelfe, that many practiſes and opinions, by that
Church alreadie authorized, are in their nature abominable and
impious, muſt either accord to me or diſſent from Reaſon, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and Religion. For theſe, ſo hee will but vouchſafe his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or attention, ioyntly proclaime aloude, that nothing amiſſe,
either in matter of doctrine or manners, can be ſo deteſtable with
out this preſumptuous groundleſſe warrant of abſolute infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
as with it; that albeit a man would ſet himſelfe to practize
all particulars directly contrarie to what God hath commanded
or to contradict God and his goodneſſe, yet his iniquitie without
this abſolute beliefe of full authoritie deriued from <hi>him</hi> ſo to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:7902:5"/>
would be but as a bodie without a ſoule, in reſpect of the Romiſh
Churches impieties, which makes the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> the principall
Author of Gods written word the abettor of all her fraude, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths,
or villanies. Briefly as it is not the doing of thoſe materials
God commands vs to doe, but faithfull ſubmiſſion of our wils to
his in doing them, which, as <hi>S. Iames</hi> inſtructs vs, makes vs true
Chriſtians: ſo is it not the doing or maintayning of what God
forbids or hates, but the doing of it vpon abſolute ſubmiſſion of
our ſoules and conſciences to other lawes then he hath left, which
makes men liue members of Antichriſt, as being animated, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and moued by the ſpirit of errour. Now this perſwaſion of
abſolute infallibilitie and vniuerſall warrant from the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
without condition or reſtraint, being peculiar to the Romiſh
Church, admitting it to be as faultie in practiſes and as obnoxious
to errours as any other, none can be reputed ſo truly Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
as it. For albeit <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended diuine reuelations, yet his
<hi>Prieſts</hi> challenge no ſuch abſolute infallibilitie as doth the Pope;
they make no ſecond <hi>Rocks</hi> or foundations, no ordinarie Paſtor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiualent
to their great <hi>Prophet.</hi> Whence although the Turkes
hold opinions in themſelues, or materially conſidered, more
groſſe, and maintayne ſome practices not much leſſe villanous
then Ieſuites doe: yet the grounds or motiues of their beliefe,
(which are as the ſoule or ſpirit of Religion) are nothing ſo peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous,
nothing ſo directly oppoſite to the holy ſpirit, as is this
Ieſuiticall rule of faith. Nor doe they either profeſſe ſuch beliefe
in Chriſt, or acknowledge him for a foundation ſo elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
as brings them within the Temple of God, within which
vnleſſe Antichriſt ſit his contrarietie vnto Chriſt could not bee ſo
eſſentiall, ſo immediate or direct, as by the rules of ſacred Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie
we are taught it muſt be. Yet I know not, whether the
indignitie of this doctrine is more apt to affect Diuines or Men
rightly religious and fearing God, then the ſottiſhneſſe of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to perſwade it, to prouoke the iuſt indignation of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Artiſts, which cannot endure, though in matters of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie,
to captiuate their vnderſtandings to poſitions deuoide of
ſenſe. To require ſome probabilitie of reaſon, ciuill or naturall,
is on their part no inſolent demand, for exchange of Chriſtian
faith or aduenturing their inaſſurance of life eternall in the ſeruice
<pb facs="tcp:7902:6"/>
of meere forrainers whom they neuer ſaw. Yet vnto perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
reſolutions no leſſe dangerous, doe Ieſuites ſolicite vs, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without any tollerable ſhew of probabilitie but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to Gods principall lawes and our naturall notions of good and
euill; as by theſe labours euery Academique may in part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
but more fully, if he would vouchſafe to ſift more of their
arguments, then in theſe ſhort tranſcurſiue diſputes I could. Nor
would I diſſwade any Artiſt well grounded in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſing
the moſt learned workes any Romaniſt hath written in this
argument. In moſt other controuerſies betwixt vs and them it is
dangerous, I muſt confeſſe, euen for well grounded Artiſts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
with their writings, not ſo in this: for I proteſt in the ſight
of God and his holy Angels, that as farre as I can remember the
inclinations of my youth, or by them prognoſticate how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I might haue beene affected, I neuer was, I neuer ſhould
haue beene, ſo throughly poſſeſſed with ſuch great diſlike of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Antichriſtianiſme in this point, by hearing the moſt famous
Preachers in this Land, or reading all the learned Writers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, as I was by examining the labours of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Valentian,</hi> and others of beſt nore amongſt them ſeriouſly
addreſſed to this purpoſe; comparing them only with the known
principles of Chriſtianitie and ſuch paſſages of ſacred Writ, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Chriſtian Artiſt ſhould be acquainted with. For the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
whereon I proceede, I haue beene only beholden to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of Scriptures; for deducing of ſuch blaſphemous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from them, as I charge the Aduerſarie with, only to that
ſmall meaſure of knowledge in Ariſtotelian Philoſophie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
my God had bleſſed mee, whiles I was bound by locall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
to the ſtudie of Artes, purpoſely abſtaining from other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
which with their informations of my vnderſtanding might
haue bred preiudice in my affection. Since that time, although
the yeares of my Miniſtrie hardly exceede the ſpace of ordinarie
apprentiſhips, yet haue I often wiſhed the diſcuſſion of theſe
points had beene then impoſed vpon mee by ſome experienced
Diuine, that would only haue giuen me right hold of their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Vpon this conſideration I would beſeech the flouriſhing
Artiſts of this famous <hi>Academie,</hi> whom God hath furniſhed with
all ſtore of munition neceſſarie for this ſeruice, not to neglect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb facs="tcp:7902:6"/>
preſent. Let them deferre (if ſo they pleaſe) the
fruits of their labours in other points (though this be the fault of
our Engliſh) vntill the <hi>Autumne</hi> of their age. But the marke I
now propoſe vnto them, being the euident reſolution of Ieſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
poſitions into thoſe groſſe and palpable blaſphemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they tend, which they only ſeeke to hide by Sophiſmes and
artificiall tricks of wit, Academicall wits might diſplume them of
theſe figge-tree leaues and manifeſt their nakednes to the world,
much better in the ſpring whiles their skill in artes were freſh and
flouriſhing, whiles the ſtrength and vigour of their inuention
would more eaſily bend this way, then in the <hi>Autumne,</hi> when
their leaues begin to fade and their ſap retire to the root, as their
pleaſant grapes grow ripe. Many towardly plants in this nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
now able to match the ſtouteſt Ieſuite liuing at his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
whileſt in his mature age, <hi>multo iam fractus membra labore,</hi>
more fit to be a Leader, then a combatant in theſe encounters, he
ſhall looke back on his former labours or cals to minde his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
dexteritie in Schoole diſputes, may take vp old <hi>Neſtors</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>

            <p>The ſchoole Ieſuite in theſe ſtudies is like the Iuy alwaies greene,
becauſe not ſet to bring forth fruit vnto ſaluation, but rather to
choake and ſtrangle the plants of life. And for ſuch inſtruments
of the Romiſh Church, as this Land vſually yeelds, this wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
facultie is all the skill they care for, or for the moſt part make
profeſſion of. Yet ſuch is the brittleneſſe of the matter they are
to worke vpon in this controuerſie, that were all the Prieſts and
Ieſuites harboured within the confines of great Brittaine at this
preſent day, but enioyned to write all they could to any purpoſe
in defence of their Mother; ſome few Artiſts of thoſe Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which out of their pride they ſeeme to vilifie amongſt the
ignorant, would, I dare not ſay make them bluſh (for ſooner might
they make a black-moores face of the ſame colour with his teeth)
but as many of their fauourers of this Kingdome, as haue not
ſworne allegeance to the Church of Rome, and are able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb facs="tcp:7902:7"/>
an argument, to bee aſhamed on their behalfe, euen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that for ought theſe Mounte-bankes could ſay or
write in their defence, the Poſitions maintayned by their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>
forraine Ieſuites, were indeed idolatrous and blaſphemous;
howbeit the Church it ſelfe, wee muſt beleeue, could neuer bee
vanquiſhed, becauſe no man can tell where or in what ſhape to
finde it.</p>
            <p>Nor neede yong Artiſts feare the countenance of antiquitie in
this point, from which their enemies ſupplies are ſo ſlender, that
would they come to open triall, and bring only ſuch of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for their ſeconds, as liued within fiue hundred yeares of
Chriſt, or before the mixture of Romiſh Religion with Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
not fully effected till a little after that time: the paucitie of
thoſe whoſe aide they durſt ſolicit, in reſpect of that great armie,
which is as reſolute as wee againſt them, would make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
either yeeld themſelues, or forſake the field. Nor haue
they beene hitherto able to addreſſe any anſwere, but to their
ſhame, to the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Engliſh Church, whoſe labours haue
made the conqueſt in this quarrell eaſie to any of their ſucceſſors,
that will aduenture to follow their ſteps. Nothing remaines but
what beſt becomes the exerciſe of yong wits; to exceede the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall
diſputes of Ieſuites againſt the truth, in copiouſneſſe of
irrefragable demonſtrations, that the allegeance they ſeeke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
vnto the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is ſolemne apoſtaſie from Chriſt;
that the beliefe of it is the very abſtract of ſorcerie, the vtmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Antichriſtianiſme that can bee expected. Theſe and like
points, being fortified by ſtrength of argument, in the time of
your Regencie or fare-well to the ſtudie of Artes, might bee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
at your better leiſure, afterwards to be reuiſed and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the appointment of authoritie. Or if the zeale of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thus mightily eclipſed by this foule Idoll of the Romiſh
Church doe not as yet ſo fully moue you; yet that indignation
which firſt wrought a deſire in mee of giuing this onſet, ſhould
worke (me thinks) in euery heart, that beares any ſparkle of loue
vnto his natiue Countrie. For what indignitie is it to thinke, that
whilſt our gracious Soueraigne is a moſt zealous Profeſſor and
Defendor of the truth we teach; ſo many of his naturall ſubiects
our Countrimen and Brethren, ſhould bee wonne vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<pb facs="tcp:7902:7"/>
faction, eſpecially by importunate inculcating two hereſies,
of all maintayned by that Church in themſelues moſt ſottiſhly
improbable; and yet apparently moſt damnable Idolaters in
their conſequences, if erroneous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane this concerning their
Churches abſolute priuiledge from all errour, and that other of
Chriſts reall preſence in the Sacrament, by tranſubſtantiation. It
cannot againe but adde much to our griefe and indignation, if we
call to minde, how, when the chiefe <hi>Gouernour</hi> and publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of this Land were for them, ſubſcription was not vrged
vpon ſuch violent and bloudie termes vnto any articles of their
Religion, as vnto that of reall preſence. The myſterie of which
iniquitie cannot better bee reſolued then into the powerfull and
deceitfull working of Satan, thus delighting to deſpite our Lord
and Sauiour by ſeducing his profeſſed ſubiects vnto the higheſt
and moſt deſperate kinde of rebellion he could imagine, vpon the
leaſt occaſions and ſhalloweſt reaſons. For ſuch is their madneſſe
in that other point, as hath beene ſhewed in this: Not one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
they can obiect to our opinion, but may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt theirs; not any fruits of godlineſſe they can pretend
but our doctrine more directly brings forth then theirs could,
though we did admit it for true. For to what other purpoſe ſuch
a preſence as they imagine ſhould ſerue them, ſaue only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thoſe deſperate Idolatrous practices and litourges of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
touched by the way in ſome parts of theſe diſcourſes, is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable;
as ſhall be ſhewed more at large (without depriuing that
heauenly myſterie of any ſolemnitie of deuotion due vnto it) in
the vnfolding of that controuerſie.</p>

            <p>8 It is further added in the ſame place, (becauſe I take it had

thinke were impoſſible for any man to doe; though were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

can it be knowne what all of them hold in moſt places, wher
vpon are grounded controuerſies of greateſt moment; and in ſuch
as wee haue beſt plentie of their interpretations, albeit they doe
not contentiouſly diſſent, yet abſolutely agree each with other
they doe not. Euen one and the ſame Father oftimes thinkes, of

infallibly beleeued: Nor were it poſſible more to contradict moſt
of them, then by following their interpretations, vpon ſuch ſtrict
tearmes, as the Romaniſts would binde all men to doe, when they
ſeeme to make for their aduantage. Not the leaſt ſurmiſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture

may admit a double ſence. <hi>Firſt their meaning may bee, that the
Church doth iudge, whether that, which the Scriptures teach, be
true or falſe, Or, Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, [This ſure foundation of faith being firſt
laid,</hi> The words of Scripture are moſt infallible and true] <hi>The Church
doth iudge which is the true interpretation, or meaning of them.
This diſtinction he applieth thus;</hi> The former obiectuns were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
if we held the Pope or Councell to determine of Scriptures, in the
former ſence; but, taking our right meaning, they are meere calumnies.
For we affirme the Church to iudge Scriptures onely in the later: and ſo
to iudge them, doth not ſet the Church or Pope aboue Scriptures, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the iudgment of priuate men. Nor doth the Church (<hi>by this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi>)
become a Iudge of Scriptures truth, but of priuate mens vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
Neither will it hence follow, that the word of God recetueth
ſtrength from the word of man; but priuate mens knowledge, may and
doth receiue ſtrength and infallibilitie, from the Church. <hi>Finally,</hi> the
Scripture or Word of God (<hi>as</hi> Bellarmine <hi>thinkes</hi>) is neither more true
or certaine, becauſe it is expounded by the Church; but euerie mans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is more true and ſtable, when it is confirmed by the Churches expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
or deciſion.</p>
               <p>Hee hath ſaid as much as the whole Councell of Trent could
haue ſaid for themſelues. But let vs ſee if this be enough.</p>
               <p>2 A priuate mans opinion (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is truer, when it is
confirmed by the Church. If we had only an opinion of the truth
or ſence of Scriptures; the conſent of others, eſpecially men skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in ſuch maters, would indeede much confirme vs, for all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
or vncertaine perſwaſions, receiue increaſe of ſtrength,
from addition of probabilities. But his words are more generall,
and concerne not onely vncertaine, but all perſwaſions, that a
faithfull man in this life, can haue of Gods Word; at leaſt of thoſe
writings, which wee and they acknowledge for ſuch: and the
marke he aimes at is, That no perſwaſion, in diuine matters, can
be certaine, without the Churches confirmation; as hee expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

with aequiuocation. For this ſpeech of his, <hi>The Church doth iudge

               <p>4 If we ſpeake of Scriptures in the former ſence, <hi>Bellarmines</hi>

to iudge, whether that which is ſuppoſed, or acknowledged by all,

ſence, ſeeing this is a Maxim vnqueſtionable (amongſt al ſuch
as haue any notion of a Dietie,) <hi>Whatſoeuer God hath ſpoken is moſt
true, in that ſenſe wherein he meant it.</hi> But, if we deſcend to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
ſpeeches; written or vnwritten, either acknowledged or
ſuppoſed for Gods Word, or ſuch as can but ground any poſſible
queſtion, whether they are Gods Words or no; the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Church doth take vpon her, abſolutely to iudge of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
part of them. For this is the very abſtract, or abridgement of
that infinite prerogatiue, which ſhe challengeth, <hi>all men muſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
beleeue that to be Gods Word which ſhe commends, that not to be his
Word which ſhe diſclaimes for ſuch.</hi> So as onely, the former tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and indeterminate truth <hi>[Whatſoeuer God ſaith is true]</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from the Popes vnlimited, tranſcendent, roiall ſentence; no
other word, or ſyllable of truth, which wee can imagine, God
hath or might haue ſpoken ſince the World began, either by his
owne or his ſonnes mouth, by the Miniſtery of his Angels, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apoſtles or Euangeliſts; but is euery way abſolutely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the Popes Monarchichall cenſure.</p>
               <p>5 And heere, let not the Reader miſtake it, as any argument
of our aduerſaries ingenuity, that they will for their owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
vouchſafe to grant (what no heathen Idolater did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
<hi>Whatſoeuer God ſaith is true.</hi> For, vnleſſe this were granted
by all; the Pope could haue no poſſible grounds of pretence, or
claime, to his abſolute infallibility, or infinite ſupremacie ouer all.
And that which his hirelings ſeeke to build vpon the former foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
is, <hi>Whatſoeuer the Pope hath ſaid, or ſhall ſay, ex cathedra, is
moſt true;</hi> becauſe, if we deſcend to any determinate truthes, wee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7902:21"/>
muſt beleeue that God hath ſpoken all, and onely that, which the
Pope hath alreadie teſtified, or, (when any queſtion ariſeth ſhall
teſtifie he hath ſpoken. In fine, the preſent Pope, by their poſitions,
is Gods onely liuing mouth, onely alſufficient to iuſtifie, or authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
witneſſe all his wordes paſt: all which, without him, are
vnto vs, as dead. Whence they muſt of neceſſitie, admit the ſame
proportion, betwixt the preſent Popes and Gods acknowledged
written word, or ſuppoſed vnwritten veritie, which in ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
we make betwixt acredible mans perſonall auouchment, or
liuing teſtimonie of what he hath ſeene, heard, or knowne by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
experience, and another mans hereſay report, either of
the matters he ſpake of, his ſpeeches <hi>themſelues,</hi> or their true ſence
and meaning, after his death. For the Prophets, Apoſtles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts (to vſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacroboſ.</hi> and <hi>Valentian</hi> both vſe the like ſpeeches.</note> their words) are dead, and Chriſt is abſent; ſo
as we can neither be certaine, what they haue ſpoken, or what they
meant in their ſuppoſed ſpeeches, but <hi>per viuam vocem Eccleſiae,</hi> by
the liuing voice of the preſent viſible Church; whoſe words are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as vnfallible, as Gods owne words, were. And for this
reaſon, muſt bee acknowledged a moſt abſolute Iudge of Gods
written and vnwritten words, aſwell of their Spirituall ſence and
meaning, as of their outward frame or viſible character. This is
the height of their iniquitie and will inferre more then our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
concluſion in this Section, <hi>That euen of ſuch places, as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by them for Gods Word, we muſ not beleeue any determinate

               </p>
               <p>6 This Doctrine, as I would requeſt the Reader to obſerue,
brings the ſecond and third perſon in Trinitie on the one partie,
and the Pope on the other, to as plaine and euident competition,
for Rule or Soueraigntie ouer profeſſed Chriſtians faith; as God
and <hi>Baal</hi> were at in <hi>Elias</hi> time. This ther Doctrine, thus in ſhew
grounded vpon, indeed and iſſue moſt oppoſite to Scriptures, is
the true Spirituall Inquiſition houſe, whereof that materiall or

Firſt, their ſoules are tied, by ſureſt bondes of faith and nature,

theſe haue ſpoken, we contend, all ſhould beleeue, for Gods own

their life-working ſence, communicate vnto them by hearing,

comfort to our ſoules; a ſence, to all vnpartiall ſences, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie

Ergo this or that is true. The firſt propoſition in this Syllogiſme

onely on coniecture, or iudgement of a priuate Spirit; which vſually
ſeemes, but is not good. Whence, ſeeing the concluſion muſt follow the
weaker part, it neceſſarily followes, that all the faith of Heretikes (<hi>ſuch

coniecturall and vncertaine.</p>
               <p>2 A dreadfull imputation, could it be as ſubſtanſtially proued,
as it is confidently auouched. And the conſequence of his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
(generally helde by all his fellowes) is of no leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then this; that no man can be infalliby aſſured, either of the
truth, or true ſence of any particular propoſition; in the whole
Canon of Scriptures receiued by vs and them, vnleſſe he haue the
Churches authoritie for confirmation of both. For, vnto vs, that
onely, which the Church auoucheth is certaine, and vnfallible;
that ſence of it, which the Church giues, onely ſound; if we ſpeake
of any particular or determinate truthes.</p>
               <p>3 How certaine and vnfallible aſſent vnto all, or any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
may bee wrought in mens heartes, without any infallible
teacher, alreadie hath beene, and hereafter ſhall be (God willing)
in more particular ſort exemplified. In this place, it ſtood the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
vpon, to haue giuen a better ſolution to the doubt obiected;
which he is ſo farre from vnlooſing, that hee rather knits it faſter;
as ſhall appeare, if the Reader will firſt cal to minde; That for the
eſtabliſhing of firme and vndoubted aſſent to any truth propoſed,
it skils not how infallible the truth in it ſelfe or the propoſer be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnleſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7902:23"/>
vnleſſe they, whoſe beleefe or aſſent is demanded, be as infallibly
perſwaded of this infallibilitie in the truth, or the propoſer. In
this reſpect, our aduerſaries pleade their immunitie from errour, as
an article neceſſarie to be infallibly beleeued, for confirmation of
Gods Word, alwayes moſt infallible (as all grant) in it ſelfe, but
not ſo (as they affirme) to vs, vntill it bee auouched by infallible
authoritie.</p>
               <p>4 Herein they concurre with vs; both with the truth, That if,
we beleeue it onely as probable, that God ſpake all thoſe wordes,
which wee acknowledge to bee moſt infallible, becauſe his, our
beleefe notwithſtanding is not infallible, but probable, or conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturall.
For as a man may haue bad deſires of things eſſentially
good; ſo may he haue vncertaine perſwaſions of truthes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
moſt certaine. It is not therefore the ſuppoſed infallibilitie
of the Church or Pope, howſoeuer, but infallibly apprehended and
beleeued that muſt ſtrengthen our faith, which otherwiſe (as is
pretended) would be but coniecturall. And by the former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(acknowledged aſwell by them as vs) it neceſſarily followes,
that if we be only probably, not infallibly perſwaded, the Pope or
Church cannot erre; our aſſent vnto the minor propoſition. i. <hi>[vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any determinate part of Gods Word,]</hi> is onely probable not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
For, by the Ieſuites Doctrine, we cannot bee certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that God ſpake this, or that, but by the Churches teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.
The immediate conſequence of which two aſſertions,
compared together, is, wee cannot bee more certaine that God
hath ſpoken this or that, then wee are of the Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
If then wee bee onely probably, not infallibly, perſwaded, that
the Church is infallible: our beleefe of the minor propoſition (that
is of any determinate truth which men ſuppoſe God hath ſpoken)
muſt bee onely probable, or coniecturall, not infallible. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to theſe collections, the learned Papiſts generally holde,
that the Churches infallibilitie muſt be abſolutely and infallibly
beleeued; (as you heard before out of<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>5 The propoſed inconuenience wee may deriue from this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie;
<hi>How the Papiſts themſelues can attaine to the infallible beleefe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7902:24"/>
of the Churches infallible authoritie?</hi> The Church, they thinke, hath
a publique ſpirit; and publique ſpirits they know are infallible;
hence they may perſwade themſelues the Church is infallible, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the ſame termes, they beleeue it hath a publique ſpirit, if
their beleefe of this latter be but coniectural; their aſſent vnto the
former can be no better. Seeing then they muſt of neceſſitie grant
(for this is the principall marke they aime at) that all muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beleeue the Church hath a publique ſpirit: the difficultie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues
to this point, how this infallible perſwaſion is, or may bee
wrought in them. Either it muſt be grounded vpon Scriptures, or
not: auouched vnto them and wrought in their hearts it muſt be,
either by a publique or priuate ſpirit. Let vs examine all the parts
of this diuiſion.</p>
               <p>6 Firſt if priuate mens infallible perſwaſion of the Churches
publike, or authentike ſpirit, be not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by vs and them: the Churches authoritie without
all controuerſie, is much greater then the authoritie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
if it, by this aſſertion, can be any, and the Churches not all in
all. For vnto that which men cannot know, whether it bee true or
falſe, they cannot be bound to yeeld abſolute or immediate obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
vnto that authoritie, which they abſolutely beleeue as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
they are bound to yeeld infallible aſſent, and abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
directly, in it ſelfe and for it ſelfe. But by this ſuppoſition
men cannot know Scriptures infallibly without the Churches
authoritie, and yet they muſt infallibly beleeue the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
without Scriptures; The Scriptures authoritie therefore
is either leſſe then the Churches, or none at all.</p>
               <p>6 But be it ſuppoſed that priuate mens infallible beleefe of the
Churches publike ſpirit is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon Scriptures, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by vs and vrged by them to this purpoſe, as vpon theſe, it <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good to the Holy Ghoſt &amp; vs; I haue prayed for thee thy faith ſhould
not faile:</hi> The queſtion whereunto wee demaund an anſwere, is
whether this infallible beleefe of the Churches authoritie, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon theſe places, muſt be wrought in mens heartes by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
or publique ſpirit. If by a priuate ſpirit onely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
the Churches publique ſpirit, or thoſe Scriptures truth, or
true meaning, whereon he grounds it: Hee and all other Papiſts
(ſuch as hee was when hee deliuered this Doctrine;) neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7902:24"/>
nor Cardinals, are ſubiect to the ſame inconueniences,
which he hath condemned vs for, as Heretiques. For all priuate
ſpirits, by his poſitions, are obnoxious to errour, vnſufficient to
plant any infallible perſwaſion in matters of faith; yet ſuch is this
article of the Churches authentique ſpirit, of which vnleſſe men
be ſo perſwaded, infallibly perſwaded, they cannot bee of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
propoſition in any Syllogiſme; wherein a point of faith is
concluded: and vncertaine of the minor, they cannot be certaine
of the concluſion, which, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> rightly obſerues, alwayes
followes the weaker part. The infallible concluſion therefore of
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> reſolution, is; vnleſſe priuate men may haue publique
ſpirits to warrant the truth of Scriptures, and the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie
thereon grounded; they cannot truly beleeue any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of faith. It remaines then we inquire; what inconuenience wil
follow, if they admit priuate men to be partakers of publike ſpirits.</p>
               <p>7 Diuerſitie of ſuch ſpirits they acknowledge not. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
priuate mens infallible aſſent vnto the truth, or true ſence of
thoſe particular Scriptures whence they ſeeke to prooue their
Churches infallibilitie, muſt be planted by a publique ſpirit, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it muſt be by the ſame ſpirit; which guides, and guiding makes
the Church and Pope authentique and infallible, both in their
propoſall of Scriptures and declaration of Scriptures ſence. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this ſpirit is one and the ſame, if it can make the Church or
Pope infallible in all; why may it not make all priuate men (by this
ſuppoſition partakers of it) alike infallible, at the leaſt in the right
vnderſtanding of thoſe places, which warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
or publique ſpirit. For our aduerſaries, I hope, will eaſily
grant, that the Churches publique and authentique ſpirit muſt be
moſt infallibly beleeued, becauſe ſo expreſſely taught in thoſe
Scriptures cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to this purpoſe. If this publike
or authentique ſpirit, can worke ſuch infallible apprehenſion of
thoſe places true meaning in priuate heartes, why not in all others
as neceſſarie for them to know; that is, in all neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And if thus it doe, why are wee bound to beleeue the Pope,
more then the Pope vs, wee being partakers of a publique and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

               <p>8 Or if they hold it no abſurditie to ſay; wee muſt beleeue two

muſt be vnto vs altogether as great, as the authoritie of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is vnto him; which is farre greater vnto him, then it is or can
be to any others; for euen that which is acknowledged for Gods
Word, both by him and vs, muſt be leſſe authentique vnto vs then
the wordes of this mortall man;</p>
               <p>10 For though we pardon our aduerſaries their former abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
in ſeeking to prooue the Churches authoritie by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Scriptures by the Churches; though we grant them
all they can deſire (euen what ſhall appeare in due place to be moſt
falſe,) That, whiles they beleeue the Popes particular iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or deciſions, from a preſuppoſal of his vniuerſal tranſcendent
authoritie, they doe not onely beleeue him, or his wordes, but
thoſe partes of Gods Word, vpon which they ſeeme to ground
his infallibilitie: yet our former argument holdes ſtill moſt firme;
becauſe that abſolute aſſent, which priuate men muſt giue vnto
theſe ſuppoſed grounds of their Religion, before other portions
of Scripture, is not grounded vpon any preheminencie incident
to theſe words as they are Gods, as if they were more his then the
reſt, in ſome ſuch peculiar ſort, as the Tenne Commaundements
are in reſpect of other <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Lawes; nor from any internall
proprietie flowing from the wordes themſelues, as if their ſecret
character did vnto faithfull mindes, bewray them to be more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
then others; nor from any precedent conſequent, or comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
circumſtance, probably arguing that ſence, the Romiſh
Church giues of them, to be of it ſelfe more perſpicuous or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
then the naturall meaning of moſt other Scriptures, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by one and the ſame ſpirit, all, for their forme, of equall
authoritie and perſpicuitie. All the prerogatiue then, which theſe
paſſages can haue before others, muſt be from the matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them; and that, by our aduerſaries poſition, is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
infallibilitie. Wherefore, not becauſe they are Gods word,
or were giuen by his Spirit, in more extraordinarie ſort then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7902:26"/>
but becauſe they haue more affinitie with the Roman Lord,
in late yeares exalted aboue all that is called God, Father, Sonne,
or Holy Ghoſt: theſe places aboue cited, muſt bee more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikely
beleeued, then all the wordes of God beſides. As I haue
read of pictures, though not more artificiall in themſelues, yet
helde in greater eſtimation amongſt the Heathen, and freer from
contemptuous cenſure then any other of the ſame Painters
doing, onely becauſe they repreſented their great God <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11 Another difficultie, whereunto we demand an anſwere is,
whether whiles they aſſent, as they profeſſe, not onely to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie
taught (as they ſuppoſe) in the fore cited places,
but alſo vnto the infallibilite of Scriptures which teach it: they
acknowledge two diſtinct aſſents, or but one. If but one, let them
ſhew vs how poſſibly the Church can bee ſaid to confirme the
Scriptures: if two, let them aſsigne the ſeuerall properties of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
whether is more ſtrong; whether muſt bee to the other as
<hi>Peter</hi> to his brethren; or if neither of them can confirme the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let them declare how the one can be imagined as a meane or
condition of beleeuing the other.</p>
               <p>12 An Heretikes beleefe of the minor propoſition in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Syllogiſme (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is but weake: A Romaniſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of the ſame moſt ſtrong. Let this bee the Minor, <hi>Peter feed
my ſheepe, or</hi> Peter <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith ſhould not faile:</hi>
what reaſon can be imagined, why a Romaniſts beleefe of theſe
propoſitions ſhould bee ſo ſtrong, and ours ſo weake? The one
hath the Churches authoritie to confirme his faith, the other hath
not. What is it then to haue the Churches authoritie, onely to
know her decrees concerning thoſe portions of Scriptures? If
this were all, we know the Romiſh Churches decrees aſwel as the
Romaniſts: but it is nothing to know them, if we doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them. To haue Churches authoritie then is, to beleeue it as
infallible: and for this reaſon is a Romane Catholikes beleefe of
any portion of Scripture, more certaine and ſtrong, becauſe hee
hath the teſtimonie of the Church, which he beleeues to be moſt
infallible: and beleeuing it moſt infallibly he muſt of neceſsitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that to be Scripture, that in euery place, to be the meaning
of the Holy Ghoſt, which this Church commends vnto him for
ſuch. Let the moſt learned of our aduerſaries here reſolue the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7902:26"/>
doubt propoſed; whether there bee two diſtinct aſſents, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of the forementioned propoſitions: one vnto the truth of
the propoſition it ſelfe, and another vnto the Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
It is euident by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, that all the certaintie a
Roman Catholique hath aboue a Sectarie is, from the Churches
infallibilite. For the propoſition it ſelfe he can beleeue no better
then an Heretique may, vnleſſe hee better beleeue the Church, i.
he beleues the Churches expoſition of it, or the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
concerning it, better then the propoſition it ſelfe in it ſelfe
and for it ſelfe. And ſo it is euident that the Churches authoritie
is greater, becauſe it muſt be better beleeued.</p>
               <p>13 Suppoſe then one of our Church, which beleeues theſe
propoſitions to be the word of God, ſhould turne of Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
his former beleefe is by this meanes become more ſtrong
and certaine. This granted, the next queſtion is, what ſhould be
the obiect of this his ſtrong beleefe; the propoſitions beleeued:
<hi>Peter feed my ſheepe, I haue prayed for thee:</hi> or any other part of
Gods written word; or the Churches authoritie; not the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
themſelues, but onely <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church
confirmes them to him. For ſuppoſe the ſame man ſhould eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones,
either altogether reuolt from the Church, or doubt of
her authoritie, his beleefe of the former propoſitions becomes
hereby as weake as it was before: which plainely cuinceth, that
his beleefe of the Church and this propoſition, were two diſtinct
beleefes, and that this ſtrong beleefe was faſtened vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
authoritie, not vnto the propoſition it ſelfe immediately, but
onely <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church which he beleeueth ſo
firmely, did teach it; for his beleefe, if faſtened vpon the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelfe, after doubt mooued of the Churches authoritie, would
haue continued the ſame, but now (by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> aſſertion) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone
as hee begins to diſclaime his beleefe of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie,
his former ſtrong beleefe of the ſuppoſed propoſition
begins to faile, and of this failing no other reaſon, then alreadie is,
can be aſsigned. The reaſon was, becauſe the true, direct, and
proper obiect of his ſtronge beleefe was the Churches authoritie,
on which the beleefe of the propoſition did intirely depend, as the
concluſion doth vpon the premiſſes, or rather as euery particular
doth on the vniuerſall, whereunto it is eſſentially ſubordinate.</p>

thus, <hi>Whatſoeuer God hath ſpoken is moſt true. But
God hath ſpoken, and cauſed to be written all thoſe wordes contained in
the Canon of Scriptures, acknowledged by oppoſite religions of theſe
times. Therefore theſe wordes are moſt true.</hi> The certaintie of the

Romiſh Churches infallibilitie, which hath commended vnto vs
theſe Bookes for Gods Word. Bee it then granted, for diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſake, that we cannot know any part of Gods Word, much

ſence, or true meaning of all, moſt, or many parts of theſe
determinate Volumes, and viſible Characters, as yet is vndeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
and vncertaine; whereas all points of beleefe muſt bee
grounded on the determinate and certaine ſence of ſome part of
Gods Word reuealed; for our aduerſaries acknowledge all points
of faith ſhould bee reſolued into the firſt truth. Hence, if wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to any particular or determinate concluſion of faith, it muſt
be gathered in his Syllogiſme, <hi>Whatſoeuer the Church teacheth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the determinate and true ſence of Scriptures, whereon points
of Faith are grounded, is moſt true. But the Church teacheth thus and

               <p>2 The Maior propoſition of this Syllogiſme, is as vndoubted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7902:27"/>
amongſt the Roman Catholiques, as the maior of the former was

indeed, as they would make our beleefe vnto the minor propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Churches authoritie. For how can we be certain that the Church
doth teach all thoſe particulars which the Ieſuites propoſe vnto
vs? wee haue Bookes indeede, which goe vnder the name of the
Trent Counſell, but how ſhall wee know that this Counſell was
lawfully aſſembled, that ſome Canons haue not beene foiſted in

Church ſpeake <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> If the Pope ſend his Writs to aſſure
vs, what Critcicke ſo cunning as to aſſure vs, whether they be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike
or counterfeite? Finally, for all that can bee imagined in
this caſe, onely the Maior of the Catholicke ſyllogiſme, indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, is certaine; and conſequently no particular or definite
concluſion of faith, can be certaine to a Romaniſt, becauſe there
are no poſſible meanes of aſcertaining the Minor, <hi>[What the true

               <p>3 Or if they wil hold ſuch concluſions,<note place="margin">Wherein the Papiſts make the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Gods.</note> as are ordinarily gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

4 This is the madneſſe of that Antichriſtian Synagogue, that
acknowledgeth Gods Word for moſt infallible, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which wee haue, for his word, if it ſelfe bee infallible. For
it tels vs, they are ſuch: yet will not haue collections, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
with equall probabillitie deduced thence, ſo firmely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by priuate men, as the collections or concluſions, which are
gathered from the Churches infallibilitie. An implicit faith of
particulars, grounded vpon the Churches generall infallibilitie, ſo
men ſtedfaſtly beleeue it, may ſuffice. But implicit faith of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
grounded onely vpon our generall beleefe of Gods infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie,
prouidence, or written word, ſufficeth not. This prooues
the authoritie of the Church, to be aboue the authoritie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or the <hi>Deitie,</hi> abſolutely conſidered, not only in reſpect of
vs, [that is all beſides the Pope and his Cardinals.] For that is of
more authoritie abſolutely, not onely in reſpect of vs, which vpon
equall notice or knowledge, is to be better beleeued, more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or obeyed; but ſuch is the authoritie of the Church in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the diuine authoritie; ſuch is the authoritie of the Popes
Decrees in reſpect of Gods Word. For the Minor propoſition
in both the former Syllogiſmes being alike vncertaine; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
muſt bee more certaine in that Syllogiſme, whoſe maior
relies vpon the Popes infallibilitie then in the other; whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior
was grounded vpon the infallibilitie of the <hi>Deitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Briefly, to collect the ſumme of all; The authoritie of the
Church is greater then the authoritie of Scriptures, both in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of faith, and Chriſtian obedience. In reſpect of faith; becauſe
we are bound to beleeue the Churches deciſions, read or explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto vs, (<hi>by the Popes meſſenger though à Sir Iohn Lack-lattin</hi>)
without any appeale: but no part of Scripture, acknowledged by
vs and them, we may beleeue, without appeale, or ſubmiſſion of
our interpretation to the Church, albeit the true ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it ſeeme neuer ſo plain, vnto priuate conſciences in whom
Gods Spirit worketh faith. The ſame argument is moſt firme and
euident, in reſpect of obedience;</p>
               <p>6 That authoritie ouer vs is alwayes greateſt, vnto which wee
are to yeeld moſt immediate, moſt ſtrict and abſolute obedience:
but by the Romiſh Churches Doctrine; wee are to yeelde ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
and moſt abſolute obedience, to the Church; more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7902:28"/>
and abſolute then vnto Gods word: therefore the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Church is greater ouer vs. The Maior is out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie,
ſeeing greatneſſe of authoritie is alwayes meaſured by the
manner of obedience due vnto it. The Minor is as euident from
the former reaſon; Our obedience is more abſolute and ſtrict vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that authoritie, from which in no caſe we may appeale, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that from which wee may in many ſafely appeale: but, by the
Romiſh Churches doctrine, there lies alwayes an appeale from
that ſence and meaning of Scriptures, which Gods ſpirit and our

then to worſhip euerie appearance of an Angell of light, without

Idols:) the probabilitie is farre greater, his inuiſible ſubſtance,

ſhould be annexed to the ſuppoſed hoaſt, then Chriſts reall body,
vncapable for any thing wee know of ioinct exiſtence in the ſame

to triumph ouer the moderne Papiſts, more then ouer all
the Heathens of the old World, whoſe ſences onely hee deluded,
or bewitched their reaſon, but quite inuerts all vſe of theſe mens

quite contrarie to the knowne nature of bodies, and yet more

then themſelues, paſſe by; ſo is it much to bee dreadded, leaſt the

What then might euery Miniſter of Chriſt, euerie diſtributer of
Gods ſecrets, haue vſed the like authoritie, before the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatiue did; at leaſt, by tacite conſent, approue the practiſe?
This place doubtleſſe proues, either altogether nothing, or thus

to prohibit, either the diſpenſors of Gods myſteries from admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring,

Lords cup vnto the people, the Lord had giuen them the cup of
giddineſſe, to caſt them into a Babiloniſh ſlumber whileſt they
conſulted about this decree; and their Scribes through retchleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
had written, what their rauing Maſters in their ſickly or

another place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> immediately annexed, though as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
to the former (as it is placed in their diſcourſe) as
a mans head to an horſes necke, both as vnſutable to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

to ſuch a monſtrous Hippocentaurique combination. The place

               <p>16 Granting (what is not neceſſarie) hee ſpake of ordering
matters concerning this Sacrament: to receiue the wine, aſwell
as the bread, was no part of their preſent diſorder, whoſe miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
at the Lords Table did miniſter mere iuſt occaſions to
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then long beardes did to the Councell of Conſtance,
to denie the vſe of the cup, might Chriſts bloud and bodie, which
he had iointly rendered to all, be vpon any occaſion iuſtly ſeuered
by man in the adminiſtration of his laſt Will and Teſtament.
Whatſoeuer the number or qualitie of the gueſts bee; the great
Lords Table muſt be alwaies ſo furniſhed as it was at the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
for he hath no reſpect of perſons. If a rich ſtately Prelate
come in with a gold ring in goodly veſtiments, &amp; a poore honeſt
Layicke in vileraiments, he ſaith not to him in Pontificiall roabes,
come ſit you here at my meſſe, where you may drinke of my wine
aſwell as eate of my bread: nor to the poore Layicke, ſtand thou
there a part, or ſit downe here vnder my footſtoole, where thou
maiſt bee partaker of the crummes which fall from my table,
though not of my cup, which muſt be kept for thy betters. High
and low, rich and poore, all were redeemed with one price, all at
this offering equal, all alike free to taſt of euery diſh, ſo they come
with wedding garments, without which euen the beſt muſt
be caſt out, as vnworthie to taſt of any part, if not of all. That
part, which the Counſels of Conſtance and Trent, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of reuerence to the LORDS Supper, haue detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from Moderne Chriſtians, the Corinthians had receiued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7902:35"/>
vnworthily; yet was not the Cuppe, for this reaſon, held ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who onely ſought to repreſſe the abuſe, as
knowing the vſe of it to bee moſt neceſſarie. The matters then
hee meant to order, when he came, was, to ſet out this Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
banquet with greater decencie and ſolemnitie, not to abridge
them, of any ſubſtantiall or materiall part thereof.</p>
               <p>17 Nor doe the Trent Fathers, if wee may truſt them vpon
their<note n="*" place="margin">Cited in the precedent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. 15.</note> words. For they (deſirous as it ſeemes to make the whole
Chriſtian World as ſottiſh, as themſelues were impious) would
make men beleeue, they could iuggle away the Cuppe, and neuer
touch the very ſubſtance of the Sacrament; as if the wine were
not as ſubſtantiall a part of the Lords Supper, as was his bloud of
his bodie, or humanitie. An integrall or materiall part they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denie it to bee; and ſuch if it bee, there Apologie is as ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
as if a man ſhould let out moſt of anothers bloud, cut of his
arme, or legge, or maime him in ſome principall part, and plead
for himſelfe, I did not meddle with his ſubſtance, meaning (as the
Councell I take it heere doth) his eſſence, ſeeing he is yet as truly
a reaſonable Creature, as before.</p>
               <p>18 But to debarre them of that refuge,<note place="margin">That the Cup is an eſſentiall and ſubſtantial part of the Euchariſt.</note> it may be they ſought or
their followers may yet hope to finde in the equiuocation of this
word, <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> importing as much ſometimes as a material, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral,
ſometimes as an eſſential part. If the cup be an eſſential and
ſubſtantiall part of this Sacrament, the Councell by their owne
confeſſion did ſouly erre, in prohibiting Communion vnder both
kindes: If no ſuch part it bee, they might by their owne rule
haue altogether denied the vſe of it ſo much as to the ſacrificer,
or conſicient: but ſo the verie vſe and end, on which the eſſence
of the Sacrament, (as of all other matters of moral practiſe) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
depends, and by whoſe expiration inſtantly muſt determine,
ſhould vtterly haue periſhed. The end and vſe of this ſacred
inſtitution, as our Sauiour expreſſely teacheth, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
grants, was to repreſent the teſtators death, yea ſo to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it, as we migh be partakers of his bodie and bloud, not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
onely, but withall, (as the Trent Fathers contend) ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.
Admitting then all they can pretend againſt the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of the Cuppe [That whole Chriſt were in the bread
alone;] yet this will not preſerue the true and fruitfull vſe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7902:36"/>
the Sacrament, nor ſalue that deadly wound, the eſſence of it muſt
perforce receiue from fruſtration of the end, neceſſarily enſuing
the cuppes abſence. For this Sacrament was ordained, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
ſo to exhibit Chriſts bodie, vnto all faithfull Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
not as intire, and whole; his bloud, not as it was incloſed
in the vaines: but the one, as torne and rent, the other, as ſhedde
and powred out vpon the croſſe. <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>which is ſhed for many,</hi> (for all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it faithfully) <hi>for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> His bloud then, as
ſhed and powred out, is as the loadſtarre of penitent and contrite
hearts, whereon the eyes of their faith, that ſeeke remiſſion of
ſinnes in this Sacrament, muſt bee faſtened: for (as the<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> Apoſtle
ſaith) <hi>without ſheding of bloud is no remiſsion.</hi> This was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of that ineſtimable all-ſufficient Sacrifice, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
his precious bloud thus powred out, the principall part
of this Sacrament, aſwell in reſpect of repreſenting his death, as in
applying remiſſion of ſinnes thereby in generall purchaſed, and
by this Sacramentall Type ſealed to euery one in particular; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if the Trent Councels Doctrine be true, that Chriſts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
bloud, which was ſhed vpon the croſſe, is really preſent in the
Chalice, and might be as immediately ſprinkled at leaſt vpon the
lips or dores of euerie faithfull receiuers heart, as the bloud, of the
Paſchal Lambe was vpon the doore-poſts of the Iſraelites. Thus,
as Sathan the <hi>Father</hi> of lies, ſo falſe opinion, ſuggeſted by him,
draw men with pleaſure into thoſe euils, for whoſe practiſe in the
end they become their chiefe accuſers. That opinion which firſt
brought in neglect of the Chalice, and, as the Trent Councell
preſumed, would haue warranted them in making this decree,
doth moſt condemne them: for the meaſure of their iniquitie,
could not haue beene ſo fully accompliſhed, vnleſſe they had held
a tranſubſtantiation of the wine into Chriſts bloud.</p>
               <p>19 What part of Scripture, can wee preſume they will ſpare,
that dare thus countermand the moſt principal of all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?
what reckoning may wee thinke, they make of our

Was
that his charity, his faith, or both? <hi>Wee reade</hi> (ſayth <hi>Bellarmine</hi>)
Peters <hi>charity did faile, that his faith did faile wee neuer read.</hi> In
vaine then doth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in vaine do all his fellowes labour, to
proue our Sauiour ſhould in theſe words ratifie a perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient
puritie of Roman faith? for <hi>Peter</hi> was to repaire in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
what had been impaired in himſelfe; to preuent, if it were
poſſible, the like fall in ſuch as did, or to themſelues did ſeeme
to ſtand; to conuert, reſtore and ſtrengthen ſuch, as in like, or
worſe ſort had denyed their Redeemer. With much greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
might the Romaniſts ſeeke to eſtabliſh a perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient
Chriſtian charity in <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, had <hi>Peters</hi> loue,
or charity only failed. But the bad liues and manners of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Clergie, would giue too manifeſt euidence againſt them in
this attempt: In this reſpect haue theſe ſtout challengers taken
vpon them the defence, of a neuer failing faith, becauſe not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
confuted. For, it is a matter very hard (I muſt confeſſe) to
prooue, that faith can neuer faile, which may deny Chriſt, ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and conſtantly as <hi>Peters</hi> did, without defect. The beſt is,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7902:41"/>
that by their owne confeſſion this place can proue, the acts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of Romane faith to be no better, then S. <hi>Peters</hi> was in this
deniall of Chriſt. His offence, they grant, was foule, but his faith
without defect. So may Popes be monſtrouſly luxurious in their
liues, but alwaies infallible in their Doctrine. Reader, conſult with
thine owne heart, and giue ſentence (as in the ſight of God) of
the whole frame of their Religion, by the foundation; and of the
foundation (ſuch as they willingly acknowledge faith to be of all
true Religion and euerie Chriſtian vertue) by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
If <hi>Peter</hi> became (as they pretend) the fundamentall rocke, by
confeſſing: that Religion doubtles, which hath no better ground
of infallibilitie, then <hi>Peters</hi> faith not ſecured from a threefold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of Chriſt, our Confeſſion, was firſt planted by the Spirit of
error, and of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>3 Not to diſpute any longer, what it was, but who they were
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was to ſtrengthen: all without exceptions. This iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may ſeeme impoſſible, ſeeing the exerciſe of his Miniſterie
could not extend to all Nations, much leſſe vnto all ages. Yet
theſe wordes bequeath no hereditarie royall iuriſdiction ouer all
perſons, but rather inioyne perſonall acts of penetencie vnto
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for his former perſonall offence. He had found extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
mercie at his Lord and Maſters hands; and was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the like vnto his fellow ſeruants more guiltie of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Chriſt, after his faith had failed did conuert and ſtrengthen
him againſt the like temptation; and he, conuerted, was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to conuert and ſtrengthen others. Whom? Not ſuch as by
conuerſion might become his brethren, or rather his children in
Chriſt; but rather ſuch, as were hewen out of the ſame roke, and
could truly call <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, <hi>Sira</hi> their Mother, ioinct
profeſſors with him of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law and the Prophets, more then
his brethren and aſſociates, in denying him, of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and
all the Prophets bare teſtimonie.</p>
               <p>4 To ſubtract all matter of calumniation from men, too
much diſpoſed to cauill without any probable cauſe, or iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
notwithſtanding his threefold deniall of Chriſt, I denie not
a triple or quadruple prerogatiue in <hi>Peter,</hi> in reſpect of Chriſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apoſtles; yet conſiſting, not in any authoritie more infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

were to depend vpon him as a chiefe meſſenger of the Lord of
Hoſtes, but in an extraordinarie efficacie of his ordinarie Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-ſhip.
In what reſpect then was his ordinarie Miniſterie or
Apoſtles-ſhip, ſo extraordinarily powerfull? In reſpect of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall
Church throughout all ages, of the Iewiſh Synagogue,
for the time being onely. S. <hi>Paul</hi> confutes the former as euidently

<hi>Peters</hi> charge, or iuriſdiction, vnto all the flocke that called
Chriſt their Lord, owner. For ſeeing after his reſurrection there
was but one Fold; for this great Shepheard to ſay; <hi>My ſheepe,</hi>
could not diſtinguiſh one ſort from another; and therefore none
to be exempted from <hi>Peters</hi> ouerſight. But the Flocke though
one in reſpect of the owner, which had purchaſed all with one
price, did conſiſt of ſheep much different in breeding, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their ſeuerall markes; ſome were of the circumciſion, others
of the vncircumciſion; the former had beene our Sauiours pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
charge in his life time, (<hi>for he was not ſent but vnto the loſt-ſheep
of Iſrael</hi>;) theſe he might with note of diſtinction, call <hi>My ſheepe.</hi>
As if a Shepheard, raiſed to better fortunes, ſhould purchaſe a
great many more ſheep, then hee was wont to looke to himſelfe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7902:44"/>
and referre both ſorts to ſeuerall keepers, though both to Fold
together in the euening, he might <hi>Signanter</hi> ſay to the one, looke
well to my ſheep: though both Flockes were his by right of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;
but onely the one his, by a peculiar relation of former
charge or ouer ſight. And thus, as we haue ſaid before, the Iewes
were committed peculiarly to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> care. Albeit, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
to the former expoſition of both places alleadged, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
by <hi>My ſheepe,</hi> might onely intimate his tender care ouer his
flocke, without diſtinction; that <hi>Peter</hi> might more carefully feed
as many as he could perſonally looke to, ſeeing the proofe of his
loue to his Lord and Maſter, and of his fidelitie which had failed,
did conſiſt herein. As for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> other collections, that our

yet as apt as groſſely to transforme Chriſts Spirituall loue, as
the Heathen did his fathers glorie, into the ſimilitude of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
corrupt affections.</p>
               <p>10 If it may ſtand with Chriſtian ſobrietie, ſo preciſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of particular differences implied in theſe words; it is moſt
likely our Sauiour meant to include all ſorts of people, according
to the different care their diuers eſtates required: ſome were to
be tenderly handled and cheriſhed like lambes; others to be lookt
vnto like elder ſheep, and to be fed with ſtronger meate, but with
leſſe perſonall or aſſiduous attendance. There is no one kind of
argument perſwades me more, the Romiſh Church is led by the
Spirit of errour, then whiles I obſerue, how they ſtill approoue
themſelues to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors in denying Chriſt, <hi>and going the
wrong way vnto the truth of the Goſpell;</hi> alwayes like vngracious
children, ſeeking to enter vpon the inheritance bequeathed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
performance of what the Teſtator principally required. Our
Sauiour requeſted <hi>Peter</hi> in theſe tearmes, <hi>Feede my ſheepe</hi> (not
thine;) intimating, he ſhould approue himſelfe a faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
one that was to giue ſtrict account vnto the owner, of
whatſoeuer befell the flocke: theſe men by commiſſion preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> would make themſelues great ſheep-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7902:44"/>
                  <hi>to kill and eate at their pleaſures.</hi> That <hi>to feede,</hi> is all one, as to
rule and gouerne, as they would haue it, is a conceipt of men
onely minding their bellies, or ſeeking to be fed by others ſpoiles.
That <hi>feeding</hi> or paſtorſhip is alwayes accompanied with rule and
authoritie, none that euer taſted any Spirituall food will denie.
That <hi>Peter</hi> was a Paſtor and a Feeder, an extraordarie Paſtor, a
principall Feeder, and therefore of preheminent rule and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer his flocke; wee acknowledge: but no preheminence in
him aboue his fellowes, which was not grounded vpon his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
care, and more then ordinarie fidelitie in feeding it; not with
Lordly iniunctions ſealed with <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> but with ſinceritie of
life and ſoundneſſe of Doctrine. There was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the tenure of his and others eſtates, as if he had beene Lord
by inheritance, not obnoxious to any forfeiture by miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and others but leaſe holders (during terme of good life
and manners) of the priuiledges they inioyed to returne by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheate,
or for want of ſucceſſion vnto <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors. That pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall
exerciſe of feeding Chriſts ſheep, in ſuch ſtrict tearmes
ſo often inioyned; rather argues, that ſhould haue beene interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnfaithfulneſſe or diſloyaltie in him, which would haue beene
accounted onely neglect or want of diligence in others. And the
ingenuous Reader may if it pleaſe him, eaſily obſerue, that of all

<hi>the Sonne of the liuing God</hi> here promiſed to erect.</p>
               <p>6. The Reader, I know, in this fruitfull age of learned expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
may finde variety of Comments, but none that can more
fully ſatisfie him, then Saint <hi>Peters</hi> owne paraphraſe vpon our
Sauiours promiſe to him, if we compare it with other Scriptures,
in ſence and meaning equiualent; That Chriſt was the only Rock
whereupon this Saint himſelfe, as a liuing member of the Church,
was built, is apparant: becauſe, intending to make his flocke,
<hi>liuely parts of the ſame aedifice,</hi> he tels them they come not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<hi>as to a ſecond Rock,</hi> but <hi>vnto the Lord, as vnto a liuing ſtone, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
of men, yet choſen of God and pretious:</hi> As if he had ſayd; Not
fleſh and bloud, not the wiſeſt of men, but only our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did firſt reueale him vnto me for ſuch, and in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
(as if he had purpoſely inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to certifie vs) that the name
of <hi>Peter</hi> did deſcend to him from this affinity with this <hi>elect and
pretious ſtone</hi> (not becauſe he was a Rocke or fundamentall ſtone
himſelfe) he addes, <hi>and ye as liuely ſtones be made a ſpirituall houſe,
a liuely Priest-hood (Prieſts as liuing, and altars as ſtones) to offer vp
ſpirituall ſacrifices, acceptable to God, by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Though they
were not all to haue the title or name of <hi>Peters</hi> (for ſo there could
be no diſtinction) yet ſo they would beleeue and confeſſe as he
did, that Chriſt was the <hi>liuing ſtone,</hi> they were to haue the realty
or ſubſtance, <hi>to be ſtones of that ſpirituall houſe, againſt which the
gates of hell ſhould not be able to preuaile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. And ſeeing hee now endeuoured to faſten them vnto
Chriſt, as vnto the only ſure Rocke of their redemption; it could
not be ſo auaileable to tel them in our Sauiours owne words, that
becomming ſuch a ſpirituall houſe, and continuing in offering
vp ſacrifices acceptable vnto God, <hi>the gates of hell ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
againſt them.</hi> Vntill this Day-ſtarre had more fully ſhined
in their hearts, hee knew it for the better method to kindle the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7902:48"/>
ſame hope in them, by the Prophets light, which in time would
breake forth clearer of it ſelfe: for that glorious promiſe of our

They may threaten but not ſo deiect vs, as to cauſe vs, either
through feare of diſgrace or other danger, skulke, or runne from

to expreſſe the full valew of both theſe Apoſtles ſpeeches, by the
laſt and moſt potent obiect of ſhame; belieuing in Chriſt, wee
ſhall not be found naked in that laſt day, nor wiſh the Mountains
for a couering to our ſhame; but enabled by ſure hope to ſtand
before the Sonne of man: for, not aſhamed of him before men

that victory of this ſpirituall houſe ouer the impotent aſſaults of

<hi>Stone,</hi> from whoſe ſtrength this ſpirituall houſe, whereof he and

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> or his ſucceſſors ioint, though ſecondary, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this glorious worke, were to diuide our faith betwixt
Chriſt and them: For it only ſtands by faith and confidence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
faſtened vpon the foundation or ſupporters. If then we
may not ſo faſten our faith either vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> or his ſucceſſors, we
can receiue no other ſtrength from them, then wee doe from
Chriſts other Apoſtles, and that is only from their Miniſteriall
function, in ſquaring and faſtening vs vnto this <hi>liuing ſtone.</hi> To
this purpoſe, ſayth Saint <hi>Paul, Other foundation can no man lay,
then that which is laid, which is Ieſus Christ.</hi> Whoſoeuer was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
builded on him, albeit he neuer heard of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> albeit
the doctrines hee heaped vpon this foundation were but hay and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7902:49"/>
ſtubble, or matter alike apt to take fire; yet the flame wherein
theſe idle ſpeculations of his braine were to periſh, ſhould but
ſinge his cloathes not deuoure his ſubſtance; becauſe by faith v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
vnto that <hi>liuing ſtone,</hi> which without any other intermediate
ſconce, or fence, doth quench the flames of hell, and keepe them
from ſcorching any, euen the laſt and vppermoſt that ſhall bee
built vpon him, vnto the worlds end. For the ſame Apoſtles
rule is vniuerſall both in reſpect of time and perſons.<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10. v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou ſhalt
confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and ſhalt belieue in thine heart,
that God raiſed him vp from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. But did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by ſpeciall reuelation vtter this, as a
myſtery altogether vnknowne before vnto the faithfull? Rather
by participation of the ſame ſpirit, which ſpake in the Prophet, he
onely vnfolds the Oracle late expounded, I muſt confeſſe without
diſtinct apprehenſion of ſo good warrant them, as is now ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;
For the Apoſtle to proue his former aſſertion, vrgeth that
place of the Prophet,<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. v. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer belieues in him ſhall not bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi>
So then with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> it is all one, <hi>to belieue in Chriſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from the dead,</hi> or <hi>in the corner ſtone, reiected of men, allowed of God.</hi>
And it ſeemes the declaration made vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt
whom he confeſſed (howſoeuer a Rocke to fall vpon to both <hi>the
houſes of Iſrael</hi>) was the ſure foundation of the fathfull, which the

becauſe it had beene ſo plainely foretold, that the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <hi>Then hee
turned backe and ſaid vnto</hi> Peter, <hi>Get thee behind me Sathan, thou

                  <hi>they reply,</hi> hee will cruelly deſtroy thoſe

contrariety in the forme of doctrine, or by an hoſtility between
the very foundations, which hee and the ſpirit of God endeavour
to lay; ſo as the edification of the one doth in the iſſue, menace
the demolition of the other. And as this oppoſition vnto Gods
ſpirit is greater or leſſe, ſo doth it argue the partie in whom it is
to participate, more or leſſe of the ſpirit of Antichriſt. In both

an excuſe, may wee thinke thoſe effemenate ſworne creatures
of ſeruitude to that great ſtrumper, can want an anſwere? No, this
diſtinction is alwaies at hand. Their Popes and Cardinals may
as erre, ſo goe to hell. But how? as priuate Doctors, not as oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall
Paſtors, not as they ſpeake <hi>ex Cathedra:</hi> ſo to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
I haue read of a proud Romiſh Prelate, that reproued
for his ſecular pompe made anſwere, hee followed theſe faſhions
as hee was a Duke, not as an Archbiſhoppe. But the reprouers
reply hath made the Apologie (better then which no Ieſuite can
make for the Pope) moſt ridiculous euer ſince. If this be ſo, quoth
the ſhepheard (ſuch was the Paſtor God had appointed to rebuke
the madnes of this falſe Prophet) I pray reſolue mee what ſhall
become of my Lord Duke, if the Archbiſhoppe goe to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
If many, ſometimes Popes, be now in hell (as no Ieſuite I
thinke, will profeſſe any morall hope that all are ſaued:) What is
becom of the Church repreſentiue, which lodged in their brains?
Hath the number of glorified Saints been encreaſed by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from earth? Were they euer a whit more happy for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heires to that glorious promiſe; <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this
Rocke will I build my Church?</hi> or were their comments vpon that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7902:57"/>
place Orthodoxall? what was the comfort Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe
could euer haue reaped thence? Onely this, though Sathan may
ſo ſift thee, that thy ſoule may goe to hell before thy body deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the graue; yet reſt aſſured of this, that thy faith which in
Cathedrall reſolutions ſhall neuer faile thee in thy life time, ſhal
ſuruine in thy ſucceſſors when thou art dead; but to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
if notwithſtanding this prerogatiue, all may deſcend one
after another into hell?</p>
               <p>29 Or if their doctrine were true, to what end did Chriſt come
in the fleſh? onely to build a Church, which like a lampe or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
may gloriouſly ſhine, whiles there is an interrupted ſucceſſion
of Popes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to propagate the ſplendor; but whoſe glory when that
expires, for ought that glorious promiſe addes vnto it, muſt bee
extinguiſhed; as the light goes out when the oyle is ſpent. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſſurance then euery Pope for his time hath, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by
their doctrine had none from thoſe wordes of our Sauiour. For
whatſoeuer power or prerogatiue was in them bequeathed to
him, doth deſcend by inheritance to his ſucceſſors. And would
the meaneſt Ieſuite now liuing haue gloried much in a life, graced
with no greater viſible Church dignity then S. <hi>Peters</hi> was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
expoſed to like danger, without any other ſolace to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, ſaue onely this, that his poſterity ſhould enioy the ſame
priuiledges? But now that the glory and dignity of the Romiſh
Church is becom ſo great, &amp; the Ieſuites portion thereby grown
ſo fat; they can bee well content to ſooth vp the Pope in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that howſoeuer his perſon may goe to hell (a place it ſeems
not much dreaded, becauſe vnknown) yet hell gates ſhall neuer
preuaile againſt his faith; which hath brought ſuch large poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to the Church; both which hee may infallibly entayle to
his ſucceſſors vntill the worlds end. But (as I ſaid before) what
then ſhall become of that cathedrall faith? ſhall it augment the
quire of Gods elect, or can they make as many S. <hi>Faithes</hi> as haue

ſome fooliſh heathens dreames of an immortall fame, that was

Church militant may encampe in one mans breſt, vpon
whom, though hell ſhut her gates, the ſimple (ſuch as they would
make vs all) muſt belieue the Church is ſafe, becauſe hee came
not with them as an heretike. For ſo in the ſecond place, though
our Sauiour promiſeth in termes as ample and maieſticall as can
be deuiſed, that not <hi>Hell gates;</hi> that is, no power or force of hell,

forth, that euery Pope from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> downewards, did giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
cathedrall teſtimony to this perpetuall ſucceſſion in like
authority. Suppoſe (what no Ieſuite dare auouch, vnleſſe hee
firſt conſult his ſuperiours, whether hee muſt not of neceſſity ſay
ſo, for maintenance of the Popes dignity) that this aſſertion had
beene expreſly conueyed from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to the preſent Pope,
without interruption; yet if any one of them did receiue it from
his predeceſſor, hauing it but as a priuate man, or vpon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
hee might erre in deliuering it to his ſucceſſor, ſo might the
third in belieuing him. For no beliefe can bee more certain then
it proper obiect, or immediate ground. If <hi>That</hi> bee fallible, the
beliefe muſt needs be vncertaine, obnoxious to error, and at the
beſt humane. No better is the Popes teſtimony, vnles giuen <hi>ex
Cathedra:</hi> and no better is the ground of his owne beliefe, of what
his Predeceſſors told him, vnleſſe they tolde it him ſo ſpeaking.
Wherfore though this preſent Pope ſhould teach <hi>ex Cathedra, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua

proue that none of his predeceſſors did euer neglect ſo to auouch
the ſame truth, it is euident that hee ſpeakes more then hee can
poſſibly know by any diuine teſtimony, either of hiſtory, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written

that by diuine faith which hee cannot poſſibly know himſelfe, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7902:62"/>
onely by faith humane. For the onely ground of his aſſertion,
is this ſuppoſed perpetuall tradition: and this is but humane,
vnleſſe it bee perpetually deliuered <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi>

Things known by immediate reuelation from God are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

yeers hence. And thus much if this preſent Pope will vndertake,
the Chriſtian people then liuing, may ſafely belieue, what the
Pope then being ſhall ſay of this; or both of their predeceſſors.
But to belieue man, as an infallible prophet of things paſt, which
cannot approue himſelfe a true foreteller of things to come, were
to inuert Gods ordinance, and mocke his word. For it hath been
a perpetuall law of God, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould euer be belieued more

               <p>11 If wee put together the firſt elements of Romiſh faith, as

as the ſimple and ignorant Papiſts, (who in policy) are taught to
read this leſſon, as little children vntaught, will by geſſing at the

their allegations, to proue that their Popes ſucceede as

muſt needes follow, that their faith is but a compoſt of folly &amp;
blaſphemy. This pretended perpetuity of tradition, or ſuſpitious
tale of ſucceſsion from <hi>Peter,</hi> is the beſt warrant they haue, the
Church doth not erre in expounding the places alleadged for
her infallability, and their beliefe of their infallibility in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
the onely ſecurity their ſoules can haue, that obeying

confeſſe the places brought by vs againſt their decrees to

the former concluſion is moſt firme, that whileſt men

there is ſmall hope of raiſing any new tribute from the Angels,

               <p>14. But though it were true, that we were abſolutely bound
to obey an abſolute Monarchie, of whoſe right none doubts: yet
may we examine whether euery Potentate that challengeth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
iuriſdiction ouer others, or giues forth ſuch inſolent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
in ciuill matters, as the Pope doth in ſpirituall, do not goe
beyond his authority in theſe particulars; albeit his lawfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues
in reſpect of others, be without controuerſie many and
great, yet limited both for number and magnitude. For ſuppoſe
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, after hee had done what he could againſt
the Pope, ſhould ſtill haue profeſſed his good liking of Romiſh
religion, oppoſing only this to all his Popiſh Cleargie, that had
challenged him of reuolt: <hi>Am not I defender of the faith.</hi> The Pope,
whom I trow you take for no falſe Prophet, hath giuen me this
prerogatiue amongſt Chriſtian Princes, as expreſly, as euer Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> bequeathed him his ſupremacy aboue other Biſhops. It is
as impoſſible for me to defend, as for his Holineſſe to teach, any
other beſides the true Catholique faith. Let the proudeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
my Prelates examine my expoſitions of his decrees, and
by S. <hi>George,</hi> he ſhall fry a fagot for an heretick, Would this or
the like pretence (though countenanced by royall authority)
haue been accepted for a iuſt defence, that this boiſterous King
had not contradicted the Pope, but the tatling Monkes, or other
priuate expoſitors of his decrees? would this haue ſatisfied the
Popes agents, vntill the King and his Holineſſe had come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
conference, for finall debatement of the caſe? yet for
Chriſts ſeruants thus to neglect their maſters cauſe, is no ſinne in
the Romaniſts iudgement, yea an hereſie is it not to deale ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
in it. For a ſinne of no lower ranke they make it, not to
ſubmit our hearts, minds, and affections, vnto the Popes nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

and experience giue vs. Vnto all the doubts, feares, or
ſcruples theſe can miniſter, it muſt ſuffice; That the Pope ſayth
he expounds ſcripture no otherwiſe then Chriſt would, were hee
in earth, but onely controls all priuate gloſſes or expoſitors of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7902:64"/>
them. But can any Chriſtian heart content it ſelfe with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,
and defer all examinations of doctrine, vntill that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
day come vpon him, wherein the great Shepheard ſhal plead
his owne cauſe, face to face, with this pretended Vicar and his
aſſociates? Do we beleeue that Chriſt hath giuen vs a written
law, that he ſhall come to be our Iudge, and call vs to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
wherein we haue tranſgreſſed or kept it; yet may we not
try by examination, whether theſe Romiſh guides lead vs aright
or awry? Whether ſome better or clearer expoſition may not
be hoped for, then the Pope or Councell, for the preſent, tenders
to vs? What if the Pope ſhould prohibite all diſputations about
this point in hand, [whether obeying him againſt the true ſence
of ſcripture, (as we are perſwaded) wee yeeld greater obedience
vnto him, then vnto Scriptures;] may we not examine the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this decree, or his expoſition of that Scripture which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely

out of Scriptures, how could the diuell himſelfe bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced

wee might iuſtly wonder that any men indued with naturall wit,

royally minded, but not much intermedling in the affairs of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
moment. Oportunity of high place vnder a king, vpon what
occaſion ſoeuer thus ſequeſtred, that poore mens complaints

of Princes gracious fauours vpon great ones. The more
abſolute ſuch a Princes lawfull authority, the greater his natiue

               <p>4 This is the onely difference in theſe two caſes otherwiſe
moſt like. An earthly Prince may liue and die deluded of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauillian
ſtates-men, ouer whom hee hath no power, after he
himſelfe is once ſubiect. But Chriſt liues and raignes a King for
euer; and though his throne bee in the higheſt heauens, beholds
the things are done on earth; hee ſees, and yet ſuffereth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
officers to retaine ſuch as loue darkenes more then light,
in groſſeſt ignorance and blind ſubiection to the Prince of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and his aſſociate, the Prince of darkeneſſe; hee ſees and yet
ſuffers them detain all ſuch as delight in lies more then in truth,
from acquaintance with his holy ſpirit; Hee ſees, and yet ſuffers
their fouleſt villanies to be countenanced by his ſacred lawes; hee
ſees, and yet ſuffers his holy name to be abuſed, to the eſtabliſhing
of Antichriſtian hereſies; hee ſees and yet ſuffers his glory made a
ſtale for maintenance of their ſecular pompe. Hee is the keeper
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and cannot ſo ſlumber, as any abuſe ſhould eſcape his
notice; his indignation ſhall not ſleepe for euer, but in due time
he will rouſe himſelfe as a Lion awaked, to take vengeance vpon
all the workers of iniquity, on them aboue others, who haue thus
vſurped his throne on earth, taking that iudgement during the
time of his ſuppoſed abſence wholly into their handes, which

               <p>4 Such Prieſtes as theſe, were to bee abſolutely obeyed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres
thus giuen from the mouth of God. And it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the parties whom theſe anſweres did concern, had perfect
notice of the Reuelation made to the Prieſts, howſoeuer the truths
of ſuch anſweres being confirmed by experiment in thoſe dayes,
they were to vndertake what the Prieſts appointed, and to obey

ſhould as often as they asked counſell of God, infallibly know,

               <p>5 That the Prieſt had no ſuch priuiledge, or abſolute promiſe

from the law of temperance preſcribed.<note n="*" place="margin">Leuit. 10. ver. 9. 10.</note>

                  <hi>Non facies vllum opus?</hi> The
Scribes and Phariſies putting a Religion in the letter of the Law,
(as the Ieſuites now doe,<note place="margin">The precept concerning the Sabaoth then which none can bee more vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall did not extend to all manner of workes.</note> when it may make for their aduantage)
did conclude from the generality of this precept, that our Sauiour
brake the Sabaoth, when hee healed the ſicke vpon it: Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
if we reſpect the vniuerſality of the propoſition onely,
were farre more probable then the Papiſts can picke any for their
purpoſe: Yet Iewiſh skill, in that they conſider not the end of the
Sabaoth, which might haue limited the vniuerſall forme of the
precept, and reſtrained it vnto ſome kind of workes onely; for not
all, but onely all thoſe workes which were repugnant to the end
of this precept were forbidden. The end of the Sabaoth was to
ſanctifie themſelues vnto the Lord; to ſet forth his praiſe both in
words and workes. Such workes then onely are here onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
as did diſtract the mind, or make men vnapt to heare, read,
or meditate on heauenly matters; all workes of ſecular vocation,
or priuate conſequence, which might hinder mens endeauours
for procuring the health, or wel-fare of others; not works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or preſent neceſſity, not works tending to greater publike
good, or to the auoidance of greater harmes, which could not be
preuented but by preſent working; for men are to read, heare,
and meditate vpon Gods word, that by it they may bee fruitfull
in good deeds by which Gods name is more immediately glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
then onely by ſpeaking well, and not doing ſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Sauiour Chriſt did better obſerue the Sabaoth by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon it, to ſaue mens liues, or recouer their health; then the
Phariſees did by abſtaining from ſuch workes of mercy, as might
haue glorified Gods name more immediately, then any ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7902:70"/>
or preciſe rules, how it ſhould bee kept: Yea, by not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
theſe good workes, when faire occaſion was offered, they did
the workes of Satan, euen murther it ſelfe, as our Sauiour Chriſt
implies in that queſtion propoſed vnto the Scribes and Phariſees
which ſought an accuſation againſt him:<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 6. v. 9.</note>

               </p>
               <p>9 The like limitations this precept had in caſe of neceſſity, or
for the auoidance of ſome great extraordinary calamity, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

may obey God himſelfe. Suppoſe then God had ſaid [Thou ſhall
obey the Prieſt in all things whatſoeuer he ſhall command thee:]
a Wiſe man notwithſtanding all this would thus reſolue; ſuppoſe
the Prieſt command mee to doe that, in doing which I ſhall diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God, or to omit that continually, in performing of which I
ſhould obey God: am I bound to obey him in all ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
ſo ſhould I fruſtrate the end of the law, and commit the
ſame offence by this my blind obedience, which others doe by
preſumptuous and willfull diſobedience vnto ſpirituall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
But it will bee replyed, who ſhall iudge whether the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
gouernour commaund thee ſuch ſeruice, as argues diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto God, or no? If the caſe bee doubtfull, and I be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by my lawfull Paſtor, I haue anſwered already in what
ſenſe obedience muſt bee performed. But if the caſe be euident,
men muſt openly diſobey their Paſtors, before they certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
God. But who ſhall iudge of the euidence? Euery mans
conſcience. Shall that then bee euident which euery man ſhall
ſay is euident vnto him? No, but what indeed and conſcience
is, and ſo ſhall appeare in his iudgement that ſearcheth the heart
and reines. Such as do not feare his cenſure will make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of diſobeying men pretending authority from him: Such
as with feare and trembling expect the ſonne of mans appearance
will not much eſteeme, how they bee iudged by men further then
in reaſon they may be perſwaded; their ſentence ſhall bee ratified
in the laſt day of iudgement. And becauſe God hath endued ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
gouernours with power of retaining and remitting ſinnes;
euery one that feares him which gaue, will feare to diſobey
them to whom this power is giuen; leſt if they retaine, hee will
not remit; and retaine they iuſtly may, or rather muſt, the ſinnes
of all ſinnes, as adde thirſt to drunkenneſſe, contempt of Gods
meſſengers, ſummons to repentance vnto actuall breaches of his

vpon ignorance of the Law, inconſideratenes or fooliſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but continued after proclamation made in the Kings name,

               <p>12 Though it bee moſt true what hath been before deliuered,
that vnto Paſtors conditionall obedience is onely due,<note place="margin">Conditionall obedience of two ſorts.</note> yet is not
the condition precedent to all acts of obedience, but ſubſequent

atwel of the Papiſts error in demanding abſolute obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all condition of limitation, as of many Proteſtants granting
leſſe then is due to Paſtors, that is obedience onely vppon this

acts be ſincere, nor our refuſall (lawfully admoniſhed) ſafe: our

vnchriſtian, and rebellious. For which cauſe we are
abſolutely bound vnto habituall performance of this, ere wee
can bee admitted as lawfull auditors of Chriſts other precepts.
All other our reſolutions, or deliberate intendments; whether

loialty which we owe to Chriſt. No miniſter may expect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but vpon theſe conditions; &amp; he that ſincerely obeieth in the

to ſuch iniunctions, as vpon ſober and deliberate examination
ſeeme to croſſe the end they propoſe, would argue ſuch ſpirituall

               <p>15 Theſe rules hitherto mentioned ritely obſerued, there is
no greater difficulty in reſtraining vniuerſall precepts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Church; then in limitting generall commandements
of kings to their Deputies or Vice-gerents. Now, if a King ſhould
charge his ſubiects to obey his Lieutenant in all that hee ſhould
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7902:73"/>
command: any reaſonable man would take the meaning to bee
this; That hee ſhould bee obeyed in all things that belong vnto
the King; ſeruice, becauſe this is the end of his appointment, and
the proper ſubiect of this precept. No man in this caſe would
bee ſo mad, as to take the Princes word for his warrant, if by his
Lieutenant and he ſhould be put into ſome ſeruice, which here more
then ſuſpitious to bee traiterous, or apparently tending to the
Kings deſtruction. If a Ieſuite ſhould ſee the Popes agent or
nuncio (whom he were bound to obey by the Popes iniunction
deliuered in moſt ample termes) tampering with the Popes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
enemies; either conſorting with vs in our Liturgie, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with vs in our Sacraments; receiuing penſion from
forrainers, or ſecretly conferring with ſuch of their Counſellors
as had more wit then himſelfe; could hee diſpence with his oath
of abſolute allegeance to the Pope, vpon theſe or like euaſions?
This is ſuſpitious indeed; but how ſhall I know whether the
Popes Agent in doing this, doe diſobey his Holineſſe? If he ſay
no, muſt I not belieue him? muſt I not obey him, and doe as hee
doth, whom the Pope commands mee to obey in all things? The
Ieſuites are not ſo ſimple in the Popes cauſe, as they would make
all other in Gods: they could tell how to limit ſuch commands,
though deliuered in moſt vniuerſall and ample termes. This is
the matter then which ſo vexeth their denoute hearts, and ſets
them beſide themſelues with furious zeale in this argument; that

out of the abundance of their hearts, as the ſpirit gaue them vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and were not curious to caſt their words in ſuch exact ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtique

for the former, are to bee vniuerſally vnderſtood onely in
that ſubiect or matter, which for the preſent they mind moſt. As
when our Apoſtle commands ſeruants and children to obey the
one, their maſters; the other, their parents in all thinges: the
meaning is, as if hee had ſaid, yee that are chriſtian ſeruants, be ye
moſt willing to yeeld all obedience that is due vnto maſters; yee
that are Chriſtian children, to yeeld all obedience vnto your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
which is conuenient for any children to yeelde to theirs:
So that the vniuerſall note doth rather inioine a totality of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
and cheerefulneſſe, a perfection of ſincerity, in performing
that obedience which other children ought to their fathers, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to their maſters, then any way extend the obiect of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
childrens or ſeruants obedience to more particulars, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were bound vnto, at the leaſt hee doth not extend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of their obedience to any particulars which might preiudice
the ſincerity of their obedience due vnto other commanders; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
hee enioyneth ſeruants to obey their maſters in all things, he
reſerues their allegiance intire vnto Princes and higher powers.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7902:74"/>
Such muſt bee obeyed both by maſters and ſeruants, by fathers
and ſonnes. Much more doth God when hee inioynes obedience
in moſt ample forme vnto Kings or ſpirituall gouernors, reſerue
obedience due to himſelfe moſt intire and abſolute.</p>
               <p>18 Yet intire and abſolute it cannot be, vnleſſe it depend imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly

Nor can Chriſt be ſaid our ſupreme Lord, vnleſſe our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him and thoſe lawes which hee hath left vs, doe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

bound abſolutely to obey his Maſter in all points, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
whether his deſignements were not contrary to the
publike lawes and ſtatutes of his Prince and Country. Wherfore
as the oath of Allegeance vnto Princes doth reſtraine the former
precepts; <hi>Seruants obey your Maſters in all things,</hi> that is, in all
things that are not repugnant to publike lawes, nor preiudiciall
to the Crowne and dignity of your Soueraigne: ſo muſt that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
vow of fidelity made vnto Chriſt in Baptiſme, and our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledgement of him for our Soueraigne Lord, reſtraine
all precepts in ioyning performance of obedience to any power
on earth, and ſet theſe immoueable bounds and limits to them;
<hi>Obey thy King and Gouernour in all things, that is, in all things that
are not repugnant to the lawes and ordinances of the Great King, thy
ſupreame Lord and Gouernour.</hi> Whileſt thou obeyeſt him, thou
doeſt well, in diſobeying them, as well as that ſeruant that takes
Armes againſt his Maſter in the Kings defence, whileſt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyeſt
him, all other obedience is rebellion; <hi>Yee are bought
with a price</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>bee not yee the ſeruants of men;</hi>
Seruice according to the fleſh hee elſewhere approues, he ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inioynes: for that is freedome in reſpect of this ſeruitude of
minde and conſcience, in being wholly at any other mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>19 Nor is it more difficult for Chriſts ſeruants to diſcern when
gouernours ſollicite them to diſloyalty againſt him, then for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
according to the fleſh, to know when their maſters ſeduce
them vnto rebellion; ſo Chriſtian men would feare God, as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7902:74"/>
much as naturall men doe earthly Princes. Such as feare God,
are ſure of a better expoſitor of his lawes for fundamental points
then ſeruants can haue for their Princes. The tranſgreſſion of
both are eaſie to diſcern in the beginning of reuolts or apoſtaſies;
but the latter more difficult, when traitors or vſurpers are grown
ſtrong, and can pretend faire titles vnto ſoueraigneties, or coine
falſe pedegrees, yet is it not impoſſible for ſober and obſeruant
ſpirits in ſuch a caſe, to foreſee what party to follow; vnto ſuch
the ſignes of the time, and carriage of the ſeuerall cauſes will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
who haue the true title. But this difficulty is none in our
ſpirituall obedience, challenged by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for
that Church in words confeſſeth Chriſt to be the true King and
ſupreame Lord, no vſurper, which is as much as to ſay, the Pope
is an vſurper, and a rebell, that dares in deeds and ſubſtance cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

Nor doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other, beſide the baſe paraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Canoniſts, or the Popes trencher chaplaines, deny, but that
in many ciuill cauſes, the Prince or temporall Magiſtrate hath a
definitiue ſentence; can hee then gather out of any circumſtance
of this place, that onely ſpirituall cauſes are here meant? nay, hee
confeſſeth that the law is generall concerning all doubtes that
might ariſe out of the law; yea it is moſt probable, that it onely
concernes ciuill controuerſies, and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon to proue,
that it includeth ſpirituall cauſes, or matters of religion, is moſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
The occaſion of this Law (ſaith hee) was for them that did
ſerue other Gods as appeares, out of the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
now the ſeruice of other Gods is a point of Religion. But
what though <hi>Moſes</hi> in the former part of this Chapter ſpeake of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,
muſt this law therefore concerne Idolaters. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part hee ſpeaketh onely of Idolaters, but this law is not onely
for them by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion. Yea the circumſtances of the
place, and the expreſſe law againſt Idolaters mentioned before,
euince, that in this Chapter, as in the former, he firſt ſets downe
lawes concerning the true ſeruice of God, and in the latte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

giues precepts for the obſeruation of the ſecond Table, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of loue, by the finall compoſition of all controuerſies that
might ariſe betwixt neighbours. In the former law Idolaters are
ſentenced to death, and Idolatry (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is a point of
Religion; Was the Prieſt alone then to giue ſentence, and the
ciuill Magiſtrate onely to execute it. There is not the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for it out of this Text. Any ordinary Magiſtrate might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
him that was lawfully conuicted of this crime, nor was it ſo
hard a matter to iudge, who was an Idolater amongſt the Iewes,
as it is to determine what is an hereſie amongſt the Romaniſts.
This was to be proued by witneſſes, not by Logicall proofe or
force of ſpeculatiue reaſon: Had the cunningeſt Ieſuite in the
world been taken amongſt them kneeling down before an Image
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7902:76"/>
and praying to it, all the diſtinctions in the maſter of ſentences, or
<hi>Aquinas</hi> or both their Commentators could not haue redeemed
him, againſt two honeſt men that would haue ſworne hee would
haue done thus much; there had beene no appeale from any City
in <hi>Iudah,</hi> vnto any higher Court; his doome had been read in the
gates, and without them hee ſhould (as <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeakes) haue put
on a ſtony coat.</p>
               <p>3 That the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> were only to execute the Prieſts defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
ſentence in all hard controuerſies, is a poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel deſeruing
execution without appeale at Princes hands. And no doubt but
it did ſo amongſt the Iewes. The former Court as is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
was to ceaſe, when they had a King amongſt them. And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in the former Chapter, after he had giuen the other law for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
controuerſies, giues the law for the election of their king, if
ſo bee they would haue one: as if the former Court had then
ceaſed to bee the ſupreme Tribunall; ſeeing all Subiects might
appeale vnto the King from it, in which this Soueraignty did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſide, as being the ſupreme Tribunall, whence there could
be no appeale.</p>
               <p>4 The King in the Law concerning his qualification, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to haue the Law of his God written out.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 17. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>And it ſhall
bee with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of his life, that hee
may learne to feare the Lord his God, and to keepe all the words of his
Law, and theſe Ordinances for to doe them, that his heart bee not lifted
vp aboue his brethren, and that he turne not from the commandement
to the right hand, or to the left.</hi> Was hee to take all this pains, onely
that hee might learne to execute the Prieſtes definitiue ſentence?
This any heathen might haue done. But the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they were not to meddle in the execution of the Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
were notwithſtanding to bee ſo well skilled in Scriptures as
to bee able to iudge, whether the Prieſt did according to that Law
which God had ſet him to follow, and to controle his definitiue
ſentence, if it were euidently contrary to Gods word, which both
were abſolutely bound to obey.</p>
               <p>5 It may perhaps here be obiected, that the King had no ſuch
aſſurance of infallibility in iudgement as the Prieſt had, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was requiſite he ſhould rely vpon the Prieſtes definitiue
ſentence. What conſtruction then can any Ieſuite make of theſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7902:76"/>
words; <hi>A diuine ſentence ſhall bee in the lips of the King, his mouth
ſhall not tranſgreſſe,</hi> he ſaith not, in execution of iudgement giuen
by the Prieſts, but <hi>in iudgement</hi> giuen by himſelf, ſeeing it <hi>is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

                  <hi>Righteous lips</hi> (ſuch the Prieſts ſhould as

Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right things.</hi> This place
if wee reſpect either the abſtract forme of precept, or plenitude
of Gods promiſe for abiliment to performe it, is more plaine and
peremptory for the Kings, then any can bee brought for the high
Prieſts infallibility, in giuing definitiue ſentence; yet doth it not
neceſſarily inferre, <hi>Kings ſhall not;</hi> but rather ſhewes that they
ſhould not, or that they might not at any time erre in iudgement,
ſo they would ſtedfaſtly follow thoſe rules which God had preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them. For when God ſaith; <hi>A diuine ſentence ſhall bee in the
lips of Kings;</hi> this ſpeech doth no more argue a perpetuall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
in giuing righteous ſentence, then if he had ſaid; A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
or erroneous ſentence ſhall not be in the lips of Kings, or his
mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement. For as that which God
ſaith, ſhall not be done, oftimes is done: ſo may that which God
ſaith, ſhall bee done, bee oftimes left vndone. Who is hee then
would make this collection: God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> that
is no man ſhall ſteale, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no theeues, no theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
yet is our aduerſaries collection as fooliſh, <hi>The Prieſts lips
ſhall preſerue knowledge, Ergo</hi> they cannot erre in giuing definitiue
ſentence, or againe, <hi>The ſpirit ſhall lead you into all truth, they ſhall
be all taught of God;</hi> therefore the Church ſhall be infallibly taught
by the ſpirite, and ſhall as infallibly teach others, liue they as
they liſt.</p>
               <p>6 Theſe places ſhew what ſhould bee done, and what God for
his part will infallibly performe (ſo men would be obedient to his
word) but neither doe theſe, or any of like nature, include any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of not erring without performance of due obedience in
practiſe of life; nor doe they neceſſarily conclude, that men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſhall performe ſuch obedience. The moſt which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
is this, that Gouernours by duety are bound to performe,
that performing ſuch obedience in practiſe of life, they might bee
freer from error, in their doctrine or definitiue ſentence. And it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7902:77"/>
was abſtinence and integrity of life that was to preſerue ſincerity
of iudgement in Princes as well as Prieſts lips, for which reaſon
Princes had their precepts of temperance, anſwerable to thoſe
rules preſcribed for the Prieſts. So <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth kings,<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 31. ver. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue

is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drinke wine, nor for
Princes ſtrong drinke, leſt he drinke and forget the decree, and change
the iudgement of all the children of affliction.</hi> This place euidentlie
ſhewes, that if their Princes were of riotous or intemperate liues,
they had no promiſe that they ſhould not peruert the iudgement
of the children of affliction. The Concluſion hence ariſing is; all
the places that can bee brought, either for the King or Prieſts au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
rather ſhew what manner of men they ſhould be both in
life and iudgement, then aſſure them of any infallibility of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if they be diſſolute in life. This was a point neuer dreamt
of by any, before the Popes notoriouſly infamous liues, did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite
the titles of ſanctity and infallibility (which from a conceit
of their predeceſſors integrity they haue vſurped) and inforced
their paraſites to frame a diſtinction of ſanctity in doctrine ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from ſanctity in life.</p>
               <p>7 It is queſtionable, whether both Prieſtes and Princes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
had not an extraordinary priuiledge aboue all other nations,
both for being infallible in their definitiue ſentences whileſt they
liued according to the lawes which God had giuen them, and alſo
for their more then ordinary poſſibility of liuing according to
ſuch lawes. Gods bleſſings (as is moſt probable) in both theſe
reſpects, were extraordinary vnto their Princes and Prieſts: yet
not ſo infinitely extraordinary, that either of them might without
preſumptuous blaſphemy hope for ordinary integrity (ſuch as the
more ciuill ſort of heathens had) much leſſe for any abſolute infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
if they were extraordinarily wicked in their liues, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
in their other dealings. Euen the peoples wickedneſſe did
impaire the force and vertue of theſe extraordinary bleſſings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to their Kings and Prieſts, God gaue them prieſts as well
as Princes in his anger, ſuch as ſhould be plyable to their humor,
not ſuch as ſhould infallibly direct them againſt the ſuggeſtions
of the world and fleſh for their ſpirituall good. So that theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promiſes both for their ſpirituall and temporall gouernors
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7902:77"/>
ſincerity in iudgement, did depend in part vpon the condition of

is here enioyned, but not vniuerſally abſolute, nor in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

               <p>3 His ſecond fortreſſe is, that neither our Sauiour Chriſt, nor
his Apoſtles did euer taxe the <hi>Prelates,</hi> or inferiour <hi>Prieſts,</hi> by theſe
names directly, but alwayes vnder the name of Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,
leſt they might thereby ſeeme to reprehend the <hi>Prieſthood</hi>
or <hi>ſeat of authority.</hi> And this they did, that men might know, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reuerence to bee due vnto the <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>PrieſthOod,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Prelates</hi> in their liues and perſons were not
ſo commendable. The conſequence is not amiſſe; albeit his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
bee not ſo firme, and the corollary, which hee hence deduceth,
moſt malitious. Hence (ſaith hee) <hi>wee are giuen to vnderſtand, that
the heretikes of this age, which vpon euery occaſion inueigh againſt
Biſhops, Prieſts, eſpecially the Pope, doe but ill conſent in manners with
our Sauiour and his Apoſtles.</hi> But did neither our Sauiour Chriſt,
nor his Apoſtles taxe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelates</hi> by their proper names
for that reaſon which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings?<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> idle and malirious collections out of our Sauiours words refuted.</note> Wee may ſuppoſe I
truſt without offence, that Gods Prophets did not go beyond their
commiſſion, in taxing the chiefe offences or offendors of their
times; that our Sauiour or his Apoſtles might vpon the like or
greater occaſions, haue vſed the ſame forme of reprehenſion the
Prophets did, or other more perſonall. The true reaſon why ſo
they did not, was, becauſe they had no ſuch reſpect of perſons or
titles, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreames of, but aimed chiefly at the faireſt, for
ſuch vſually gaue greateſt countenance to fouleſt ſins. And who
knowes not, now in the Synagogues latter dayes, the glorious
titles of Scribes and Phariſes had, in a ſort drowned the names of
Prieſts; as the reputation of Ieſuites hath of late yeeres much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed
all other titles of inferiour miniſters, heretofore more fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mous
in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church? It was likewiſe the high eſteeme of
theſe two Saint like ſects, which ſeduced moſt ſilly ſoules throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Iewry,</hi> to follow traditions contrary to Gods lawes, as the
Ieſuites late ſame hath drawne moſt of the blind Churches chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7902:80"/>
(which goe more by eare then eye ſight) to account villany
piety, and falſhood ſubtlety. As our Sauiour and his Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the <hi>Rabbies</hi> or Prieſtes in their times, not vnder the
names of <hi>Prieſtes</hi> and <hi>Leuites,</hi> but vnder the glorious names
of Scribes and Phariſies, then reputed the onely guides of
godlineſſe: ſo would they, were they now on earth (as wee
in imitation of them) taxe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, eſpecially vnder
the names of Ieſuits, or other more famous orders in that church.
But the Sect of Scribes and Phariſes being not knowne in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi>
time, nor any other order ſo glorious then, as the order of
Prieſts,<note place="margin">Mala. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

O yee Prieſts this commandement is for you.</hi> So did <hi>Micah</hi> and <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and euery <hi>Prophet,</hi> as their demerites gaue occaſion.</p>
               <p>4 His third fortreſſe is, that whatſoeuer Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Moſes</hi>
chaire, muſt he conceiued to make more for Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> and ſuch
as ſate therin. Why our Sauiours admonition ſhould make more
for the Popes authority within his owne territories then it did
for the Scribes and Phariſes, or High Prieſts authority in the land
of Iewry; I ſee no reaſon that it may concerne the people, liuing
vnder the Pope, and Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> as much as it did the people
of <hi>Iewry</hi> then ſubiect to the High Prieſt, Scribes and Phariſes, I
will not deny; for ſuch Iudges as they were, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> in
their ſeuerall generations may bee, nay, would God they were
not. Let vs ſee then, what infallibility in giuing definitiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> can proue out of the fore-mentioned place. The
words are plaine, <hi>Whatſoeuer they bid you doe, that doe.</hi> What, all
without any exception? nay, you doe the Papiſts wrong, if you
collect ſo; <hi>Whatſoeuer they ſpeake ex Cathedra.</hi> Then the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though moſt vniuerſall for the forme is reſtrained by our
aduerſaries themſelues, vnto ſuch doctrines onely, as they taught
<hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> And iuſtly, ſeeing this reſtraint hath more apparent
ground in the Text then any other. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>they ſit in
Moſes ſeat,</hi> they are infallible, not alwaies, becauſe they ſomtimes
ſit; but whiles <hi>they ſit in Moſes ſeat,</hi> or giue ſentence out of it; what
is it then to giue ſentence out of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat? to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
ſolemnly, and vpon deliberation? If vnto all their doctrines
or definitiue ſentences ſo prononnced, men had beene bound in
conſcience to yeeld obedience: the Pope (as ſhall bee ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none)
had neuer ſate in <hi>Peters chaire;</hi> yea, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe had been

in conſcience bound to be an <hi>Apoſtata</hi> from Chriſt.<note place="margin">

the meaning of theſe words? <hi>They ſit in Moſes ſeat, all therefore

ſay, whileſt they ſit in Moſes ſeat, hee ſpeakes not of theirs, but of
Moſes his doctrine. the meaning is, as if hee had ſaid, whatſoeuer the
law or Moſes (recited by the Scribes and Phariſes) ſhall ſay vnto you,
that obſerue and doe, but doe not yee according to their works.]</hi> This he
takes to bee Saint <hi>Hilaries,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> expoſition of the
place. If any man yet further demand, why our Sauiour did not
ſpeake more plainely, <hi>[Whatſoeuer Moſes ſaith, obſerue and doe]</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>[Whatſoeuer the Scribes and Phariſes ſay, obſerue and doe:]
Maldonat</hi> in the ſame place giues two reaſons: <hi>The first, becauſe
our Sauiour did now purpoſe to taxe the Scribes and Phariſes hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
which hee had not taxed, vnleſſe hee had ſhewed, that they taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then they liued. The ſecond, that in this Chapter hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to reprehend the Scribes and Phariſes ſharpely, and therefore it was
expedient,</hi> hee ſhould firſt commend them for ſome things, leſt
all his reproofes might ſeeme to proceed from paſſion, or want
of iudgement. Thus farre <hi>Maldonat,</hi> vnto whoſe anſwere wee
may adioyne, that our Sauiour Chriſt (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> alſo wel hath
noted) did ſpeake theſe words vnto ſuch as had ſeene his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and heard his doctrine, and yet could not bee his dayly audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
with his other Diſciples: but were to repaire to the Scribes
and Phariſes, as vnto their ordinary teachers, and inſtructers in
the Law. Here, if wee conſider the humor of rude and ignorant
people for ſuch may wee ſuppoſe moſt of his auditors were as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7902:81"/>
yet) it was very likely they would either be ſlow to heare, or ready
to diſtaſt any doctrine that ſhould proceed from the Scribes and
Phariſes mouthes, whom they had heard ſo much diſcommended
by that bleſſed mouth, which ſpake as neuer mans did. For it is
a worke of great iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay of the ſpirit ouerruling the
fleſh, to make men relliſh their doctrine, whoſe liues &amp; conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
they loath. And ſuch as are but ſchollars (though neuer
ſo meane) to an excellent maſter, will vſually be puft vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a
conceit of themſelues, from other mens conceit and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of him, and in this humor ſcorne to learne of any more
meanely qualified, or of leſſe eſtimation in the ſame profeſſion.
Againe, there is a iealouſie in moſt illiterate minds, that their
Preacher, if hee follow not ſuch leſſons in his life, as hee giues
them, doth not teach them as they ſhould bee taught, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them ſincerely as hee thinkes, but rather in policy inioynes
them ſtrictneſſe of life, that hee himſelfe may follow his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
without partners.</p>
               <p>5 Hence vſually are many wholeſome ſpirituall medicines
diſproued,<note place="margin">The originall of iealouſies in the ſlocke, or needleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of Paſtors.</note> ere proued or taſted, becauſe the parties vnto whom
they are tendred, haue no conceit or relliſh of any good, but
what is pleaſant to ſenſe, or profitable for ſecular purpoſes; ſuch
as none that truely thinke, or call good, but will ſo entertaine it
in action and reſolution, neuer willingly preferring the leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the greater, both being of the ſame kind. If a man ſhould
make choice of that bargaine, which he would perſwade as leſſe
commodious vnto others; none would belieue hee ſpake ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
as hee thought, but rather cunningly to preuent others, or
to effect his owne gaine without a ſharer. But whileſt ſecular
good ſtands in competition with ſpirituall, albeit wee approue
the one as truely good, and condemne the other as euill; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the beſt of vs is often enforced to take vp that complaint; <hi>To
will is preſent with me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>but I finde no means to performe that which is
good for I doe not the good things which I would, but the euill which I
would not, that doe I.</hi> Rude and illiterate mindes, ignorant of this
difference betweene ſenſitiue and ſpirituall good, as altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the one, out of their owne cuſtom alwayes to act
what they intend, ſuſpect their Paſtors, whileſt they commend
wholeſome food vnto them, do not thinke becauſe they do not as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7902:81"/>
they ſay. From this ſourſe iſſue theſe or the like mutterings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelues, Tuſh, if our Parſon were of the ſame minde
out of the Pulpit, as he makes ſhew for in it; why ſhould bee not
frame his life accordingly? Doth he loue vs (trow we) better then
himſelfe? nay, I warrant him, hee is old inough to know what is
good for himſelfe: and if he knew that which he bids vs do, to be
as good for him, as hee would make vs belieue it is for vs; what
a Gods name, hinders him from doing it? he hath little elſe to doe
beſides, much leſſe I am ſure then any of vs.</p>
               <p>6 To meet perhaps with all theſe, but eſpecially with this laſt
temptation, our Sauiour giues his auditors this preſeruatiue; <hi>The
Scribes and Phariſes ſit in Moſes chaire, all therefore whatſoeuer they

As if hee had ſaid, Though their liues bee hypocriticall and bad,
yet bee not too iealous of their doctrine: They deliuer that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
vnto you, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did teach your forefathers. The
doctrine is exceeding good, howſoeuer theſe curſed hypocrites do
not follow it: But this is Gods iudgement vpon them, that they

               <p>8 If we take this whole vniuerſall affirmatiue, <hi>[Whatſoeuer they
bid you, that obſerue and do]</hi> in that ſenſe our Sauiour meant it: it

they which commend it to you for good, are euill, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
teach themſelues to doe it. Few Preachers in any well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Church, are ſo vnlearned, or bad of life, but what they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
one time or other deliuer out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,
might be a ſufficient rule for their hearers internall thoughts, and
outward actions: did not the flocke prepoſterouſly make their
Paſtors doings, the rule of their thoughts and ſayings; alwayes
ſuſpecting that, as not good, which they ſee left vndone, and
accounting all lawfull for themſelues to doe, which they ſee
done and practiſed by their leaders. When as not the Paſtors liues
or doings; but their ſayings are to bee made rules of other mens
liues and actions. And our Sauiour enioynes the former obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
vnto the very Phariſes; who ſpake as well, and did as ill as
any could doe; very patterns of hypocriſie. In expounding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
hey could not but often inculcate the orthodoxal doctrine of
good workes, of almes deedes, and liberality; yet retained they
the rootes of auarice in their hearts, whoſe bitterneſſe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
it ſelfe vpon particular occaſions,<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 16. v. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>All theſe things heard the
Phariſes,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Luke, which were couetous, and they mocked him.</hi>
They often exhorted others to circumciſe the heart, to be humble
and meeke as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, yet remained proud themſelues, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of higheſt places in the Synagogues,<note place="margin">Luc. 11, v. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>inwardly fully of rauen and
wickedneſſe.</hi> They often taught others as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done, to walk
vprightly as in the ſight of the Lord their God; and <hi>yet did all their
works to bee ſeene of men.</hi> They had often taught their auditors
to honour father and mother, and learnedly diſcourſed vpon the
equity of this precept in generall: yet could vpon priuate reſpects
diſpenſe with it in ſundry particulars. They ſaid well in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and did ill in the latter. And albeit they iuſtified their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
by tradition of the elders (as the Pontificians doe theirs,
when they abſolute ſubiects from the bond of duet, to their ciuil;
or children; to their naturall parents, that they may bee more

by the Pope (<hi>who muſt bee preſident in their Councels, as</hi>

                  </gap>hey ſhall proceed from the holy
Ghost, for the reaſon which wee haue learned of the Euangeliſt, to wit,
becauſe ſuch as giue them, are Prelates of Chriſts Church. And this is
all I haue to ſay vnto the ſecond argument.</p>
               <p>12 It is eaſie indeed for them thus to anſwere: to whom it is
moſt eaſie and moſt vſuall to blaſpheme, That the Popes, aſwell
as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prophecies, may in the euent proue true and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Chriſts Church, wee doe not doubt: becauſe vnto ſuch
as loue God, or are beloued of him, all things, euen Sathans
malice that had ſuborned <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and his brethren againſt Chriſt
and his members, turne to the beſt. But hee that had taken this
<hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> whileſt hee vttered this ſentence, for an infallible
Prophet of the Lord, had been bound in conſcience to haue done
ſo to our Sauiour at his, as the people did to <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
inſtigation. If our aduerſaries will permit vs to interprete the
<hi>Trent</hi> Councels decrees, as the faithfull of thoſe times did <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
prophecie: wee will ſubſcribe vnto them without delay. It
is expedient, wee grant, and profitable withall vnto the Church,
that there ſhould bee ſuch decrees, whereby the faith of others
might bee tried. But as it was not lawfull for the people, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue
their hands in Chriſts bloud, though the greateſt benefite
that euer befell the world, was by his death: ſo neither is it ſafe
to admit the <hi>Trent Canons,</hi> though a wonderfull bleſſing of God
they ſhould be ſet forth, becauſe they ſo clearely teſtifie the truth
of his word concerning Antichriſt. <hi>Canus</hi> ſaid more in this then
was needfull, according to his ſuppoſed principles in his anſwere
to the next argument. But God who ruled the mouth of <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi>
and made him ſpeake the trueth, when hee intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe, did alſo direct <hi>Canus</hi> penne to vent, what vpon
better conſideration hee would haue concealed. Yet herein hee
wrote, but out of the abundance of his owne, and moſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

hearts, who hold that the Prieſts and Phariſes did erre one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a matter of fact, not in any point of faith, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Chriſt. Of which in the next Chapter. For concluſion of
this, conſider with me, Chriſtian Reader, how great cauſe we haue
to thanke our gracious God, that the ſect of Ieſuites, or rabble
of Predicants, were not founded in our Sauiours dayes; for
then doubtleſſe the Diuell had picked a traitor out of that crue,
whoſe impudent, ſophiſticall Apologies for open blaſphemie, and
vnrelenting perſeuerance in traiterous plots, might haue outfaced
the world, that the deliuering of Chriſt into his enemies hands
had beene no ſuch ſinne, as <hi>Iudas</hi> teſtified it was, both by his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſpeech, and deſperate end.</p>

then may all the promiſes made or ſuppoſed to bee made

reades their writings can bee ignorant, that all their chiefe and

If hee haue not, it muſt needes bee, either becauſe hee could not

giue his definitiue ſentence alone, without euidence of the fact
it ſelfe, whereunto hee ties mens faith, as ſhall appeare by your
owne confeſſions. Nor do you limit him any time, as well in the
afternoone, as in the forenoone; as well (for ought wee can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
when drinke is in, and his wits out of his head, as when he
is ſober. For you hold it not neceſſary for him to vſe any long
deliberation. But, if it be his will to bind all Chriſtians to belieue
him, the whole Church muſt belieue that he was herein directed
chiefe by the holy Ghoſt: for the Church is bound to heare their
Paſtor: And, if hee binde all men to belieue him, then muſt all
of neceſſity belieue, that hee was infallibly aſſiſted by the holy
Ghoſt, in ſhewing that which hee binds them to belieue: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the whole Church might erre, nay were bound to erre,
becauſe it is bound to belieue the Pope. Theſe conſequents are

for you to proue, that any ſentence in your Church hath beene ſo
pronounced, or can bee, although the Pope himſelfe bee preſent
in the Councell, and bee an eye witneſſe of all proceedings.</p>
               <p>8 Yet if any of you ſhould here ſhufle (as yee vſually doe at the

nay ſure they did faile in ſome circumſtance which we know not,
and did not indeed ſpeak <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> albeit they ſeemed ſo to do:
wherefore this doth not conclude againſt the Popes infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

ſo hard to bee knowne, euen by theſe that heare him, whether hee
obſerue all circumſtances required to the exerciſe and true vſe of
ſuch infallible authority, and whether her hee ſpeake <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> or
no, when he may ſeeme to ſundry ſo to ſpeake; it would be the
onely ſafe courſe for all Chriſtian Churches vtterly to renounce
all obedience to him, but vpon examination of his doctrine, to
ſtand continually vpon their guard, leſt vnder pretence of this his
infallible authority, when he ſpeakes <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> hee may worke
ſome ſuch ineſtimable miſchiefe vnto the Scriptures, or Chriſtes
choſen here on earth, as theſe High Prieſts did vnto Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
by his ſeeming to ſpeake <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> when hee doth not. If,
by abuſing this his infallible authority, he ſhould either make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
theſe Scriptures, or animate the people to imbrue their hands
in the bloud of Chriſts deereſt Saints: it is not his ſpeaking <hi>ex
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7902:90"/>
Cathedra,</hi> that can redeem their ſoules from hell, nor reſtore Gods
word againe; for theſe are matters of an higher price, then that
they ſhould bee purchaſed with two or three words of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
vnhallowed mouth.</p>
               <p>9 To conclude, if this authority of your Church be but ſuch,
as the ancient Church of the Iewes had; you cannot expect any
faithfull people ſhould otherwiſe eſteeme of your decrees, then
the faithfull in our Sauiours time were bound to eſteeme of the
Iewiſh High-Prieſts and Elders, whom ſurely they did not take
for Chriſts onely, nor beſt friends. If the Popes infallibility bee
but ſuch, as theſe high Prieſts had: you may bee as guilty of the
bloud of Chriſts Saints, as they were. If you will challenge (as

The Pope would bee proclaimed ſo abſolutely infallible by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable
pattent or inheritance, as no breach of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
no touch of diſloyalty to Chriſt in actions, might breede
a forfeyture of his eſtate, or eſtrange Chriſtian conſciences from
yeelding obedience to him, euery way as compleat and abſolute,
as that which the people of God performed vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> or
Chriſtians doe yet vnto their Sauiour. Whence though we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>Moſes</hi> infallibility, and his to be the ſame; yet the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the abſoluteneſſe of their authority, or the tenour, or
holds of this ſame infallibility, would be ſuch, as is betweene a
Tenant at will, or one that enioyes a faire eſtate, perhaps, all his
life time, yet onely by continuance of his Lords good liking of
his faithfull ſeruice, &amp; a Freeholder that cannot by any act of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,

               <p>5 Againe, albeit the authority gotten, or manner of holding
it, were the ſame; yet the manner of getting it in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
Pope is not alike. The one profers no miracle for the purchaſe, no
ſigne from heauen, no admirable skill in expounding Gods word;
his calling hee profeſſeth to bee but ordinary, and in this reſpect
(ſay his followers) hee was to ſucceed Saint <hi>Peter: Moſes</hi> not ſuch,
nor ſo affected: his miracles were many and great; the ſignes &amp;

extraordinarily extraordinary: otherwiſe that obedience the
people performed to him, had beene no leſſe then deſperate Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
as the challenge of the like without like proofe &amp; euidence
of ſuch fauour with God, is no better then blaſphemie or Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

                  <hi>as the Lord had ſaid, and as the Lord had ſworne vnto

vp Iudges which deliuered them out of the hands of their oppreſſors:
yet when the Iudge was dead, they returned, and did worſe then their

                  <hi>in following other gods, to ſerue them, and worſhip them, they

What rule then was left to reclaime them? the infallible propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
of their Prieſts? Though theſe or an Angell from heauen
ſhould haue propoſed any other doctrine, then what was conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to their written law (whoſe true meaning in this reſpect, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of them ſhould haue knowne) <hi>Moſes</hi> curſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
had ouertaken them following it. So much were they
addicted vnto <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts propoſals,<note place="margin">Of <hi>Gedeons</hi> diſtruſt, and the meanes how his faith was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> that Angels could ſcarſly be
heard, though ſuggeſting nothing but what their Lawgiuer had
taught, though aſſuring them by their preſence of ſuch aſſiſtance
from their mighty God as he had promiſed. Thus when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of theſe heauenly ſouldiers, ſought to encourage Gedeon,
<hi>The Lord is with thee thou valiant man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 6. v. 13.</note> Hee replies, <hi>Ah, my Lord,
if the Lord be with vs, why then is all this come vpon vs, and where be
all his miracles which our fathers told vs of, and ſaid, Did not the Lord
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7902:97"/>
bring vs out of Egypt? but now the Lord hath forſaken vs, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs into the hand of Midianites.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I will not
deny but the Lord hath done of old, as our fathers haue declared
vnto vs; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtory I diſtruſt not, but am ſure he hath dealt farre
otherwiſe with vs.</p>
               <p>7 But doth this defect of faith in him, conuince the law of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
rather the obiect of his diſtruſt, might haue taught him
to haue belieued the perfection of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, which had ſo often
forewarned them of ſuch oppreſſion by their enemies, when they
forſooke the God of their fathers. Theſe forwarnings had <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
belieued aright; hee had not diſtruſted the Angels exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What was the reaſon then of his miſbelieuing, or rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeeing
that part of the law? Not ignorance of Gods word in
generall; for the miracles related by <hi>Moſes</hi> he had in perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
What then? want of ſufficient authority to propoſe vnto
him theſe particular reuelations, or their true meaning? This is all
the Romaniſt can pretend. Yet what greater authority could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
then that Angell had, which ſpake vnto <hi>Gideon?</hi> Our Apoſtle
ſuppoſeth any Angels propoſall of diuine doctrines, to be at the

<hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Cephas) or</hi> (which he ſuppoſeth to be more) <hi>an Angell
from heauen preach vnto you otherwiſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>then wee haue preached vnto
you, let him be accurſed.</hi> Or, if wee reſpect not onely the perſonal
authority of the propoſer, but with it the manner of propoſing
Gods word: What propoſall can wee imagine more effectuall
then this great Angel of the couenants reply vnto <hi>Gideons</hi> diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>8 Whether <hi>Gideons</hi> diffidence after all this, were a ſinne, I leaue
it to bee diſputed by the Ieſuites. A defect or dulneſſe, no doubt
it was, and onely in reſpect of the like in vs, they hold a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the viſible Churches infallibility: vnto whoſe ſentence
whoſoeuer fully accords not, is by their poſitions, vncapable
of all other infallible means of diuine faith. To pretend doubt
or diſtruſt of Gods word once propoſed by it, yea, to ſeeke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſatisfaction or reſolution of doubts then it ſhall vouchſafe to
giue, is more then a ſinne, extreame impiety. Yet had this great

Angell ſtood vpon his authority in ſuch peremptory tearms, <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi>
had died in his diſtruſt. For after a ſecond reply made by <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi>

thee, if I haue found fauour in thy ſight, then ſhew mee a ſigne that thou
talkeſt with me: Depart not hence I pray thee, vntill I come vnto thee,

euident documents fully perceiued it was an Angell of the Lord
that had parlied with him all this time, erecting his deiected heart
with theſe comfortable words, <hi>Peace bee with thee, feare not, thou
ſhalt not die;</hi> He yet demands two other ſignes before hee aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
vpon the Angels word. But after it is once confirmed vnto
him by experience of his power, in keeping his fleece drie in the

as theſe did againſt <hi>Michaiah.</hi> The point wherein wee deſire
reſolution, is, by what rule of Romiſh Catholique Diuinity, truth
in thoſe times might haue beene diſcerned from falſhood before
Gods iudgements did light vpon the City and Temple. Hee is
more blind then the blindeſt Iew that euer breathed, who cannot
ſee how ſuch as profeſſed themſelues Prieſts and Prophets of the
Lord, aſwell in <hi>Iudah</hi> as in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did bewitch the people with
the ſelfe ſame ſpels the Papiſts boaſts of to this day, as the beſt
prop of his Catholike faith. Yet ſuch is the hypocriſie of theſe
proud Phariſes, that they can ſay in their hearts; <hi>Oh had wee liued
in the dayes of Iezabel, we would not haue beene her inquiſitors againſt
ſuch Prophets as Elias and Micaiah were:</hi> When as in truth <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>
impietie towards them, was clemency in reſpect of Romiſh
cruelty againſt Gods Saints, her witchcrafts but as veniall ſins,
if wee compare them with Ieſuiticall ſorceries. But of this error
more directly in the Chapter following; of their ſorceries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
hereafter.</p>
               <p>3 Vnto our former demand, [whether the ſociety of Prophets
were the Church repreſentatiue, whether the people were bound
without examination to belieue whatſoeuer was by a <hi>maior</hi> part,
or ſuch of that profeſſion as were in higheſt or moſt publike place
determined.] What anſwere a learned Papiſt would giue I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell. Then this following, better cannot be imagined on their
behalfe, [That this ſupreme authority which they contend for,
was in the true Prophets onely; that they, albeit inſpired with
diuine illuminations, and endued with ſuch authority as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
makes the Popes <hi>humana diuinitas inſpirala,</hi> did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
permit their declarations, for the hardneſſe of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
heart to be tried by the euent, or examined by the law, not
that they wanted lawfull power (would they haue ſtood vpon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7902:101"/>
their authority) to exact beliefe without delay; ſeeing readineſſe
to belieue the truth propoſed, is alwayes commended in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Story. And no doubt, but the people did well in admitting
the true Prophets doctrine, before the falſe, at the firſt propoſal;
the ſooner, the better. But were they therefore to belieue the true
Prophets abſolutely without examination? Why ſhould they
then belieue one of that profeſſion, before another; ſeeing ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
could propoſe their conceits with as great ſpeed and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſſe
as the beſt? Nor did reaſon onely diſſwade, but the<note n="*" place="margin">Iud. 13. 1,.</note> law
of God alſo expreſly, forbid that people, alwayes, and in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to truſt ſuch, as vpon triall had beene found to diuine aright
of ſtrange euents. Yet grant wee muſt, that hardneſſe of heart
made this people more backeward, then otherwiſe they would
haue beene to belieue truthes propoſed; that oftimes they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſignes from their Prophet, when obedience was inſtantly due
from them to him; that oftimes they ſinned in not aſſenting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
without interpoſition of time for triall, or reſpite to
reſolue vpon what termes beliefe might be tendered. Thus much
wee may grant with this limitation; [if we conſider them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
or ſo well diſpoſed as they ſhould,<note place="margin">In what caſes and perſons pronenſſe to belieue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular truthes is commendable, in what or in whom ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> and might haue beene,
not as the Prophets found them.] For in men inwardly ill affected
or vnqualified, for true faith, credulity comes neere the nature
of vice then vertue, a diſpoſition of diſloyalty, a degree of hereſie
or infidelity, rather then a preparation to ſincere obedience, or
any ſure foundation of true and liuely faith. Aſſent perchance
men ſo affected, may more readily then others would vnto ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
diuine truthes: yet not truely not as they are diuine and
conſonant to the rule of goodneſſe, but by <hi>accident,</hi> in as much
as they in part conſort with ſome one or other of their affections.
And the more forward men are vpon ſuch grounds, to belieue
ſome generalities of Chriſtian dueties; the more prone they
proue, when opportunity tempts them, to oppugne others more
principall, and more ſpecially concerning their ſaluation. For cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
if it ſpring not out of an honeſt diſpoſition vniformally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>4 It is a rule as profitable for our owne information in many
points,<note place="margin">A rule for the right ſetling of our perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in diuine matters, or ripening of true faith.</note> as for refutation of the aduerſarie, that the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

bound their hopes of accompliſhing the one by perfect ſuruey of

Euen in buſineſſes of greateſt importance, though requiring ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt
expedition, a wiſe man will moderate his pace according to
the quality of the ground whereon hee goes, otherwiſe the more
haſte may cauſe worſe ſpeed. The Iewes were, as wee are, bound
to belieue truthes propoſed without delay: but both for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
moſt ſtrictly bound to a continuall vniformity of practiſing
diuine precepts already knowne, without diſpenſing with this or
that particular, though offenſiue to our preſent diſpoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
indulgence to this or that ſpecial time, without all priuiledge
ſought from the pleaſure or diſpleaſure of men, both bound, ſo to
frame our liues and conuerſations, as to bee inſtantly able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the truth propoſed, not by relying vpon their authority
that propoſe it, but for it ſelfe, or from a full and liuely, though
a quicke and ſpeedy apprehenſion of immediate homogeneall
conſonancie betweene the externall and the internall word. For
if any part of Gods word truly dwell in vs, though ſecret it may
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7902:103"/>
bee and ſilent of it ſelfe, yet will it Eccho in our hearts, whileſt
the like reuerberates in our eares from the liue voice of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
Thus had the Iewes hearts beene truely ſet to <hi>Moſes</hi> law,
had their ſoules delighted in the practiſe of it as in their food, they
had reſounded to the Prophets call, as a ſtring though vntouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and vnable to beginne motion of it ſelfe, will yet raiſe it ſelfe
to an vniſon voice, or as the ſoules of heauen anſwere with like
language to others of their owne kind, that haue better occaſion
to beginne the cry. In this ſenſe are Chriſts ſheepe ſaid to heare
his voice, and follow him; not euery one that can counterfeit his
or his Prophets call,</p>
               <p>5 The iſſue of all that hath beene ſaid is, that none within the
precincts of theſe times, whereof wee now treat, from the Law,
giuen, vnto the Goſpell, were bound to belieue Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
without examination of their doctrine by the precedent
written word. Onely this difference there was; ſuch as had right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

as it were by a preſent taſte, which others could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Moſes</hi> to blow and flouriſh in them by little and little after the
manner of naturall growth, it did not alwayes bring forth new
ones in an inſtant, as the earth did at the firſt creation. Much
more vſually did propheſies during the ſtanding of the firſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſpring out of Moſaicall predictions. If wee compare his
writings with latter propheſies, not long before the Babyloniſh
captiuity, though hee had departed this life before their fathers
entred into the land of promiſe, yet hee ſpeakes vnto this laſt
generation as an intelligencer from a farre Country, that great
preparation was made againſt them, but who ſhould bee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners
or managers of miſchiefe intended; hee leaues that to
ſuch Prophets as the Lord ſhould raiſe them vp for the preſent.
<hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> vpon his admonition, following his direction,
are ſent by God, as it were, to ſcowre the coaſt, to diſcrie when the
Nauy comes, for what Coaſt it is bound, and how neare at hand.
Here had the people faithfully examined their hearts by <hi>Moſes</hi>
law, whether not guilty of ſuch ſinnes as deſerued the plagues
threatned by him, they had quickly aſſented vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and the Prophets words. For as conſciouſneſſe of their
ſinnes in generall, might cauſe them feare ſome plague or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
indefinitely threatned by their Lawgiuer, whoſe writings
they beſt belieued: ſo might the diligent obſeruation of their
particular tranſgreſſions, and their progreſſe in them, haue
taught them to preſage the determinate manner of their plagues
and puniſhments foretold by the preſent Prophet. For God in
his vſuall courſe of iuſtice, ſo ſuites his puniſhments to the moſt
accuſtomary habits or predominant ſinnes, as vnto men religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
obſeruant of times and ſeaſons, the growth and proceſſe of
the one will giue a certaine criſis of the other. Beſides euery age
hath peculiar ſignes ſubordinate to the generall predictions of
good or euill foretold by Gods meſſengers, whereby the faithfull
learne to know the day of their viſitation, and as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>to hide themſelues (in latibulo altiſsimi) from the plague</hi>;) if not by
their hearty repentance, godly prayers, and religious endeauors
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7902:108"/>
to preuent it. And becauſe wee in this age, are not ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the particular ſignes of former times, wherein true
Prophets liued, it is hard for any liuing now, though eaſie to all
the faithfull then, to giue any certaine or particular rule how the
truth of their propheſies might haue beene, at leaſt probably
knowne, before the euent did finally and abſolutely approue
them. Would to God wee could diſcerne the ſignes of times

               <p>3 Againe, there had beene no Prophet, no ſignes, no wonders,
for a long time in <hi>Iudah,</hi> before our Sauiours birth, yet hee neuer
made that vſe either of his miracles, or more then Propheticall
ſpirit, which the papiſts make of their imaginary publike ſpirit: he
neuer vſed this or like argument, to make the people relie vpon
him. How know yee the Scriptures are Gods word? How know
yee that God ſpake with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, or with your
Fathers in Mount <hi>Sinai? Moſes,</hi> your Fathers, and the Prophets
are dead, and their writings cannot ſpeake. Your preſent Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
the Scribes and Phariſes doe no wonders. Muſt you not then
belieue him whome daily you may behold doing ſuch mightie
workes as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to haue done; that <hi>Moſes,</hi> as your fathers
haue told you, was ſent from God; that Gods word is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his writings: otherwiſe you cannot infallibly beleeue that
there was ſuch a man indeed as you conceiue hee was, much leſſe
that he wrote you this Law, leaſt of all can you certainely know
the true meaning of what hee wrote. Hee that is the onely ſure
foundation of faith, knew that faith grounded vpon such doubts,
was but built vpon the ſand, vnable to abide the blaſts of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7902:109"/>
temptations; that thus to erect their hopes was but to prepare
a riſe to a grieuous downefall, the ready way to atheiſme, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
or deſpaire. For this cauſe hee doth not ſo much as
once queſtion how they knew the Scriptures to be Gods word:
but ſuppoſing them knowne and fully acknowledged for ſuch, he
exhorts his hearers to ſearch them, ſeeking to prepare their hearts
by ſignes and wonders to embrace his admirable expoſitions of
them. And becauſe the corruption of particular morall doctrines
brought into the Church by humane tradition, would not ſuffer
the generality of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets already belieued to
fructifie in his hearers hearts, and branch out vniformely into
liuely working faith: he laboured moſt to weede out Phariſaiſme
from among the heauenly ſeed, as euery one may ſee, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
his ſermon vpon the Mount, with the Phariſes gloſſes vpon
<hi>Moſes.</hi> If the particular, or principall parts of the law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
had beene as purely taught, or as clearely diſcerned, as the
generall and common principles: His Doctrine, that came not
to deſtroy, but to fulfill the law in words and works, had ſhined
as brightly in his hearers hearts at the firſt propoſall, as the ſunne
did to their eyes at the firſt riſing. For all the morall duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by them, were but as diſperſed rayes or ſcattered beams
of that diuine light and glory; which was incorporate in him, as
ſplendor in the body of the ſunne. Nor was there any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Iewes beliefe in him ſhould proſper, vnleſſe it grew out of

                  <hi>Had yee belieued Moſes</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour)
<hi>yee would haue belieued me, for he wrote of me, but if yee belieue not
his writings, how ſhall yee belieue my words?</hi> For which cauſe, they
were in conſcience bound to examine his doctrine by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
the Prophets: otherwiſe they might haue belieued the ſauing
truth,<note place="margin">To belieue Chriſt without examination of his doctrine by <hi>Moſes</hi> had beene neither to belieue Chriſt nor <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </note> but falſly; and vpon decitfull grounds. The ſtronger or
more abſolute credence they had giuen vnto his words or workes
without ſuch examination, the more they had enſnared their
ſoules, and ſet their conſciences vpon the Racke, by admitting a
poſſibility of contradiction betwixt two doctrines both firmely
belieued, without any euidence of their conſonancie, or bothes
conſpiring to the ſame end. The ſpeedier and higher this edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Chriſt had beene, the ſooner it might haue ruinated that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7902:110"/>
foundation which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had reared in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> vnleſſe this new worke had been orderly ſquared, well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
cloſely layed, and ſtrongly caemented vnto the former.
In ſecular ſchooles hee is held an vnwiſe anſwerer, that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Socraticall intertogations; for, albeit there appeare no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
in any one propoſed apart, yet in the proceſſe, a reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
may bee eaſily brought to grant concluſions, from which
he knowes not what conſequences may bee drawne, becauſe their
conſonancy with the probleme whoſe defence hee vndertakes, is
not ſo euident nor immediate, as vpon a ſodaine may bee fully
examined. And not examining the conſonancy of euery other
propoſition with the principles of that faculty, whereto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
belongs, the beſt anſwerer liuing may bee made either
grant what hee ſhould not, or deny what ſhould bee granted.
Now Chriſts doctrine was to Moſaicall and Propheticall, as the
concluſion to the premiſſes, or as the corollarie of greateſt vſe
vnto the ſpeculatiue theoreme. Suppoſe then a Iew well skilled
in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſhould inſtantly vpon the firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of our Sauiours ſermons, or ſight of his miracles, haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him for ſuch an infallible teacher, vpon tearmes as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and irreuocable, as the Ieſuite would haue the Pope ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all Chriſtians, a good diſputant might eaſily haue
ſtaggered him by theſe or like Socraticall demands; Doe you
ſtedfaſtly belieue <hi>Moſes</hi> writings for Gods word? God forbid I
ſhould doubt of this: Doe yee belieue this new doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by miracles as firmely? What if I doe? Doe you know
as certainely, whether both agree aſ well as one part of <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with another? What if I doe not? vntill you bee fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
in this, your beliefe in both cannot be ſound: for in caſe
they ſhould diſagree, the one muſt needes be falſe; and if choice
were giuen you, whether in ſooth would you diſclaime? Here a
wiſe man, that (as the wiſe King ſpeakes) had eyes in his head and
would not be led by a blind ſaith, would haue pauſed a while, and
thought with himſelfe, This is a point that ſhould bee looked to:
for if theſe new doctrines ſhould proue incompatible, as for any
iuſt examination hitherto made, they may, I cannot ſee whether
deſerues more credence; Whiles I conſider <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, &amp;
call to mind thoſe mighty wonders our fathers told vs, with like
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7902:110"/>
continuall experiments of their diuine truth; nothing can ſeeme
more certaine then they; againe, whiles I behold theſe new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
me thinkes his authority that workes them, ſhould bee as
great as <hi>Moſes</hi> was; yet if they ſhould happen to diſagree, the one
muſt bee better belieued then the other, or elſe (for ought I ſee)
there can bee no certainety of either; for, if this mans poſſibly may
bee, why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> doctrine likewiſe be falſe? or if our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were deceiued by his ſignes and wonders, why may not we
bee ſo ſerued by this mans miracles? But if vpon iuſt trial they ſhal
be found fully to agree in euery point (as I truſt they doe) then
doubtleſſe both are from God, and I ſhall ſtedfaſtly belieue this
new doctrine to be diuine, if ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> had foretold; &amp; withal,
more euidently acknowledge, then before I could, that <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſpake by the ſpirit of the all ſeeing, euerliuing God, if this <hi>Ieſus</hi> of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> be in all points like to him, and ſo qualified as hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
the great Prophet ſhould bee. But in the interim till the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bee made, it is beſt to lay ſure hold on <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets.
For <hi>prior tempore potior iure:</hi> their writings doubtleſſe were from
God, becauſe hitherto they could not bee deſtroyed: time and
they ſhall trie whether Ieſus and his doctrine be ſo or no; whether
he be that great Prophet that ſhould come, or we are yet to looke

little more then formerly both had heard: for the raiſing vp of
the widdowes ſonne which eſpecially occaſioned their comming
was the greateſt of all in this Catalogue, and yet as great as this,
ſome of the ancient Prophets had done; how could it then proue
him to be the Meſſias? Had he told them as much in plain terms,
they might haue beleeued him, becauſe this great worke did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
him to be a Prophet, and therefore one that could not lie:
But by this anſwere, how could they gather more, then the people

               <p>5 Yet this obiection, at leaſt the ſolution, confirms the truth
of my former aſſertion, that by his miracles alone conſidered, they

God would ſuffer ſeducers to worke wonders for the tryall

               <p>7 For mine owne part (vntill I bee by ſome others better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed)

his firſt comming in humility) vndervalew both his true miracles
and heauenly doctrine. Euen ſuch as are ſaid to haue belieued

thought themſelues ſo whole and ſound, as no way to neede his

But the queſtion is, vpon what tearmes, or how farre they
were bound to heare all. Abſolutely, and at firſt propoſall of their

might hee that could haue ſet the beſt legge foremoſt, and ſtept

hee wrought by the finger of God, who onely was greater then
that ſtrong man whom hee vanquiſhed, bound and ſpoiled of his

ſuffer themſelues to be commanded by men, neither of greateſt

inſtructed in Gods law, or illuminated with the notions of good

then wee in ſuch diſtance of time can diſcerne. That finger

farre more apparent in his victories ouer Sathan himſelfe,
then in <hi>Moſes</hi> ouer his Schollers the Enchanters, eſpecially whiles

would infallibly proue him to bee that great Prophet, <hi>Moſes</hi>

which hereafter.</p>
               <p>6 Here I may once for all conclude, that the power of doing
miracles was as effectuall to aſſure ſuch as did them of ſaluation,
as ſight of them done, was to eſtabliſh ſpectators in ſauing faith.
But the power of caſting Diuels out, or doing greateſt miracles,
was no infallible pledge of ſaluation to ſuch as did them: much
leſſe could the acknowledgement of this diuine power in them,
breede full aſſurance of true faith in others, but onely ſerue as a
meanes to cauſe them relie vpon the Law and Prophets as their
onely rule, and to taſte and proue the bread of life proffered
to them by our Sauiour, which alone could aſcertaine them by
their names were written in the booke of life. But to proceede by
the former rule.</p>
               <p>7 If others by experiments anſwerable to it,<note place="margin">Chriſt was to bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the great Prophet by his ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency in thoſe gifts of the ſpirit, whereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophets had beene approued.</note> were knowne to
bee true Prophets: Chriſt likewiſe by his knowne ſupereminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in that which approued them, was to be acknowledged for the
Prince of Prophets. Now, if wee reuiſe the hiſtorie of the olde
Teſtament, how few Prophets ſhall wee finde endowed with the
gift of miracles; ſuch as were, did exerciſe their power rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Idolaters, then true profeſſors. So, when Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were brought to as open competition with <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, in
the King of <hi>Iſraels;</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> had beene with the Enchanters, in

                  <hi>Elias</hi> makes his calling as cleare as the light,

thus much before, as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, no queſtion had done:
ſo as the euent, anſwering to his prediction, not to the others,
did, by <hi>Moſes</hi> rule, demonſtrate him to be, them not to be, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the liuing God. But when the like controuerſie was to

be tried betweene <hi>Zidkiah</hi> and his foure hundred complices, on

was obſerued before) appeales to this law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as moſt

to conteſtate the iſſue thus ioyned <hi>[and hee ſaid hearken all yee

and pregnant law of <hi>Moſes, Ieremy</hi> pleades his warrant, being born
downe by the contradictions of <hi>Hananiah</hi> a profeſſed Prophet of

hee propheſied peace vnto the preſent ſtate, and good ſucceſſe to
the Proiects then on foot;<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 28. v. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note>

I will ſpeake in thine eares, and in the eares of all the people. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that haue beene before mee, and before thee, in times past prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
againſt many Countries, and against great kingdomes, of warre,
and of plagues and of peſtilence. And the Prophet which propheſieth of
peace, when the word of the Prophet ſhall come to paſſe, then ſhall the
Prophet bee knowne that the Lord hath truly ſent him. Ezechiel</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
referres himſelfe to the ſame triall amongſt ſuch as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

it will come) then ſhall they know that a Prophet hath beene among
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 From theſe debatements,<note place="margin">In what caſe <hi>Moſes</hi> rule for diſcerning true Prophets did hold infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true.</note> we may gather in what caſes the
former rule held for certaine. Firſt, negatiuely, it was vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
true; for hee that propheſied any thing which came not to
paſſe, did ſufficiently proue himſelfe to bee no true Prophet, but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7902:117"/>
a counterfeit. So did not euery prediction of what afterwardes
came to paſſe, neceſſarily argue it to haue beene from God. Yet
as the force and vertue of many things, not ſuch of themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
euident from vicinity, or irriation of their contraries: ſo
though God permitted ſome to foretell ſtrange euents for triall
of his peoples faith; yet this power hee reſtrained when the
controuerſie came to a former triall; then hee cauſed the true
Prophets words to ſtand, whiles the predictions of the falſe, and
the Princes bloud which relied vpon them, fell to the ground, like
<hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke. So as the fulfilling of what the one, and
fruſtrating of what the other had ſaid, did ſufficiently manifeſt
the one had ſpoken of himſelfe preſumptuouſly; the other, what
the Lord had put into his mouth. Hence is the determination
eaſie, what meanes this people had to diſcern, amongſt true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
which was that Great one, in all things like to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Firſt
if euents foretold did ſufficiently teſtifie of his diuine ſpirit: his
owne witneſſe of himſelfe would bee authentike, becauſe a true
Prophet could hardly lie, or make himſelfe greater then he was.
This is an argument, which directly confutes ſuch, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Chriſt to haue been a Prophet, ſincere in doctrine; &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in deedes: and yet denie him to be the Prince of that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the great mediator of the new Couenant, both which hee
often auouched. Beſides the quantity of that ſpirit, whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
quality manifeſted him to bee a Prophet, would notifie his
exceſſiue Greatneſſe in that ranke and order, or more directly to
the queſtion.</p>
               <p>9 The great Prophet there ſpoken of was to be knowne by
his ſimilitude with <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Prophet in ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the words vſed by him, peculiar vnto Chriſt.</note> who was as the <hi>ſymbole, or proportional
meane</hi> betweene him and leſſer Prophets. Others in theſe few

in him after his reſurrection, becauſe he had foretolde his
reedefying the temple in three dayes ſpace. Which ſpeech of his
the fooliſh Iewes, not knowing his body to bee the true temple,
wherein their God did dwell after a more excellent manner then
betweene the Cherubins, take as meant of the materiall Temple,
which had beene 46. yeeres in building. But (ſaith Saint<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 2. v. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn)
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7902:120"/>
Aſſoone as he was riſen from the dead, his Diſciples remembred that

which Ieſus had ſaid.</hi> Nor did they compare theſe two together
by chance: for our Sauiour often inculcated this Methode, as
of purpoſe to imprint the former oracle of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in their hearts.
To aſſure them of his going to his father, he expreſly tels them:

and He that was glorified, were both one:<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn, 12. v, 28</note> 
                  <hi>Father, Glorifie thy
Name. Then came there a voice from heauen ſaying, I haue both glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it, and will glorifie it againe.</hi> How had hee glorified it before?
By glorifying this great Prophet, who did fully expreſſe, but
farre exceede <hi>Moſes,</hi> in all thinges wherein former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did reſemble him, but came farre ſhort of him. When
was hee ſo glorified? At his tranſfiguration vpon Mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> which none without ſacrilegious impiety could haue
foretolde, as likely to befall himſelfe, ſaue hee alone, that had,
not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> onely ſeene the ſimilitude of the Lord, but being in
the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall with him.
Yet this Prophet of whom we ſpeake, though like to his Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
in ſhape and ſubſtance, to aſſure them hee ſhould come in the
glory of his father, foretelles his Diſciples that ſome of them
ſhould not<note n="*" place="margin">Marc. 9. v. 1. Math. 16. v. 28. Luk. 9. 27. 2. Pet. 1. 17.</note> die vntill they had ſeene the Kingdome of God come

wel pleaſed, as for his ſake the world might henceforth know how
ready he was to heare all, that through faith in his name ſhould
call vpon him, euen ſuch as had diſpleaſed him moſt. For this
cauſe, the Codicill annexed to the diuine will and Teſtament here

or ancient prophecies, as well with the whole courſe of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
life, as with his ignominious and cruell death, or manner of
his glorious reſurrection, I ſhould either haue eſteemed or
regarded leſſe, had not my Sauiour himſelfe preferred the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of prophetical teſtimonies before the certainty of their ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes that
had conuerſed with him in their life time, admitted to conference
with him after his riſing from the dead. For ſo wee read of two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which had ſeene his miracles, heard his doctrine, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7902:126"/>
acknowledged <hi>him for a Prophet, mightie in word and deed:</hi> but yet
diſtruſted the report of his reſurrection after it had beene the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time confirmed by ſuch of their fellowes as had doubted
with them: yea their Maiſter himſelfe had told them as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

with diſtruſt, hauing now met them as liue-like as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
were? Was he to them a Prophet, mightie in word and
deed: and yet not able to performe what hee had conſtantly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
But what was the chiefe matter of their iuſt reproofe? That
they had not beleeued his wordes, nor giuen due credence to his
workes? Dull, no doubt, they had beene, in not eſteeming better
of both; vnwiſe, in not learning more of him, that taught as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
man taught: but (as in them hee teacheth vs) moſt dull and
moſt vnwiſe, euen<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 24. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>fooles and ſlowe of heart, in not beleeuing all
that the Prophets had ſpoken. Ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe
things</hi> (as if hee had ſaid, Is it poſſible your ignorance in them

<hi>and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. You will ſay perchance they did not well in giuing ſo little
attention and credite to the Prophets, whoſe light ſhould haue
led them vnto Chriſt: but now that they haue light on him in
perſon, without their helpe, onely by his ſeeking them, ſhall not
hee who was the end and ſcope of all propheticall writings, teach
them all? He will: but not by relying onely vpon his infallible
authoritie. This <hi>aedifice</hi> of faith muſt bee framed vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
laide by the Prophets. For this reaſon happily our Sauiour
would not bewray himſelfe to be their infallible teacher, vntill he
had made them by euidence of Scripture, by true ſence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his ſpirit, beleeue and knowe the truth, which he taught,
to be infallible. Hee had opened their hearts, by opening the
Scriptures vnto them before their eyes were open to diſcerne
his perſon: for<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 24. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>he began at Moſes and at all the Prophets, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
vnto them in all the Scriptures the things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

ſpring out of the ſolide experience of his skill, and trueth of his

this was he who <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid ſhould baptize with the holy Ghoſt and
with fire; when by the working of his ſpirit,<note n="c" place="margin">v. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>their hearts did burne

now they would not receiue the record of man; there is another that

               <p>3. Would the Pope who challengeth Chriſts place on earth
amongſt his liuing members, and requires we ſhould beleeue his
wordes, as well as theſe Diſciples did Chriſts, but expound thoſe
Scriptures vnto vs which Chriſt did to them, with like euidence
and efficacie; could hee make our hearts thus <hi>burne</hi> within, by
opening the ſecret myſteries of our ſaluation: wee would take
him for Chriſts Vicar, and beleeue indeede hee were infallibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

ſo diſtinctly and clearely as Chriſt did vnto theſe Diſciples,
nor by affoording vs the true ſence and feeling of the ſpirit, in
ſuch ardent manner as they enioyed it, and yet accurſeth vs if we
beleeue not his words as well as they did their Redeemers: wee
may hence take a perfect meaſure of that<note n="b" place="margin">A briefe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of the mouth of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of by S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>

contained in the three aſſertions prefixed to the beginning of this
Section. Nor can the reader imagine either any other forepaſſed,
like vnto it; or yet to come, likely to proue more abominable:
if it ſhall but pleaſe him to ſuruay the length and breadth of it,
but eſpecially the profunditie.</p>
               <p>4. The length of it I make that aſſertion; <hi>The Pope muſt bee as
well beleeued, as either Chriſt was whileſt hee liued on earth, or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
after his glorification.</hi> The breadth; <hi>His abſolute authoritie
muſt be for extent as large and ample as Chriſts ſhould be, were he on
earth againe;</hi> or that commiſſion he gaue to his Diſciples, <hi>Goe
Preach the Goſpell to euery creature: his directions muſt goe foorth
throughout all the earth, and his wordes vnto the endes of the world.</hi>
The depth is much greater then the ſpace betweene heauen and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7902:127"/>
hell. For if you would drawe a line from the Zenith to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir
through the Center, it would ſcarce be a gag long enough
for this monſtrous mouth; ſo wide as hell cannot conceiue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The depth I gather, partly from the exceſſe of Chriſts worth,
either ariſing from his perſonall vnion with the Godhead; his
ſanctitie of life and conuerſation; or from his hyperpropheticall
ſpirit and aboundant miracles. For looke how much he exceedes
any but meere man in al theſe: by ſo much doth the Pope (though
ſuppoſed as not obnoxious to any crime) make his authoritie and
fauour with God greater then Chriſts, which is the ſemidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this mouth of blaſphemies. The other part, equall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
in quantitie, but for the qualitie more tainted with the
dregges of Hell, ariſeth from that oppoſition the Popes ſpirit
hath vnto Chriſt; or from the luxury and beaſtly manners of the
Papacie, erected by Satan as it were of purpoſe to pollute the
world with monſtrous ſinnes, and to derogate as much from
mankinde, as true Chriſtianitie doth aduance it: finally to make
the Chriſtian world as much more wicked, as Chriſts Diſciples,
Apoſtles, and faithfull followers are better then the heathen.
Nor doth the Pope exact beliefe onely without miracles or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of a propheticall ſpirit:<note place="margin">The chiefe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by Romiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to proue the excellency of their church directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the principles of Senſe &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> but contrary to all notions
of good and euill, common to Chriſtians and Heathens, and as
it were in deſpite of the prophecies that haue deciphered him for
Antichriſt. What heathen Philoſopher could with patience
haue endured to heare, that a diſſolute luxurious tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t could not,
though in matters of this life, giue wrong ſentence out of the
ſeate of Iuſtice? The Ieſuites teach it as an Article of faith, that

thee, thou bondſlaue of Sathan.</hi> For if the Romiſh Hierarchy
bee or hath been in the worlds eye, the moſt potent and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
that euer was: This deſcription of the Beaſts power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
agree ſo well to any as vnto it, Nor doth the Scripture any
where intimate the true Church militant ſhould dominere ouer
all Nations, or be ſo triumphantly victorious, as they boaſt theirs
hath beene. To thinke the Antichriſt whom they expect ſhould
in three yeeres ſpace ſubdue as many Nations as haue beene tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
to the See of Rome, is a conceit that iuſtifies the Iew as
well in his credulity of things to come which are impoſſible, as in
his hypocriticall partiality towards his preſent eſtate, which hee
neuer ſuſpects of Apoſtaſie. Vnto this obſeruation the Reader
may adde other like deſcriptions of this ſcarlet Whore; all ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreeing to the Papacy, as hee that will not acknowledge it for
the Kingdome of great Antichriſt, hath great reaſon to ſuſpect
his heart, that if hee had liued with our Sauiour, he would ſcarce
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7902:128"/>
haue taken him for his Meſſias; nor can the Ieſuites bring any
better reaſons, why the Pope ſhould not be <hi>the Antichriſt;</hi> then
the Iewes did, why Chriſt ſhould not be the Great Prophet. Yet
this I ſay, not to diſcourage ſuch as doubt whether the Pope bee
that Man of ſinne; or to bring them out of loue with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
which may be ſound without expreſſe or actuall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of this truth, not as yet reuealed vnto them: as thoſe
two Diſciples, no doubt, were neither hypocrites nor infidels,
albeit they miſtruſted the report of Chriſts reſurrection; for they
were farther from approuing the practiſes of the Iewes againſt
him, then from actuall acknowledgement of it. If any man thus
doubt, whether the Pope be Antichriſt, ſo hee doe not approue
his hatred and warre againſt Gods Saints, or his other diueliſh
practiſes: Gods peace bee vpon him; and in good time I truſt
his eyes ſhall bee enlightned to ſee the truth in this particular, as
thoſe two Diſciples did in the Article of the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>6 Seeing wee haue proued the Popes authority ſo farre to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede

beſide ſhould teach the contrary, yet were euery Chriſtian bound

him. Though the Church or Pope ſhould expound them to vs,
wee could not infallibly belieue his expoſitions; but by that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by which hee is ſuppoſed to teach: ſo belieuing, wee could
not infallibly teach others the ſame; for it is the ſpirit onely that
ſo teacheth all. The inference then is as euident, as ſtrong; that
<hi>priuate</hi> in the forecited place, is oppoſed to that which wants au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
not vnto publike or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. The Kings promiſe made to
me in priuate, is no priuate promiſe: but will warrant mee, if I

perfect liberty, yea free acceſſe of pleading our cauſe, againſt

not reade the Scriptures with <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> or any of our writers
expoſitions, or in any edition ſaue ſuch as they approue, or with
the Rhemiſh animaduerſions or gloſes, or according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of that faith wherein the Ieſuites haue catechized him. So that
the reading of ſcriptures, if their opinions be erroneous (as wee
hold the Popes deciſions are) ſerues to as good purpoſe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
one of their catechizing in the right faith, as the ringing
of belles doth to bring a melancholy man out of ſome fooliſh

His meaning in plain Engliſh, is this; He and his fellowes
could wiſh reformed Churches would all come off at once, and
belieue as Romaniſts doe, without all examination, whether they
belieue as Chriſtians, or Magicians: but if we will not be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

be very wel content to admit vs into their Church again, though

               <p>4 The learned Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> of famous memory, out of

neuer ſo good or forcible to euince the contradictory to their

chance but to omit ſome petty terme or clauſe impertinent
to the maine queſtion, or make his propoſitions more improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7902:133"/>
by framing them more vniuerſall then he needs, occaſion will
quickly be taken to interrupt his progreſſe and put him off, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
(if the Anſwerer bee ſo well prouided) with ſome ſhew of
inſtance to the contrary, or abſurditie likely to follow, if all were
true his Antagoniſt would ſeeme to prooue. Nor doe I cenſure
this as fault in youth, or whileſt we are in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> forge, ſo the

For ſeeing the gift of miracles was beſtowed on hypocrites, or
ſuch as might fall from any gifts or grace of the ſpirit they had:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7902:134"/>
though the ſpectators might beleeue the particular concluſions:
to whoſe confirmation the miracles were fitted, yet was it not
ſafe, without examination, abſolutely to rely vpon him, in all
thinges that had ſpoken a diuine truth once or twice. In that he
might be an hypocrite or a diſſembler, for ought others, without

not they themſelues alwayes. And albeit a man that neuer was
in the ſtate of grace, may oft times deliuer that Doctrine which
is infallible: yet were it (to ſay no worſe) a grieuous tempting
of God to rely vpon his Doctrine as abſolutely infallible, vnleſſe
we know him (beſides his skill or learning) to be alwayes in ſuch

they therefore haue no ſaye at all in deciding controuerſies of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7902:135"/>
faith? You may not thinke a Ieſuite would take <hi>Ieſus</hi> name in
vaine: he will neuer for ſhame, exclude his Maſter for hauing at
leaſt a finger in the gouernment of the Church: Why, what is his
office? or what is the vſe of his authoritie, regiſtred by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Euangeliſts? Not ſo little as you would weene. For, his
ſpeeches, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt <hi>others that in their life time haue infallibly taught
diuine truthes by mouth or pen, may be conſulted as a witneſſe or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
law in caſes of faith, but after a certaine ſort and manner, eyther
to ſpeake the truth, or ſomewhat thereto not impertinent, as ſhalbee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in due place.</hi> The place he meanes, is, where hee diſputes
whether the Pope be bound to conſult other authoritie beſides
his owne, or vſe any meanes to ſearch the truth before hee paſſe
ſentence <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> that is, before he charge the whole Chriſtian
World to beleeue his deciſion. This he thinkes expedient, but ſo
farre forth onely, as if it pleaſe his Holineſſe to enioyne the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of ſome particular point vpon the whole World, all muſt
beleeue that he hath conſulted Scripture and antiquitie as farre as
was requiſite for that point, as you ſhall after heare.</p>
               <p>2 That in ſuch controuerſies he includes the meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scriptures to bee the word of God: is euident out of his owne
words in the forecited place. For the knowledge of Scriptures
he would haue to be an eſpeciall point of faith, yet ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proued by Scripture, but by this liuing and ſpeaking au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
as he expreſſely contends in the eleuenth paragraph of
the ſame queſtion. His concluſion is; If it bee neceſſarie, there
ſhould be ſome authoritie, though humane, yet by diuine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
infallible, to ſit as miſtreſſe and Iudge in all controuerſies
of faith, and not to be appropriated to any deceaſed, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
proued: it remaines that it be alwaies liuing in the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
preſent amongſt the faithfull by ſucceſſion, hee meanes, of
Popes. Thus you ſee the preſent Pope muſt be Iudge, and Chriſt
&amp; his Apoſtles muſt be brought in as witneſſes. And yet whether
there were ſuch a Chriſt, as Saint <hi>Mathew, Luke, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
tell vs there was; or whether the Goſpels which goe vnder their
names be Apocryphall, and that of <hi>Bartholmewes</hi> onely Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall;
we cannot know but by the Popes teſtimonie: ſo that in
the end, he is the onely Iudge, and onely witneſſe, both of Chriſt,
the Apoſtles, and their writings, yea of all diuine truthes, at leaſt

Scriptures cannot be knowne to be diuine, but by the authoritie
of the preſent viſible Church: if this Church doe not <hi>viua voce</hi>
confirme all Chriſtians in this fundamentall truth, their faith can
not be diuine, but humane. VVhat the Pope or his Cardinals

and deprecate the blame, rather then (as now I freely muſt) impute the
true cauſe to the negligence of you Romane Prieſtes, whome I perceiue to
wax cold and to thinke of nothing leſſe then of calling the Councell:
with hope whereof as heretofore I was excited, ſo now deſpaire hath made
me dull. For I ſee well that ſuch as are moſt bound to haue a vigilant care
of the Churches publique welfare, and not to foreſlow any opportunitie
of increaſing her dignitie; neuer ſo much as mention the Councell, (at
this time as neceſſarie, as alwayes vſefull) but when Chriſtians eyther
are alreadie, or are likely to be at variance. In one word, neuer but them,
when there is ſure hope it may bee hindered by their diſcord. For when
peace gets it turne, and all is quiet, not a word of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.

               <p>4 This great Learned Antiquaries Learned aduice, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Epiſtle ſent to the ſame Cardinall, then imployed by the
Pope in the Councell, was, not to ſuffer matters decreed in any
former Councell lawfully aſſembled together, to bee diſputed or
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7902:136"/>
called in queſtion. Sufferance hereof was in his iudgment no leſſe
preiudiciall to the State Eccleſiaſtique, then vnto the temporall
it would be, to permit malefactors trauerſe the equitie of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
lawes eſtabliſhed and knowne, after ſufficient proofe or
confeſſion made of Capitall offences committed againſt them.
The marginall quotations of the Trent Councell, compared
with this graue admonition, which had antiquitie-cuſtomes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall,
as the Author vrgeth, to giue it countenance, may ſerue
as a perfect index for our inſtruction, with what preiudice the
Biſhops there aſſembled came to determine, by whoſe manudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or ſet rules they drew their ſuppoſed inerrable lines of life.
Now it is impoſſible any determination, that takes it force from
multitude of voyces, ſhoud be eyther in it ſelfe more certaine, or
more forcible to perſwade others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the motiues or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that ſwayed the ſuffragants ſo to determine; and theſe in
this caſe could, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon, be but hiſtoricall perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or preſumptions. For no Ieſuite I thinke, will ſay theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
had the Popes ſentence <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> to aſſure them before
hand what Councels had beene lawfully called, and fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
or whether all the ancient Canons they afterwardes reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
were alreadie as authentique and certaine as they could
be made: For ſo it had beene a labour altogether loſt, yea a matter
no leſſe prophane then rebaptization, to haue confirmed them by
ſuffrages of Biſhops, after their Cathedrall confirmation by the
Pope. Euen of his Holineſſe himſelfe, whoſe verdict (as in this
caſe muſt finally be ſuppoſed) addes diuine credence vnto teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in their owne nature fallible and merely humane, the
queſtion propoſed in the former Section remaines ſtill inſoluble.
For without the relation of ſome Hiſtorian, or Regiſter, or eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reuelation from aboue, no Pope can diuine how many
Councels haue beene held, much leſſe what was finally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in euery ancient Canon confirmed by the Biſhops aſſembled
at Trent. Speciall reuelations, ſuch as the Prophets had, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
none. And yet diſtinctly to tell what hath been done
in times paſt, or places a farre off, without relying on others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
is an extraordinarie effect of ſpeciall reuelation, a worke
of higher nature and greater difficultie, then Propheticall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of things to come. Are then the relations of Hiſtorians, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7902:137"/>
Regiſters of Ancient Councels diuine and authentique. Not
without the Popes ratification with it they are? Yes, or elſe a
great part of Roman faith by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon can bee but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
               <p>5 Hence may we ſafely annex a corollary, as neceſſary, as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the maine concluſion propoſed, for the principal ſubiect
of this ſection. [As the Popes authority is, by Ieſuitical Doctrine
made much greater then our Sauiours, ſo may the aſſiſtance or
countenance of his omnipotent ſpirit, make the reports of any te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
Hiſtorian, or mercenary Regiſter, as diuine, authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
and certaine, as any Propheticall or Apoſtolicall teſtimonies
of the Meſſiah.] Yea, if it ſhould pleaſe him to authorize <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
Annals, or relations of former Councels, their credit ſhould
be no leſſe than the Euangeliſts. Yea hence it followes, (as the
diſcreet Reader, without further repetition of what hath here
beene ſaid, or new ſuggeſtion of the reaſons whereon the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is grounded will (I hope) of his owne accord<note n="a" place="margin">Cha: 6. parag. 5. Sect. 4.</note> hereafter
collect) That determinations proceeding vpon any knaues or looſe
companions teſtimonies; though more looſely examined, ſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
at all, or taken for examined by the Pope, ſhall, by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
be of force as all-ſufficient, eyther for producing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
beliefe of mens ſpirituall worth wee neuer heard of, or for
warranting daily performance of Religious worſhip to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
as any declaration he can make vpon our Sauiours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
vnto his Apoſtles. For we may no more doubt of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he ſhall authorize, or any mans ſaluation canonized by
him (whoſoeuer be the Relatours of their life and death,) then of
Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> though our Sauiour promiſed hee ſhould bee ſaued. The reaſon is plaine. The Pope is ſole Iudge of all diuine
Oracles: our Sauiour (as you haue heard out of

others be, whomſoeuer he
ſhall admit.</p>

not the true &amp; principal cauſe of his beleefe. The Churches
authority, by his doctrine, may in diuers reſpects be truly ſaid both
a cauſe and condition; Or, to ſpeake more diſtinctly; the Churches
propoſal is a condition without which no man can ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
propoſitions of faith: the infallibility of her propoſall is the
true and only cauſe of euery Romane Catholikes beleefe in all
points. This denial of the churches authority to be (according to
their principles) the true cauſe of beleef, <hi>Is the ſconſe that muſt firſt

               <p>2 <hi>Valentian,</hi> if we wel obſerue his proceſſe in the forecited place,
proues only that, which none in reformed churches did euer deny;
albeit hee profer more in his premiſes: which whileſt hee ſeekes

God in theſe latter dayes doth not teach men the Goſpel in ſuch

ſufficeth: As hee that ſhould ſay, <hi>Socrates</hi> by man was
taught his learning, doth not meane the ſpecificall nature, or
whole Mankind; but that <hi>Socrates,</hi> as others, had one man or
other at the firſt to inſtruct him. The ſame Dialect wee vſe,
when wee ſay, euery one that truely cals God father, receiues
inſtructions from the Church his Mother, that is, from ſome in

The difference likewiſe betweene the Romaniſts and vs, hath

this Miniſtery of the Church is a neceſſary condition, or mean

whatſoeuer inclines our minds to the embracement of any truth,
is the proper efficient cauſe of beliefe or aſſent vnto the ſame:
Yea efficiency or cauſality it ſelfe doth <hi>formally</hi> conſiſt in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

be moued by the Churches propoſall, ere it can moue them at all

whether habituall or actuall, vnleſſe diſcurſiue, cannot poſſibly
bee reſolued into any praeexiſtent Maxime or principle. From
which grant, this emolument will ariſe vnto our cauſe; that the
Churches authoritie cannot be proued by any diuine reuelation,
or portion of Scripture; ſeeing it is an Article of faith, and muſt
be beleeued <hi>eodem intuitu</hi> with that Scripture or part of Gods
word, whether written or vnwritten, that teacheth it; as light and
colours are perceiued by one and the ſame intuition in the ſame
inſtant. And by this aſſertion we could not ſo properly ſay, wee
beleeue the diuine reuelation becauſe we beleeue the church (nor
doe we ſee colours becauſe we ſee the light;) but wee may truly
ſay, that the <hi>obiects</hi> of our faith, (<hi>diuine reuelations</hi>) are therefore
actually credible, or worthy of beleefe, becauſe the infallible
Church doth illuſtrate or propoſe them; as the light doth make
colours though inviſible by night, viſible by day. This ſimilitude
of the light and colours is not mine, but <hi>Sacroboſcus;</hi> whom in the

I muſt requeſt the Reader to obſerue, that as oft as they mention

Therefore we muſt infallibly belieue they are ſuch.]</hi> So likewiſe muſt
wee beleeue, that to bee the true and proper meaning of euerie
ſentence in them contained, which the Church, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to iudge of their ſenſe, ſhall tender vnto vs.</p>
               <p>2 For better manifeſtation of the Truth,<note place="margin">Reſolution twofold: either of obiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, or of our beliefe, or perſwaſions concerning them.</note> wee now teach: the
young Reader muſt here bee aduiſed of a twofolde reſolution;
One of the things or matters beleeued, or knowne, into their
firſt parts or Elements; Another of our beliefe, or perſwaſions
concerning them, into their firſt cauſes or motiues. In the one,
the moſt generall or remoteſt cauſe; In the other, the moſt
immediate or next cauſe alwayes terminates the reſolution. The
one imitates, the other inuerts, the order of compoſition; ſo as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7902:144"/>
what is firſt in the one, is laſt in the other, becauſe that which is
firſt intended, or reſolued vpon by him, that caſteth the plotte, is
beſt effected by the executioner or manuall compoſer. In the
former ſenſe, wee ſay mixt bodies are laſtly reſolued into their
firſt Elements; houſes into ſtones, timber and other ingredients;
particular truthes into generall maximes: concluſions into their
<hi>immediate</hi> praemiſes; all abſurdities into ſome breach of the rule
of contradiction. Conſonantly to this interpretation of <hi>finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution;</hi>
the <hi>first verity, or diuine infallibility,</hi> is that into which
all faith is laſtly reſolued. For (as wee ſaide before) this is the
firſt ſteppe in the progreſſe of true beliefe, the loweſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereon any Religion, Chriſtian, Iewiſh, Mahometan, or
Ethnicke can be built. And it is an vndoubted Axiome, <hi>quod
primum est in generatione, eſt vltimum in reſolutione; when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
any thing into the parts whereof it is compounded, we end, in the
vndoing or vnfolding it, where nature begunne in the compoſition or
making of it.</hi> But he that would attempt to compoſe it againe, or
frame the like aright, wold terminate all his thoghts or purpoſes
by the end or vſe, which is fartheſt from actuall accompliſhment.
Thus the Architect frames ſtones and timber, and layes the firſt
foundation according to the platforme he carries in his head; &amp;
that hee caſts proportionably to the moſt commodious or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
habitation: which, though laſt effected, determines all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
or reſolutions precedent. Hence, if wee take this <hi>vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima
reſolutio,</hi> as we alwayes take theſe termes, when we reſolue
our owne perſwaſions, that is, [for a reſolution of all doubts or
demands, concerning the ſubiect whereof wee treat] A Roman
Catholiques faith muſt, according to his Principles, finally bee
reſolued into the Churches infallibility. For this is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ground, or firſt cauſe of any particular or determinate point
of Chriſtian faith; and the immediate cauſe is alwayes that, into
which our perſwaſions concerning the effect is finally reſolued,
ſeeing it onely can fully ſatisfie all demandes, doubts or queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning it. As for example, if you aske why men, or
other terreſtriall Creatures, breath, when fiſhes doe not: to ſay
they haue lungs, and fiſhes none, doth not fully ſatisfie all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
or doubts concerning this Subiect. For it may iuſtly
further be demanded, what neceſſity there was the one ſhould
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7902:144"/>
haue lungs rather then the other. If here it bee anſwered, that
men and other perfect terreſtiall creatures, are ſo full of feruent
bloud, that without a cooler their owne heare would quickly
choake them, and in this regard, the God of nature who did not
make them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or giue them life in vaine to bee preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
did with it giue them lungs, by whoſe reſpiration their
naturall temper ſhould be continued: This anſwere doth fully
ſatisfie all demands concerning the former effect. For no man
of ſenſe would further queſtion, why life ſhould be preſerued,
whoſe preſeruation immediately depends vpon reſpiration, or
exerciſe of the lungs, &amp; is therfore the immediate cauſe of both,
and that whereunto all our perſwaſions, concerning the former
ſubiect, are laſtly reſolued. Or, if it ſhould bee demanded, why
onely man of all other creatures hath power to laugh; to ſay, he
were indued with reaſon, doth not reſolue vs; for a Philoſophical
wit would further queſtion, <hi>[Why ſhould reaſonable ſubstances haue
this fooliſh faculty rather then others?]</hi> A good<note n="*" place="margin">Laurentin. de Riſu.</note> Philoſopher would
perſwade vs the ſpirites which ſerue for inſtruments to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
part, are more nimble &amp; ſubtle, and ſo more apt to produce
this motion, then the ſpirites of any other creatures are. But this
I muſt profeſſe reſolues not me: for how nimble or ſubtle ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they be, vnleſſe man had other corporeall Organes for this
motion, the ſpirits alone could not produce it: and all organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
parts are framed for the operation or exerciſe of the faculty,
as their proper end. Whence, hee that would finally reſolue the
former probleme, muſt aſſigne the true finall cauſe why reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſubſtances, more then others, ſhould ſtand in need of this
motion. Now ſeeing vnto reaſon onely it is proper to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
danger, and procure ſorrow and contriſtation of heart by
preconceit of what yet is not, but perhaps may bee: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
that our mortality through <hi>reaſon</hi> obnoxious to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,
ſhould bee able to correct this contriſtant motion
by the contrary, and haue a faculty to conceiue ſuch pleaſant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
as might dilatate the heart and ſpirites; that as man hurts
his body by conceited ſorrow, whereto no other Creature is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
ſo he might heale it againe by a kind of pleaſance, whereof
hee alone is capable.</p>

ſeeing the Church defines nothing but by Gods word eyther

beleeues it can know, nor hath hee any other motiue to belieue

The Reader, I hope, will remember what was ſaid before; that
thoſe flowting hypocrites would faine beleeue the Pope ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>5 It may be ſome Nouice in Artes that hath late read ſome
vulgar Logicians vpon the demonſtrations, might here frame
this doubt in fauour of the Romiſh Churches Doctrine. As the
finall cauſe may be demonſtrated by the efficient, and the efficient
by the final: ſo may the Church be infallibly proued by Scriptures,
and the Scriptures againe by the Churches authority, both infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
beleeved each for others ſake, as both the former demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are true and certaine, and yet mutually depending one vpon
the other.</p>
               <p>6 This obiection, had ſome late Logicians vnderſtood what
they ſaid, would carry ſome ſhew of truth to countenance <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
former circular reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but they lace their M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> rule, vttered
by him <hi>Pingui Minerua,</hi> too too ſtraightly. For taking it as they do,
we ſhold admit<note n="*" place="margin">A rule in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick by ſome much miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued. Whoſe miſconſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not impeched might in ſome ſort ſhroud the Romaniſts ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes in this Argument.</note> of circular demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrations, the conceit wherof can
haue no place but in a giddy braine. To demonſtrate the finall
cauſe in any worke of Nature, were to aſsigne a Counſailor to the
infinite wiſdome of the God of Nature; in whoſe intention the
end is firſt, and is the cauſe of all operation or efficiency. Who
could giue, or who would demaund a naturall cauſe why life
ſhould be preſcribed? for this is the will of him that gaue it. If
queſtion were made of the manner how the life of man and other
creatures is preſerued, when as their heat might ſeeme to choake
them? A man might truly anſwere, by reſpiration: and reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7902:146"/>
is from the lungs. But it is one thing to aske how or by what
meanes, another, for what end any effect is produced. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is an inquiry of the efficient, within theſe precincts of meanes
or motions alwayes prime and independent; The later of the final
cauſe abſolutely, indemonſtrable, becauſes it implies a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to giue a reaſon why that ſhould be, for whoſe ſake all other
things of that ranke haue being. Nor is the end it ſelfe (to ſpeake
properly) euer produced, though oftimes in common ſpeech, we
take the effect immediately thereto deſtinated (becauſe moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
for the end it ſelfe, as we doe the ſtarre next to the pole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
viſible, for the pole or point immoueable. Thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
reſpirations or actuall preſeruation of life with the finall
cauſe why men haue lungs; when as both are effects of the lungs,
both meanes of accompliſhing Natures or rather the God of
Naturs purpoſe, in whoſe will or pleaſure the finall cauſe of any
naturall effect alwayes conſiſts. And ſeeing nothing in Nature
can preoccupate his will, no cauſe can be precedent to the finall.
This conſideration of natural effects tending as certainly to their
propoſed end, as the arrowe flyes to the marke, cauſed the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<note n="*" place="margin">Aueroes.</note> Philoſopher to acknowledge the direction of an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſupernaturall agent in their working, the accompliſhment
of whoſe will and pleaſure (as I ſaid) muſt bee the finall cauſe of
their motions; as his will or pleaſure which beſtowes the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
not the Architect (vnleſſe he be the owner alſo) is the finall
cauſe why the houſe is built. Finally, euery end ſuppoſeth the
laſt intention of an intelligent agent, whereof to giue a reaſon
by the efficient which onely produceth works or meanes thereto
proportioned, would be as impertinent, as if to one demaunding
why the bell rings out, it ſhould bee anſwered, becauſe a ſtrong
fellow puls the rope.</p>
               <p>7 Now that which in our aduerſaries Doctrine anſweres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the cauſe indemonſtrable whereinto finall reſolution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
workes or intentions of intelligent agents muſt be reſolued,<note place="margin">Faith cannot be reſolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any definite branch of the <hi>Firſt Truth.</hi>
                  </note>
is the churches authoritie. Nor can that, if wee ſpeake properly,
be reſolued into any branch of the firſt truth; for this reaſon (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids
others alleadged before) that all reſolutions, whether of our
perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or intentions, or of their obiects (works of Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſuppoſe a ſtability or certainty in the firſt links of the chaine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7902:147"/>
which wee vnfolde; the latter alwayes depending on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
not the former on the latter. As in reſolutions of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kinde lately mentioned (imitating the order of compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
actuall continuation of life depends on breathing, not brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on it: breathing on the lunges, not the lunges mutually
on breathing: ſo in reſolutions of the other kind (which invertes
the order of compoſition) the vſe or neceſſitie of lunges
dependes vpon the vſe or neceſſitie of breathing; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
or vſe of breathing vpon the neceſſity or vſe of life, or
vpon his will or pleaſure that created one of theſe for another.
Thus againe, the ſenſitiue facultie depends vpon the vital, that
vpon mixtion, mixtion vpon the Elements, not any of theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
vpon the ſenſitiue faculty; if wee reſpect the order of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
or Natures progreſſe in their production. Whence hee
that queſtions whether ſome kinds of plants haue ſenſe, or ſome
ſtones or mettals life, ſuppoſeth as vnqueſtionable, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
haue life, that the ſecond are mixt bodies. But if we reſpect
the intent or purpoſe of him that ſets nature a working; all the
former faculties dpend on the ſenſitiue, the ſenſitiue not on any
of them. For God would not haue his creatures indued with
ſenſe, that they might liue; or liue, that they might haue mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but rather to haue ſuch bodies that they might liue, to liue
that they might enioy the benefit of ſenſe, or the more noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>8 Can the Ieſuite thus aſſigne any determinate branch of the
firſt truth, as ſtable and vnqueſtionable, before it be ratified by the
Churches authoritie? Euident it is, by his poſitions, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
and as euident, that beliefe of the churches authority cannot
depend vpon any determinate branch of the firſt truth, much leſſe
can it diſtinctly be thereinto reſolued. But contrariwiſe, preſſe
him with what Diuine precept ſoeuer, written or vnwritten,
though in all mens iudgements (the churches authoritie ſet aſide)
moſt contradictory to their approoued practiſes: for example,
[That the ſecond Commaundement forbids worſhipping I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
or adoration of the conſecrate hoſt;] he ſtraight inuerts
your reaſon thus, Rather the ſecond commandement forbids ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe the holy Church, which I beleeue to bee infallible,
approueth both. Laſtly hee is fully reſolued to beleeue nothing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7902:147"/>
for true, which the Church diſproues, nothing for falſe or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
which it allowes Or, if he would anſwere directly to this
demaund, [To what end did God cauſe the Scriptures to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?]
He could not (<hi>conſonant to his tenents</hi>) ſay [That wee might
infallibly rely vpon them,] but rather [vpon the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
which it eſtabliſheth.] For Gods word whether written or
vnwritten,<note n="*" place="margin">Vide annor. cap. 15. Sect 3. paragr. 2.</note> is by their Doctrine, but as the teſtimonie of
ſome men deceaſed, indefinitely preſumed for infallible, but whoſe
materiall extent the Church muſt firſt determine, and after wards
iudge, without all appeale, of their true meaning. Thus are all
parts of Diuine truthes, ſuppoſed to be reuealed, more eſſentially
ſubordinate to the Churches authoritie, then ordinary witneſſes
are to royall or ſupreme iudgment. For they are ſuppoſed able to
deliuer what they know, <hi>in termes intelligible</hi> to other mens capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
without the Prince or Iudges ratification of their ſayings,
or expoſitions of their meanings; and iudgment is not ordained
for producing witneſſes; but production of witneſſes, for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
iudgement. Thus by our aduerſaries Doctrine, Gods
word muſt ſerue to eſtabliſh the Churches authority: not the
Churches authority, to confirme the immediate ſoueraigntie of
it ouer our ſoules.</p>
               <p>9 Much more probably might the Iew or Turke reſolue his
faith vnto the firſt truth, then the moderne Ieſuited Papiſt can.
For though their deductions from it be much what alike, all ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſottiſh: yet theſe admit a ſtabilitie or certainty of what the
firſt Truth hath ſaid, no way dependant vpon their authority that
firſt propoſed or commended it vnto them. The Turkes would
ſtorme to heare any Mufti profeſſe he were as well to be beleeued
as was Mahomet in his life time; that without his propoſall they
could not know eyther the olde teſtament or the Alcoran to bee
from God. So would the Iewes if one of their Rabbines ſhould
make the like compariſon betwxit himſelfe and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
doth betwixt Chriſt and the Pope: who, beſides that hee
muſt bee as well beleeued as his Maſter, leaues the authority of
both teſtaments vncertaine to vs, vnleſſe confirmed by his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
But to ſpeake properly, the pretended deriuation of all
three hereſies from the firſt truth, hath a liuely reſemblance of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7902:148"/>
falſe petigrees, none at all of true doctrine and reſolutions. Of
all the three the Romiſh is moſt ridiculous, as may appeare by
their ſeuerall repreſentations. As, imagine there ſhould be three
Competitors for the Romane Empire; all pleading it were to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
by inheritance, not by election; all pretending lineall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. The firſt, like to the Iew, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
an authentique petigree, making him the eldeſt. The
ſecond, reſembling the Turke, replyes, that the other indeede
was of the eldeſt line, but long ſince diſinherited, often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and enforced to reſigne; whence the inheritance deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him as the next in ſucceſſion. The third, like the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,
pleades it was bequeathed him by the Emperours laſt wil and
teſtament, from whoſe death his Anceſtors haue beene intitled to
it, and produceth a petigree to this purpoſe, without any other
confirmation then his owne authority; adding withal, that vnleſſe
his competitors and others will beleeue his recordes and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(written or vnwritten) to be moſt authentique, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be certaine whether euer there had beene ſuch an Emperour
as they plead ſucceſſion from, or at leaſt how farre his Dominions
extended, or where they lay. This manner of plea in ſecular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies,
would be a meane to defeate him that made it. For
albeit the Chriſtian World did acknowledge there had beene
ſuch an Emperour, and that many parts of Europe of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
vnto his lawfull heire: Yet if it were otherwiſe vnknowne
what parts theſe were, or who this heire ſhould bee; no Iudge
would be ſo mad as finally to determine of eyther vpon ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.
Or if the Plaintiffe could by ſuch courſes as the World
knowes oft preuaile in iudgement, or other gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
effect his purpoſe: hee were worſe then madde
that could thinke the finall reſolution of his right were into
the Emperours laſt will and teſtament, which by his owne
confeſſion, no man knowes beſides himſelfe; and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into his owne preſumed fidelitie, or the Iudges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
partialitie. So in this controuerſie whatſoeuer the
Pope may pretend from Chriſt, all in the end comes to
his owne authority; which wee may ſafely beleeue, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to bee moſt infallible, that it will neuer prooue partiall

there bee ſome bookes diuine, which queſtionleſſe cannot by any meanes

the Prophets or Apoſtles are diuine: yet this I ſhall not certainely
belieue, vnleſse I firſt belieue that Scripture, which ſaith thus, is diuine.
For ſo wee may read euery where in Mahomets Alcoran, that the
Alcoran it ſelfe was ſent from heauen; but wee belieue it not. Therefore
this neceſſary point [that ſome Scripture is diuine,] cannot ſufficiently

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus collects: <hi>It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

the Scripture is often ſo ambiguous and intricate, that it cannot bee
vnderſtood, without the expoſition of ſome that cannot erre: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it alone is not ſufficient. Examples there be many. For the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the diuine perſons, the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father
and the Sonne, as from one ioint originall Originall ſinne, Chriſtes
deſcenſion into Hell, nd many like, may indeed be deduced out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but not ſo plainely as to end controuerſies with contentious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
if we ſhould produce onely teſtimonies of Scriptures. And wee
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7902:150"/>
are to note there bee two things in Scripture, the Characters or the
written words, and the ſenſe included in them. The Character is as the
ſheath, but the ſenſe is the very ſword of the ſpirite. Of the first
of theſe two all are partakers; for whoſoeuer knowes the Character,
may reade the Scripture: but of the ſenſe all men are not capable, nor can
wee in many places bee certaine of it, vnleſſe Tradition be aſſiſtant.</hi> It
is an offer worth the taking that here he makes, <hi>That the ſenſe of
Scriptures is the ſword of the ſpirit.</hi> This is as much as wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that the ſenſe of the Scripture is the Scripture. Whence the
inference is immediately neceſſary, That if the Romiſh Church
binde vs to belieue, or abſolutely practiſe, ought contrary to the
true ſenſe and meaning of Scriptures, with the like deuotion we
doe Gods expreſſe, vndoubted commandements: ſhe preferres
her owne authority aboue Gods word, and makes vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

it is planted: or from the firſt beginning of it to it full growth;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7902:150"/>
or from it firſt entrance into our hearts, vntill our departure out
of this world. How farre, and in what ſort the Miniſtery of men
in the Church is auaileable, for planting faith; hath been declared
heretofore. Eyther for the planting or ſupporting it, the skill or
authority of the teachers reaches no further, then to quicken or
ſtrengthen our internal taſte or apprehenſion of the diuine truth
reuealed in Scriptures; or to raiſe or tune our ſpirites, as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
did <hi>Eliſhahs,</hi> the better to perceiue the efficacy of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
imprinting the ſtampe of thoſe diuine Reuelations in our

                  <hi>The eare</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Iob) tryeth

can in eyther caſe haue any vſe: but onely eyther for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a right diſpoſition in the Organ, whereby triall is made; or
by occaſioning the exerciſe of the faculty rightly diſpoſed. How
eſſentially faith by our aduerſaries doctrine dependes vpon the
churches authority, is euident out of the former diſcourſes: that
this dependance is perpetuall, is as manifeſt, in that they make
it the iudge and rule of faith, ſuch an indefectible rule, and ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique

ſhallow braines haue hitherto hoped to couer. Wee haue the
ſame Scriptures they haue; and peruſe them in all the languages
they doe. What is it then can hinder, eyther them, from mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting;
or vs, from diſcerning, their Truth or true meaning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted?
Doe we want the Churches propoſall? we demand how
their preſent Church it ſelfe can better diſcerne them then ours
may? what teſtimonie of antiquity haue they, which we haue not?
But it may be, we want ſpectacles to read them, our Church hath
but the eyes of priuate men, which cannot ſee without a publike
light: Their Churches eyes are Cat-like, able ſo to illuſtrate the
obiects of Chriſtian faith, as to make them cleare and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to it ſelfe, though darke and inuiſible vnto vs. Suppoſe they
could: Yet Cats-eyes benefit not by-ſtanders a whit for ſeeing
colours in darknes, albeit able themſelues to ſee them without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other light then their owne. The viſible Church (ſaith the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite)
is able to diſcerne all diuine truth by her infallible publique
ſpirit. How knowes he this certainly, without an infallible pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſpirit? perhaps as men ſee Cats-eyes ſhine in the darke, when
their owne doe not. Let him beleeue ſo. But what doth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
aduantage him, or other priuate ſpirits, for the cleare, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
or perfect ſight of what the Church propoſeth? Doth the
propoſall make diuine Truthes more perſpicuous in themſelues?
Why then are they not alike perſpicuous to all, that heare, reade,
or know the Churches teſtimonie of them? <hi>Sacroboſcus</hi> hath ſaid

beleeue all other points, as he that can perfectly ſee the light, may
ſee Colours by it. Want of this radicall beleefe in vs, makes our
faith in their opinion, ſo vnſtable, or rather blinde and dead. Yet
can I hardly perſwade my ſelfe, all of them will grant the Church

ſhould you thinke they may not erre as well as others? Did they
ſhew you any euidence out of ſcriptures, or did they bring you to

                  <p>3 But the Reader perhaps expects what inconuenience wil hence
follow. Firſt, hereby it is apparant, that beliefe of Scriptures, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Truth, and their true ſenſe, abſolutely and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
vpon the churches propoſall, or rather vpon their beliefe
of what it propoſeth, as well after they are confirmed in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
point <hi>[That they are Gods word,]</hi> as in the inſtant of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
in it. The firſt neceſſary conſequence of which
opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is; That the church muſt bee more truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
beleeued, then any part of Scripture or matter contained
in it. For in this manner of dependance, that tranſcendent rule
of nature,<note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtot. l. 1. poſt. cap. 2.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hath it proper
force: Whether wee ſpeake of the <hi>Eſſence, Exiſtence,</hi> or <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of things being, or exiſting: that vpon which any other thing
thus abſolutely and continually depends, doth more properly &amp;
really exiſt, and hath much firmer intereſt in it eſſence and
exiſtence, then ought can haue which depends vpon it. One
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7902:155"/>
there is, and no more, that can truely ſay, my Eſſence is mine
owne, and my exiſtence neceſſary. Whatſoeuer is beſides, is but
a ſhadow or picture borrowed from his infinite being. Amongſt
created entities, all eſſentially depending on <hi>Him, Accidents</hi> haue
a kind of exiſtence peculiar to themſelues; yet cannot ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee ſaide to exiſt, as their ſubiects, on whom they haue ſuch
double dependance. Nor can the Moone ſo truely ſay, my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is mine owne, as may the Sunne, which lends light and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to this his ſiſter, as it were vpon condtion ſhee neuer vſe it
but in his ſight. For the ſame reaſon, that for which wee belieue
another thing, is alwayes more truely, more really, and more
properly belieued, then that which is belieued for it, if the one
beliefe neceſſarily depend vpon the other, <hi>tam in facto eſſe quam
in fieri, from the first beginning to the latter end.</hi> For of beliefes
thus mutually affected, the one is reall and radicall, the other, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall,
or at the moſt by participation onely reall. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is vnſound. [Intellectiue knowledge depends on ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue:
therefore ſenſitiue, is of theſe two the ſurer.] The reaſon
is, becauſe intellectiue knowledge depends on ſenſitiue, onely in
the acquiſition: not after it is acquired. But this inference is moſt
vndoubted; [Wee belieue the concluſion for the premiſſes:
therefore we belieue the premiſſes the better,] becauſe beliefe of
the Concluſion abſolutely depends vpon the premiſſes, during
the whole continuance of it. This is the great Philoſophers
rule, and a branch of the former Axiome. And ſome iuſtly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether in Scholaſtique propriety of ſpeech, wee can
truely ſay there is a beliefe of the concluſion, diſtinct from the
beleefe of the premiſſes; or rather, the beliefe of the premiſſes, is
by extrinſical denomination attributed vnto the concluſion. This
latter opinion, at leaſt in many Syllogiſmes, is the truer: moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
true in all, wherein the concluſion is a particulall, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y
ſubordinate to an vniuerſall of truth vnqueſtionable. As hee
that infallibly belieues euery man is a reaſonable creature, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
belieues <hi>Socrates</hi> is ſuch. Nor can wee ſay, there be two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctint
beliefes: one of the vniverſall; another of this particular: for
<hi>he that ſayeth, All, excepteth none.</hi> If <hi>Socrates</hi> then make one in the
Catalogue of men, hee that formerly knew all, knew him to bee
a reaſonable Creature: all he had to learne, was what was meant
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7902:155"/>
by this name <hi>Socrates,</hi> a man or a beaſt; After he knowes him to be
a man, in knowing him to bee a reaſonable creature, hee knowes
no more then he did before, in that vniuerſall, <hi>Euery man is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Creature.</hi> The like conſequence holdes as firme in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
argument; He that beleeues this vniuerſall, <hi>[Whatſoeuer the
Church propoſeth concerning Scriptures, is most true,]</hi> hath no more
to learne but onely what particulars the church propoſeth. Theſe
being knowne, we cannot imagine there ſhould bee two diſtinct
beleefes: one of the churches generall infallibility; another, of the
particular Truthes or points of faith (contained in the Scripture)
propoſed by it. For as in the former caſe, ſo in this, He that from
the churches propoſall beleeues or knowes this particular, <hi>The
Booke of Reuelations was from God,</hi> receiues no increaſe of former
beleefe: for before, hee beleeued all the church did propoſe; and
therefore this particular, <hi>becauſe one of all.</hi>

ariſing from theſe grounds peculiar to them, muſt needs be more

are in themſelues ſuſpitious, vncapable of other credit then what
they borrow from the Church. For in reſpect of the Churches

Scriptures, and traditions (of what kinde ſoeuer) muſt be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeued. And if ſuch traditions as can haue no aſſurance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

of the Churches authoritie depriues vs of all true and ſtedfaſt
beleefe concerning Gods Word or any matter contained in it,
God (as they plead) hath reuealed his will obſcurely: and vnto a
diſtinct or cleare apprehenſion of what is obſcurely reuealed, the
viſible churches declaration is no leſſe neceſſary, then light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of colours. The reaſon is one in both, and is this. As
the actuall viſibilitie of colours wholly depends vpon the light, as
well for exiſtence, as duration: ſo, by Ieſuiticall Doctrine, <hi>true
beleefe</hi> of Scriptures wholly depends on the viſible Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
as well during the whole continuance, as the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

is more viſible then colours, ſeeing by it alone colours become
actually viſible: ſo will it neceſſarily follow, that the churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration

                  <p>6 Perhaps the Reader will here challenge mee, that this laſt
inſtance proues not al that I propoſed in the title of this chapter.
For it onely proues the Popes ſupremacie is better to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
then that Chriſt is come in the fleſh; that God did euer ſpeake
to men in former ages by his Prophets, and in later by his ſonne.
But this inferres no abſolute alienation of our beleefe from
Chriſt, ſeeing euen in this reſpect that wee beleeue the Church or
Pope ſo wel, we muſt needs beleeue that Chriſt is come in the fleſh
and that God hath ſpoken to vs ſundrie wayes: for thus much
the Pope auoucheth. Yea, but what if the church teach vs that
Chriſt is our Lord and Redeemer, and yet vrge vs to doe that
which is contumelious to his Maieſtie? What if it teach vs that
theſe Scriptures are Gods Word: and yet binde vs by her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
decrees to breake his Lawes, and giue his ſpirit the lie?
Should we make profeſſion of beleeuing as the Pope teacheth,
and yet take his meaning to be onely ſuch as <hi>Marnixius,</hi> whom
we better beleeue, would make it: His Holineſſe would quickly
pronounces vs Apoſtataes from the Catholike faith. Or if this

               <p>8 Would theſe or like ſupplications, though conceiued in
Chriſtian modeſty, though propoſed with religious feare, and
awfull regard of their perſons, though preſented with teares and
ſighes, or other more euident ſignes of inward ſorrow, finde any
entrance into Romiſh Prelates eares, or moue the Maſters of the
Inquiſition houſe to forbeare exaction of obedience to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or other decree of the Trent Councel: Were the forme
of the decree it ſelfe, vnto priuate iudgements, neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to Gods expreſſe written lawes; or the conſequence
of practizing as it preſcribes, neuer ſo dreadfull to the doubtfull
conſcience? How much better then were it for ſuch ſilly ſoules,
had they neuer knowne the Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> to haue been from
God? for ſo committing idolatry with ſtocks and ſtones, or other
creatures, they had done what was diſpleaſing to their Maſter, &amp;
iuſtly puniſhable:<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> yet <hi>with fewer ſtripes,</hi> becauſe his will was
not made known vnto them. But now they know it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the truth of this commandement. To what end? That
they may bee left without all excuſe for not doing it. They ſee
the generall truth of Gods Oracles, that they may bee more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
blinded in wilfull peruerting the particulars. For what
glory could the allurement of ſilly ignorant men to ſimple ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
be vnto great Antichriſt? Let them firſt ſubſcribe to the
written Lawes of the euerliuing God, and afterwardes wholly
ſubmit themſelues to his determinations for their practiſe, and
ſo the oppoſition betwixt him and the Deity, betwixt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions
and the decrees of the Almighty, may bee more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
more directly contrary. The Heathen or others not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
Gods word at all, are rightly tearmed vnbeleeuers:
men thus beleeuing the Scriptures in generall to be Gods word,
from the teſtimony of the Church, and yet abſolutely relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her iudgement for the meaning of particular places, are
tranſported from vnbeliefe to miſbeliefe, from groſſe ignorance
to wilfull defiance of God &amp; his lawes. Finally, they are brought
to know Gods word, that they may doubt in this and like feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7902:158"/>
practiſes enioyned: that ſo firſt doubting, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
reſoluing abſolutely to follow the Churches iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
againſt that ſenſe and meaning of the diuine decrees which
the holy ſpirit doth dictate to their priuate conſciences, they
may without doubt be damned, for not abiding in the truth. Like
their firſt parents they heare Gods ſentence, but preferre the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of Sathans firſt borne before their owne, becauſe
it muſt bee preſumed hee is more ſubtle then they. Or to referre
the two maine ſtreames of this iniquity to their proper heads:
The firſt, [That we cannot know the olde or new Teſtament to
be Gods word, but by relying vpon the Church] makes all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers
to it, reall Atheiſts or Infidels, and Chriſtians onely in
conceit or vpon condition, [If the Church, whoſe authority they
ſo highly eſteeme, be as infallible as is pretended.] Heretofore I
haue much grieued at the Trent Councels impiety: but now I
wonder at theſe graue Fathers folly, that would trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with preſcribing ſo many Canons, or ouerſeeing ſo large
a Catechiſme, when as the beginning of <hi>Protogoras</hi> booke, one
or two words altered, might haue comprehended the entire
confeſſion of ſuch mens faith, as rely vpon their fatherhoods, The
Atheiſt thus beganne his booke; <hi>De dijs non habeo quod dicam, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum
ſint necne: Concerning the Gods or their being, I can ſay nothing.</hi>
A priuate Romane Catholike might render an entire account of
his faith in termes as briefe: <hi>De Chriſto &amp; Chriſtiana fide non hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo
quod dicam, vtrum ſint necne: Whether there bee a Chriſt, or
Chriſtian Religion bee but a politike fable, I haue nothing to ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,
yea, or no, the Church or Councell can determine:</hi> whom
in this, and all other points wherein God is a party, I will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
belieue, whileſt I liue: if at my death I finde they teach
amiſſe, let the diuell and they (if there be a diuell) decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie.
Yet this conceit or conditionall beliefe of Chriſt and
chriſtianity conceiued from the <hi>former,</hi> ſerues as a ground colour
for diſpoſing mens ſoules, to take the ſable dye of Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the <hi>ſecond</hi> maine <hi>ſtreame</hi> of Romiſh impiety will deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
all ſuch as drinke of it. For once belieuing Gods word from
the Churches teſtimony, this abſolute ſubmiſſion of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to embrace that ſenſe it ſhall ſuggeſt, ſublimates them
from refined Heatheniſme of Gentiliſme to diaboliſme or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7902:158"/>
with infernall ſpirits, whoſe chiefeſt ſolace conſiſts in
acting greateſt villanies, or wreſting the meaning of Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
lawes to his diſhonour. For iuſt proofe of which imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wee are to preuent what (as wee late intimated) might in
fauour of their opinion bee replyed to our former inſtance of
light and colours.<note place="margin">An obiection which might bee made in fauour of the Romaniſts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</note>
               </p>
               <p>9 Some perhaps, well affected, would be reſolued, why, as hee
that ſees colours by the ſunne, ſees not onely the ſunne but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
with it, ſo hee that belieues the Scriptures by relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church, ſhould not belieue the Church onely, but the
Scriptures too, commended by it. The doubt could hardly bee
reſolued, if according to our aduerſaries tenent, the Churches
declarations did confirme our faith by illuſtrating the Canon of
Scriptures, or making particular truthes contained in it, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
more perſpicuous: as if they were in themſelues but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially
credible, and made actually ſuch by the Churches te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
which is the firſt and <hi>principall credible;</hi> in ſuch ſort as
colours become actually viſible, by illumination of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and prime viſible. But herein the grounds of Romiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the inſtance brought by <hi>Sacroboſcus,</hi> to illuſtrate
it, are quite contrary. For the light of the Sunne, though moſt
neceſſary vnto ſight, is yet neceſſary onely in reſpect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
or for making colours actually viſible; which, made ſuch, or
ſufficiently illuminated, are inſtantly perceiued without further
intermediation of any other light then the internall light of the
Organe, in diſcerning colours alwaies rather hindred then hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by circumfuſion of light externall. For this reaſon it is, that
men in a pitte or caue may at noone day ſee the ſtarres, which
are inuiſible to ſuch as are in the open aire: not, that they are
more illuminated to the one, then the other; but becauſe plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of light doth hinder the organ or eye-ſight of the one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all obiects, eyther actually viſible in themſelues, or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
illuminated, are better perceiued in darkeneſſe then in the
light. But ſo our aduerſaries will not grant, that after the church
hath ſufficiently propoſed the whole Canon to be Gods word,
the diſtinct meaning of euery part is more cleare and facile to
all priuate ſpirits, by how much they leſſe participate of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Churches further illuſtration. For (quite contrary to the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7902:159"/>
former inſtance) the Churches teſtimony or declaration is onely
neceſſary, or auaileable to right beliefe, in reſpect not of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to be beleeued <hi>[Scriptures;]</hi> but of the party beleeuing. For
(as hath beene obſerued) no man in their iudgement can belieue
Gods word, or the right meaning of it, but by beleeuing the
Church:<note place="margin">Vide Sect. 2. cap. 1. &amp; Sect. 4. c. 4.</note> and all beliefe is inherent in the belieuer. Yea this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
beliefe of the Churches authority, is that, which in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
and <hi>Sacroboſcus</hi> iudgement, makes a Roman Catholicks
beleefe of Scriptures, or diuine truthes taught by them, much
better then a Proteſtants. If otherwiſe the churches declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or teſtimony, could without the beliefe of it infallibility,
which is inherent in the ſubiect belieuing, make Scriptures cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
as the light doth colours viſible in themſelues: a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
that knew their churches meaning, might as truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
them as a Romane Catholike, albeit hee did not abſolutely
belieue the church, but onely vſe her helpe, for their Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall
interpretation, as hee doth ordinary expoſitors, or as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doe the benefite of the Sunne for ſeeing colours, which
neuer thinke whether colours may bee ſeene without it or no.
For though it bee certaine that they cannot, yet this opinion
is meerely accidentall to their ſight: and if a man ſhould be ſo
wilfull as to maintaine the contrary, it would argue onely blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of mind, none of his bodily ſight. Nor ſhould diſtruſt of
the Romiſh churches authority, ought diminiſh our beliefe of
any diuine truth, were her declarations requiſite in reſpect of
the obiect to bee beleeued, not in reſpect of the ſubiect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing.</p>
               <p>10 Hence ariſeth that difference which plainely reſolues
the former doubt. For ſeeing the Sunne makes colours actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſible, by adding vertue or luſtre to them: wee may rightly
ſay, wee ſee colours, as truely as the light, by which wee ſee
them. For though without the benefite of it, they cannot be
ſeene: yet are they not ſeene by ſeeing it, or by relying vpon
it teſtimony of them. Againe, becauſe the vſe of light is onelie
neceſſary in reſpect of the obiect, or for preſenting colours to
the eye; after once they bee ſufficiently illuminated or preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
euery creature endued with ſight, can immediately diſcern
each from other, without any further helpe or benefite of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7902:159"/>
light, than the generall, whereby they become all alike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
viſible at the fame inſtant. The Sunnes light then is the
true cauſe, why colours are ſeene: out no cauſe of our diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
one from another beeing ſeene, or made actually viſible
by it. For of all ſenſible obiects ſufficiently propoſed, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue
faculty, though ſeated in a priuate perſon, is the ſole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ſupreme Iudge, and relies not vpon any others more
publike verdite of them. On the contrary, becauſe the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
ſuppoſed firme beliefe of Scriptures, or their true meaning
ariſeth onely from his vndoubted beliefe of the churches veracity
which is in the belieuer as in it ſubiect, not from any increaſe
of inherent credibility, or perſpicuity thence propagated to the
Scriptures: Hence it is that conſequently to his poſitions, moſt
repugnant to all truth, hee thinkes, after the church hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
auouched the Scriptures diuine truth in generall, wee
cannot infallibly diſtinguiſh the true ſenſe and meaning of one

teſtimony; and onely belieue that ſenſe to bee repugnant,
that conſonant to the analogie of faith, which ſhee ſhall tender,
albeit our priuate conſciences bee neuer ſo well informed by
other Scriptures to the contrary. The truth then of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
concluſion is hence eaſily manifeſted. For ſeeing they hold
both the Scriptures and their diſtinct ſenſe to bee obſcure and
vnable to aſcertaine themſelues, vnleſſe the Church adde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity
or facility of communicating their meaning to priuate
ſpirits: ſuch, after the Churches propoſall, cannot poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them any better, or more directly in themſelues, then they
did before, but muſt wholy rely vpon their Prelates, as if theſe
were the onely watchmen in the Tower of Gods church, that
could by vertue of their place diſcerne all diuine truth. Others
muſt belieue there is an omnipotent God, which hath giuen
his law; a Mediator of the new Teſtament: but what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
either of Law or Goſpell is, they may not preſume other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to determine, then weake ſights do of things they ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
a farre off, whoſe particular diſtance or difference they
muſt take onely vpon other mens report, that haue ſeene them
diſtinctly, and at hand.</p>
               <p>11 To illuſtrate theſe deductions with the former ſimilitude
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7902:160"/>
of the <hi>prime</hi> and ſecondary <hi>viſibles.</hi> Let vs ſuppoſe for diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſake, that the Sunne which illuminates colours by its
light, were further indued (as wee are) with ſenſe and reaſon,
able to iudge of all the differences betweene them, which it can
manifeſt to vs, and hence challenge to bee a Pope or infallible
propoſer of colours. This ſuppoſition the Canoniſt hath made
leſſe improbable. For <hi>Deus fecit duo luminaria, God made two
lights,</hi> that is, by his interpretation, the Pope and the Emperour.
Or, if you pleaſe to mitigate the harſhneſſe of it, let the Man in
the Moone, whom we may not imagine ſpeechleſſe, bee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſunne or Pope of colours, <hi>Mercurie</hi> or <hi>Nuncio.</hi> As the
Papiſts ſay, wee cannot know Scriptures to be Scriptures, but
by the infallible propoſall of the Church: ſo it is euident wee
cannot ſee any colour at all, vnleſſe illuminated or propoſed by
the Sunnes light. But after by it wee ſee them, ſuppoſe wee
ſhould take vpon vs to diſcourſe of their nature, or determine of
their diſtinct properties as now wee doe, and the ſunne or Pope
of colours, by himſelfe or his Nuncio ſhould take vs vp, as Duke
<hi>Humphrey</hi> did the blinde man reſtored to ſight, which hee neuer
had loſt; Yea? who taught you to diſtinguiſh colours? were you
not quite blinde but now? as yet you cannot diſcerne any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
without my publike light, and yet will you preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine
their properties, and diſtinguiſh their natures againſt my
definitiue ſentence knowne? Muſt not hee that enables you to
ſee them, enable you to diſtinguiſh them ſeene? Muſt you not
wholly rely vpon my authority; whether this bee white, or that
blacke? If a man vpon theſe Motiues ſhould abſolutely belieue
the ſunnes determinations, renouncing the iudgement of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
ſenſes: could hee truely ſay, that hee eyther knew this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to be white or that blacke, or another greene? Rather were
he not bound to ſay, I neither know white from black, nor blacke
from blew, nor blew from greene: but I know that to be white
which the Sunne, the onely infallible Iudge of colours, ſaith is
white; that onely to bee blacke, that blew, and that greene which
he ſhall determine ſo to be. I may thinke indeed that the ſnow
is white, or coales blacke: but with ſubmiſſion to the Sunnes
determination.</p>
               <p>12 And yet, as you haue heard at large out of the Trent
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7902:160"/>
Councell, and beſt Apologies can bee made for it, the Church
muſt bee the infallible Iudge of all Scripture ſenſe, and muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
be belieued without all appeale to ſcriptures, not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
as ſhee ſhall accord with them. The concluſion hence
iſſuing, is moſt infallible, and on their parts moſt ineuitable:
<hi>[Whoſoeuer abſolutely acknowledgeth this authority in the Church or
Conſistory, &amp; yelds ſuch obedience vnto it in all determinations, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

beſt reſolution hee can make of his faith is this; <hi>[I belieue that to
bee the meaning of euery place, which the Church ſhall define to bee the

               <p>14 To conclude then: Hee that abſolutely belieues the Pope,
as Chriſts Vicar generall in all things, without examination of
his decrees by Euangelicall precepts, neither belieues Chriſt nor
his Goſpell; no not when this pretended Vicar teacheth no
otherwiſe then his Maſters lawes preſcribe For thus belieuing a
diuine truth onely from this mans authority, hee commits ſuch
Idolatry with him (for the kind or eſſence) as the Heathen did
with <hi>Mercury,</hi> their falſe Gods ſuppoſed meſſenger, though ſo
much more hainous in degree, as his generall notion of the true
God is better, whoſe infinite goodneſſe, cannot entertaine an
interpreter no better qualified then moſt Popes are, did his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſtand in need of any. But if when the Pope ſhall teach
the doctrine of Diuels, men abſolutely belieue it to be Chriſts,
becauſe his pretended Vicar commends it to them: in thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
they commit ſuch prepoſterous Idolatry, as thoſe of
<hi>Calecut,</hi> which adore the Deuill, vpon conceit, doubtleſſe, of
ſome celeſtiall or diuine power in him; as the abſolute Papiſt
doth not adore the Pope, but vpon perſwaſion he is Chriſts Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,
and teaches as Chriſt would doe, <hi>viua voce,</hi> were hee again on
earth. And leſſe it were to bee lamented, did theſe Pſeudo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
profeſſe their allegiance to Sathans incarnate Agent,
as to their ſupreme Lord, by ſuch ſolemne ſacrifices onely as the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7902:161"/>
inhabitants of <hi>Calicute</hi> performe to wicked ſpirits.<note place="margin">That this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſuch as embrace it, to glory in villany</note> But this their
blinde beliefe of whatſoeuer hee ſhall determine vpon a proude

inuert the whole law of God and nature, to glory in villany, and
triumph in miſchiefe, euen to ſeeke prayſe and honour eternall;
from acts ſo foule and hideous, as the light of nature would make
the <hi>Calicutians</hi> or other Idolaters bluſh at thier very mention. It
is a ſure token hee hath not yet learned the Alphabet of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that doubts whether Ieſuiticall doctrine concerning this
abſolute beliefe, extend not to all matters of fact. And if out of
ſimplicity, rather then policy, ſo they ſpeake: I cannot but much
pitty their folly, that would perſwade vs it were not the fault of
Romiſh Religion, but of the men that profeſſe it, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
ſo many vnto ſuch diueliſh practiſes of late. I would the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
were but put to inſtance what kind of villany eyther hath
beene already acted on earth, or can yet poſſibly bee hatched in
the region vnder the earth, ſo hideous and vgly, as would ſeeme
deformed or odious to ſuch as are wholly led by this blind faith,
if it ſhould but pleaſe the Romiſh Clergy, to giue a milde or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
cenſure of it. No brat of hell, but would ſeeme as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to their eyes, as young todes are to their dammes, if their
mother once commend the feature of it, or acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it for
her darling. Did not ſome of the Powder-plotte, after Gods
powerfull hand had ouertaken them, and ſentence of death had
paſſed vpon them, euen when the Executioner was ready to do
his laſt office to them, make a queſtion whether their plot were
ſinnefull or no? So modeſt were ſome of them, and ſo obedient
ſonnes to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they would not take vpon
them to ſay eyther the one or other, but referred the matter
to their mothers determinations; hereby teſtifying vnto the
world, that if the Church would ſay, they would beleeue ſo great
an offence againſt their Country were none againſt God. One of
them was ſo obſtinate, as to ſollicite his fellow, whileſt both were
drawne vpon one hurdle to the gallowes, not to acknowledge it
for any ſinne. Or if theſe muſt bee reputed but priuate men, not

I abſolutely deny, (as the Catholique Doctors vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
generally doe) that the Pope can erre in ſuch a buſineſſe.</hi> The
certainety of this his beliefe hee would ground vpon thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
by <hi>which wee are aſſured it ſhall neuer come to paſſe that the
vniuerſall Church can bee deceiued in points of Religion. But the
whole church ſhould erre very groſely in ſuch matters, ſhould, it repute
and worſhippe him for a Saint which is none.</hi> Here it would bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
how Sathan inſtigates theſe men vnto ſuch tenents, as
may occaſion God and his Goſpell to be blaſphemed. Firſt, they
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7902:163"/>
would make it an Article of faith, that all muſt belieue as the
Pope teacheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whence it followes, that eyther hee cannot
teach amiſſe, or elſe faith may periſh from off the earth. Which
if it could, God were not true in his promiſes. The ſureſt pledge
the Chriſtian world can haue of his fidelity in them, muſt be the
Popes infallibility, ſo as from the firſt vnto the laſt, hee muſt be
held as true in his dealings, as God in his ſayings. If hee faile in
canonizing a Saint, whom he cannot poſſibly know to be ſuch,
vnleſſe hee knew his heart, which belongs wholly vnto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
God muſt be a lyar, and there is no truth in him. The finall
iſſue intended by Sathan in theſe reſolutions is this; When men
haue beene a long time ledde on with faire hopes of gaining
heauen by following the Popes direction, and yet in the end ſee
(as who not blinde ſees not) his groſſe errors and deteſtable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
they may bee hence tempted to blaſpheme God as if hee
had beene his copartner in this conſenage. From this root (I take
it) hath Atheiſme ſprung ſo faſt in <hi>Italy.</hi> For whileſt faith is in
the blade, and their hopes flouriſhing, they imagine God and
the Pope to be ſuch friends as their blinde guides make them:
But afterwards comming to deteſtation of this <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> &amp;
his treachery, holding his ſpirituall power as ridiculous, they
thinke eyther as deſpitefully, or contemptuouſly of the Deity;
or ſay with <hi>the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3 Thus Antichriſts followers ſtill runne a courſe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Chriſtian Religion.<note place="margin">The fearefull manner of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God in maintaining this argument.</note> For if it bee true (as it is moſt true)
that faith cannot vtterly periſh from off the earth; what damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
abuſe of Gods mercy and fauour toward mankind is this, in
ſeeking, as the Ieſuites doe, to make all abſolutely rely vpon one
in matters of faith? For ſo if hee faile, all others muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
faile with him. That is, the whole world muſt be as kind ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
fooles to him, as that naturall idiot was to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
who being demanded, whether hee would goe to heauen
with him or no, replyed hee would goe to Hell with ſo good a
Maſter, ſeeing any man would be willing to goe to heauen with
an ordinary friend, yea with his enemy. Though we ſhould vſe
no other argument but that, <hi>Auoide yee ſonnes of Sathan; for it
is written, yee ſhall not tempt the Lord your God:</hi> It ſhould, mee
thinkes, bee enough to put all the Ieſuites in the world vnto ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7902:163"/>
in this point, did they not as farre exceede their father in
impudency, as they come ſhort of him in wit. For this manner
of tempting God is more ſhameleſſe then the Diuels ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto our Sauiour, when hee was inſtantly ſilenced with this
reproofe. A preſumption it is more damnable to expect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
or guidance of Gods ſpirit, in ſuch deſperate reſolutions
as <hi>Valentian</hi> here brings, then it were for a man to throw himſelfe
headlong from an high Tower, vpon hope of Angelicall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
For ſeeing (as I ſaide) God hath promiſed, that true
faith ſhall not periſh from off the earth; for all men to aduenture
their faith vpon one mans infallibility, who may haue leſſe ſauing
faith in him then Turke or Infidell, is but a prouoking or daring
of God to recall his promiſe. Or what more damnable doctrine
can bee imagined, then that all men ſhould worſhippe him for
a Saint, whom the wickeddeſt man on earth doth commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for ſuch?</p>
               <p>4 <hi>But to proceede. As the doctrine is moſt impious, ſo are
the grounds of it moſt improbable. For how can the Pope or
Papiſts infallibly know this or that man to bee a Saint; Seeing
there is no particular reuelation made of it, eyther to the Pope
or others?</hi> I anſwere (<hi>ſaith</hi> Valentian) that the generall reuelation,
whereby it is euident, that whatſoeuer the Pope ſhall decree, as pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the whole Church, is most true, may ſuffice in this caſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) vnto the canonizing of Saints appertaine theſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Scripture, in which heanenly ioyes are generally propoſed to
all ſuch as leade a godly life. For by the Popes determination, we know
the Saint which hee hath canonized, to bee contained in the foreſaid
vniuerſall propoſition. Whence it is eaſie to frame an aſſent of faith;
by which wee may perſwade our ſelues, that ſuch a Saint hath obtained
eternall bliſſe.</p>
               <p>5 I would requeſt the Reader by the way to note the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
iniurious partiality, in ſcoffing at ſuch of our Writers, as
without expreſſe warrant of particular reuelation, holde a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
of their owne ſaluation: when as they, onely by Gods
generall promiſes to ſuch as leade a godly life, and the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
in declaring who haue ſo liued, can bee certaine (<hi>de
fide</hi>) others are ſaued. But the former doubt is rather remoued
then quite taken away by this his anſwere, if it ſtand alone. As
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7902:164"/>
yet it may bee queſtioned, how any can infallibly know the truth
of what hee cannot poſſibly know at all, but only by other mens
teſtimonies, in their nature (the Ieſuite being iudge) not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in whoſe examination it is not impoſſible his Holineſſe
may bee negligent? For how men liue or die in <hi>England, Spaine,</hi>
or the <hi>Indies,</hi> no Pope can tell but by the information of others
no Popes. The Reader perhaps will prognoſticate <hi>Valentians</hi>
anſwere, as in truth I did. For when I firſt framed the doubt
before I read it in him, mee thought it ſtood in need of ſuch a
reply, as<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. Sect. 4. chap. 6, Parag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brought for defence of the vulgar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.
Altogether as fooliſh it were to thinke any priuate mans

(at leaſt ſo farre as they proue in generall, that hee died a godly and

the Pope in defining a controuerſie vſe diligence or no, yet without

Chriſt hath giuen him. Wherefore in his iudgement care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
are neceſſary to the Pope, not ſo as if hee could not define aright,
or rightly vſe his authority without them: but that hee doe not ſinne
himſelfe, whileſt hee defines an infallible truth for others to belieue.
Hereto may bee added, that albeit a diligent care were neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for the infallibility of the Popes deciſions; yet the ſame faith,
which binds vs to belieue he decides the controuerſie infallibly, binds vs
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7902:164"/>
alſo to belieue that hee vſed as much diligence as was requiſite. As for

and ſeaſonable wether, &amp; whatſoeuer elſe were neceſsary for effecting of

<hi>that no ſure arguments can be brought, why wee ſhould thinke ſtudy or

as it concernes other mens faith that muſt rely vpon it.</hi> Rely vpon it

And it is all one, whether like Witches they giue their

               <p>5 Laſtly, in reſpect of this mouth of blaſphemie, Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and Gentiliſme are as a toy. The ancient Heathen, out of
their inbred ignorance, and want of externall meanes for right
information of their vnderſtanding, changed the glorie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
God into the ſimilitude of corruptible things; often
taxed by meere Philoſophers for their groſſeneſſe. Theſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
though profeſſing the worſhip of the euer-liuing, true, and
only God, though partakers of his written word, and all the helps
his gracious prouidence from time to time hath affoorded for
manifeſtation of it right ſenſe and meaning, abuſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7902:169"/>
with the Pope, and his periured Soueraigne. For knowing
the breach of peace was fully reſolued vpon by the State of
France, he thought it a point of warlike wiſedome to begin with
the enemie in his owne Land, rather then expect his onſet vpon
notice of warre proclaimed: and faire opportunity (as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends

league, as afterwards his venerable perſon was the firſt, vpon
whom thoſe perfidious Aſſaſinates, and Actors in the Pariſian

ſaw fitteſt occaſions; vntill at length they got both feet on Princes

to nuſſle the people in their credulitie? For mine owne part, as
yet I cannot thinke ſo, though I haue beene friendly cenſured for
ſaying the contrarie. Many of them, I am perſwaded, thinke they
honour Chriſt as much, as the beſt in reformed Churches doe.
But doth this their conceipt, or imaginarie loue to him, leſſen
their wrong, in reſpect of thoſe contumelies offered him by the
Heathen? Rather (in the learned) it is a ſymptome of that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
plague, inflicted vpon the Iewes, <hi>That ſeeing, they ſhould not
ſee, that hearing, they ſhould not heare, nor vnderſtand:</hi> no ſigne at
all of better reall affection towards Chriſt, but rather a token of
greater ſeruilitie vnto Satan, or of that ſtrange ſpirituall drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
ſpoken of by the Euangeliſt. Their hearts and heads are
not acquainted; the one endites what Satan ſuggeſts, and moues
their outward members to act what he commands; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
all done in honour of Chriſt, as if a man ſhould bee ſo
deeply intoxicated with ſome pleaſant poyſon, as to enforce it
vpon his deareſt friend, for an extraordinarie daintie. Finally, that
theſe great Clearkes ſhould thus acknowledge Chriſt for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of the world, and yet admit euery Pope for his Compeere,
and thus deuoutly embrace the doctrine of Deuils, is an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
document, they are the ſworne followers of <hi>Him, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
is by the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes, and lying
wonders, and in all deceiueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe amongſt them
that periſh.</hi> That which eſpecially cauſeth many of vs to doubt,
whether the Ieſuites doe not equiuocate, when they ſpeake well
of Chriſt, is, becauſe their learning and iudgement are, on the
one ſide ſo great, and this imagination on the other ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
abſurd and ſottiſh, as one cannot poſſibly better brooke the
others companie in the ſame heart or braine, then the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Prince, or Potentate in the world could the beaſtlieſt ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
ſhee-foole liuing for the only conſort of his bed; howſoeuer
theſe cunning Panders in pride of their nimble wits may hope to
betroth more ſimple ſoules into this out-caſt of hell. And though
experience in ſome ſort hath proued it true, that no opinion was
euer propoſed ſo abſurd, but found ſome Philoſopher for it Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron:
yet this imagination of the Popes tranſcendent authoritie,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7902:170"/>
farre exceeds the limits of any experiments or obſeruation made
in Philoſophers, anſwerable to the former axiome. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the more their infatuation, of whom we ſpeake, exceeds the
bounds of all folly or vanitie meerely naturall, the more it aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to vs the truth of the Apoſtles prediction in the place late
cited.<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 10. 11.</note> Doubtleſſe <hi>becauſe they receiued not the loue of the truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The fulfilling of which prophecie is moſt conſpicuous in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Ieſuites, the principall maintayners of this doctrine. For
were they not men of rare wit and exquiſite learning, were not
this opinion withall of all that are or can bee imagined the moſt
ſottiſhly improbable, and prepoſterouſly impious; the print of
Gods finger, thus confounding their braine, could not be ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
or diſcernable. The firſt bait, caſt out by Satan, was but to
draw the Romiſh Cleargie vnto practices, ſo ſuſpicious amongſt
the people that they could not be iuſtified, but by a conceipt of
infallibilitie: and not checking their pride, being challenged of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in doctrine, and impietie in their dealings; the Lord gaue
them ouer to beleeue this monſter of falſhood and vntruth, a
bottomleſſe pit of hypocriticall prepoſterous blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>10 Would to God the daily ambitious practices of many,
that are or would be in great place amongſt vs, the proneneſſe of
moſt to tranſgreſſe the bounds of lawfull authoritie, and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſſe

impatience of all impeachment by men, as farre their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
in ſpirituall graces, as their inferiours in ſecular dignitie;
did not plainely ſhew the paſſage from that point, where theſe
mens reſolutions anchor, vnto this new <hi>Tyre,</hi> the Rock of honor,
and ſeate of pride, to be but ſhort, and the tranſportation eaſie, if
opportunities of Time and Tide did ſerue them. But of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
temptations, and opportunities that did firſt driue the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
into this harbour, as alſo of inueterate errors in other
points, and reliques of Heatheniſh diſpoſitions, whereby they
<hi>two</hi> others after them, elſewhere (according to my promiſe) if
God permit. At this time it ſhall ſuffice to haue waded thus farre
in theſe vnpleaſant paſſages, for diſcouering the enemies weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his new Fortifications, or Repalliations rather of ſuch
breaches, as our ancient Worthies haue made in their imaginarie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7902:171"/>
Rock of ſtrength. Now as my ſoule and conſcience in the ſight
of God, and his holy Angels can aſſure me, theſe imputations of
blaſphemie, ſorcerie, and prepoſterous Idolatrie, I haue laid vpon
this fundamentall point of Romiſh faith, are moſt true, though
much leſſe exaggerated then it deſerues: ſo againe, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
it hath in ſome ſort euer gone againſt my conſcience, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to diſcipher or diſplay her abominations. For my little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of this preſent ages temper too well inſtructs me, what
great offence is oftimes hereby giuen to men, as weake in faith as
ſtrong in their perſwaſions of it, to ſlatter themſelues in their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
or make them ſeeme vnto themſelues, men rightly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

true religion by their hatred vnto this doctrine of Deuils, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themſelues with Prieſts and Ieſuites, as they are painted out
in their natiue colours by eloquent and learned Paſtors. But his
iniquitie be vpon his owne head, that thus peruerts my labours,
vndertaken for his good, vnto his harme. For vnto a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
purpoſe haue I ſet forth this ſurvey of Romiſh blaſphemie,
in a larger volume then firſt I meant it, euen to ſtirre vp my ſelfe,
and euery Profeſſor of true religion, vnto ſerious amendment of
our liues, to hold faſt our faith, by holding vp hands pure from
briberie and corruption, by lifting vp hearts and mindes void of
all guile and hypocriſie, ardently zealous of euery good worke,
