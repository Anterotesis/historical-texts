         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Looke to the Word, wherein all these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
things are revealed: Christ is evidently the
matter and summe of the Gospell: and the
Apostle affirmes the like concerning the
<pb facs="tcp:18740:4"/>
Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
to every one that beleeveth.</hi> First, <hi>by
similitude,</hi> saith <hi>Austin:</hi> when a man is come
to the end of a way, he can go no farther:
so when a Christian is come to Christ, he
hath no farther excellencie to seek or go
unto: in Christ there is enough and enough
to reconcile him to God, and bring him to
heaven.<note place="margin">Cont. Iul. 9.</note> Secondly, <hi>for perfection,</hi> saith <hi>Cyril<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi>
When a thing is finished, it is said to come
to an end, as namely in weaving a garment<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
so Christ hath finished, perfected, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the Law: he came not to destroy,
but establish it: so that in him we have a
perfect righteousnes to present God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
even as the Law required, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. 21.
Thirdly, he is <hi>finis intentionis:</hi> the Law
bids us look to Christ, in whom only we
can live: both the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> in the holy
precepts of it, <hi>impossible</hi> in this our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
therefore have recourse to Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. together with the curses and
threats of it, whereby it is a sharpe <hi>Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
leading to Christ, Gal.</hi> 3. 24. As also the
<hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> all whose <hi>shadowes</hi> figure
<pb facs="tcp:18740:4"/>
out Christ and his benefits, <hi>Heb. 10. 1. Now
is Christ come</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian) who is the end
of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Do cibis Iud. cap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>opening all the dark matters of it,

teacher,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cont. Faust.</note> 
               <hi>a setler of truth to the uttermost. Austin</hi>
calls <hi>Moses</hi> his ceremonies, <hi>prenunciative</hi> or
foretelling <hi>Observations:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Advers. Iud.</note> and saith, <hi>We are
not now constrained to observe things used in the
Prophets time, Non quia illa damnata, sed quia
in melius mutata sunt; not for any evill in them,
but because they are changed for the better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What they foretold, and how they are
changed for the better, this Treatise in part
discovereth, and I purpose not now to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
These glorious times of the Gospel
shew evidently, how much the truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
the shadow: the vertue common
to the ancient beleevers, as well as unto us:
<hi>Christ Iesus yesterday,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and to day, and the same
for ever:</hi> but as the manifestation is more
cleare, so the grace is more plentifull and
comfortable. The same Testator made
both Testaments, and these differ not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but <hi>accidentally;</hi> the Old <hi>infolding</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:18740:5"/>
New with some darknesse, and the New
<hi>unfolding</hi> the Old with joyous perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie.</p>
            <p>This glorious dispensation of grace, as
it stands by the good pleasure of God, so
also by his manifold wisedome, who in
severall approches of his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
drawes still nearer to his Church, and
yet reserves the greatest for his Kingdome
of glory. Even now, in this marvellous
light of the Gospell, we have our divine
ceremonies and sacraments, see him afarre
off, know but in part, darkly as in a glasse,
and receive our best contentment by the
acts of faith, while the Word and Spirit
make us know the things freely given us
of God in Christ Iesus. But time shall bee,
when (to say nothing of the estate of the
Church after the ruine of Antichrist, and
calling of the Iewes) we shall in heaven
see him whom we beleeved, face to face,
clearly, perfectly, immediately, without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
or Types, in the fullest vision,
nearest union, and absolutest fruition. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
till then shall we comprehend wholly

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heard of a demurre made, as though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were put forth under this Authors name,
which it none of his. I assure thee in the word of
a Minister, that for the workes that have my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
prefixed (and I heare of no other publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his name) there is not one note nor notion which is
not the Authors owne, according to his papers. And the like I
affirme concerning this Treatise of Types, which now I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
The use of it is manifold: To open divers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
To shew the meaning of legall shadows and ceremonies:
To declare the faith of <hi>the Elders,</hi>

To manifest our faith,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 5.</note> one with theirs, <hi>one faith, one
Lord, one Baptisme,</hi> one salvation: To magnifie and commend
Christ to every soule, that it may be saved, and he honoured.
To discerne and bewaile the blindnesse of Gods ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Iewes, and pray for their returne to the truth not catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at shadowes: Of whom, in present I may say with detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to maturitie? Let us enjoy and make use of our owne
good, and follow the truth in truth: avaunt superstition, be
packing all impietie, let true religion be preserved and flourish.</hi>
Yet withall,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 26.</note> seeing there is a promise that <hi>all Israel shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>

the entrance into which Treatise, we must
premise some Propositions.</p>
               <p>1. That the Lord decreed to have alwayes a Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
upon the face of the earth; for the upholding of which
hee upholds the world. For, 1. Hee will have his
name confessed, and praised as well in earth as in heaven.
2. Hee will maintaine his publike worship, by it to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
heathenish Idolaters from true Worshippers.
3. To prepare true beleevers in this Church militant to
that Church triumphant, and to set and polish them as
living stones in this mount of the Church, for that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
mountaine and temple.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. For the effecting of his purpose he hath decreed,
that the doctrine of salvation by Iesus Christ should bee
founded out in the Church, together with the doctrine
of the Law, that partly the right way of his worshipp,
and partly the way of salvation, might be made knowen
and opened to beleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. By the Gospel the Lord hath revealed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace, which is in substance but one, as <hi>God</hi> is
but one, and <hi>Christ</hi> is but one, who is the substance of it.
As there is but one <hi>hope</hi> of one eternall life, the end of
the Covenant: and one faith which is the meane to leade
to that end, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> V. So long as Christ was to come, it pleased God to
traine his Church by an heape of Ceremonies,<note place="margin">God appointed a multitude of ceremonies to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>

if more speciall reasons be demanded; These may be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I. The nonage and infancie of that Church, which
was not capable of such high mysteries, but was to bee
taught by their eyes as well as their eares. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it pleased God to put the ancient Church (even
newly out of the cradle) under Tutors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 2. and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
diverse types and ceremonies, as <hi>rudiments</hi> and
introductions, <hi>verse</hi> 3. fitted to the grosse and weake sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Church, which was to be brought on by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, through such shadows and figures, to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18740:12"/>
true Image and thing signified, who in our Text calleth
himselfe <hi>truth,</hi> in opposition to all those shadowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the weaker and duller they were, the
more neede had they of cleare instruction; and God
could have revealed Christ as clearely to them,<note place="margin">Velata sunt ista, donec aspiraret dies, &amp; remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur umb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>g.</note> as to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> But as the Lord had observed this method in
creating the world, hee would have darknesse goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
light; and in upholding the world hee would have
dawning goe before cleare day: So in the framing and
upholding the Church, hee would have Christ exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Fathers, as to the Wise men, in swadling
clouts, which hid his glory. He respected them as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
he erected for them in <hi>Iewry,</hi> a little free-schoole
set up in a corner of the world; hee appointed the Law
of <hi>Moses</hi> as a Primer, or A. B. C. in which Christ was
to be shadowed in darke and obscure maner; he would
that Christ should come to his brethren, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his;
who first obscured himself to them, and afterward made
himselfe better knowen. One compares it to <hi>Noahs</hi> 1.
Opening the window of the Arke; 2. Removing the
covering; 3. Stepping forth himselfe.</p>
               <p>II. Therein the wisedome of God provided for
the further advancement of Christ and his Gospel; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which compared with the Law, must bee manifested in
great brightnesse and glory. Christ the Sonne, must
come in more glory then <hi>Moses</hi> the servant. Hence,
<hi>Ioh. 1. 17. The Law was given by Moses, but grace and
truth came by Iesus Christ:</hi> The Gospel is called <hi>grace,</hi>
not because under the Law the same grace was not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but comparatively: that was scarse grace to this
which is more full, more manifest; as the light in the
dawning,<note place="margin">Grace in the new Testament specially, how.</note> is scarse light in comparison of light at noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
There was grace, but here is more grace. 1. In
manifestation: The light of the Sunne is seven-fold, and
like the light of seven dayes, as was prophesied, <hi>Isai. 30.
26.</hi> 2. In impletion and accomplishment of that</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18740:13"/>
which was but a promise of grace in comparison. <hi>Act.
13.</hi> 32. 3. In application and apprehension by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in all Countries, not onely in <hi>Iudea.</hi> 4. In the
groweth and perfection of faith and grace in the hearts
of ordinary beleevers above them. Hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.
the Law had but <hi>a shadow of good things to come,</hi> and
<hi>not the Image and truth it</hi> selfe: that is, It had a rude and
darke delineation of good things to come, as a draught
made by a painter with a coale; but the Gospel exhibits
the picture it selfe in the flourish and beauty; that is, the
truth and being of it.</p>
               <p>Hence also <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17.<note place="margin">Ceremonies called shadows, for 4. reasons.</note> speaking of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Ceremoniall Law, saith: they were but
<hi>shadowes</hi> of things to come, but the body is Christ.
Whence hee would have us conceive: 1. That as
the body is the cause of the shadow, and the cause more
excellent then the thing caused: So Christ was the cause
of those Ceremonies, and more excellent then they.
2. As the shadow representeth the shape of the body,
with the actions and motions: So those rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
resemble Christ in all his actions, passions, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as after we are to heare. 3. As the shadow is but
an obscure resemblance in respect of the body: So the
Ministery of the old Testament in rites and Ceremonies,
is a darke representation of the body, namely Christ and
his spirituall worship. 4. As the body is solid, firme,
and of continuance, even when the shadow is gone: So
the Ceremonies as shadowes are flowen away, but
Christ the body and his true worship lasteth for ever.
In all which Christ and his grace are advanced, as the
publisher and perfecter of our salvation without any
shadowes; whereas of the Law it is sad: <hi>It made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perfect, Heb.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. Those Ceremonies were not given to merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes by them, nor to appease Gods anger,<note place="margin">Non ex opere op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ato.</note>
nor to bee an acceptable worship by the worth of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18740:13"/>
worke done, nor to justifie the observer: but to shew
justification by Iesus Christ, the truth and substance of
them; to bee types of him, pointing at him in whom
the Father is pleased; to bee Allegories and resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the benefits of Christ, exhibited in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
to bee testimonies of the promise and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
on Gods part; to be Sacraments and seales of faith
on the part of the beleeving Iew, exciting and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his faith in the Messiah.</p>
               <p>IV. God would have this heape of Ceremonies; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
1. As bonds and sinewes of the ministery and publike
meetings;<note place="margin">Vse of them to the Jews.</note> in which the voice of the promised seed, and
the sound of wholsome and saving doctrine might bee
preserued in the Church, and propagated to posterity.
2. To be externall signes of their profession, by which
God would have his Church distinct from all nations of
the earth. 3. To be to the unbeleeving Jewes, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
discipline to bridle them, and an exercise to frame
them (at least in externall conversation) to the Policy,
and Commonwealth of <hi>Moses;</hi> for else they must be cut
off, and excluded.</p>
               <p>V. Gods wisedome in appointing these Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
1. Appointed a certaine observation of the line
and tribe whence the Messiah should come according to
the promise.<note place="margin">Gods wisdome in appointing them.</note> 2. Enjoined a certaine provision for the
Ministery, which had no certaine part of the land allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them. 3. That the poore might be so provided
for, as that there might not be a beggar in Israel.</p>
               <p>The former propositions and reasons being delivered
by way of Preface, wee now come to shew that which
our Text properly calleth for, that is: wherein or how,
Christ is the <hi>truth</hi> of those <hi>figures,</hi> and the body of those
shadowes of the Ceremoniall Law.</p>
               <p>Christ was figured in the old Testament by holy <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I. In respect of Creation. 1. Both of them were
Sons of God, the one by eternall generation, the other by
grace of Creation. 2. Both were Men, <hi>Adams,</hi> redde
earth; the first in his matter, the second not in his matter
only, but also in his bloody passion. 3. Both were Sons
of one Father, and both men but of no man their father,
neither of them having any other father but God. 4. Both
created in the <hi>Image of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vterque ad ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem Dei con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus, uterque Deo charissimus.</note> the former, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>ingraven forme of his Fathers person. Heb.</hi> 1. 3.

6. Both possessed of a most happy and innocent estate;
in which the one had power to persever, but not will:
the other had both power and will. 7. The first <hi>Adam</hi>
was made in the sixth day of the weeke to the Image of
God: the second <hi>Adam</hi> towards the sixth age of the
world appearing to restore that Image which the first
<hi>Adam</hi> quickly lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. In respect of office and soveraignty. 1. The
first <hi>Adam</hi> was owner of Paradise, the heire of the
world; soveraigne Lord of all the Creatures to whom
they came for their names; the second <hi>Adam</hi> is Lord of
heaven as well as earth, heire of the <hi>outmost bounds of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18740:14"/>
earth, Psal.</hi> 2. 8. Commander of all Creatures; whom the
windes and seas obey; whose word the divels tremble at;
and he keepes his soveraignty which the first <hi>Adam</hi> lost.
2. <hi>Adam</hi> was appoynted to <hi>keepe the Garden</hi> and <hi>dresse</hi>
it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> was set apart to
<hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>save</hi> his Church, the Garden and Paradise of
God, <hi>Eph. 5. 26. 3. Adam</hi> was King, Priest, and Prophet
in his family: so is Christ in the Church, the family and
houshold of faith,<note place="margin">Primus ecclesiae doctor audiens immediate a Deo quae ecclesiae era<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t proponenda, ita &amp; Christus.</note> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. As <hi>Adam</hi> was the first Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the word in the Church, delivering the promise
of the blessed seed with certaine rites &amp; Ceremonies to
his children, and they to their posterity: So the second
<hi>Adam</hi> is the chiefe Prophet and Doctor of his Church,
who alwaies prescribed the pure worship of God for
matter and manner in the Churches of all ages.</p>
               <p>III. In respect of Conjugation. 1. <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
sleeping <hi>Eve</hi> is formed: Christ dying the Church is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<hi>Eve</hi> is taken out of <hi>Adams</hi> side, while he sleepes:
out of the second <hi>Adams</hi> side, while he was in the sleepe
of death, issueth the Church. 2. <hi>Eve</hi> was no sooner
framed but as a pure and innocent spouse she was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God to <hi>Adam</hi> yet in innocency: so God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delivered the Church as a chaste &amp; innocent spouse
to be married to the second <hi>Adam</hi> for ever, to be bone of
his hone, and flesh of his flesh. 3. Of <hi>Eve</hi> marryed
to <hi>Adam</hi> he receives both a <hi>Cain</hi> and an <hi>Abel</hi> into his
house: so the second <hi>Adam</hi> hath in his visible Church
both elect and reprobates, sound and hypocrites, as by
many Parables is signified; as of the field; the net, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IIII. In respect of propagation. 1. Both of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
them are rootes, both have a posterity and seed, <hi>Isa. 53.
10.</hi> 2. Both of them convey that they have unto
their posterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 14. As by the first <hi>Adam sinne,</hi>
and by sinne <hi>death</hi> came over all men: so by the second
<hi>Adam</hi> came <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and by righteousnesse <hi>life</hi> on
all beleevers; and herein especially was the first <hi>Adam</hi> a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18740:15"/>
figure of him that was to come. 3. As the first <hi>Adam</hi>
merited death for all his posterity: so the second <hi>Adam</hi>
life for all his.</p>
               <p>Application followes.</p>
               <p>I. To note the honour and antiquity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery

exercised. Dispise at thy perill what they so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
thinke it too base for thy selfe to attend, for thy
sonnes to intend: Neither the first <hi>Adam</hi> Lord of the
earth, nor the second <hi>Adam</hi> Lord of Heaven and earth,
did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. To note the antiquity and authority of the
doctrine of free grace by the merit of the Messiah, which
both the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> taught;<note place="margin">Antiquity of the doctrine of free grace.</note> neither of them
ever dreamed of the doctrine of workes and humane
merits. What <hi>Adam</hi> learned of God in Paradise hee
taught to his posterity; what his posterity heard of him,
the same they delivered and left to their children; but
they never heard nor taught any other <hi>way to salvation,</hi>
but by the promised seed: so also what the Disciples
heard of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> that they taught to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
but they heard the same of him. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. And our
doctrine being the same with theirs, is not new, but
more ancient then any other. For as this is the honour
of all truth,<note place="margin">Quod antiquissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> to be before error and falshood: so of this
truth, to have precedency of all truths; It truely pleadeth
antiquity, therefore verity.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. In that the Church comes out of Christs side,
being in the sleepe of death,<note place="margin">Seeke life by Christs death.</note> as <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> hee
sleeping, wee learne to seeke our life in Christs death.
That death should be propagated by the sinne of the first
<hi>Adam,</hi> was no marvaile: but that life by the death of the
second, is an admired mystery. Here is the greatest work
of Gods power fetched out of his contrary; of ranke
poyson a soveraigne remedy by the most skilfull Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
of hearts. Let the Jewes scorne a crucified God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18740:15"/>
and refuse the life offered by a dead man; they know not
the Scriptures, nor the power of God; who can and doth
command <hi>light out of darknesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6.</note> life out of death, all things
out of nothing. How easily can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e repayre all things out
of any thing, who can fetch and frame all things out of
nothing? He is of power to make of clay and spittle (fit
to put out the sight) a remedy to restore sight. He can as
easily save a world by the death of his Son, as multiply a
world by the sleepe of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Labour to bee ingrafted into the second <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> that as thou hast borne the image of the earthly,<note place="margin">Get into Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> as thou art surely of the first.</note>
so thou maist beare the image of the heavenly, 1. <hi>Cor. 15.
49.</hi> 1. Because the second <hi>Adam</hi> repayres whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we lost in the first. By the first wee are enemies to
God, by the second wee are reconciled to him. By the
first wee all dye,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> by the second wee are <hi>all made alive,
1. Cor.</hi> 15. 22. By the first we are left to Sathans power,
by the second wee are guided by the Spirit of God. By
the first we lost all the Creatures, by the second we are
restored to the holy use of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all. By the first a necessity
of death is brought in, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. it is appoynted for all
men once to dye,</hi> and then commeth judgement; but by the
second wee have a recovery of the blessing of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and life. Whatsoever the first <hi>Adam</hi> brings into the
world by sinne, the second carryes out by his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
2. Because by Christ the truth wee recover
more then we lost, or ever should have had by the Type.
For so the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. the gift by the second
<hi>Adam</hi> hath <hi>exceeded the offence</hi> of the first. That as the
first <hi>Adam</hi> by eating the forbidden fruit hath powred
all evill into the soules and bodies of all men, though
they eate not of the forbidden tree: So the second <hi>Adam</hi>
by regeneration is <hi>made righteousnesse</hi> to those who had
wrought no righteousnesse,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> and powred all good things
into the soules and bodies of his members: The first
<hi>Adam</hi> by sinne helps us into misery: but the second
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18740:16"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> not onely helps us out of misery, but advanceth
us to the highest dignity; to be, of sonnes of wrath, sons
of God; brethren of Christ; members of his body; heires
of the kingdome of heaven. By <hi>Adams</hi> sinne we are all
driven out of Paradise, an earthly pleasure, in which wee
should have enjoyed an inconstant happinesse: but
by Christ we are brought into the heavenly Paradise, our
Fathers house. By <hi>Adams</hi> sinne we become unjust: but
by Christs holinesse we are not just onely, but sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
graced, confirmed, glorified, into whom by faith we
come to be ingrafted.</p>

without open crime: Christ being without sinne.
3. Both walking with God, <hi>found grace with God.
Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. 8. Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 40. 52. But <hi>Noah</hi> found
grace by acceptation and imputation: Christ by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

owne perfection and justice: but <hi>Noah</hi> cloathed with
Christs.</p>
               <p>III. Both of them were Preachers of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
But Christ preached his owne doctrine, <hi>Noah</hi>
Christs. Both invited unto repentance. Both called men
to avoid the Judgement to come. Both lived and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a most corrupt age, when there was a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
both in doctrine and manners. Both their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
were despised, and that despight of both fearefully
revenged; the one by water, the other by fire and sword:
both by utter desolation, as the like never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>IV. Both of them makers of an Arke, and Masters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of it. But <hi>Noah</hi> of a materiall; Christ of a spirituall, the
Church. <hi>Noah</hi> to save sinners from the deluge of waters
temporall: Christ to save sinners from the deluge of
Gods wrath eternall.<note place="margin">Noahs Arke and Christs: 6. resemblances.</note> In the making of their Arkes they
are very like. 1. Both doe all about their Arkes at
Gods commandement. For as the Lord did not hide
from <hi>Noah</hi> his decree, <hi>Gen. 6. 13:</hi> So he communicated
his whole will and counsell to his Sonne concerning the
salvation of the Church, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 26. 2. As <hi>Noah</hi> takes
many trees at Gods commandement, and strongly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them together, and pitcheth them within and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18740:17"/>
without against the waters: So doth Christ make
choice of trees of righteousnesse, the planting of the
Lord, and compacts them together by the bond of the
Spirit, glewes and fastens them together by the glew of
Christian love, and pitcheth them within and without,
fortifies and strengthens them against the waters of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
temptation, persecution, that none shall drowne
or overwhelme them. 3. As <hi>Noah</hi> prepared divers
roomes in the Arke for divers creatures: So Christ in
his Arke appoints divers places and functions for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
here, and prepares in his Fathers house <hi>many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
for them hereafter, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2. And as <hi>Noah</hi> receives
into the Arke cleane and uncleane creatures and persons,
a <hi>Sem,</hi> and a <hi>Cham:</hi> So the Lord Christ into his militant
Church, all sorts of Nations, sexes, persons, conditions;
Jewes, Gentiles; men, women, noble, ignoble; belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and unbeleevers; hypocrites, and sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
On this floore is wheat and chaffe. 4. As <hi>Noah</hi>
made a window into his Arke, to give light to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
within: So Christ, by the Gospel preached in the
Church, enlighteneth the mindes of those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
without which light let in, they should sit in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
darkenesse. 5. As <hi>Noah</hi> by the same direction
makes a doore to enter into the Arke, and but one
doore for so very great a building: So there is but one
<hi>doore</hi> to the great building of the Church dispersed farre
and wide, and this is <hi>Christ himselfe, Ioh.</hi> 10. 7, 9. 6.
As <hi>Noah</hi> the Master of the Arke enters into it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaves
and saves all that enter in with him; for which
purpose hee is contented to bee tossed up and downe by
those most raging waters, and had no more freedome
from feare and danger then others in the Arke: So
Christ the Master of his Church, to save his Church,
himselfe enters into it, and is admitted into it by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Baptisme; and was contented for the saving
of others to bee tossed with waves and billowes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18740:17"/>
ignominy, shame, sinne, curse, yea the torments
of hell. That his Church might be in safety with him,
he will bee in danger with her, and every way to helpe
her, will bee every way like her in all things, sinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>V. Both of them were repayrers of the world.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
From <hi>Noah</hi> descended all the inhabitants of the earth:
from Christ all the inhabitants of heaven. The world
againe was re-peopled and replenished by <hi>Noahs</hi> poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
the Church and every member is Christs posterity.
Both of them were preservers and providers for all
sorts of Creatures: But <hi>Noah</hi> as a steward; Christ as Lord
and owner of them: <hi>Noah</hi> for a few, Christ for all: <hi>Noah</hi>
for a yeare and a little more, Christ perpetually. To both
of them the creatures came in, and were obedient to
them. Though never so fierce and savage out of the
Arke, yet in the Arke they were mild and tame: So to
Christ the windes, seas, divels obey; and if Lyons and
Cockatrices come into the Arke and Church they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as Lambs and little children putting off all fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>VI. Both of them offered a sacrifice of rest, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
sweet savour to the Lord, <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 8. 21. As men are
delighted with sweet savours, so was <hi>Noahs</hi> sacrifice
pleasing to God.<note place="margin">Sacrifice of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and of satisfaction.</note> But his was a sacrifice but of <hi>testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
witnessing his faith and thankfulnesse: The sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ was a perfect <hi>satisfaction,</hi> in which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not the bodies of cleane beasts as <hi>Noah,</hi> but his
owne body as a Lamb without spot, not upon an Altar
built by <hi>Noahs</hi> hand, but upon the Altar of his Deity,
not ascending to heaven by ordinary fire, but offered
through his eternall spirit, compard to fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.
And therefore must fully satifie his Fathers justice,
appease his wrath, and be most acceptable in it selfe, and
must bring <hi>Noahs,</hi> and all other sacrifices into accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And from hence it was that with both of them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18740:18"/>
God did make a covenant of grace for their posterities,
that he would never breake out in such wrath against
them, confirming the same unto the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi>
by the signe of the Raynebow, and to the posterity of
Christ by the Sacrament of Baptisme, and the Lords
Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> VII. Both of them sent a Dove out of the Arke.
<hi>Noah</hi> when the waters asswaged, and much of his feare
and daunger was past, sends out the Dove who brought
an Olive branch, a signe of joy, comfort, and abating of
the waters: So Christ Jesus his sufferings and labours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, sent his Spirit forth (which had lighted <hi>as
a Dove</hi> on him) and brings joy,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> and peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
into the hearts of all beleevers, bringing in a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that Gods wrath is appeased, the waters are
diminished, his love and favour returned which is
better then life.</p>
               <p>Now to application.</p>
               <p>I. In the type and truth learne:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Preserve inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in the worst times.</note> If all the world
about us be given to wickednesse, and wee be cast into
never so wicked an age, then to labour to shine in the
middest of a <hi>naughty generation, Phil.</hi> 2. 15. It is a singular
praise to be a <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodom, and in a corrupt age to bee
unlike sinners. For light to shine and shew it selfe in
darkenesse,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 16.</note> is beautifull and glorious. <hi>Let your light so
shine before men, that they may see your good works and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
your father which is in heaven.</hi> To shew our selves
sonnes of God, and children of light among enemies
of God and light, is a singular honour. <hi>Noah</hi> fashioned
not himselfe to those corrupt times; nor Christ to the
evill behaviour of that age. Never had Christians more
need among so many wicked fashions, to be exhorted
not to fashion themselves to the world. If a Preacher
hold on a preacher of righteousnesse in singlenesse and
sincerity of heart, not fashioning himselfe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
temporizers and men-pleasers, Let all the world
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18740:18"/>
scorne, oppose, traduce him: If a private man hold forth
the word of life, and in blamelesse and pure conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
walke in a way which leadeth against the streame and
common current of the corrupt age: Both the one and
the other have here the type and the truth, <hi>Noah</hi> and
Christ presidents for the like actions, precedents in the
same way.</p>
               <p>II. In them both learne: That these are the dayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in which we must expect our Lord to judgement.<note place="margin">Sinnes which are signes of Judgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</note> 
                  <hi>As
it was in the dayes of Noah, &amp;c:</hi> So shall the comming of
the Sonne of man bee. As those sinnes in <hi>Noahs</hi> time
brought the deluge of water:<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 38.</note> the same sinnes now
reigning, shall bring and hasten the destruction by fire,
prophecyed, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. The sinnes are these. 1. The
sonnes of God marry with the daughters of men: that
is, the godly with the ungodly, religious with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
beleevers with infidels, 2. Horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the word.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 20.</note> As <hi>Noah</hi> preached by the power of
the Spirit, and Christ himselfe by the Spirit so as never
man spake; yet both were despised, and the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
whereby they spake: So now godly Ministers
must not thinke much to bee despised in their Ministery.
For as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of Christ: So
Christ hath told us it must be. 3. Profanenesse of the
Ministery, and generall malice against sincerity. As in the
dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> many Wrights and workemen were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to prepare an Arke for others; but themselves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entred into the same, nor saved by the same: And
as in the dayes of Christ, the Scribes and Pharisees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
themselves chiefe builders, but refused the corner
stone, and neither entred themselves nor suffered others,
but envy Christ they could: So shall it be in the daies of
the Sonne of man. 4. In the Common-state, and
men, apostacy, security, sensuality; men eate, drinke,
marry, but know nothing of judgement, that is, will
not know: So shall the comming of the Sonne of man
be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18740:19"/>
III. In that Christ is the true <hi>Noah,</hi> all the true
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> members of Christ (who are carefull to prepare them an
Arke, and to get within the Arke of the Church) have
solid and strong comfort.<note place="margin">Comfort to bee had in Christ our <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </note> For, 1. He is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all that come unto him, who calls all the weary:
as <hi>Noah</hi> readily received all that offered themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. Let not thy sinne discourage thee, bee thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so uncleane, get once into the Arke, and thou art safe.
2. As <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe entred into the Arke, and abode
there all the time of danger, and tossing by the waters:
So our Lord still abides in the same ship of the Church
with us; he is so much the more compassionate to us, as
hee is acquainted with our sorrowes; and though the
danger and feare bee never so much, wee shall fare no
worse then himselfe will, who in all our troubles is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with us and for us. 3. As <hi>Noah</hi> pitched the
Arke within and without, and so fenced it against the
waues and raging billowes and surges of a world of
seas: So doth our true <hi>Noah</hi> strengthen his Arke and
Church partly with his promise, partly with his prayers
that their faith faile not, as with pitch within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
so firme and sure, as let this little Arke of the
Church be tossed upon the waters of affliction, and tried
by never so many temptations, and persecutions in this
sea of the world, it is so fenced and pitched that it
shall never miscarry. <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke indeed by tossing
and beating of the waters may bee weakened and made
worse: but Christs Arke the Church, is made better
and stronger by trialls and afflictions, <hi>Psal. 119. 71. It is
good for mee that I have beene afflicted, that I may learne
thy statutes. Noahs</hi> Arke at last shall putrifie and perish,
but Christs Arke shall never perish, but at last bee more
perfect and glorious. 4. As Gods Covenant with
<hi>Noah</hi> was his safety in the Arke: (for looke upon the
Arke floating above water, laden with heavy burthen,
fenced against the waters with a little pitch, perhaps not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18740:19"/>
very skilfully, that being the first vessell that ever was
made for the water) without Anchor, mast, sterne, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
or Master to governe it (for <hi>Noah</hi> was shut in by
God) how should it be but carried by winds and waves
upon rockes, or hills, or sands, or trees, or buildings,
and so in an instant split all too pieces, but that the Lord
was Stearsman in all that voyage?) So the safety of
the Church is, that it hath so faithfull a Pylot, whose Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made in his Church is the wall and defence of his
people, more stable then the foundation of the earth.
Which made <hi>David</hi> to glory;<note place="margin">Psal. 46. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Though the earth bee

5. The Arke had a time to be freed from the deluge of

made a Priest by the <hi>Oath</hi> of God, <hi>Psal. 110. 4. The Lord

<hi>Melchizedek.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> that Christ is
the true <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> both a Priest and a King. 1. As
he is a Priest wee are assured of a perfect reconciliation
by his all-sufficient Sacrifice. 2. Of sound instruction,
for the Priest must teach the Law, his lips must present
knowledge. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 25. When the Messiah is come hee
will tell us all things. Wee detest the blasphemy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that tells us, that he hath left an imperfect doctrine,
that must bee eeked with traditions. 3. Of his blessed
intercession, which is meritorious and acceptable. <hi>Samuel</hi>
out of his love to the people, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. saith thus,
<hi>God forbid that I should sinne, and cease to pray for you;

but I will teach you the good way:</hi> Christs love to the
Church is no lesse; therefore he will both teach and pray.
4. Of powerfull protection and safety. For he is not
our Priest onely but our King; not our Doctor onely, but
our defendor; not a Priest onely to pray, but a King to
obtaine for us, and bestow on us what he prayes for.
What if he had never so much power in teaching, if
he were impotent in defending? But he is King of peace

<hi>Melchizedek</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham:</hi> So Christ our <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek</hi>
hath blessed all the faithfull posterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Eph. 1. 3. with all spirituall blessings in Christ
Iesus.</hi> But with difference. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
blessing <hi>Gen. 14. 19. blessed art thou of God
possessor of heaven and earth:</hi> But our <hi>Melchizedek</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and bestoweth blessings of higher kind also then
could <hi>Melchizedek.</hi> For, 1. Christ blesseth by meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
blessing, through his most perfect sacrifice pacifying
his Fathers wrath: <hi>Melchizedek</hi> offered no such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to no such effect, his was accepted by mercy, not
for merit, not for his owne sacrifice, but for Christs. 2.
By actuall procuring the blessing of remission of sinnes
and righteousnesse restored, a more effectual blessing then
<hi>Melchidek</hi> could procure: His sacrifices could onely
signifie these in the Messiahs, not actually apply them.
3. By gathering, calling, ruling and preserving in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life his whole Church, as members of his owne
body, and by the donation of his spirit: none of which
blessings <hi>Melchizedek</hi> could give. 4. By bestowing
eternall life on beleevers, here in the first fruits, heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in the harvest: whereof <hi>Melchizedek</hi> must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
from him the fountaine, not a giver, 5. By
publishing and pronouncing on beleevers all this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18740:22"/>
in the preaching of the Gospell, and sealing it to
the hearts of the elect by the daily effectuall voyce of
his spirit by the word: which <hi>Melchizedek</hi> could not
doe. Therefore a greater then <hi>Melchizedek</hi> is here, and
a greater blessing then <hi>Abraham</hi> received from him. Let
the world curse, wicked ones rage and revile against the
Church and members, yet as <hi>Isaac</hi> said of <hi>Iacob, Gen. 27.
33.</hi> I have blessed him, and therefore he shall be blessed;
the same will Christ not say onely, but accomplish to
them.</p>
               <p>IIII. Hence is the stability and perpetuity of the
Church and members.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. By our <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek</hi>
the Church abides for ever.</note> That Christ is the true <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi>
that is, an eternall Priest; the Church must be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For a Priest cannot be without a Church, nor an
eternall Priest without an eternall Church, but of Christ
it is said, thou art a Priest for ever. Therefore Tyrants
shall not wast it, time shall not outlast it, death shall not
hinder the being and happinesse of it, no more then it
could the eternity of the Priest himselfe, who rose glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
from the dead, so shall the members. How happy
a thing is it to be of this houshold.</p>
               <p>V. The excellency of Christs Priesthood above
the Leviticall.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5. Excellency of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood above the Leviticall.</note> This is the scope of the Apostle in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<hi>Melchizedeks</hi> Priesthood so largely. For the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Priests were homagers to this, yea to the shadow
of it in <hi>Melchizedek</hi> while they were in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
loynes. 1. They were <hi>men</hi> onely of men: Christ
the Sonne of God, true God and man. 2. They were
sinfull men, and must offer <hi>first for themselves,</hi> and then
for others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 3. But Christ was sinlesse, he needed
not offer for his owne sinnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. 27. 3. For
their office, they were but ministers of holy things, and
of salvation propounded in them: Christ because of this
order was <hi>author of salvation to all that obey him, Heb. 5.
9.</hi> 10. 4. They were many, and all ministers of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
covenant: but he is but one, who hath obtained
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18740:22"/>
a more excellent office in that he is <hi>Mediator of a better
testament established upon better promises, Heb.</hi> 8. 6. For
the promises of the covenant of grace are more excellent
then those of the Legall covenant. 5. They offered
often, and the repetition of sacrifices argued their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
and imperfection: but he offered but <hi>once,</hi> and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>not do it daily<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Heb.</hi> 7. 27. which argued the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. 6. They offered the blood of beasts
which could not expiate sinne, nor wash the conscience
of the sinner farther then purifying the flesh: but he (not
with blood of bulls and goats, but) with his owne blood
entred once into the holy place having obtained an
<hi>eternall redemption, Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and this blood purgeth
the <hi>conscience from dead works,</hi> verse 14. 7. They ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in an <hi>earthly fading Sanctuary</hi> made with hands,
and entred into an holy place which perished and fayled,
according to that elementary and temporary worship:
but he is minister of the true Sanctuary and Tabernacle
which the <hi>Lord pitcht and not man, Heb.</hi> 8. 2. this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
is his owne blessed body in which he performed
all his service, called, chap. 9. 11. <hi>a great and more perfect
Tabernacle not made with hands,</hi> and vers. 24. is now
entred <hi>not into holy places made with hands,</hi> but into the
very Heaven to appeare in the sight of God for us.
8. They all ceased, dyed, one succeeded another; as
mutable was their whole service, which also ceased and
deceased, and gave place to the truth of it when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of time came: but this true <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> being
without beginning or end of daies, hath an <hi>eternall
Priesthood, Heb.</hi> 7. 24. and therefore neither hath nor
needeth any successor in earth. Whence every repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his sacrifice bloodily or unbloodily in the Masse
is an high and hatefull blasphemy, a denyall of Christs
person to be above the person of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> and of
his sacrifice to be above <hi>Aarons,</hi> or that it was offered
by the eternall spirit of his Deity.</p>

                  <hi>Melchizedek</hi> because he was
but <hi>likened to the Sonne of God, Heb.</hi> 7. 3. could not offer
a Sacrifice to take away sinne: he must be the Sonne of
God indeed, and God himselfe that must doe that. The
least sinne which wee account so light could never be
expiated, but by the blood of him that is God as well as
man. All created strength cannot stand under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the least sinne. Therefore in the worthinesse of
this person see the unworthinesse of thy sinne to hate
and abhorre it, and thy selfe in dust and ashes for it.
An haynous and execrable offence were that which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could take away but the death of the Prince.</p>

dead womb when it was not with her as with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

who are taught to say; Our father, &amp;c. The onely true

Which Prophecy cannot be understood of <hi>Salomon;</hi> for

and verse 5. they shall feare him <hi>so long as the Sunne and

<hi>all Kings shall worship him</hi> and serve him: and, vers. 17.
his name shall be <hi>for ever:</hi> all these are true in Christ
onely. Thus as <hi>Isaac</hi> was founder of a mighty state: so

by <hi>Herod, Mat. 2. 3. Isaac</hi> carryed the wood of the
burnt offering upon his shoulders even to mount
Moriah, <hi>Gen. 22. 6:</hi> So Christ carryed the Crosse on
which he was to be nayled, even to Golgotha. 4. <hi>Isaac</hi>
was led away as a Lamb to the slaughter: So Christ was
led away, <hi>Ioh</hi> 19. 16. to death. 5. <hi>Isaac</hi> without reply
submitted himself to his father even to the death; suffered
himselfe to be bound on the wood, and yeelds himselfe a
burnt offering unto the Lord: Even so Christ without
reply was obedient unto his father unto the death, and
was content to be bound, not as <hi>Isaac</hi> for himselfe alone,
but for us and them; and laid downe his life a whole
burt offering, and a ransome for many, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 28. Thus

3. Neither of them must be offered every where or

body it selfe; and these two hills, if they be not one and

but that Golgotha was the skirt of Moriah) yet could
they not be farre distant, the one being within the gate
of the City, and the other not farre without, the nearest
to the City of all. 4. The Father layes first the wood
upon both, and then both upon the wood, both must
feele the weight of the wood, no small wood to burne
a man, a whole burnt offering as <hi>Isaac:</hi> but the wood
which Christ bore was farre heavier.<note place="margin">Ob molis mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudinem. Ob peccatorum molem.</note> 1. For the
greatnesse of the burthen. 2. For the burthensome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our sinnes, <hi>Isay 53. 4. he bare all our diseases.</hi> And
then both by Gods appoyntment were bound on the
wood, fastened hand and foot, not that either was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
but to retaine the manner appointed for sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
5. <hi>Isaac</hi> must be offered alone, the servants must
stay at the foot of the hill a farre off, little knowing the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18740:24"/>
businesse and sorrow in hand: So Christ must <hi>tread the
Winepresse alone, Isa.</hi> 63. 3. the Disciples feare and fly, and
little consider the agony of their Master. 6. The
Father carryes in his hand the sword and fire against his
owne sonne; the sword signifying the justice of God, the
fire his burning wrath against the sinnes of men: Both
bent against Christ, both sustained by this <hi>Isaac;</hi> in
whom the justice of God is satisfied, and the flame of his
wrath extinct and quenched.</p>
               <p>IV. In his scape and deliverance. 1. The blow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
is a fetching but <hi>Abraham</hi> must hold his had, <hi>Isaacs</hi>
flesh must not be pierced or cut: The souldiers ready to
breake the legges of Christ (as of the two theeves) must
stay their hands; not a bone of him must be broken.
2. <hi>Isaac</hi> offred, and three dayes dead in his fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and minde, yet dyed not, but his Father received
him as from the dead: so Christ offered upon his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dyed not, and his humanity dead in the belly of the
earth, after three dayes he revived, and raysed himselfe
againe to die no more. So both were delivered from
death the third day:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> wherein the Apostle plainely
makes him a type, <hi>Heb. 11. 19. from whence he received
him as</hi> in a type or resemblance, that is, to be a type or
resemblance of Christs resurrection from death. 3. The
Ramme that was offered for <hi>Isaac</hi> was caught by the
head among the thornes, and hanged in a bush: Christ
our sacrifice was hanged on a tree, crowned with thornes,
and so hung on the Crosse to expiate our sinnes compared
to thorns and bryers, which would for ever have held
us, if they had not held him.</p>
               <p>V. In his mariage. 1. <hi>Rebekah</hi> was faire and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
beautifull:<note place="margin">Similitude of <hi>Rebekahs</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Churches.</note> so the Church is faire in the beauty of Christ,
and faire within. 2. Shee was of his owne kinred
and flesh, <hi>Gen. 24. 4:</hi> so Christs spouse is of the same flesh
which himselfe assumed. 3. She was wooed by his
fathers servants, and brought forwards toward <hi>Isaac:</hi> so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18740:25"/>
the Church is wooed by pastors and Preachers the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ, and so brought forwards by his friends
towards the bridegroome. 4. She resolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all her friends and comforts to come to <hi>Isaac:</hi> so the
Church forsakes all in affection and actually, being called
to enjoy her head and husband Jesus Christ. 5. She
decks her self with jewels and trims her selfe before she
comes to <hi>Isaac,</hi> but covers all with a vaile: so the Church
prepares her selfe as a Bride for a Bridegroome, trimms
her selfe with faith and graces as Jewells, but covers and
vailes all with humility, modesty, shame facenesse, as not
worthy to be seene, much lesse matched to such an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.<note place="margin">How Christ meets his Church.</note>
6. In her comming towards <hi>Isaac, Isaac</hi> meets
her: so the Church comming towards Christ he meets
her afarre off, 1. by his grace of election, 2. by his most

and power at the last Judgement for her finall salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I. In the type and truth note a patterne by
which to frame our obedience,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. A patterne of obedience.</note> 
                  <hi>Phil. 2. 8. Let the same
minde bee in us that was in them.</hi> 1. To bee humbly
obedient unto our father as they. 2. Having never
so difficult a Commandement. As <hi>Abraham</hi> rose
early to obey God; and <hi>Isaac</hi> as early to obey his
Father; and Christ was content early in the morning to
bee prosecuted to death: so let not us procrastinate, but
hasten to our duty, especially to our sacrifices of prayer
and prayses early in the morning. <hi>Psal.</hi> 108. 2. 3. As
<hi>Abraham</hi> in offering, nor <hi>Isaac</hi> in obeying consulted not
with flesh and blood, acquainted neither <hi>Sarah</hi> nor the
servants, nor consulted with humane wisdome to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
obedience: no more must we in our obedience. So
<hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 1. 16. professeth of himselfe that he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
not with flesh and blood after he had a calling. If
flesh and blood will object any thing against obedience,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18740:25"/>
and extoll it selfe against the knowledge of God, bring
it captive into the obedience of Christ, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 5.
4. Obey in suffering, as well as in doing; dayly take
up our crosse (as both they carried the wood of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering)
and not repine nor reply. We must not thinke
that by carrying our crosse wee can performe the worke
of our redemption,<note place="margin">Non ad <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> for to that end it was carried by
Christ onely; yet we must carry it so farre forth as he is
a patterne for our imitation, yea that we may be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the image of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. 5. For the
measure, sticke not at heavy crosses and burthens, they
carried heavy loads of wood. Wee must not love our
lives to the death, if God call us therto. For both they
were obedient unto the death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. Such a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is given of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 11. they loved not
their lives unto the death.</p>
               <p>Now thus to frame our obedience are required two
rules.<note place="margin">Two rules for our obedience.</note> I. A change and renovation of our crooked
and corrupt nature, which is ever rebelling against the
law of the minde. Nothing (wee say) is hard to good
will: But this good will is not to bee found but in such
as are regenerate by the Spirit of God, who hath made
it of an unwilling, a willing will. And till this change
be made every commandement is impossible, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
yoke. Let Christ give the same commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the young man, and to the disciples, of leaving
all and following him, it is an impossible taske to the
one, yet in his naturall estate, but an easie yoke to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who with the commandement receive some secret
power to draw them to obedience. Let the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
an angry, furious, naturall man to forgive his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that wrongs him, and blesse him that curseth him,
and doe good for evill, and recompence love for hatred:
Oh this is an impossible commandement, and flesh and
blood cannot possibly brooke it; and indeed he must be
more then flesh and blood that can heare it, hee must
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18740:26"/>
have a spirit subduing his will unto the will of God.
Let God speake (as hee did to <hi>Abraham)</hi> to a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted:
Offer me up now, not thy sonne, but thy sin,
thy deare lusts; thy Usury, thy revenge, swearing, lying,
thy <hi>Herodias,</hi> thy <hi>Dalilah,</hi> thy darling, thy pride; take
the knife into thy hand, and with thine owne hands kill
it, sacrifice it, let out the life blood of it: Oh what
grutching, gainsaying, rising up against the word, and him
by whom God commandeth? Every naturall mans sin
is his <hi>Isaac,</hi> his childe, his best beloved, his joy and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
hee cannot spare him, hee cannot part with him.
Though the Lord bee in never so great haste and earnest,
they bee not so hasty as to rise up with <hi>Abraham,</hi> early
in the morning to offer up their sinnes; a plaine evidence
that as yet their nature was never changed, but they are
in their sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule II.</hi> In dangerous, and difficult, or costly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
propp up thy faith with consideration of
Gods power and truth. So did <hi>Abraham</hi> in this difficult
commandement; when hee might have considered of a
thousand strong hinderances, he strengthened his faith by
this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19. hee considered that God was able to
raise him up even from the dead, whence after a sort hee
received him. Thus he supported his faith in that word
of promise, <hi>Rom. 4. 20, 21. hee considered not Sarahs dead
body, but was fully assured that God (whom hee beleeved,
who quickeneth the dead, verse 17.) who had promised,
was also able to doe it.</hi> These two props upheld him, even
the full assurance of Gods truth in promises, and power
in performing them. In duties of apparant danger, the
casting an eye on Gods truth and power will bring them
forward, else they never come on, <hi>Dan. 3. 17. Our God is
able to deliver us, and hee will;</hi> but if not, &amp;c. So in the
time of danger and deepe distresse, cast thy selfe on the
might and truth of God, who quickneth the dead, who
can say to the dead, live, and they shall live. In duties
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18740:26"/>
chargeable, if thy obedience must cost thee some part,
or the whole of thy estate, looke on Gods power and
goodnesse. So the Prophet to <hi>Amaziah, 2. Chron.</hi> 25. 9.
what shall we doe for the hundreth talents? <hi>The Lord
is able to give thee more then this. Object.</hi> But I know
not whether he will. <hi>Sol.</hi> Faith assures it selfe there is
never any losse in obeying God. It knows, the way to
keepe <hi>Isaac,</hi> is to give up <hi>Isaac.</hi> It hath a promise, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
forsaketh house, lands, &amp;c. for Christ, hee shall
have an hundreth fold.</p>
               <p>II. In both we have a notable type of our resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. A type of our resurrection.</note>
                  <hi>Isaac</hi> was raised the third day, as from the dead:
but Christ indeed raised, not as <hi>Isaac</hi> for himselfe, but
as an head for his body and members. Which assureth us,
1. That wee shall rise out of all pety deaths and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
for our head is aboue water. Though the billowes
of afflictions inward and outward may rinse us, and run
over us, yet they shall not drowne us because our head
is aloft. They may threaten and affright us, but shall not
drowne and destroy us; we shall wade out well enough,
because they can never goe over our head any more.
2. That we shall at the last day rise from all the death
of mortality and corruption; in which argument the
Apostle is large to proove, that because <hi>Christ the head is
risen,</hi> the members must also rise againe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12.
For, 1. Can or will a living and powerfull head be
alwayes dismembred and sundred from the body?
2. Because Christ rose not as a private person as <hi>Isaac</hi>
did, but as the <hi>first fruits</hi> of them that slept, <hi>verse</hi> 20.
3. Because Christ in his resurrection is opposed to the
first <hi>Adam, verse 21:</hi> For as by the first <hi>Adam</hi> comes
death on all; so by the second <hi>Adam</hi> resurrection from
the dead. This is a sure propp and stay against all the
miseries and occurrences of this life, and against the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of death, and horrour of the grave, that we are
assured of a better resurrection, else were wee of all men
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18740:27"/>
most miserable, <hi>verse</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>III. A sweet consolation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Matter of sweet consolation.</note> God watched every
motion in both these <hi>Isaacs</hi> offering; how farre <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
should goe, how long, to the lifting up of the knife;
and where he should stay; and when was fit to say, doe
the boy no hurt: So hee watched the executioners, the
crucifiers, how farre they should proceed with Christ,
but stayed them from breaking his bones, and kept him
from seeing corruption. So when Gods time and terme
is come, the affliction and afflicter shall goe no farther; a
voice at length shall come, and say: Stay thy hand, doe
him no hurt.</p>
               <p>IV. Both were delivered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Looke for help, though the case be desperate.</note> but not till the third day;
the one when the knife was up, the other being dead
and hopelesse, at least in the account of men, as appeared
by the words of the <hi>disciples</hi> which were <hi>going to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus.</hi>
Hence wee learne to make this use for the
strengthening of our faith:<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> Then to looke for helpe and
deliverance when the case is desperate, and in humane
sence we are gone. There is life in this comfort, which
assureth us of life, even in death, as <hi>Hos. 6. 2. After two
dayes he will revive us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the third day he will raise us
up, and wee shall live in his sight.</hi> In all wants and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
let <hi>Abrahams</hi> voice to <hi>Isaac</hi> comfort thee:
<hi>God will provide.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deus providebit.</note> If <hi>Isaac</hi> see <hi>Abrahams</hi> sword in the
one hand, and fire in the other ready to deuoure him, yet
a little while and the sword shall bee put up, and the
fire shall take another object. So the faithfull sonnes of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> seeing God the Fathers sword of justice
drawne against them, and the fire of his fury ready to
consume them, yet at length shall see by Christ the
sword put up, and the fire of wrath turned againe into a
flame of love and grace. Faith hath a cheerefull voice:
God will prouide. Unbeleefe is full of repinings and
murmurings: Oh how should I be prouided for, in this
or that? I see no meanes, &amp;c. Here the difference holds
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18740:27"/>
which was betweene the <hi>ten spies</hi> and <hi>the two, Num.</hi> 13.
If thou see not the meanes for thy deliverance, goe to
the Mountaine there is a Ramme for <hi>Isaac:</hi> hasten thy
obedience, and God which set thee on worke, will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
thy deliverance.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. In his actions. 1. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sent by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to visite his brethren in the wildernesse:<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 15.</note> So was
Christ sent to seeke his brethren wandring in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
he was sent to the lost sheepe of <hi>Israel.</hi> 2. As
at thirty yeares,<note place="margin">Gen. 41 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> was preferred to his Office by
<hi>Pharaoh:</hi> So at thirty yeares Christ entred his Office.
3. As by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a virgin was given <hi>Ioseph</hi> to wife,
<hi>verse 45:</hi> So in the Church as a pure Virgin given by
the Father to Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 37.</note> as his Spouse to sanctifie and
save: All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me:
and him that commeth to me<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> I will in no wise cast out.
4. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> garners feeds all Egypt,
all his fathers house, and the nations; whence in <hi>Gen.
49.</hi> 24. he is called <hi>the feeder of Israel,</hi> and a <hi>stone,</hi> that
is, a <hi>rocke</hi> or refuge to his brethren: So Jesus Christ is
the feeder of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of all the family of God in all
Nations of the earth, not with temporall food onely,
but with the Manna from heaven, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and his owne flesh and blood, the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
and indeficient bread and water of life. 5. As
<hi>Ioseph</hi> in his lowest estate was both a Lord in the prison,
and a comforter of the prisoners, assuring the Butler of
his life, and recovery of his place: So Jesus Christ at
his lowest abasement, was Lord over death and the
grave, having command of them, and his last breath on
the Crosse all most comforted the poore thiefe promising
him both life and glory. 6. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> doth all the
good he can for his brethren that had ill deserved it: For
1. Hee teacheth them how to live together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
brotherly love and concord,<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>fall not out by the way.</hi>
2. Teacheth them how to speake to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and what
to demand. 3. Goes to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and speaks, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
for them whatsoever he would, and placeth them
in <hi>Goshen</hi> the far of the land, till they come to <hi>Canaan:</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18740:28"/>
So Jesus Christ above all lessons commended to us the
new Commandement of love, a badge of his disciples;
teacheth us how to pray, and what, in the Lords prayer;
himselfe intercedes for us, and obtaineth all that good is,
and provides for us in earth till we come to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. In his sufferings and passions. 1. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
grieved him, <hi>Gen</hi> 49. 23. that is, not his Mistris
onely and Master, but his brethren also conspire against
him, although sent from his father in love, and comes in
love to see how they doe, and to know their wants; yet
they scorn him, behold yonder dreamer comes; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
to kill him, let us kill him and see what will become
of his dreames: So Jesus Christ came among his owne,
sent from his Father in love, pitying the wandrings and
wants of men; but the Jews scorne him for a deceiver,
plot to kill him, conspire against his life. 2. As his
brethren sold him for twenty pieces, stript him naked,
cast him into a pit, sent him as a slave into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
hee (being indeed free) became a servant: So Jesus
Christ in his infancy was sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> sold by the
Jews for thirty pieces, stript naked of his apparrell, and
in the forme of a servant cast into the pit of death and
the grave, whence they thought never to have heard
more of him, as <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren did. 3. As in this
service <hi>Ioseph</hi> was tempted to whoredome by his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Mistris when they were alone, and that often and
dayly; but by strength of grace stoutly resisted, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
her and himselfe: So was Jesus Christ in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of his Ministery strongly assailed by Satan to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
whoredome when he was alone in the wildernesse,
and that often set upon; yet by the power of the Spirit
overcame and conquered, so as the evill one found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him. 4. As in this service (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his faithfulnesse and innocency) <hi>Ioseph</hi> was falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
condemned, cast into prison with the Butler and

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18740:29"/>
falsely accused, they lay things to his charge he
never knew, as falsely condemned, bound yea fastened
to the Crosse betweene the thieves, and cast into the
grave as into a prison, till the time of his deliverance
came, that he was taken out <hi>from prison and judgement,</hi>
as <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> IV. In his advancement and preferment. For,
1. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> was <hi>separate from his brethren, Gen.</hi> 49. 26.
that is, advanced by God to honour above them all: So
Christ was separate and advanced in glory above men
and Angels, <hi>Heb. 1. 4. hath obtained a farre more excellent
name then the Angels.</hi> 2. Though <hi>Ioseph</hi> was shot at
by the archers, yet his arme was strengthened, the bonds
and fetters were loosed, and he not onely brought out of
prison, but advanced to bee Lord over the whole land,
and next unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> having all administration delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him: So Jesus Christ, although he was a But or
signe of contradiction<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> yet his arme was strengthened to
raise himselfe out of the grave, to loose all chaines of sin,
to loose all sorrowes of death, and being ris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him in heaven and earth, his throne set next unto his
Fathers, the Lord of his Church, and ruler of the whole
earth, to him is committed the governement, and his
<hi>bounds are the utmost hills, Psalm.</hi> 2. yea the whole
Church in heaven and earth is his to whom all power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
3. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> every way honoured <hi>Ioseph;</hi>
As 1. He richly decks and attires him, puts a golden
chaine on his necke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 42. 2. They must cry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, <hi>Abrech,</hi> that is, every man must bow to him.
3. Every man must depend on his word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 55.
Goe to <hi>Ioseph</hi> (saith <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> and what he faith to you,
doe yee: So God the Father hath highly exalted his
Sonne Jesus, and given him not onely the rich robes of
immortality and glory, but a Name above all names, that
at his Name every knee shall bowe. He appointed not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18740:29"/>
                  <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> onely to be his fore-runner to make way for
him, but all the Apostles and Evangelists cry before him
Abrech. Yea all faithfull pastours and teachers whose
office is to bring men to stoope under the subjection of
Jesus Christ. Yea he hath given his Sonne plenary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to governe his kingdome, and commands us, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ioseph</hi> to heare him.</p>
               <p>I. From the type and truth learn.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. No newes for good men to be hated for their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</note> It is no new thing
for the best men to be hated and wronged for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and innocency. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was therefore hated of his
brethren, because <hi>most loved of his Father, Gen.</hi> 37. 4. Christ
was hated because he was the light, and gave witnesse
unto it. This is a certaine truth, if God will testifie to a
man, the world will testifie against him, whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are contrary to his. If God will advance a man in
grace, the world will depresse him. If God be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to <hi>Moses, Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> his brother and
sister will hate him. If <hi>David</hi> be respected, <hi>Saul</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
him. Who can stand before envy? not naturall bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
No marvaile if men say as of old: If we let this
man alone all men will beleeve in him. Well: an evill
eye is a signe of an evill man, that dares in his thoughts
check the Almighty for doing with his owne as he will.
And a good man cannot expect a surer confirmation in
goodnesse, then to be hated for it; as in our type and
truth. Let us on the contrary there love most where God
sheweth most love: nor let any <hi>Ioseph</hi> leave his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for the hatred of the brethren.</p>
               <p>II. All the sufferings of Gods children are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
and ordered by him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. All sufferings of the godly come of God. Ordained by him.</note> 1. They are ordayned
by God. So in the type <hi>Ioseph</hi> sees Gods decree: It was
not you, but God sent me afore you. So did the true
<hi>Ioseph:</hi> It is not thou <hi>Pilate</hi> that couldst have any power
over me, unlesse it were given from above, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 11.
and <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27. 28. against thy holy Sonne Jesus, <hi>Herod,
Pontius Pilate,</hi> with the Gentiles, and the people of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18740:30"/>
Israel gathered themselves together, to doe whatsoever
thy hand and counsell had determined. Let not us looke
so much at mens malice as at Gods decree. So did <hi>David</hi>
when he said; <hi>Shimei</hi> curseth because the Lord hath bid
him curse <hi>David, 2. Sam.</hi> 16. 10. If for brethren wee find
enemies, let us say as <hi>Ioseph;</hi> It was not you, God hath an
hand in it.<note place="margin">Ordered, and how.</note> 2. Our suffrings are ordered by God.
1. For their measure, as in the type; Come, say they, let
us kill the dreamer, but they could not: So in the truth;
come let us kill the heire, and then the inheritance shall
be ours; let us bury him, and lay stones, and watch and
seale, yet with all these they could not keepe him under.
Feare not evill men, they shall not doe as much as they
will, but as God will. 2. For the end, they cannot
frustrate the counsell of God, nor his dreames. Neither
Gods glory nor <hi>Iosephs</hi> preferment can be prevented: So
the Jewes, Let us put this seducer to death, and we shall
well shift our hands of him, what will become of his
doctrine, of his Disciples: But all turned to his greater
exaltation, as <hi>Iosephs.</hi> Conclude hence, that all the hatred
of evill men, unjust accusations, false sentences, cruell
executions shall not hurt, but one way or other set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our truest good. As both <hi>Iosephs</hi> and Christs turne
to their greatest advancement, both their innocencies
breake out as the light. And innocency is innocency, and
will be so knowne, and shall be as the Sunne at noone
day.</p>
               <p>III. A singular comfort.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Comfort by Christ our <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
manifold.</note> Is Christ the true <hi>Ioseph</hi>
our brother? Hee will 1. know us when we know not
him, as <hi>Ioseph.</hi> He will love us before we can love him,
he will love us when we shall not know it, his bowels
will earne within him towards us, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 9. as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
and yet knowne.</hi> He is a stone of refuge to all his
brethren, and though he be rough for a while and try us
with temptations and afflictions of sundry sorts as <hi>Ioseph</hi>
did, yet he will at length make himselfe knowne to bee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18740:30"/>
                  <hi>Ioseph;</hi> he will say, I am <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I am Jesus your brother.
2. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> tooke order that his brethren should bee
washed in his house, and set at his owne table: So our
<hi>Ioseph</hi> washeth us in cleaner water, even the pure
streames of his blood, and makes us cleane by the water
of sanctification, sealing it to us in baptisme, and after
feeds us at his owne table, and sets before us the bread
and water of life, as in the sacrament of the Supper.
3. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> sent his brethren home with victualls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money, and with Chariots and all necessaries for
their journey till they came againe to be fully provided
for by him: so our <hi>Ioseph</hi> furnisheth us in this our journey
and travell with all necessaries without our money or
merits, untill we come to dwell with him, and he be all
in all unto us. 4. As when <hi>Iacob</hi> and his sonnes
came into Aegypt, and at that joyfull meeting of Father
and all the sonnes, <hi>Ioseph</hi> went out to meet them: So our
<hi>Ioseph</hi> meets us now in our way by his grace and spirit:
and at that great meeting of all his brethren shall make
ready the clouds as his Chariot, and come in person in
state, and we shall meet the Lord in the ayre and be ever
with him.</p>
               <p>IV. As <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren behaved themselves to
him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Do to Christ as <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to him.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 17. So let us behave our selves to Christ.
1. Humble our selves, bee ashamed that we have so
wronged our brother, pray for pardon; and as it is in
<hi>Zachery,</hi> looke upon him whom we (that is our sinnes)
have pearced; and lament and be sorry for him, as one
mourneth for his onely sonne. 2. Honour him. All
our sheafes must bow to his; he hath that extraordinary
blessing from above and below, the blessing of his father
is strong with the blessing of his Elders, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 26.
Christ is blessed in himselfe, and in his posterity in all
ages. 3. Depend on him for food as they, and say
with <hi>Peter, Ioh. 6. 68. Master to whom shall we goe? thou
hast the words of eternall life;</hi> and for all supplyes apply
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18740:31"/>
that to him which is spoken of <hi>Ioseph, Gen. 50. 19. Is not
he for us under God?</hi> 4. Let his gracious promises
comfort and feede us, as <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren were <hi>comforted</hi>
by his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 21. 5. Offer him such gifts as wee
have, prayer, prayses, duty, endeavour. Be encouraged,
<hi>Ioseph</hi> will <hi>accept</hi> small and meane gifts from brethren,
although he need them not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 15. Our <hi>Ioseph</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
not a graine of grace, not smoaking flax.</p>

                  <hi>Deut. 18. 18. A Prophet
will I raise up like unto thee:</hi> Here is a similitude
a likenesse, no parity no equality. This is the difference:
Christ is worthy of more glory then <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 3. 3.
For <hi>Moses</hi> was meere man: Christ <hi>God</hi> as well as man.
Christ the <hi>builder</hi> of Gods house, <hi>Moses</hi> but a <hi>stone</hi> in it.
Christ a <hi>sonne</hi> in the house: <hi>Moses</hi> but a <hi>servant.</hi> Christ
the Lord of his owne house being the Church: <hi>Moses</hi> a
servant in his Lords house. Now let us see wherein the
similitude is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I. In his person and estate. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> was of
meane parents and birth: So was Christ of a poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
and dryed stocke, and borne of a poore Virgin,
who at her purification brought <hi>a payre of Doves,</hi> a
gift appointed for poore persons, Luk. 2. 24. Whereas
rich folkes must bring a Lamb of a yeare old, Lev. 12. 6.
2. <hi>Moses</hi> was no sooner borne but he was exposed to
the cruelty of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and sought out to death:
So Christ in his infancy was sought by <hi>Herod</hi> to bee.
slaine. But both by Gods extraordinary and especiall
providence saved and delivered, that both might bee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18740:31"/>
saviours and deliverers, the one by her whose sonne he
was reputed, the other by him whose sonne he was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
3. <hi>Moses</hi> was a <hi>shepheard,</hi> he kept the sheepe
of <hi>Iethro</hi> his father in law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. and while <hi>Moses</hi>
was in that private estate, wee read of little concerning
his life expressed till he was fourty yeares old: So Christ
was a shepheard sent to seeke and save the lost sheepe
of his Fathers fold, of whose private life wee read as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as of <hi>Moses</hi> till he was thirty yeares old. 4. <hi>Moses</hi>
was of a most meeke and sweet disposition above al men
living, yet full of zeale and indignation against sin, as at
the erecting of the calfe, <hi>Exod. 32:</hi> So Christ a patterne
of meekenesse: Learne of me for I am meeke; but
most zealous and earnest at the abuse of the Temple,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>II. In his office and function. 1. Both appointed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
by God.<note place="margin">Office of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and of Christ.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> sent and raysed to deliver Israel out of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> bondage: Christ sent to deliver all the Israell of
God from the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of hell, and all his oppression of
sinne, curse, damnation, the most heavy taskes and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
<hi>Moses</hi> was appoynted to lead Israell towards
Canaan: So Christ to lead the Church the Israell of God,
into heaven. And whereas <hi>Moses</hi> was to lead them but
into the sight of Canaan, and the borders: Our <hi>Moses</hi>
leads us into the heavenly Canaan, and gives us posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
2. Both were furnished by God to their office.
1. <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in all the learning of Aegypt:
Christ was learned to admiration. His enemies asked,
whence hath he all this great learning? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 15. And,
Never man spake like this man. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 46. And at twelve
yeares old he sate among the Doctors conferring with
them, <hi>Luk. 2. 46. 2. Moses</hi> was furnished with many
mighty miracles, in Aegypt, in the red sea, and in the
wildernesse for the confirming of his calling: all types
of the miracles of Christ by sea and land, in townes and
deserts to manifest his glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 11. But with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18740:32"/>
Christ wrought, by his owne power: <hi>Moses</hi> by
Christ.<note place="margin">Execution faithfull for matter and manner.</note> 3. Both joyfully executed their office whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we consider the matter, or the manner. 1. For
the matter. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> brings glad tidings to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
of their deliverance out of Aegypt, and that from
God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 30. Christ brings from God the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of eternall salvation, and deliverance from the
spirituall Aegypt and bondage under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of hell to
all the elect of God. 2. <hi>Moses</hi> received from God
and delivered to his people the Law, and was a Mediator
betweene God and his people. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. the Law was
delivered <hi>in the hand of a Mediator:</hi> that is, <hi>Moses,</hi> as
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. Now <hi>Moses</hi> was Mediator of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Non redemptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, sed relationis.</note>
not a mediator of redemption, but of receiving the
law and delivering it to the people, standing betweene
God and them, as his mouth to them, and theirs to him:
But Christ our true <hi>Moses,</hi> 1. not onely receives the
Law, but fulfils it. 2. When <hi>Moses</hi> had broken the
tables, to shew how wee in our naturne had broken the
Law, our true <hi>Moses</hi> repaires it againe. 3. He writes
the Law not in tables of stone, but in the tables of the
hearts of beleevers. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. the Law was given by
<hi>Moses,</hi> but grace by Christ. <hi>Moses</hi> could not pearce the
heart, nor supply grace to keep the Law. 4. He is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of a new Covenant, and surety of a better testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and 9. 15. 3. <hi>Moses</hi> gives Israel an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
patterne of the Tabernacle, and all the utensils to the
very least pinns about it: But our <hi>Moses</hi> delivers a perfect
doctrin from heaven, and certaine and perpetual rules for
the worship of God to his Church and the wel ordering
of it even in the smallest things. And as nothing was left
which must not be framed to the patterne seene in the
mount: So hath not Christ left the worship of God in
whole or part, in great or small matters to the liberty
of men; for then he should have beene lesse faithfull then
<hi>Moses. 4. Moses</hi> instituted the Passeover and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18740:32"/>
from God, offers the blood of beasts, sprinkles the
houses of the Israelites with the blood of the Lambe,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 12. by which they were saved from a temporall
death, and the revenging Angell: But Christ the true
<hi>Moses</hi> instituted the supper of the Lord, sacrificeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
offers his owne blood being the Paschall Lambe,
who purgeth and saveth from death eternall. And as that
house onely was exempted which was sprinkled with
the blood of the Lamb:<note place="margin">Dum extendebat manus Moses, prae se <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

assured onely where the blood of Christ is sprinkled,
and apprehended by faith. 5. <hi>Moses</hi> prayeth for
Israel with his hands stretched out till the evening, and
while he prayeth, Israel overcommeth <hi>Amalek, Exod.</hi> 17.
At <hi>Moses</hi> prayer Gods wrath is turned away. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.
Christ stretcheth out his hands for the elect upon the
Crosse, and made intercession for them in earth, and now
continues so to doe in heaven; whereby we are both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to conquer our spirituall enemies, as also Gods
wrath is appeased, and grace and favour returned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
Thus, both for the matter faithfully discharged their
office in these five things. 2. For the manner contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the difference, it is in <hi>Heb. 3. 5. 6. Moses</hi> was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all the house of God as a servant: but Christ as the
sonne. <hi>Moses</hi> in his masters house: Christ in his owne
house. <hi>Moses</hi> by delegate authority: Christ by proper
power. <hi>Moses</hi> as a servant foretells his masters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
Christ declared the Lord present. <hi>Moses</hi> in types
and shadows: Christ in body and truth. <hi>Moses</hi> to one
nation the Jews: Christ taught all nations the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<hi>Moses</hi> doctrine accuseth, woundeth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 45.
Christs doctrine justifieth, healeth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. In his passion and suffering. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to deliver the Law,<note place="margin">Suffering of <hi>Moses</hi> and of Christ.</note> fasted forty dayes and forty
nights in the Mountaine alone: Christ being to preach
the Gospell fasted so long in the wildernesse alone. 2.
<hi>Moses</hi> comming armed with authority for the Hebrews
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18740:33"/>
good was rejected both in his person and doctrine
and message. The Hebrew could say, <hi>who made thee a
iudge? Exod.</hi> 2. 14. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will <hi>not hearken, Exod.
7.</hi> 4. Nay <hi>Pharaoh</hi> raged and oppressed the more: Our
true <hi>Moses</hi> comming to save the Jews sped no better;
for thus they protested aginst him, Wee have no King
but Caesar, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 15. And we will not have this man to
raigne over us. Yea his gracious words, and potent
works were still contemned and envyed by the wicked
Scribes and Pharisees, as at this day by all the wicked
in the world, and there is no stilling of the rage of the
Devill and his instruments where Christ is truely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
3. <hi>Moses</hi> refused to be called the sonne of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and left the Court of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be
partaker of the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s of Gods people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Christ
descended from the glory of Heaven to save his elect,
and to suffer with them, and for them as <hi>Moses</hi> could
not doe. Yea he tooke on him our infirmities and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and on earth refused his right to be a King when
they would have made him, because his Kingdome was
not of this world 4. Both were willing to dye at
Gods commandement, both went up into a mount to
dye; <hi>Moses</hi> on mount Abarim, Christ on Golgotha. Both
carefull to supply their absence to their people: <hi>Moses</hi>
by appoynting <hi>Ioshua</hi> his successor, Christ by sending
his spirit to lead his people into all truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> IV. In sundry particular actions. 1. <hi>Moses</hi>
lift up the Serpent in the wildernesse:<note place="margin">Actions of <hi>Moses</hi> and of Christ.</note> So was Christ
lift up, <hi>Ioh. 3. 14. 2. Moses</hi> obtained flesh in the
wildernesse to feede many thousands: So Christ in the
desert fed many thousands with a few loaves and fishes.
3. <hi>Moses</hi> marryed an Aethiopisse, a stranger, blacke:
Christ marrieth the Gentiles strangers, and in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium
of his Church it is said, I am black but comely,
<hi>Cant. 1. 4. 4. Moses</hi> sweetened the bitter waters
of Marah by the tree cast in, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 25. Christ swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18740:33"/>
our afflictions by the wood of his Crosse, <hi>Heb. 2. 10.
5. Moses</hi> was called a God; <hi>Aarons</hi> God for direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in things of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 16. and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> God,
<hi>Exod,</hi> 7. 1. for executing on him, as God, Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But Christ is indeed God, most wise in counsell,
most potent in revenge. 6. <hi>Moses</hi> delivered <hi>Israel</hi>
thorow the Red-sea by his Rod, <hi>Exod. 14:</hi> So Christ
his Church from death by his Crosse through the red-sea
of his blood. 7. Never was God so clearly seene by
the eye of flesh as to <hi>Moses,</hi> who talked face to face:
But never did creature see his face but Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18.
8. As <hi>Moses</hi> was transfigured on an hill, <hi>Sinai,</hi> and so
glorious as <hi>Israel</hi> could not behold his face: So was
Christ on mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> so as his disciples were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and wist not what they said. 9. As Christ after
death rose most gloriously: So <hi>Moses</hi> body after his
death was most gloriously raised, in which hee was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ on the Mount in his transfiguration,
<hi>Matth. 17. 2. 10. Moses</hi> face was covered with a
vaile: Our <hi>Moses</hi> with the vaile of his flesh hid the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Deity, and put on vilenesse instead of majesty
that men might behold him, and see, and heare him, and
beleeve.</p>
               <p>I. The doctrine of religion which wee teach is of
God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Our doctrine is of God.</note> 1. Wee teach no other then what <hi>Moses</hi>
taught, nor no other then what Jesus Christ taught, the
one being faithfull as a servant, the other as the sonne in
the house. For as there were not two Churches of the
old and new Testament: So is there but one faith, one
doctrine in substance, onely differing in manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
2. This doctrine was perfectly, fully, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delivered to the Church, seeing both were so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
If there be a doctrine of traditions unwritten; if
a doctrine of merits, of purgatory, of intercession of
Saints, then was Christ unfaithfull and did not reveale
the whole will of his Father. <hi>Paul</hi> a servant revealed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18740:34"/>
the whole will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. Was the Sonne lesse
faithfull? 3. This doctrine is fully and sufficiently
confirmed by many and mighty miracles both in <hi>Moses</hi>
the servant, and in Christ the Sonne, and being no new
doctrine, it needs no new miracles. It is too idle to call
for other miracles, when they cannot proove that wee
bring any other doctrine. If wee should bring in strange
and lying doctrines never knowen to <hi>Moses</hi> or Christ, as
they doe, wee would cast about for lying wonders, and
pretend fabulous miracles to prove them as they doe.</p>
               <p>II. Whatsoever office or function God sets thee
in,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Bee faithfull in doing thy office.</note> bee faithfull; so was <hi>Moses</hi> the servant; so was
Christ the Sonne. Hast thou an high place in Gods house
as <hi>Moses?</hi> be faithfull, see 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. Art thou but a
doore-keeper in Gods house? bee faithfull, in faithfull
performing of whatsoever God reveales to bee his will.
Hast thou received any talent? lay it out to thy Lords
advantage, else canst thou not bee faithfull. Let thy care
and study be to bee found not onely faultlesse, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all things according to thy Christian profession;
that faithfulnesse may bee thy praise and crowne in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
Ministery, private life, in the whole practise of
religion; and also thy comfort living and dying, when
the Lord shall witnesse unto thee as to <hi>Moses</hi> in his life
time, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 7, 8. and dead, <hi>Deut. 34. 5, 10. Moses</hi>
the servant of the Lord died, and there arose no such
Prophet.</p>
               <p>III. Labour to expresse the fruit of faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Shew faith in the fruit of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 11.
26.</hi> to preferre the state of Gods people above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profits and prerogatives; account the despised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Saints above the admired happinesse of
wicked men. <hi>Moses</hi> would joyne himselfe to them
when hee might have beene in the height of honour:
Christ would not be in heaven without them, but endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more affliction, then <hi>Moses</hi> could, to enjoy them.
Hence observe foure sorts of people that are not of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18740:34"/>
Christs nor of <hi>Moses</hi> minde. 1. Politicians, who
take the honour and profit of the Gospel, but will none
of the afflictions of Christ. 2. Proud persons, who
will not looke so low as on afflicted Christians.
3. Temporizer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>, that looke a squint on them if any suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for well-doing. 4. Scorners, that despise the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
and exercises of Gods people as too base company
and courses for them. Let all such know, 1. That
Christ in heaven scornes them not, nor withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from them, yea heaven would not please him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. 2. That the fellowship of a Kings Court,
such as <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> in riot, feasting, drinking, gaming, is
hatefull to a sound minde in comparison of the society
of the miserable and persecuted Saints, though a fleshly
eye cannot see it. 3. That it will be no great comfort
to beleeve the Communion of Saints and not enjoy it.
4. That they which despise it here shall never enjoy it
in heaven.</p>
               <p>4. In the type and truth wee have a sure argument
of our resurrection.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Assurance of our resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> dead body, hid in the valley
of <hi>Moab,</hi> none knew where, appeared glorious on the
hill <hi>Thabor,</hi> in Christs transfiguration: Christs body hid
in the grave comes forth glorious, and ascends glorious
on mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> Both teach that our bodies are not
lost but laid up, and as sure as laid downe in basenesse,
shall rise in glory.</p>

who makes way to both.<note place="margin">Calling.</note> 2. Both guides going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods people. The type to the earthly Canaan: the
truth to the heavenly. 3. Both led them into the land.
<hi>Ioshua</hi> led the people not onely toward the land, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the promised land. What was denied to <hi>Moses,</hi> was
granted to <hi>Ioshua. Moses</hi> might not enter, nor those
that had disobeyed; but <hi>Ioshua</hi> entreth, and taketh pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
for himselfe, and for all the people: So our <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
hath taken possession, and led us into the possession
of our heavenly Canaan. What <hi>Moses</hi> Law could not
doe for our infirmity, Christ by his Gospel hath done
for us. That may shew us the way: but this brings us
to the wayes end, and gives us all our promised expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus our <hi>Ioshua</hi> carries us through from this
wildernesse to our rest. 4. Both divided the land,
and allotted to every man his portion. <hi>Ioshua</hi> having

1. <hi>Ioshua</hi> being to passe over <hi>Iordan</hi> divides
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18740:35"/>
the waters, and they gave way unto him: Christ in the
same <hi>Iordan</hi> divides the heavens, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 16. and they
testifie unto him, <hi>verse 17. Ioshua</hi> divides waters, but
he ascribes it to the power of the Lord of all the world,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 13. But our true <hi>Ioshua</hi> being that Lord and
God of all the world, by his owne power commanded
the seas and they obeyed him. 2. <hi>Ioshua</hi> becompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and the long blast of rammes
hornes overthrew the walls of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. Our <hi>Ioshua</hi>
by as weake and vile meanes in the eye of flesh, even
by the sound and blast of the Gospel shakes downe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the high and thick walls of the Devill and Antichrists
kingdome, and of the <hi>Iericho</hi> of this world, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the people of God in their passage to Canaan. By
the preaching of the Gospel, typified by the sound of the
Trumpets, our <hi>Ioshua</hi> overthrowes the wisedome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
seeming sanctity, and whatsoever strength of flesh is
opposed to the power of the Gospel. 3. Whilst <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
was destroying the enemies of God, the Sunne in
the heavens at his word stood still, and stayed his course
as a willing spectatour of that businesse, and deferred
the night lest hee should want day to smite his enemies
in, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 12. So our <hi>Ioshua</hi> whilst on the Crosse hee
was spoiling principalities and powers, and opening the
way to Canaan, commanded the Sunne to stopp his
course, and hide his face, to witnesse to all the world
the great worke in hand that day. Of both these dayes
may be verified, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 14. there was never before day

1. <hi>Ioshua</hi> was the Judge and Captaine of Gods people,
the leader of his Armies,<note place="margin">Vterque magnus miraculis, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus triumphis. Ambr. de offic. lib. 2. cap. 20.</note> the mighty conquerour of all

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 24. nay made his men of warre set their feete

and in small time had slaine one and thirty Kings with

by that. Even all the gates of hell, the rage of Satan,
the power of sinne, the allurements of the world, whole
armies of temptations, a troupe of pleasures, honours,
profits on one hand, a whole band of crosses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
on the other, a legion of lusts within our
selves. But our <hi>Ioshua</hi> the mighty Captaine not onely of
the Lords hosts, but who is the Lord of hosts, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to sit on a white horse, whose name is called
Faithfull and true; and hee judgeth and fighteth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 11. Hee hath valiantly triumphed over
all enemies, spoyled principalities and powers, set his
foot on their necks, troden Satan under his feet, and
made us tread him under our feet too. If <hi>Ioshua</hi> have
slaine one and thirty Kings; Our <hi>Ioshua</hi> hath slaine so
many thousand commanders. 2. By meanes of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuas</hi>
faithfulnesse and fortitude not one word failed of
all the good things which the Lord had said unto <hi>Israel,</hi>
but all came to passe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 45. and 23. 14. So by
meanes of our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> all the promises of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
heaven and happinesse are accomplished, which are
all in him Yea and Amen. Heaven and earth may faile,
but not one jote of Gods promise but this <hi>Ioshua</hi> will
see it accomplished.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> V. In sundry actions. 1. <hi>Ioshua</hi> saved <hi>Rahabs</hi>
house that had the red cord hung out at the window,<note place="margin">Actions.</note>
because they had saved the Spies, <hi>Chap. 6:</hi> So Christ
saves every penitent sinner that expresseth faith in his
blood, and love to the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God, especially his
Ministers and Seers. 2. Hee graciously accepted the
<hi>Gibeonites,</hi> when they humbly sued and intreated peace
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18740:36"/>
of him: So a broken and a contrite heart our true <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
never despised. Hee that offers repentant sinners
grace before they seeke it, when they seeke it will not
deny it. 3. When God by <hi>Ioshua</hi> had wrought that
great miracle of stopping up the river <hi>Iordan,</hi> till they
passed over, <hi>Chap. 4. 2. Ioshua</hi> commmanded twelve
men of <hi>Israel</hi> to gather twelve stones out of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and
set them up memorialls of Gods great acts to all posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
So our <hi>Ioshua</hi> having wrought many mighty mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
for the confirmation of his holy doctrine, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
twelve men his twelve disciples by the preaching of
the Gospel, to erect through all the world<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> a monument
and memory of the wondrous workes of the Sonne of

the enemies of <hi>Israel</hi> (not one of whom, were he

to roote out at once all his enemies. Art thou an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

way to Canaan? looke to thy selfe. Suppose thou hadst

the salvation of his people shall bee accomplished.
1. Though the promise may seeme out of minde, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
shall performe every word and syllable of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made three hundreth yeeres before. 2. Though
there be never so many hindrances and mighty lets, they
shall not hinder. God promiseth the good land; but
how should they get thorow <hi>Iordan,</hi> seeing there is no
other way? Now rather then his promise shall faile, he
will invert the order of nature; <hi>Iordan</hi> shall stop his
course, nay runne backward. The like in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> God had said, that night they must

promiseth <hi>Ioshua</hi> to overcome 5. Kings at once; an hard
taske, and one day is too little for it; but rather then the
night approaching shall dissolve the battell, and any of
them escape, hee will command the Sunne to stand still,
and lengthen the day that his word may bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
<hi>Israel</hi> in passing to Canaan must passe the huge
and terrible wildernesse fourty yeares. Alas what shall
they eate or drinke? Can a barren wildernesse afford
any food, or (if any) for so many hundred thousand
men? But before the promise faile, heaven shall raine
<hi>Manna,</hi> the rocke shall give abundance of water.
Hath God promised thee daily bread, helpe in affliction,
refreshing in wearinesse, remission in sense of sinne, a
blessed issue in every triall? Let thy faith give God the
honour of truth. Heaven shall fall and earth ascend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

hee promised thee the heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> what if thou
seest armies of enemies, of discouragements? thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

so will we obey thee. 3. Follow him as our guide
into that eternall rest, and depend on him for our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
there. <hi>Moses</hi> cannot carry us in, for himselfe must
onely see the land. So wee may see the land of promise
a farre off in the Law; but onely Jesus can bring us in. For,
1. He alone is entred already to take possession for us.
2. He hath undertaken to carry us through our wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

               <p>IV. What conditions we must observe in comming

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Conditions to be observed in going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> as they in comming to the good land.
1. The land is theirs and possession given, but many
Canaanites and Jebusites must dwell in the Land under
tribute still, <hi>ch.</hi> 15. 63. and 16. 10. So notwithstanding
all our promises of rest, and possession of peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in this world are some yea may Canaanites and
Jebusites to molest Gods people. But at last our <hi>Ioshua</hi>
leaves never an enemy unsubdued. There shall nothing
which is unholy get within the walls of that City; hee
sees the last enemy destroyed, 2. They must not
come into that land till they were circumcised; for all the
forty yeares in the wildernesse they were not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
<hi>ch.</hi> 5. 3. 7. Till the shame of Aegypt was remooved
vers. 9 <hi>Ioshua</hi> cannot bring them into the promised
land. Which shame (as <hi>Iunius</hi> thinks) was the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their fathers contracted in Aegypt, whereby
they grew carelesse of Gods ordinances. Our <hi>Ioshua</hi>
brings not us into our Canaan so long as wee are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and uncircumcised; till he have circumcised our
hearts, and we be holy and sanctified: for without shall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18740:38"/>
be dogs. 3. <hi>Ioshua</hi> must divide their inheritance
by lot, and so every one must receive it; not by right or
desert, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 2. And so God commanded <hi>Moses Numb.</hi>
26. 55: So our <hi>Ioshua</hi> divides to the elect their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the heavenly countrey, not for their merits and
deserts, but by his rich and free gift. If no Israelite could
claime of <hi>Ioshua</hi> one foot out of merit and desert, but all
of promise and grace: much lesse may we our childs part
in heaven. Gods mercy is mans merit. 4. <hi>Ioshua</hi>
gives them the land with this condition, that for so
great labour and travell in preparing so good a land they
affoord him an inheritance among them, <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 49. Our
<hi>Ioshua</hi> was not inferiour in labour and paines to <hi>Ioshua</hi>
in purchasing us a better land; and we must give him the
inheritance he asketh (so they did to <hi>Ioshua)</hi> that he may
dwell among us, or in the midst of us. Now the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
he asketh among us is our hearts purged by faith.
He desires no more of thee for all his paines but a little
roome in the midst of thee, which himselfe will build
and dwell in. If thou dost not give him his demand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
thy unkindnesse and unthankfulnesse, thy heart shall
lie as a ruinous wast, as a nasty and stinking hoale, a cage
of uncleane beasts and lusts, yea an habitation of Devils.
5. <hi>Ioshua</hi> brings them into the good land, and as soone
as they eate the corne of the land the Manna ceaseth the
next morrow, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 12. So when our <hi>Ioshua</hi> shall bring us
into our good land to eate the fruit of it, the good things
and meanes of this world shall cease. The Manna the
preaching of the word, celebration of Sacraments, faith
and hope, &amp;c. But we are sure of better meanes, or better
things without meanes; in the hope and expectation of

Christ by occasion of the place in which he was educated
not by that Law. But as a Nazarite signified one that
was seperated and severed from the common course of
men to a more holy profession of sanctity, and to a
stricter care to avoid all manner of impurity, such a one
the Prophets signified Christ should be; not onely holy
and seperate from sinners, but the author of holinesse.
And as <hi>Sampson</hi> was sanctified from the womb: So was
Christ much more. So the Angell, The holy thing that is
in thee is of the holy Ghost. And herein beyond <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
for in Christ are all sanctified. 3. <hi>Sampson</hi> grew
and the spirit waxed strong in him,<note place="margin">Growth in Spirit.</note> so as he became a
Saviour of incomparable strength. So Christ grew every
way; in stature, in favour with God and man; and the
Spirit was so strong in him (because it was not measured
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18740:39"/>
unto him as unto <hi>Sampson)</hi> as he became a Saviour stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then the strong armed man. He was the true <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
that overcame many enemies, and slew heaps upon
heaps. And although <hi>Sampson</hi> the type was at last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by his enemies: our true <hi>Sampson</hi> is invincible,
and hath gloriously triumphed over them all. Both of
them were great deliverers; the one from great thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and temporall misery: the other from a greater
spirituall and eternall thraldome under sinne, the Law,
Satan, hell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. <hi>Sampson</hi> was a type of Christ in three especiall
actions. 1. He found meat in the eater,<note place="margin">Actions.</note> and from
the strong sweetnesse, and brought some of it to his
parents: Christ by his death (which seemed to eate him
up) brings us meat, the bread of life, sweeter then hony;
and out of this dead Lyons mouth, that is, Christ dead,
comes sweetnes.<note place="margin">Christianorum processit extmen instar aepum.</note> 
                  <hi>Thence sprang whole flocks of Christians,
like so many swarmes of bees. 2. Sampson</hi> loved strange
women and went among the enemies of God for a
wife;<note place="margin">August. ser. 107 <hi>de temp.</hi>
                  </note> which might seeme a sinne in him, but that the

love to the Gentiles, casting his love on her that was not
beloved, to make his dispised and dispersed of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
his spouse and wife: as <hi>Hos. 2. 23, I will have mercy on
her</hi> &amp;c. Where the whole contract on both parties is
set downe at large. 3. <hi>Sampson</hi> put forth his mind
in parables and riddles: so did Christ his doctrine to the
Pharises, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. In passion and suffering they were very like in
many passages. 1. Both sold for money,<note place="margin">Sufferings.</note> 
                  <hi>Sampson</hi>
by <hi>Delilah</hi> to the Princes of the Philistims, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 5.
Christ for <hi>thirty peeces of siluer</hi> unto the chiefe Priest.
Both betrayed by their most familiar; the one to the
Philistims, the other to the Pharisees. Both under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of love, <hi>Sampson</hi> by <hi>Delilah, Iudg.</hi> 16. 15. Christ by
<hi>Iudas</hi> with a kisse, Both apprehended by their enemies;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18740:39"/>
both led away, both bound, both brought forth at a
great feast, both blinded, both scorned, both fastened
to a post, the one of the house, the other of the crosse.
2. As <hi>Sampson</hi> offered himselfe freely unto death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
wicked men, as a most valiant Captaine being
called to be a revenger of Gods enemies; and therfore it
is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. he died (not as a selfemurtherer, but) <hi>in
faith;</hi> that is, as a faithfull servant of God adventured
his owne life for the destruction of the enemies of God
and his Country, as every good subject and souldier
(pressed to the field) ought to do. So Jesus Christ volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
offered himself to death, and went out to meet the
apprehendors, and was content to dye among wicked
men, and to be hanged betweene two theeves, that he
might destroy and scatter the powers of the enemies of
his Churches salvation.</p>
               <p>IV. In victory and fortitude. 1. His first strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
(which was as a praeludium to his calling) in which
he assayed his power,<note place="margin">Stratagems and victories.</note> was that he overcame a stout Lyon
in the desert, and slew him with his owne hand, <hi>ch. 14. 6.
and tare him, as one should have rent a Kid:</hi> So the first
powerfull worke in which our <hi>Sampson</hi> shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
was the conquering of the devill that roaring
Lyon hand to hand, who assaulted him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by three horrible and hellish temptations.
2. <hi>Sampson</hi> slew with his owne hand (being alone)
above a thousand men at once, having nothing but the
Jawbone of an Asse; a weake, base, and insufficient wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
for so great a warre and victory; and as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
so it was an uncleane weapon of an uncleane beast by
the Law, which his strict profession of a Nazarite
should not have touched, had it beene out of case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:
So our true <hi>Sampson</hi> by as weake and vile instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and as contemptible in the eyes of flesh conquers
thousands daily; while by the foolishnesse of preaching,
by the doctrine of the Crosse, by weake earthen vessells
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18740:40"/>
he subdues whole countries and kingdomes unto him;
that the worke may bee knowne to be his owne hand
and power, and not the instruments. 3. <hi>Sampson</hi>
slew <hi>more</hi> of Gods enemies at his death then in all his
life, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 30. And this was the effect of the death of
Christ; when sinne, Satan, hell, the grave, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
seemed to triumph over him, and make themselves
merry (with the Philistims) as having in their power
their greatest enemie; but suddenly he afflicted them
more in his death then in all his life. This death of Christ
pulled Satans house over his head; it was the death of
death, and squeasing of all enemies at once. 4. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
being in the Citty <hi>Azzah,</hi> and the Citizens now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in wait to kill him, and to make an end of so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an enemy whom they had sure within their gates,
he arose at midnight and tooke the doores of the gates
of the City, and the two posts, and lift them away with
the barres, and layd them on his shoulders and departed,
<hi>ch. 16. 3:</hi> So when satan and sinners had buried Christ,
laid a stone on him, sealed it, and watched him, thinking
they had him sure enough never to molest them more;
he like another mighty <hi>Sampson</hi> rose in his might, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away the gates and barres of death from himselfe
and all his members. All the bonds of death and sinne,
with which he was bound in our stead, he shooke off,
as <hi>Sampson</hi> did the seven greene cords, and broke their
power as towe is broken when it feeleth fire.
5. <hi>Sampson</hi> never had helpe from any other, in slaying
the Lyon, the enemies; but with his owne hand without
any other second or weapon: So Christ in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
alone; in the garden at prayer alone; before <hi>Pilate</hi>
alone, all the disciples fled; on the Crosse alone. No other
must tread the winepresse; none must share in the honor,
nor conquest with him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Judge none by outward ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I. Not to judge of the piety or impiety of Gods
children by their calamities. <hi>Sampson</hi> hath many enemies,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18740:40"/>
many conflicts, many dangers; by the Lyon, the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims,
the Azzhites, and his owne wife; his life painfull,
his death violent: Jesus Christ himselfe beset with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
on all sides, as the sunne with moats; never free
from conflicts with the Lyon the devill, with his owne
Jewes, with <hi>Pharao,</hi> Saduces, Herodians; his person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
his miracles traduced, his life painfull, his death
shamefull and accursed.<note place="margin">Or inward.</note> Yet may we not judge either of
them forsaken of God, who still assisted them with his
owne strength, and was strongest in them when they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
weakest.<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 15.</note> Neither may we mis-judge <hi>the generation
of Gods children</hi> in their conflicts with Satan, with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
with sinners, or with the terrours of their owne
hearts.<note place="margin">22. 1.</note> If they shall cry out; <hi>My God, why hast thou for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me?</hi> wait a while, and Gods strength shall doe great
things in their weakenesse.</p>
               <p>II. God can and usually doth use strange,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Strange means used by God for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good.</note> weake,
and unexpected meanes to overthrow his enemies, and

weake things, his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dome working by the most foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
When a thousand enemies set upon <hi>Sampson</hi> at once
without any weapon or meanes of defence, he can use a
jawbone to kill a thousand of them when they thinke
him farre enough from any weapon; and if <hi>Sampson</hi>
wants a better and readier meanes against Gods enemies,
hee can by two hundred Foxes (a most unexpected
meanes) burne up their graine and fields at harvest time:
Our Lord by the foolishnesse of preaching can and doth
overcome his enemies; nay God can and doth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
meanes wrack his foes. <hi>Sampson</hi> shall marry a wife
among the Philistims to bee an occasion of warre and
revenge, and this came of God: whereas marriages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Princes ordinarily are made to compose and
make up differences, not to make them. Our Lord
Jesus overcomes sinne, death, hell, grave, by suffering, by
death, by descending into hell, by lying in the grave,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18740:41"/>
most unlikely or contrary meanes. Let Gods enemies
feare revenge by every thing, even where no feare is.
An enemy of God and his Church is never safe, seeme
he never so secure. An army of frogges shall drive <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
out of his bedchamber in the middest of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
a fly shall choake Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> if other meanes
be wanting; and proud <hi>Herod</hi> shall be eaten up, not by an
army of men but of lice.</p>
               <p>III. The greatest victory against the enemies of
the Church is by passion and patience,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Our victory stands in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and passion.</note> submitting our
selves meekely unto God in obedience, walking in our
callings, and doing the worke of God. Thus did these
two mighty <hi>Sampsons</hi> most overcome their enemies
when they seemed most overcome by them. Our warre
(saith <hi>Isidore)</hi> is contrary to the striving of the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.<note place="margin">Illic qui caedit &amp; superat; hic qui caeditur &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert: Illic qui vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissim ferit; hic qui alteri maxil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam praebet: non in ultione, led pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia victoria ponderatur.</note>
                  <hi>There hee gets the garland which striketh and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth;
heere he which is strooke and suffereth. There he
which being strooke striketh againe, heere he which offereth
his cheeke to the striker.</hi> And thus he concludeth; <hi>Our
victory consisteth not in revenging but in suffering.</hi> Oh
let the children of the Church lay aside worldly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
clamour, reviling, revenging speeches or actions;
and betake themselves to the weapons of the Church,
prayers, teares, patience, weapons mighty under God.
The power of a Christian is patience, who must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
evill with goodnesse.</p>
               <p>IV. In that Christ is the true <hi>Sampson,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Fourefold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Gods people.</note> heere is
much consolation, and many comforts to the Israel of
God. 1. Comfort. As <hi>Sampson</hi> revenged the
wrong offered him in his wife: So will Christ: <hi>Mat. 25.
In that yee did it to one of these little ones, yee did it to mee.</hi>
And though <hi>Sampsons</hi> wife may be taken from him and
given to another: Christs cannot. <hi>Ioh. 10. 28. none shall
pluck them out of my hand.</hi> 2. Comfort. A mightier
deliverer is heere then <hi>Sampson</hi> for Israel. For, 1.
Though <hi>Sampson</hi> was strong to overcome a Lyon:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18740:41"/>
our <hi>Sampson</hi> is stronger to overcome the Devill;<note place="margin">Christ a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier and better Deliverer, then <hi>Sampson,</hi> in six things.</note> not
in himselfe onely, but for us, in us, and by us. 2. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
was strong, but might abuse his strength, as hee did
in whoring and wantonnesse, which in prison he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
But Jesus Christ used all his strength for God,
against sinne and his enemies. 3. <hi>Sampson</hi> abusing it,
might lose his strength, for it was not the parting with
his haire, but his sinne grieving the Spirit, that weakned
him: but Christ could not lose his strength, because hee
could not lose his obedience. 4. <hi>Sampson</hi> was so
strong, as the Philistines thought it bootlesse to assay
him with power, but by policy and indirect meanes
they conquer him: but our <hi>Sampson</hi> cannot bee conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
neither by power, nor by policy; for hee is stronger
then all, and in him are treasures of wisedome.
5. <hi>Sampson</hi> overthrew the enemies, but that was his
owne overthrow: but Christ not so; his conquest was
to his most glorious exaltation, 6. <hi>Sampson</hi> as a type
onely began the deliverance of the Church, but hindred
by death could not perfect it: Our <hi>Sampson</hi> perfected
the deliverance and salvation of the whole Church, and
did more after death then in his life or death; and will
most fully perfect it for all his members in the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
3. Comfort. The glory of Gods children
appeares not yet, but shall <hi>when hee shall appeare, 1. Ioh.
3. 2. Sampsons</hi> strength for a time lurked in the prison:
the glory of Christs Deity lay hid a while in the grave,
but both most powerfully brake forth: So shall the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the despised Saints, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 37. 6. 4<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Comfort.
Wee shall never doubt of meanes to comfort and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
us in want. The same God that supplied <hi>Sampson</hi>
a Jawbone against his enemies, supplied him out of the
same Jawbone a well of water to drinke when hee was
ready to faint.<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Trust thy selfe with God</hi> in thy wants,
reserve to him all meanes, instruments, and wayes of
bringing thee helpe. If thou see no apparant or great
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18740:42"/>
meanes of thy comfort and supply, hee can use weake
and unexpected meanes; onely walke in thy calling,
and the rocke shall yeeld thee water rather then thou
shalt be destitute in Gods way, or worke.</p>

enemies, so must thou learne <hi>not to love thy life to the

deare to finish thy course with joy. For a man to thrust
himselfe in hazard,<note place="margin">Injussu Dei, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato assectu.</note> or venture his life <hi>without warrant

First in respect of his followers,<note place="margin">3. Warres.</note> secondly of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

<hi>David</hi> had a traine.<note place="margin">Followers.</note> 1. Of poore men, and received

<hi>David</hi> had a poore traine; and not receiveth onely, but
calleth all unto him that are heavy laden with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

2. Afterwards <hi>David</hi> had his thirty seven Worthies,

who as worthy and stout Champions, fought the

Lords spirituall battells, and mightily subdued the world
under the government of Jesus Christ, in whose place
are succeeded pastors and teachers to the end.<note place="margin">Enemies: open</note> 2. His
enemies. 1. Open and manifest, not onely <hi>Goliah</hi> that
defied all Israel, but <hi>Saul</hi> that casts a speare at him, that
hunts him as a Partridge, that sends out for him to
bring him to death, and the house of <hi>Saul, Shimei</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on him, and cursing him with an horrible curse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Amalekites, Philistims, &amp;c. So our Lord Jesus had
open hostility against the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of hell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
him hand to hand, and conquers him in the
wildernesse. But <hi>Herod</hi> hunts his life every where, the
Pharisees revile him for a deceiver and Demoniack, send
out for him to take away his life, and the people of the
Jews pursuing him with all open hatred and hostility
even to the death, and all the wicked tyrants and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as so many Amalekites and Philistims.<note place="margin">and secret.</note> 2. Secret
and underhand enemies, that should have beene loyall
and loving to him, even his owne people that flattered
him with their mouths, but imagined mischiefe against
him, <hi>Psa.</hi> 41. 9. Such as <hi>Doeg, Achitophel.</hi> Nay he which
eat bread with him at his table, his familiar that went
up to the house of God with him. And more then all
this, he that came out of his owne loynes, his owne son
<hi>Absalom;</hi> besides the sonnes of his father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 28.
So our true <hi>David</hi> had not onely his owne Jewes and
brethren hating him with an horrible hatred, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his blood upon themselves; but his owne Disciple
that had beene so familiar with him, that went to the
house of God often with him, that knew all his haunts
and waies, betraying him, and delivering him to bee
crucified. And thus Christ himselfe expounds that in
<hi>Psalme</hi> 41. 9. of himselfe and <hi>Iudas, Luk.</hi> 22. 21. And
therefore Interpretors expound such execrations, as
<hi>Psa. 59. 13. Consume them that they be no more,</hi> not so
much litterally against <hi>Saul</hi> and other enemies of <hi>David;</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18740:44"/>
as against the Jewes and enemies of Christ shadowed by
them; and so conceive them as they be Propheticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of Jerusalem and the Jewes forty yeares after
Christs ascension, and of the present wrath upon the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
Jewes, whose hatred against Christ liveth at
this day, as the curse liveth on them.<note place="margin">Victories.</note> 3. His deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
and victories, with many of which the Lord
honoured him. As 1. <hi>Saul</hi> layes wait every where to

feet were made like Hinds feet in expedition
to avoid his enemy whether <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Absalom;</hi> who cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him as hunters the silly hare, and he escapes them all
though narrowly and strangely. Christ Jesus was often
sought after and laid for by his enemies, no kind of snare
was undevised to take him in his talke, in his doctrine,
in his life and conversation; no meanes unattempted
to take his person, but hee escaped their hands strangely.
Sometimes he went through the midst of them all, who
having strong purpose yet had no power to take him,
till the time wa<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>

2. <hi>Saul</hi> having wearied himselfe in pursuit of <hi>David,</hi>
sent messengers to take him three severall times, 1 <hi>Sam.
19.</hi> 20. but they among a company of Prophets began to
prophecy, the spirit of the Lord comming upon them,
and they went without him. So the Pharisees sent mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
to apprehend Christ and bring him before them;
but comming to him (as <hi>Sauls</hi> messengers to <hi>David)</hi>
and hearing his gracious words, had no power to take
him; but went away preaching and proclaiming (as they
prophecying) <hi>never man spake like this man, Ioh.</hi> 7. 46.
3. In the comparison between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David (David</hi>
having slaine <hi>Goliah)</hi> was sung: <hi>Saul hath slaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
but David his ten thousand, 1. Sam.</hi> 18. 10. But there
is no comparison betweene the victories of <hi>David,</hi> and
of this sonne of <hi>David,</hi> who hath slaine the great <hi>Goliah</hi>
the Devill who defied all the host of Israel; and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18740:45"/>
the devill onely, but overcame death, hell, the
grave; and chased before him all the armies of sinnes, and
bands of temptations which come out against the Israel
of God. 4. in that noble victory <hi>David</hi> cuts off <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liahs</hi>
head with his owne sword: So in the wildernesse
the devill, the great <hi>Goliah</hi> used Scripture against Christ,
and Christ overthrowes him and cuts off his head by
the same sword of the Spirit, the word of God. And
now daily he convinceth the wicked enemies by the
testimony of their owne <hi>conscience, Rom.</hi> 2. 15. He nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no other sword or weapon against them then their
owne.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>David</hi> was a type of Christ in his Kingdome:<note place="margin">4. Kingdome.</note>
first,<note place="margin">Entrance.</note> in respect of the entrance, secondly, of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
thirdly, of the continuance or eternity. 1. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
entred not without strong opposition, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

verified,<note place="margin">Psal. 118. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>the stone which the builders refused, is become
chiefe stone of the corner.</hi> No man was more despised of
<hi>Sauls</hi> courtiers then <hi>David,</hi> who was thought farre
enough from the Kingdome: so no man so much despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and rejected of the <hi>Scribes, Pharisees,</hi> chiefe <hi>Priests</hi>
and people, as Christ. <hi>Barrabas</hi> an honest man to him;
and yet was mightily and unexpectedly invested into
his Kingdome by his glorious rising from the dead.
2. In his administration.<note place="margin">Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> will judge uprightly,
and sing mercy and judgement; he will endure no hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
person in his presence. But our <hi>David</hi> is the just and
righteous Judge of all the world; and most sincerely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenceth
mercy to the penitent sinner, but feedes the
impenitent with judgement.<note place="margin">Eternity.</note> 3. In the continuance
or eternity. God promised mercy to <hi>David</hi> and his seed
<hi>for ever,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 132. 12.</note> which promises are not to be extended to his
carnall succession, for the princely dignity is taken from
them. Their glory was eclipsed in the captivity, and
where be now any of <hi>Davids</hi> race according to the flesh?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18740:45"/>
But the everlasting seed of <hi>David</hi> is to bee meant.
1. Christ himselfe, in whom his kingdome is perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
2. The true Israel as well of Gentiles as of Jewes
by faith ingrafted into the Messiah, in respect of whom
shalbe no end of his Kingdome. Thus in all those spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
wherein <hi>David</hi> professeth he will praise the Lord
<hi>among the Gentiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> must be taken as a type of
Christ, who by his Spirit set forth the praise and true
worship of God among the Nations to the end of the
world. And so <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 15. 9. interprets it of the calling
of the Gentiles. For <hi>David</hi> could not doe this literally
and in person, among whom he never dwelt nor came,
but onely in him whose type he was.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>David</hi> was a type of Christ in respect of Christ
his propheticall and Priestly office.<note place="margin">5. Office Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall and Priestly. 1.</note> 1. <hi>David</hi> by his
sweet musick allayes <hi>Sauls</hi> madnesse, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23.
Christ by the sweet voyce of the Gospell stills the evill
spirits which molest and vexe men, and gives them
peace and quietnesse in mind and conscience. And in the
dayes of his flesh, how he sought to cure and allay the
spirituall madnesse of the wicked Scribes and Pharisees
against him, is plaine in the story. 2. <hi>David</hi> brings
back the Arke to his right place. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. So did Christ,
the truth of Gods Law obscured by the <hi>false glosses</hi> of
Scribes and Pharisees;<note place="margin">Math. 5. and 6. and 7.</note> and reduced the true sense and
meaning of it, And freed his Church (signified by the
<hi>Arke)</hi> from the spirituall thraldome and captivity of the
Law. 3. <hi>David</hi> builds an Altar in the grounds of a
stranger, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24, namely, Araunah the Jebusite: The
true <hi>David</hi> builds up a Church among the Gentiles, and
sets up Gods worship among them that were strangers
from the Covenant. 4. <hi>David</hi> offers a sacrifice, and
the Lord accepts it, sending fire from heaven to consume
it, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 25. Christ offers the most acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
that every was<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> in which both <hi>Davids</hi> and all
ours must be accepted; and in which alone the Lord
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18740:46"/>
smels a savour of rest.</p>
               <p>I. As the spirit of God came on <hi>David</hi> after his
anoynting,<note place="margin">Vse. 1. Enter upon no office without assistance of the Spirit.</note> 1. <hi>Sam. 16. 13:</hi> So did it on our true <hi>David</hi>
after his baptizing: to fit them to their waighty offices.
Learne 1. That he that is not fitted and furnished with
gifts of the spirit in some measure, and attempteth any
office in the Church or commonwealth, is not called by
God; whose wisdome will not send a blind man for a
seer, nor a dumb man on his message or errand. Would
a man know whether hee have received of this spirit
for his office?<note place="margin">A note of it.</note> A note is, when God stirres up his will in
that office to performe all the desire of God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 28, he
saith to <hi>Cyrus: Thou art my shepheard, thou shalt performe
all my desire.</hi> The Magistrate is a shepheard; he must doe
in judgement what God himselfe would doe in repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vice, and cherishing religion, else the spirit (who is
not contrary to himselfe) leads him not. The Minister is
a shepheard; hee must speake nothing but what God
would speake for the incouraging of grace, and disgrace
of sinne and sinners. God speaks peace to his people and
feeds the impenitent with judgement, and he that in
his ministery doth speake sweetly to wicked men, and
broacheth a vessell of gall and wormewood for godly
men to drinke, is not sent by God on that errand: hee
crosseth the spirit which hee pretendeth. 2. Art
thou a private Christian, see that the same spirit rest on
thee, and that thou hast received of the same anoynting.
For 1. he that hath not the spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> is <hi>none of Christs:</hi> and
2. what is it to us that the spirit rest and light upon
Christ, if he should determine all his fruits and graces
upon him? But in that the sweete oyntment and Balsame
poured upon the head of our high Priest runnes downe
to the <hi>skirt of his garment,</hi> that is, to the lowest member
of his Church, <hi>Psa,</hi> 133. 2, hence are we sweetly and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
refreshed. Findest thou emptinesse or want of
grace? fly to this fulnesse, but observe the diverse manner.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18740:46"/>
To the head is given the spirit in all fulnesse: to us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<hi>of that fulnesse, Ioh.</hi> 1. 16. To him beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
to us according to measure.</p>
               <p>II. That Jesus Christ is the right and undoubted

And it will be worth our labour to enquire how farre

their noble acts, and the honourable exployts of

is his Crosse, or rather the Gospell, a doctrine of the
Crosse, to the world foolishnesse or basenesse; but in his
kingdome of glory, the signe of the sonne of man, that is,
such glory and power as agrees to none else. 2. Their
servants and attendants must be rich, stately, noble, and
the sonnes of great Princes must be nearest to attend
them: Christ Jesus (in contempt of what the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth)
will have his servants poore, meeke, lowly; not
such lofty Lords as so farre excell the Emperour in
worldly glory as the Sunne the Moone, the Popes ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

heaven, brethren of Christ, and of the royallest blood

beene of this world) could have imitated them. But
while he was in the world (to shew that his kingdome
had no similitude nor correspondency with the pomps
of earthly kingdomes) in his progresse hee gets on an

clothes spread under him. But when he shall shew his

And these being eternall, the kingdome of Christ must

It was ever the lot of truth to bee rejected of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as was <hi>David,</hi> as was Christ: few nobles, few wise:
nay many great Rabbies (professing the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)

Christianity. Nay the basest sort made mouthes and scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

and these come in out of the most remote parts of

Church is now Catholike. 3. <hi>Salomon</hi> prepared <hi>great

gifts, they are notably signified in <hi>Salomons</hi> Throne,
which was exalted above all the Thrones of all Princes;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salomons</hi> Throne: sixe things opened.</note>
described, 1. King. 10. 18. 1. The matter was Ivory
and gold wherewith it shined: Signifying the sincere
and upright disposition of <hi>Salomon</hi> to justice and equity,
shunning all corruption and by-respects which make
men pervert Justice. And as these vertues made <hi>Salomons</hi>
throne to shine: so the royall throne of Christ is a
throne of Justice, <hi>a great white Throne, Rev.</hi> 20. 11. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but sincerity and purity proceeds thence. Hee
justifies no wicked person or cause, nor takes the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the hand. 2. The state of it. The King ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18740:52"/>
to it by sixe stayres, signifying that the King riseth
above all his subjects many degrees in practise of many
vertues; wisdome, prudence, justice, fortitude, piety: So
Christs Throne is infinitely exalted above all Princes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
men &amp; Angels, dominations, principalities, thrones,
and set at the right hand of God; and himselfe as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
transcendeth all creatures in practice of all graces,
in perfection of all holinesse. 3. The figure was
round: signifying the perfection and simplicity of the
minde in the Judge discerning causes; who could not
abide any deceitfull, fraudulent, or hypocriticall courses
or corners: Such is the Throne of Christ, in whom was
never found guile nor deceit, neither can he abet, or not
hate it in any. 4. There were two pillers or barres
to beare up the armes of <hi>Salomon:</hi> signifying the rewards
and defence of good men, and the punishment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of evill men by the power of his arme, whereby
Kings and kingdomes are sustained: So our Lord Jesus
upholds his kingdome <hi>by reward and punishment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Premio, &amp; paena.</note> and in
the last day shall set the sheepe at his right hand, and
the goats on his left. 5. Two Lyons of gold standing
by the stayes: noting the power and fortitude of the
King, whose strength is as the strength of Lyons against
enemies, and to put in execution wise and soveraigne
counsells. But <hi>Salomons</hi> strength was weakenesse to the
strength of Christ; who as a couragious Lyon of the tribe
of Judah shall teare and spoyle his enemies, <hi>and none
shall rescue, Hos.</hi> 5. 14. 6. The foote stoole of it was
of gold, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 9. 18. to note the freedome of the King
from covetousnesse; that he ought to have his wealth
under his feet, and so master them as they neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
nor corrupt him: So Christ the Judge of the world
most perfectly despised the world; and at his appearing
shall set it under his feet and burne it. 2. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
according to those gifts. <hi>Salomon</hi> did with
such admirable wisdome judge betweene the two har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18740:52"/>
for the living child, as <hi>all Israel hearing the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
feared the King; for they saw that the wisdome of God
was in him to doe justice, 1. King.</hi> 3. 28. But our <hi>Salomon</hi>
is the just Judge of all the world, who shall passe a
righteous sentence betweene the godly and the wicked,
in that great and terrible day. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. when all flesh shal
see and admire the wisdome and power of God in him
to doe justice.</p>
               <p>For application, briefly.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>A greater then</hi> Salomon <hi>is heere,</hi>

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 31.
1. Hence our Saviour perswades to come to him to
partake of his wisdome,<note place="margin">Duties to Christ, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
                  </note> wealth, peace, grace. But the

aside the weighty affaires of her kingdome, the charge
of her journey and gifts to <hi>Salomon</hi> not small, 1. <hi>King.
10. 10:</hi> the dangers, wearinesse, and all to heare the
wisdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> yet as a Gentile did all this: But
many men and women professing Christianity will not
step over their thresholds to heare the wisdome of a
greater then <hi>Salomon. Ob:</hi> If <hi>Salomon</hi> or Christ were
heere, we would. <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The Jewes would say so, but
would not. 2. Hee that heares you, heareth mee.
3. He that will not heare us, would not heare Christ
himselfe. <hi>Ob:</hi> Wee have businesse and occasions.
<hi>Sol:</hi> 1. Many make occasions which might be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
2. Many pretend occasions. 3. Many
have occasions, but so had this Queene, who would not
be hindred from <hi>Salomon</hi> by the weighty affaires of a
kingdome. 4. Whose occasions ordinarily hinder
them,<note place="margin">2. Wait on him and thinke thy selfe therein happy.</note> they shall never taste of the supper. 2. Hence
wee must labour to account it our happinesse that wee
may have liberty to wait on the true <hi>Salomon.</hi> So the
Queene of Saba: Happy are thy servants that may attend
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18740:53"/>
on thee, and heare thy wisdome. So our Saviour himself:
Happy are they that heare the word and keep it. Happy
we, if we saw our happinesse, that we need not with such
cost and toyle seeke after our <hi>Salomon.</hi> For he comes to
us, and knocks at the doores of our hearts, and offers to
enrich us with treasures of wisdome. Let us open our
gates that this King of glory may enter in. Let us receive
the rules of wisdome from his mouth, and consider how
unhappy they are that despise the word, of which both
the <hi>Salomons</hi> were preachers.</p>
               <p>II. Comfort that Christ is the true <hi>Salomon</hi>
1. Great were the blessings which <hi>Salomon</hi> procured to
Israel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> but all temporary, and outward: but our <hi>Salomon</hi>
procures greater,<note place="margin">Fourefold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
                  </note> spirituall and eternall. 2. <hi>Salomon</hi>
prayes, and is heard for al that pray in the temple, 1. <hi>King.
8.</hi> Christ prayes, and merits that all prayers of Saints be
heard, <hi>Ioh. 17. 3. Salomon</hi> could not be present in all
his Kingdome at once. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 11. Salomon <hi>had a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
and let it out to dressers:</hi> vers. 12. <hi>but my vineyard is
set before mine eyes.</hi> Himselfe still walks in the midst of
the golden Candlesticks, and watcheth for the good of
it. 4. All the excellencies which now wee see and
enjoy in Christ, are nothing to them wee shall see, as the
Queene of Saba, halfe was not told me in my countrey.
So as the glory, delight, pleasure, which our <hi>Salomon</hi> now
gives us must affect our hearts to renounce carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and pursue those that are above. What is earth to
heaven, that is, faith to fruition? This is that, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 7.
Behold his bed is better then <hi>Salomons,</hi> which was for
price and safety most excellent; for threescore valiant
men stood about it every night. But the spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
bed in the mariage chamber (the kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
surpasseth all comprehension: all sweetned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense

man of sorrows,<note place="margin">Name and office.</note> and such as no man ever sustained and
overcame. Both Prophets, <hi>Ionah</hi> sent to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to <hi>Niniveh:</hi> Christ the true <hi>Ionah,</hi> the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of the Church was sent to preach the same doctrine
to the world <hi>Mat. 4. 17. Then Iesus beganne to preach and
say, Amend your lives</hi> &amp;c. Both of them in expresse
words must signifie to their hearers, that without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

               <p>II. In respect of his death and suffering. In the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
1. kind,<note place="margin">Kind of death.</note> 2. manner, 3. fruit. 1. The kinde; it
was a willing death, a free will offring. For as <hi>Ionah</hi>
when the tempest was raysed, freely offered himselfe to
death when the Mariners would faine have saved him,
<hi>Ion. 1. 12. take me, and cast me into the sea</hi> that the tempest
may cease: So, when the storme of Gods wrath was
boistrous against the sinnes of mankind, Jesus Christ our
<hi>Ionah</hi> offered himselfe to the death; for he had power
either to lay downe his life, or to retaine it, <hi>Ioh. 10. 18.
No man taketh away my life from me, but I lay it downe of
my selfe. Ioh.</hi> 18. 5,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egosum.</hi> Manner.</note> 
                  <hi>I am he.</hi> 2. The terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner. For as <hi>Ionah</hi> was swallowed up of the Whale
who made but one morsell of him: So Christ was swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of death, and seemed wholly devoured of the
curse of God. And as the one cryed in the Whales belly,
&amp; <hi>out of the belly of hell, Ion.</hi> 2. 2, and vers. 4. <hi>I am cast away
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18740:54"/>
out of thy sight:</hi> So the other cries upon the Crosse, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Both of them
were in so extraordinary death, as in their sense they
were in the deepest Hell.<note place="margin">And fruit.</note> 3. The fruit of it.
1. The appeasing of the wrath of God his Father.
For, as <hi>Ionah</hi> once cast into the Sea, the windes were stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>the sea ceased from her raging, Chap.</hi> 1. 15. and there
was a great calme: So Christ by his death pacified his
Fathers wrath, stilled the rage of Satan, abolished
the horror of death, which otherwise had never beene
still and calme towards us. 2. To save his fellowes.
For as <hi>Ionah</hi> must be cast into the sea to save his fellows
from drowning, <hi>Chap. 1. 12:</hi> So must Christ bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with the waves of his Fathers displeasure, and
(as <hi>Ionah)</hi> bee put to death by those that should have
preserved him: but not for any desert of his owne, but
to save his companions and brethren in the same ship
with him from death and drowning: For so was the
signification of his name, Jesus; so himselfe affirmed,
<hi>Matt. 20. 28. The Sonne of man came to give his life a
ran some for many.</hi> So also <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prophecied: <hi>It is
fit that one man die for the people, and that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
perish not, Ioh</hi> 11. 50.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. In <hi>Ionah</hi> wee have a type of Christs buriall,
noted by Christ himselfe.<note place="margin">Buriall.</note> For as <hi>Ionah</hi> was in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the fish,<note place="margin">Matt. 12. 40.</note> three dayes and three nights: So must
Christ bee detained in the grave, and lie under buriall
three dayes and three nights, (parts put for the whole,
as perhaps also in <hi>Ionah)</hi> till the case seemed desperate
in both; not onely in their owne apprehensions (as I
have before shewed) but in the disciples apprehension.
<hi>Luk. 24. 21. Wee thought this should have beene hee that
should have delivered Israel, and behold this is the third
day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> IV. <hi>Ionah</hi> was a manifest type of Christ in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
For,<note place="margin">Resurrection.</note> 1. As <hi>Ionah</hi> was taken into the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18740:54"/>
belly of the Whale whole, and passed through the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and armies of teeth as sharpe as speares, without
breaking or crushing one bone of him, or the least limb
of his body: So Jesus Christ passed through the strait
gate of death, but as one bone of him was not broken;
the speciall and extraordinary providence of God in
both of them watching the whole businesse. 2. As
the Lord spake unto the fish, and the fish against his
will must cast up <hi>Ionah</hi> on dry ground: So the belly of
the earth can keepe Christ no longer then the third day
(no more then the belly of the Whale could keepe <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah)</hi>
his blessed body must see no corruption. 3. As
<hi>Ionah</hi> returned from his grave with a song of praise and
thankesgiving, <hi>Chap. 2:</hi> So Jesus Christ returned to
life from his grave with a song of triumph and victory,
fore-prophecied, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 14. and accomplished, 1. <hi>Cor.
15. 55. O death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory!</hi>
4. As <hi>Ionah</hi> an Hebrew goes not to preach to
the Ninivites, being Gentiles, till after his resurrection
out of the belly of the Whale: So Jesus Christ an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
not till after his resurrection, leaves the obstinate
Jewes; and by his Apostles ministery and preaching
turnes himselfe <hi>to the Gentiles, Act.</hi> 13. 46. 5. As
<hi>Ionah</hi> after this delivery, went and preached the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of repentance with great fruit and successe, to the
conversion of all Niniveh, and preventing the fearefull
wrath denounced to come within fourty dayes: So our
Lord Jesus after his resurrection and ascension, sending
out his Apostles to preach repentance and remission of
sinnes, mightily prevailed, and suddenly converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
nations of the Heathen, and brought them to faith
and repentance.</p>
               <p>For Application:</p>
               <p>I. Let us acknowledge a <hi>greater then Ionah here,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 41. Lest as the Ninivits shall rise up against
the Jewes,<note place="margin">Repent at the Ministery of his servants.</note> they rise also against us if wee convert not,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18740:55"/>
nor repent at Christs doctrine as they did at <hi>Ionahs.</hi> For
1. Who are they to us?<note place="margin">Motives.</note> They barbarous Heathens,
and Gentiles, never instructed before: wee have beene
trained in the Scriptures from childhood. 2. What
were their meanes to ours? <hi>Ionah</hi> preached but three
dayes to them: Christ hath preached, not three dayes as
he, nor three yeeres as to the Iewes; but aboue three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
yeares.<note place="margin">Christ a farre more excellent Preacher.</note> He preached one sermon: Christ a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
3. What was their Preacher to ours? 1. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
was a weake man: Christ is God and man. 2. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
a sinful man, cast into the sea for his owne sinne:
Christ an innocent man, cast into the sea for our sinne.
3. <hi>Ionah</hi> a Prophet, a servant: Christ the Lord of all
the holy Prophets, therefore of <hi>Ionah. 4. Ionah</hi> a
stranger to them: Christ of our owne kindred and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
5. <hi>Ionah</hi> preached unwillingly: Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
freely, and spent himselfe for us. 6. <hi>Ionah</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
nothing but destruction of them and their City:
Christ a sweet doctrine of grace, salvation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of a kingdome of heaven. 7. <hi>Ionah</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
out of the belly of the Whale, but did no miracle
for confirmation of his doctrine: Christ came both from
the bosome of the Father, and from the heart of the
earth, and did innumerable signes and miracles in which
wee see his glory. 8. <hi>Ionah</hi> a most angry and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
man, would faine die because the Ninevits did not:
Christ a mirrour of patience will die least his hearers
should. 9. To <hi>Ionah</hi> no Prophet gave witnesse, or
foretold of him: To Christ <hi>all the Prophets gaue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Act.</hi> 10. 43. and spake before of him. Shall
now Nineveh repent in sackcloth and ashes by <hi>Ionahs</hi>
Ministery of three dayes; and shall not wee by Christs
constant Ministery of threefore yeares? Shall Nineveh
condemne Judea for not acknowledging a greater then
<hi>Ionah;</hi> and shall it not condemne us not repenting?
whose sinne shall bee farre greater then that of the Jews,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18740:55"/>
who rejected Christ in his abasement and humiliation;
but we reject the Lord of glory, now exalted.</p>
               <p>II. In the type and truth the freedome of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2.</note>

Rom.</hi> 3. 29. 2. Christ was the promised <hi>seed in whom
all nations must be blessed. Gen.</hi> 22. 18. Hence comes in
our title to grace, and not from any desert of ours. For
what is amiable in the wilde Olive? It is onely Gods
free calling, who calls her that was not beloved, to bee
beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If we bee grafted into Christ, and received
into grace, all is well, we are in state good enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Some are grafted into the Church by profession
of mouth onely, as all were <hi>not Israel that were of Israel:</hi>
and some planted into it by the faith of the heart. The
former are not altered from their wilde nature: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are renewed to the Image of Christ. Therefore let
none content themselves with externall profession, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the word, sacraments, and prayer; but labour
for soundnesse of faith and grace, by which onely wee
become branches of the true Olive; whereas to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as a scien, by a thred of profession, will not keep it
from withering.</p>
               <p>III. In both we have a certaine Embleme,<note place="margin">

of our resurrection.<note place="margin">Our resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assured to us.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. If the Spirit of him that
raised up <hi>Ionah</hi> and Jesus be in us, he shall also quicken
our mortall bodies, and if the head be risen the members
must rise also. For as God spake to the fish, and the fish
gave up <hi>Ionah</hi> as from the dead: so shall God speake to
the earth and sea and all creatures, and they shall give up
their dead. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. he shall say to the earth give,

and to the sea restore my sonnes and daughters, and they
that are as seed under clods shall <hi>awake and sing:</hi> And
these dry bones shall be againe covered with <hi>sinews, flesh,
and skin,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 6. For as <hi>it was impossible for Christ
to be held ever under death, Acts</hi> 2. 24. as impossible is it
for his members. Let us comfort our selves in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of death to our selves, or our friends, and by

board into the sea was the occasion of converting the
Mariners: Even so Christs death converted many of
them that were causes and authors of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. 41.
And as the Mariners lives were saved by casting <hi>Ionah</hi>
into the sea: so all beleevers by the death of Iesus Christ.
1. Let us not measure Gods workes by carnall senses.
This made the two disciples going to Emaus, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.
to make but a bad argument: Hee is crucified, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this is the third day; therefore though we thought
he should have redeemed Israel, wee are deceived.
Whereas faith would have made a cleane contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
He is crucified, and this is the third day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is the Redeemer. The Iewes, not knowing the
Scriptures, and power of God, are hardned against Iesus
Christ, expecting a great Emperour, as <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> or
some great Monarch; not able to see that by so base a
death, life could be procured. The carnall protestants
are held off from the true imbracing of Christ, because
they see the truth and sincerity of Christ every where so
resisted and hated by great Rulers and Doctors; as if it
had not been so in Christs owne person and Ministery;
or as if Christ was not set as a sign or butt of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereas, therefore it must needs be he. 2. Let us

the waight of sinne committed pressed <hi>Ionah</hi> into the
deepest sea of evils; and sinne imputed thrust Christ
into a deeper sea, even the deepest hell. Both seem left
of God in the hands of death; both cry out as left in the
depth of hell. 1. Doe thou run from God and duty, and
though thou beest Gods childe, thou maist finde God
pursuing thee, as if he were an utter and irreconcileable
enemy. 2. Make as light a reckoning of sinne as thou
canst, the least of them shuts us or Christ out of heaven.
Doth Christ undertake thy sinne, he sees not heaven till
he die for it? Sinne imputed will not let Christ enter
into heaven, but by his owne blood, yea through Hell.
Thy sinne repented of held Christ, an innocent, out of
heaven till he dyed for it: but where shall ungodly and
impenitent sinners appeare? 2. This same collation

made choice as his peculiar, though all the earth was his.
<hi>Exod. 4. 22. Israel is my first borne,</hi> that is, not only the
first people and nation that first professed the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, and had priority of the Gentiles who were

and choice of that from all other people; whom hee
would accept as his beloved in the Messiah the first born
of all creatures, and among whom he would stablish his
covenant, and raise up his worship, thus hee dealt not
with other nations. 3 <hi>By a speciall right.</hi> The first

2. For the strange maner. He was the first borne of a

borne without sinne. 3. For accomplishing his office
in his resurrection. He is called the first begotten or first
borne of the dead two wayes. 1. In respect of his father
who first begot him from the dead. Whence his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is called a begetting. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33. thou art my
sonne, this day have I begotten thee; the Apostle apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whose priviledge it was to raise up himselfe from the

have power to take up my life againe. And being risen,
he was the first that ascended in body and soule into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thus consider Christ, as God, as Mediator, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,
as raised, and ascended; he is the Lords first born,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. The first borne of Israel was the second, and next
to the father of the family, yea, after the father, instead
of the father: So is Christ to his family, the Church; he
performes all offices of a carefull and tender father, and
takes on him not the affection onely of a father, but even
1. the name of a father. <hi>Isa. 9. 6. Father of eternity.</hi> 2 the

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18740:58"/>
brethren, and were chiefe in office and authority, rulers
in the house after their fathers, and Priests in the family,
before the Leviticall order was established. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 29.
when <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Esau,</hi> supposing him the

and let all thy mothers children honour thee.</hi> So all the

<hi>Iacob</hi> blesseth <hi>Iudah,</hi> this is added as his right: <hi>Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sonnes shall bowe downe unto thee.</hi> Here in they were
speciall types of Christ; who in all things must have the
preheminence as first in time, in order, in precedency,
first in the excellency and dignity of his person. Of
whom,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> comming into the world, was said: <hi>Let all the
Angels of God worship him.</hi> And for glory and authority
he sits on his fathers throne, the onely King of kings,
who hath <hi>a name above all names. Phil.</hi> 2. 9. And <hi>Heb. 2.
9.</hi> we see <hi>Iesus crowned with glory and honour,</hi> the head
of the mysticall body, the Prince and head of all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And besides he is the high Priest of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by offering up himselfe a sacrifice for us. Thus Christ
is first in order, in glory, in Priesthood.</p>
               <p>IV. The first borne had a <hi>double portion</hi> in goods,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Deut. 21</hi> 17. Signifying 1. The plenitude of the spirit
&amp; grace in Christ,<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 7.</note> who was anointed with oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>above</hi> all his fellowes. 2. The preheminence of
Christ in his glorious inheritance, advanced in glory and
majesty incomprehensible by all creatures.</p>
               <p>I. Out of the occasion of the Law of the first borne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Every mercy is the greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement unto God.</note>
learne, that the more God doth for any man, the more
he ought to conceive himselfe to be the Lords, and the
more right and interest the Lord challengeth in him.
For therefore the first borne were his by a speciall right,
because he had not onely delivered them out of Aegypt,
as others; but from the speciall plague of Aegypts first
borne. Speciall mercies call for speciall service. More
mercies are more bonds of obedience. And new mercies
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18740:59"/>
are so many new cords to draw and fasten us to God
and duty. Is it not reason, that the more it pleaseth the
Lord to become ours, the more we should become his?
Ought not great benefits become great binders? And
should not great love bee a great loadstone of love?
Should not strong cords of Gods love draw us strongly
to love our God? Examine the encrease of Gods mercies
on thee in all kindes, and whether they have had this
fruit, to make thee more dutifull. Hath God multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
blessing on thy head that thou shouldest blesse thy
selfe in wickednesse? Hath God continued mercy that
thou shouldest continue sinne? Art thou the Lords by
Creation, providence, redemption, stored with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
kindnesses pertaining to life and godlinesse, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a slave to sinne and Satan? Remember good <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
conclusion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 8, 9. My master hath dealt thus
and thus with me, advanced me from nothing to this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
committed all to my trust, kept nothing from me
but thee, <hi>How then can I doe this great wickednesse, and
sinne against God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If Christ be the true first borne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Honor Christ as the first born of God,</note> of whom all they
are but types; we must give him the honor of his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
The whole Church, and all the sonnes of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must honour him; all the sheaves of the brethren
must vaile and bowe to his sheave. Let not the basenesse
of his birth, the humility of his life, the ignominy of his
death, the shame of his crosse, the poverty of his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
the weaknesse and frailty of his followers, draw
our eyes aside from him (as the Jews at this day) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him the first borne, esteeming him (as doth
the Church) the chiefe of ten thousand; and with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

above our owne or other mens, confesse and professe his

upon him, and make him our chiefe refuge, for all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
depended on the first borne for protection, so doe
members on the head. 4. Greeve to offend him by
sin. How pitifully can men and women grieve for the
death of their first borne? So much more should we that

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ld comfort in the birthright.</note> 1. In
that Christ being the truth of the first borne, from him
the birthright is derived unto us beleevers as it was from
<hi>Reuben</hi> unto <hi>Iudah,</hi> and wee partake of the same birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with our head. For here is a difference betweene
the type and truth of the first borne. They had all their
priviledges for themselves: but Christ not for himselfe
but for us. Whence his elect members are called the
Congregation of the first borne written in heaven, that
is, whose names are written in the booke of life. And
farther; the more those first borne had, the lesse had the
other brethren: but the more Christ hath, the more have
we, seeing of his fulnesse we receive grace for grace. If
he be strong, he is strong for us, if rich, he is so to us.
If he be Prince and Priest of his family the Church, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we recover the dignity we had lost by sinne; and of
slaves and vassalls of corruption, are made <hi>Kings and
Priests,</hi> that is, the first borne <hi>to God, Rev.</hi> 1. 6. If he have
a double portion of the spirit, so have wee by him. <hi>Isa.
40. 2. speake to the heart of Ierusalem,</hi> her iniquity is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;
she hath received double at the Lords hand for
all her sinnes, that is, a double portion of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
As <hi>Ioseph</hi> made <hi>Benjamins</hi> messe to be doubled:
so our Jesus doubles his spirit on the elect. If he have a
double portion of glory, immortality, and heavenly
inheritance; so have we in him, being coheires with him
in the same inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 2. Comfort.
Being Gods first borne through Christ, wee are deare
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18740:60"/>
unto God. So <hi>Exod. 4. 22. Israel is my first borne,</hi> that is,
deare unto me, as the first borne, commonly are dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to their Parents. Israel, before his receiving into the
Covenant, was the worst of all people, and smallest in it
selfe, and in Gods eyes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. and 9. 4. But afterwards
being (in the right of the Messiah) Gods first borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
deare to him as the apple of his eye. Now what
a joy is it to the beleeving soule to see God a father
looke towards it as a father to his first borne? So fareth
it now with us, being so made in Christ. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
God takes notice, and revengeth all the wrongs
done to the Saints, because they are his first borne. Let
Aegypt offer injury to Gods first borne, God will say,
Slay every first borne of man and beast in Aegypt; let
them see, in the punishment, their sinne. For can a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
father see an arme or a legge of his first borne cut
off? Would it not go to his heart to see him dismembred?
And can the Lord Jesus endure any wrongs and cruelties
done to his members, and this not pierce his bowels?
A man may sometime see his child in want, and correct
his first borne for his farther good, send him to bee
schooled and trayned in some course under a sharpe
discipline; but to see him wounded, to see him bleed,
cast off, troden under fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>, he cannot endure: No more
the Lord. Let no man, never so great, dare to wrong the
godly; for he will rebuke Kings for their sakes.</p>
               <p>IV. Seeing in Christ the first borne wee attaine
the birthright;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Forfeit not the birthright by sin.</note> let every Christian beware of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and passing away his birthright as <hi>Esau,</hi> who <hi>sold
his birthright for pottage, Heb.</hi> 12. 16. and therefore called
<hi>prophane.</hi> So doe they that exchange spirituall things for
temporall, earth for heaven. As many, who pretend a
part in Christ; but in <hi>Esaus</hi> language say: Give me my
pottage, my silver, my honour, my profit, my pleasure,
let them take their religion, their preaching, praying,
and precisenesse, a bird in hand is worth two in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18740:60"/>
bush. This contempt of their priviledges robbed the
Jewes of them, who being cast out of favour, of first
borne become the last of all people, and now wee Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
are stept into their birthright. Let us be wise in
the entertayning our prerogative conscionably, expresse
our love to Christ and his Gospell, not hatred, as they,
least provoking the Lord he deale with us in justice as
he did with them. For if <hi>he spared not the naturall branches
(Rom. 11. 21.)</hi> What reason hath he to spare us?</p>
               <p>V. Learne to grow in conformity with our elder

in the spirituall union by regeneration, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 13. We
must be like him in affection, like him in affliction, like
him in the combat, and like him in the Crowne. How
like unto Christ is he that resists and despises the spirit
of grace, that having onely humane nature, hath no
whit of <hi>that divine nature, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. When heardest
thou this first borne brother to sweare or lye? Or be idle
in speech, wanton in behaviour, carelesse of his course,
or company? When was he ashamed of thy cause, of thy
Crosse, yea or curse? But thou art ashamed of his Crosse
and cause. When did he revile, rebuke, hate? Would
he be like us in every thing, even in our evills, sinne
onely excepted? should not we be like him in grace, to
be like him in glory?</p>

                  <p>I. The Choise had respect 1. To the tribe.
He must come of one onely tribe of Levi,<note place="margin">The choice respected, 1 Tribe.</note> which was
by God of all the tribes seperated, and appointed by God
to exercise the Priesthood in the Tabernacle, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
whatsoever belonged to the holy Ministery. This
signified Christ our Mediator who must bee a speciall
and singular man, <hi>taken from among men, Heb.</hi> 5. 1. as they,
true man as they. For he must be true man in nature and
affection that must mediate and negotiate mans cause
with God, and so taken from men to stand in the midst
betweene God and man. True it is, our Lord came not
of Levi, but <hi>out of Iudah, Heb.</hi> 7. 14. with the reason,
for he was not to be after the manner of <hi>Aaron, but of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18740:61"/>
Melchizedek, verse 15:</hi> and because hee was to change
the Priesthood, and would doe it in the tribe, and was
to bee <hi>a Priest not after the carnall commandement, but
after the power of endlesse life, verse</hi> 16. But yet he was
expressely typed by those Priests. Neither was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a spirituall signification, that <hi>Aaron</hi> the first of those
high Priests should bee <hi>Moses</hi> brother. For what more
brotherly league then of Christ to <hi>Moses,</hi> of grace to the
Law,<note place="margin">2. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> and of the new Testament to the Old? 2. To
the perfections. For in the choice of the Priest were
requisite many externall perfections. <hi>Levit. 21. 17. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of thy seed hath any blemishes, shall not prease to
offer the bread of his God.</hi> Hee must not be blind, lame,
nor mishapen. Wherein the Lord would not onely
provide for the dignity of that calling in that infancy of
the Church; which otherwise (if the Priesthood had
beene in outward shew contemptible) many might have
drawen not their persons onely into contempt, but even
all such holy things as they handled: But especially to
signifie Jesus Christ our high Priest to bee without all
blemish, the onely immaculate Lambe that takes away
the sinnes of the world. For although no other mortall
man could be without some blemish of sinne or other;
yet it became us to have such an high Priest as is holy,
harmelesse, undefiled, separate from sinners, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 26.
And as our Lord was spotlesse, and without all blemish;
so also perfect in all parts and perfections. He wanted
no part, no gift, no sufficiency to discharge that function
too weighty for men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>I. In this our unblemished high Priest wee have a
sufficient cover for all our blemishes both of soule and
body.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 1. A cover for all deformities of soule and body</note> 1. If never so blemished in soule by sinne, by
infirmity, if wee have a thousand wants and eye-sores;
if we bewaile and resist them, here is helpe and remedy
in our high Priest against them all. For as those persons
that had such blemishes might not stand at the Altar to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18740:62"/>
doe duties there, yet they were allowed in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and to eate from the Altar of the sacrifices as the
Preists did, <hi>Levit. 21. 22:</hi> So all defects and weaknesses,
which the Saints carry as a burthen, shall not hinder them
from participating in the good things purchased by
Christs sacrifice, nor cast them out of place of the elect,
neither here nor for ever. 2. Be thou never so ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished,
and deformed, or maimed in body, now (the
truth being come) God respects not according to the
outward appearance. And although the honour of the
Ministery must bee respected, and the choisest of our
children are not too good for Gods service; yet now
it is farre better, a good Minister without an eye, or a
hand, or foot; then a Congregation without a good
Minister.</p>
                  <p>II. All these outward perfections of the body in
all the Priests high and low,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 2. Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> point us to such endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and gifts of minde which the Lord expects in
Ministers, before they attempt this high calling. 1. He
of all men must not bee blind or ignorant. <hi>Hos. 4. 6.
Because thou hast refused knowledge, thou art rejected from
being a Priest to me.</hi> How should he be a light to others
that himselfe is in darknesse? If the eye bee darke so is
all the body. 2. Hee must not have either a blind or a
blemished eye, an eye filled with envie at another mans
gifts and prosperity: Nor a squint eye, looking indire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
upon every thing; not aiming at Gods glory, or the
building of Christs Kingdome, but his owne glory,
wrath, lusts, ends. 3. He must not be lame or cripled
in his feet, but make right steps to his feet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13.
Upright in his way; not right doctrine onely, but right
life also. 4. Hee must not have a flat nose, that is,
without discretion, or judgement to discerne truth and
falsehood, good and evill, things fit and unfit. As the
nose discernes smells; so to discerne companies and
courses. 5. Hee must not have a crooked backe, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18740:62"/>
downwards and almost broken with earthly cares;
hindering his eye from looking towards heaven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
heavenly contemplations and studye. And so
in the rest. Would God such care were had in the
choice and permission of Evangelicall Ministers, as in the
Old. We should not see the Churches pestered with so
many unworthy illiterate men fitter for any trade then
this so holy calling.</p>

                     <hi>verse</hi> 7. signified the
anointing of Christ with the holy Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<hi>Isai. 61. 1. The Spirit of the Lord hath anointed me
to preach. Psal. 45. 7. God, even thy God hath anointed
thee with the oile of gladnesse above all thy fellowes.</hi> In

anointed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matter.</note> In this anointing. 1. The matter, holy
Oile; signifying the Spirit of God and his gifts, for much
similitude and agreement betweene them. 1. That
was made of the most precious things in all the world,
<hi>Exod. 30. 25:</hi> So the holy graces of the Spirit are the
best things in the world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. there is no gift to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18740:63"/>
this. Oile swimmes aloft: So the Spirit and graces are
highest. 2. No stranger had that Oile, but onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and things sanctified: So none but Gods Elect
have these precious and saving mercies. <hi>Ioh. 14. 17. The
world cannot receive it,</hi> that is gifts not common, but of
sanctification. 3. That perfumd all the place where it
was: It is the Spirit of God that sweetens and perfumes
all our actions and natures, otherwise most corrupt and
loathsome to God. 4. That sanctified the thing to
which it was applied, and set it aside to an holy use.
Without this Oile the sacrifice of the Jew was as if hee
had killed a dog. It is the Spirit that sets us apart, and
sanctifieth to the Lord us, our persons, our actions, 2.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. The service that wants the spirit is hatefull
to God. 5. Oile is cleare and shining, and makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things anointed to shine: The holy Ghost within,
enlightneth the mind, and brings in the true light and
knowledge of God. 1. <hi>Ioh. 2. 27. the anointing shall teach
you all things.</hi> 6. Oile hath the force of fire in pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
and subtly pearcing, and is the fuell and feeder of
fire and flames: So the Spirit of God is a pearcing fire
in the heart, and kindles and maintaines in it the ardent
flames of the love of God. Holy thoughts as sparkes
flie upward. 7. Oile suppleth, cherisheth, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
So the Spirit of consolation anoints <hi>with oile of
gladnesse, Psal.</hi> 45. 7. It is he that brings peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
into consciences. 2. The measure, powred
in abundance upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head.<note place="margin">Measure.</note> Not dropped but pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
signifying the abundance of gifts and graces most
plentifully conferred upon Christ our head. For as it
was proper to the high Priest to bee anointed on the
head, whereas the common Priests were anointed but
in their hands, not on their heads: So was Christ as the
head anointed with oile above all his fellowes, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the spirit beyond measure,<note place="margin">Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> signified by powring on
the head. 3. The communication of this oile. It
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18740:63"/>
stayed not on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, but ranne downe his beard
even to the skirts of his garments: signifying that the
Spirit of grace distills from the head unto all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his mysticall body the Catholike Church. First
the Spirit descends and sits on Christs head, then on the
Apostles, in likenesse of fiery tongues, running downe as
it were by <hi>Aarons</hi> beard; and from them upon other
inferiour persons beleeving their word,<note place="margin">Psal. 133. 2.</note> as unto <hi>the skirts
of his garment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a threefold Application hereof.</p>
                  <p>I. In the anointing of the high Priest,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Eminency of Christ above all creatures.</note> the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Jesus Christ above all creatures; whose very Name
carrieth in it a note of principality, being called <hi>the high
Priest of our profession.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 1.</note> And in that this whole conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of the high Priest, in most solemne and stately
manner was but a darke shadow of his solemne inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
into his Office. And by this anointing Christ is
differenced from the most excellent Priests and Prophets
that ever were, <hi>Aaron, Moses, Elias.</hi> Some of them
had a most glorious vocation, as <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of their callings, graced with most divine and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
miracles: but never any had the spirit sitting on his
head but hee. None of them by their anointing had all
graces, nor any grace in perfection, but onely begunne
and in small degree. <hi>Moses</hi> a beleever wanted faith
sometime, as when he smote the Rocke which he should
have spoken to; and the meekest man in the world was
sometimes to seeke of his meeknesse. <hi>Aaron,</hi> though
the oyle was powred on his head, was weake; as in
murmuring against <hi>Moses,</hi> and in making the calfe: But
in our high Priest all graces and vertues were not incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
onely, but perfect. In him knowledge of God was
most perfect, holinesse most perfect, and all kinde of
graces in highest degrees. Grace sits in his lips, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to move the mind, but to change it. None of them
by anointing could receive graces for others, but for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18740:64"/>
themselves onely: but hee receives such a measure as
runnes over to the sanctifying of the lowest and meanest
of his members. Hence, 1. <hi>Ioh. 2. 27. the anointing which
wee have of him, dwells in you, and teacheth you all things.</hi>
And 2. <hi>Cor. 1. 21, 22. It is God that anointeth us in Christ;
and sealeth, and giveth us the earnest of the Spirit.</hi> Thus
our Lord Jesus is advanced above all, his oile shines
brightest, and swims aloft above all others.</p>
                  <p>II. In <hi>Aarons</hi> and Christs anointing and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Office:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 2. Ministers must increase their gifts.</note> Ministers must labour for a greater
measure of this ointment then others, to runne downe
from them to their skirts. They must pray by the Spirit,
watch by the Spirit, walke by the Spirit. An uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Minister may doe another good, but hee hath no
promise of blessing, nor doth any good to himselfe. As
the holy ointment was kept in the Sanctuary: So Christ
is the Sanctuary whence this oile comes. The pipes are
the word preached, Sacraments, prayer, societies of
the Saints and Gods people. And such Ministers as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously
contemne the conduit-pipes through which
this oile drops and flowes, scorne to come to Sermons,
and joyne in holy exercises; how doth their oile drie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
Instead of this oyle that should fall from them,
a deale of pitch and slime, froth and filthinesse falls on
their skirts.</p>
                  <p>III. In the communication of this ointment unto
us the skirts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 3. Duties of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate beleevers.</note> we learne that Christ is not for himselfe,
but for us. And therefore, 1. Examine if thou beest
anointed. This is to bee a Christian, to bee anointed as
Christ was. Scornest thou this holy oile in thy selfe or
others? Know thou shalt one day wish the mountaines
to fall on thee, on whom this oile falls not. 2. Hence
draw strength in temptation. Remember, If sollicited
to sinne, Oh I have the anointing; I am taken up, and
set apart to Gods use; I am for God and his glory, <hi>Neh.
6.</hi> 11. 3. Use meanes to attaine a farther measure, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18740:64"/>
be liker Christ. Thou missest a Sermon, or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
thou knowest not what drops of oile thou hast
missed. 4. Have a care to walke as such as are anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
smelling sweet every where in holy lives, speaches,
prayers; in all things edifying thy selfe and others.
Leave a sweet smell every where behinde thee. Let it
drop downe from us to others round about us.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the high Priests consecration was
sacrificing,<note place="margin">3. Sacrificing. Three sorts of sacrifices.</note> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 1, 2. In which, 1. Observe in
generall, that the Priests must be consecrated by offering
all sorts of sacrifices for them; and therefore they must
take a calfe, two rammes, unleavened bread, cakes and
oile, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. 1. Because of the speciall holinesse and
honour of their calling who are to come so neere unto
God, who will bee specially sanctified in all that come
neere him. 2. Because sinne in them is more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then in any other, and in expiating their sinnes, as
much is required as for the sinnes of all the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. Because they were to offer unto God all the
gifts and sacrifices of all the people of all sorts; and
therefore for them must be offered all sorts, to sanctifie
them not onely in generall, but to their speciall services
betweene God and his people.<note place="margin">1. A sinne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: Particulars 6.</note> 2. In particular: The
first of these sacrifices must be a sinne offering, <hi>verse</hi> 10.
For which they must; 1. Take a calfe and offer him
for the expiation of sinne, <hi>verse</hi> 14. This yong calfe was
a type of Christ, who onely by his owne oblation expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
our sinne, which otherwise made our selves and
duties most hatefull. 2. This calfe must be presented
before the Lord and his Congregation: signifying the
willingnesse of Christ to offer up himselfe for the sinnes
of men, <hi>Iohn. 19. 11. 3. Aaron</hi> and his sonnes must
put their hands on the head of the calfe, <hi>verse 10:</hi> not
onely to confesse they were worthy to die for their own
sinnes, but to professe also that the death which they
deserved, was by the death of the Messiah (the high
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18740:65"/>
Priest of the new Testament) removed off them, and
transferred upon the beast. And not onely the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our sinnes upon Christ; but also is signified that
wee must lay our hand by a true faith upon Christ our
head, if we expect any comfort from his death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
4. The calfe must be killed before the Lord, at
the doore of the Tabernacle, <hi>ver. 11:</hi> signifying both the
death and crucifying of Christ, as also the fruit of it by
the place. That by his death, as by a doore, an entry is
made for us into the Church, both militant and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. 5. The blood of that sinne-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for the Priest must be put on the hornes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and the rest powred at the foot of the Altar, <hi>vers 12:</hi>
signifying; 1. The sufficiency of Christs death to
purge and reconcile us to God. 2. The plenty of
grace and merit in it for many more then are saved by it.
For being sufficient for all, it is not helpfull to all, nor to
any that tread under foot this precious blood; the extent
of the benefit is to all the elect. 3. The large spreading
and preaching of the Gospel of salvation by Christs
blood, through all the coasts and corners of the earth (as
the blood sprinckled on the foure corners) and that by
the finger, hand, and ministery of men. 6. The fat
must bee offered unto God; but the flesh, skinne, and
dung must be burnt with fire without the host: signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
1. That Christ offered himselfe, and the best
parts he had, suffering in soule and body. 2. That hee
must suffer without the host, without the gate of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. and carried out our sinnes out of
Gods sight. 3. That nothing but blood comes on the
Altar: For onely the blood of Christ his Sonne clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
us from all sinne.</p>
                  <p>Note hence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> No perfection, but onely in Christ.</note> that the Priests in the Law must bee put
in mind that they were sinners, and needed a sacrifice for
themselves. By which they were to take notice of a
difference betweene themselves and our high Priest.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18740:65"/>
1. There was no perfection in their persons; for they
must offer, and lay their hands on the head of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
confessing guiltinesse. 2. Nor in their Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in which the high Priest need offer for his owne sins.
3. Nor in all their Consecration; they could offer no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to wash away any sinne, their owne nor others;
onely they did point at the sacrifice of Christ: but by his
consecration he could offer himselfe a meritorious and
sufficient sacrifice for the sinnes of his elect. Thus is our
high Priest advanced above them all.</p>
                  <p>The second of these sacrifices in the Consecration of
the high Priest was to be a burnt offering or Holocaust.<note place="margin">2. A burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>ing, or Holocaust.</note>
The use of which was to signifie the dedication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and all that he had,<note place="margin">Particulars 4.</note> to be purified by the Spirit (as
by fire) to the use of God in his service, as that Holocaust
was, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, and 19. Most things in this were common
with the former. 1. The blood must be sprinkled on
the Altar round about: signifying the full remission of
sinnes purchased by the blood of Christ, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of all his benefits, and the vertue of his whole
passion to be applyed to the whole Church; for sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
still betokens application. 2. The inwards and
legs must be washed in water, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. signifying that
Christ should bring no uncleane thing in his offering,
but he should be absolutely pure within and without; in
his minde, thoughts, affections, signified by the inwards;
and in his conversation, motions and walkings, signified
by the legs. 3. The burning of the offering wholly,
<hi>ver.</hi> 18. signified 1. the ardent love of Iesus Christ;
who was all consumed as it were with the fire of love
and zeale towards mankinde upon the Crosse. 2. The
bitternesse of his passion in his whole man, who was as
it were consumed wholly with the fire of his fathers
wrath due to the sinnes of man. 4. As the burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ascended up to heaven in fire: So Iesus Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
offered himselfe a whole burnt offering ascended
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18740:66"/>

1. The blood of this Lambe was to be put on the lap of

The feet to direct and lead into all holy moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Christ that we may be wholly cleane. As both our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

that both Priest and people have part and interest in the
death of Christ; as also that Christ did not onely deliver
himselfe to death for us, as this Ram, but also giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to feed us to eternall life. <hi>Iohn 6. 55. My flesh is

1. The lifting up and heaving of Christ upon the Crosse.
2. The heaving up of our hearts in thankfulnesse to God
for so great benefits. 3. That the merits of Christ our
true sacrifice, and benefits of his death should, by the
preaching and publication of the Gospell, be spred abroad
into all corners of the world, as that sacrifice was shaken
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18740:67"/>

all leaven of sinne. 2. That Priest and people must in
service to God lay aside all leaven of maliciousnesse.
3. The oyle notes the soft and loving kindnesse of
God and Iesus Christ, chearing and suppling the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                        <hi>Note.</hi> Wash and purge all with the blood of Christ.</note> as the eare, hands, and feete of the high
Priest must be touched with blood before he attempt any
part of his office: so our care must be that all our parts
all our actions and affections bee touched and purged
with the blood of Christ. So <hi>David, Psal. 51. 2. Wash
me throughly. Reason.</hi> 2. Because sinne hath defiled
the whole man; all his parts, all his actions, all within
him, all without him. 2. This foulenesse sticks so fast,
as it is no easie matter to bee cleansed. Nothing in the
world can fetch out this soile but the blood of Christ.
Not all the water in the sea, nor all the holy water in the
Sea of Rome can wash away one sinne. 3. All thou
doest or performest depends upon the merit of this
blood, and dignity of this person and passion for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The knowledge of thy duty must be sprinkled

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is not enough that Christs blood be shed,
but it must also be sprinkled. If thou contentest not thy

to lay hold on Christs blood and besprinkle thy selfe with

faith, which takes up the blood of Christ, and applyes it
to ones selfe, as did <hi>Paul,</hi> who dyed for me. 3. If

for the outward man, 1. If thy right eare bee
touched, thou hast the hearing eare rightly to heare the
word of God. Thou hearest to learne; for to hearken is
better then the fat of Rammes. 2. If thy right hand be
touched, that thou art an active Christian, not an hearer
onely of the word but a doer, and unto knowledge of
the doctrine of faith joynest obedience of faith, thou
keepest the faith working, as knowing that obedience is
better then sacrifice, thou darest not doe what seemes
good to thy selfe, or is right in thy owne eyes, but what
is rightly ruled by Gods word, for that is the right
hand touched. 3. If thy right foot be touched, that
thou walkest in the right way with a right foot, not
making crooked pathes to thy feet, but ordering thy
conversation aright. And all this with right ends and
affections, the feet of the soule laying aside all sinister
ends and intentions in all thy obedience, and directing
all to the honour of the true <hi>Aaron</hi> and high Priest
Jesus Christ. 4. If thou findest the effects of Christs
blood sprinckled.<note place="margin">Effects two.</note> 1. Pacification of conscience, for this
blood speakes better things then <hi>Abels</hi> for us, and in us;
for us, to God by intercession: in us, by perswasion that
the Lord looking on the blood of Christ, rests wholly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18740:68"/>
on it as a full satisfaction for all our sinnes; for this is
the end of shedding, <hi>remission of sinnes, Mat. 26. 28;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of sprinkling. 2. Daily <hi>sanctification through this
sprinckling. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. For out of the side of Christ issues
water as wel as blood; the one redeeming from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vaine conversation, the one purgeth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the death of works,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> the other <hi>from dead works</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
The sprinkling of this blood admits not security,
or idlenesse, and carelesnesse; nor suffers a man to sinne
against this blood by impenitency, unbeleefe, despising of
grace, horrible swearing, and foule lusts. But makes the
Christian truely noble, as one now descended of the
blood of Christ; scorning the base and foule courses he
formerly affected. Find these markes, and comfort thy
selfe, thou art sprinkled with Christs blood. Thy whole
course is sanctified; all thy hearing, all thy obedience, be
it never so weake in it selfe, bee thy unworthinesse
never so great, it shall bee no barre to thine acceptance
with God, for every thing sprinkled with this precious
blood is sweetned and accepted.</p>

Priest to his office, is his apparrell, appointed by God,
and called holy garments, glorious and beautifull; farre
differing from all other mens. And they signified, 1. The
function to be glorious and excellent. 2. The fitnesse
of their persons to that office. 3. The glory of the
true high Priest Jesus Christ, of whom <hi>Aaron</hi> was but
a figure. For all the glistering shew of these Priestly
garments set forth the more the Angelicall brightnesse
of all the vertues which should shine in Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">The Priests garments in number tenne, whereof foure belonged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Priests.</note> The Priestly garments appointed by God were tenne in

                     </gap>oure belonged to the inferiour
Priests, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 40. 42. 1. A linnen garment:
Which signified the white garment of CHRISTS
righteousnesse and innocency;<note place="margin">1. A linnen garment.</note>
which they were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18740:68"/>
in before the Lord if they would be acceptable in
their persons or duties. Noting to us by the way, that
every godly Minister weares a white linnen garment, not
woven and made by men, but by God; not without him,
but within him; not a shadow or ceremony, but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and truth, to which all shadowes give place. Nay
there is no private man that is godly but he must weare
this white linnen garment, having put it on in the laver
of regeneration: as <hi>Gal. 3. 27. whosoever are baptized into
Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. A girdle.</note> 
                     <hi>have put on Christ.</hi> 2. A girdle vers. 40. which
signifies constancy and stability in the truth, both in our
high Priest Jesus Christ, who was not a reed shaken but
a firme rocke: as also in his members, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>to stand fast, their lines girt with verity, Eph.</hi> 6. 14.
Hence followes, That the Ministers word must not be
yea and nay; his course must be constantly gracious and
watchfull. And for private Christians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9. Be not
carried about with divers and strange doctrines; for it is
a good thing that the heart bee stablished with grace.
3. A bonnet,<note place="margin">3. A bonnet.</note> 
                     <hi>vers.</hi> 40. A symbole and signe to them of
Gods protection still covering them in their faithfull
service: signifying to us the Lords cover and faithfull
protection both over our head, and over his members
for his sake. So as, every faithfull Minister hath a bonnet,
Christ carries him as a starre in his right hand, and covers
him from the rage of Satan and the world, else should he
not stand a minute. And every faithfull member of
Christ is so covered as an haire cannot fal (much lesse the
head) without the will of his heavenly father.<note place="margin">4. Breeches.</note> 4. The
breeches, ver. 42. putting more comelinesse upon the
uncomely parts. Signifying to them and us 1. What
reverence we ought to use in the service of God; farre
remooving thence every uncomely thing. 2. Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
out the true and perfect holinesse, with which
Christs humanity was cloathed; and not onely with that
but with the Majesty of his deity, which highly graced
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18740:69"/>
and honoured the despised and fraile humanity, which
had <hi>no forme nor beauty, Isa.</hi> 53. 2. 3. Not darkely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
that care and respect which our Lord and
Saviour Christ hath of his inferiour, base, and despised
both Ministers and members through the world. <hi>Isa. 41.

                  </p>
                  <p>To the high Priest belonged sixe peculiar garments,<note place="margin">To the high Priest sixe.</note> First the Ephod, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. In which 1. The matter, it was
not wooll or silke,<note place="margin">1. The Ephod: where Matter.</note> but linnen which riseth out of the
earth, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. 17. Signifying that holy flesh of Christ
which vayled his deity as a garment; and that it was
taken not from heaven but from his mother on earth,
as the matter of that garment grew immediately out of
earth.<note place="margin">Forme.</note> 2. The forme, it was a long white garment:
signifying the long white garment of Christs absolute
righteousnesse; white, innocent and unspotted; and long,
to cover all our nakednesse, without eeking or patching
of merits.<note place="margin">Ornament.</note> 3. The ornament of it. In it were set two
Onyx stones, and in them the names of the twelve
tribes of Israel ingraven, which <hi>Aaron</hi> carryed upon his
shoulders: signifying 1. That the names of the godly are
not lightly written but fast ingraven in the love and
memory of Christ, as those names were ingraven in very
hard stones. 2. That Christ doth still carry his Church
on his shoulders; lifting them up out of dust and misery,
and bearing them upon the shoulders of his power and
providence as on Eagles wings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11. Or as the
good shepheard brings home the sheepe on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 5. According to his gracious promise,
<hi>Isa. 46. 4, I have made you; I will also beare you, and I
will carry you and deliver you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vse.</note> 4. The use of it. The
high Priest in this garment carryed on his shoulders the
names of Israel into the Sanctuary before God: so our
high Priest in the garment of his righteousnesse presents
his Church (shadowed by the twelve tribes) without
spot or wrinckle or any such thing; and carries into
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18740:69"/>
heaven on his shoulders, even into the true Sanctuary
not made with hands, those whose names are written
in the booke of life.<note place="margin">Distinction.</note> 5. Distinction. As the high
Priest carryed the names in severall precious stones, and
severally ingraven: so our high Priest takes speciall notice
of every particular member of the Church, neglects not
the meanest, but knowes them by name, as the head
can name every member of the body, and contemnes not
the meanest. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 4, the Church of Sardi had a few
names, that is, godly persons so well knowne to Christ
as men by their names.<note place="margin">Propriety.</note> 6. The propriety of it. It
was not lawfull for any but <hi>Aaron</hi> and the high Priest
to use this garment, nor might any imitate it, for it was
the fall of <hi>Gideons</hi> house, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 26, 27, for making an
Ephod like that of the Sanctuary. It is true there were
ordinary Ephods holy garments common to inferiour
Priests, as <hi>Saul</hi> put to the sword foure score and five
Priests that wore an Ephod, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18. And used by
the Levits, as <hi>Samuel</hi> very young ministred in an Ephod,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 18. And it may be there were some garments
called Ephods which great men did weare, and no holy
garment, as 2 <hi>Sam. 6. 14. David</hi> danced before the Arke
girt with a linnen Ephod. But this Ephod was peculiar
to the high Priest, and in no garment else might he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the names of the twelve tribes: signifying that no
garment of righteousnesse may be expected or imitated,
in which God can behold his Church, but this of Jesus
Christ. And whosoever seeke elsewhere, <hi>are abolished
from Christ</hi> to their destruction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. 4. Oh the
fearefull case of Papists that seeke to have their names
written in another Ephod of their owne weaving and
making!</p>
                  <p>The second garment peculiar to the high Priest,<note place="margin">2. The breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> was
called the brestplate of judgement, <hi>ver. 15:</hi> the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
part of all his garments.</p>
                  <p>I. In respect of the twelve costly and glistering
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18740:70"/>
stones which were set in foure rowes according to the
number of the tribes,<note place="margin">Precious stones Shining.</note> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to the 22. In which 1. The
shining of these stones signified the shining purity and
innocency of Jesus Christ both in himselfe, and in his
members. If they be pure as the sun, faire as the Moone,
what is he?<note place="margin">Worth.</note> 2. Their price, of great value and worth:
signifying what a price the Lord Jesus valued his
Church at. He accounteth not beleevers as common and
base stones, but more precious then his owne life. How
vile and despicable soever they seeme to men, and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under foot heere below as common pebles; yet
Jesus Christ sets another price on them. 3. Their
place or situation.<note place="margin">Place.</note> They are set in the pectorall, and
<hi>Aaron</hi> must carry them on his heart: signifying that
Christ hath as much care of his Church as if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in his heart; lets out his blood to make roome in
his heart for them.<note place="margin">Number.</note> 4. Their number, Twelve, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all the tribes: noting that there is a roome in the
heart of Christ for every one of the elect. None can
anticipate or prevent other. With him is plentifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
The former without the latter shall not be
perfected,<note place="margin">Order.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 40. 5. Their order. They stand
in foure rowes in a comely quadrangle: signifying the
comely order that Christ hath stablished in the Church:
some in higher place, some in lower, some of one ranke
and vertues, some of another, as those stones, but all stand
seemely and fitly<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> And this order wee must maintaine,
keepe our rankes as they did.<note place="margin">Figure.</note> 6. The figure. The
foure square, <hi>ver. 16:</hi> signifying the stability and firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Church, as a foure square turne it any way is
firme. Satan and all deceivers shall not pick one stone
out of Christs Pectorall. The gates of hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
against him that is fixed in that rocke and stone of
Israel.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> 7. Their use. That <hi>Aaron,</hi> who before bare
the names of Israel on his shoulders before the Lord,
might now beare them on his heart continually for a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18740:70"/>
remembrance before the Lord, when he goeth into the
holy place, <hi>ver. 29:</hi> signifying 1. The ardent love of
Jesus Christ towards his Church, who beares it not
onely on his shoulders as a shepheard, nor onely in his
armes as a nurse: but upon his heart, and in his heart
never to forget our good. If <hi>Aaron</hi> may forget the names
he carries upon his shoulders, he cannot the names upon
his breast or heart, so cannot Christ forget the Church he
hath taken into his heart. <hi>Isa. 49. 15, Can a woman forget
her child, and not have compassion on the sonne of her
wombe? though they should forget, yet will not I forget thee.</hi>
2. Bearing of the names continually before the Lord
on his heart, signifieth the continuall mindfulnesse and
intercession of Jesus Christ for his Church in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
sanctuary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. By vertue of which all our
prayers get audience and acceptance.<note place="margin">Quantity.</note> 8. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
As all the names of Israell were gathered into a
narrow compasse: so Jesus Christ our Mediator shall
<hi>gather together into one, all the despersed sonnes of
God:</hi> and present them before God as the most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and precious parts of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 52. He shall
make a short account in the earth, in comparison of the
wicked who will take up more roome.</p>

above them all, to which their light is obscurity.
Plainly signifying Jesus Christ <hi>in whom are hid treasures of
wisdome and knowledge, Col. 2. 3. He is the light of the
world, Ioh. 9. 5. Which enlighteneth every one that commeth
into the world, Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. There are many lights, as stones
and stars, in the world: but he is the sun, nay he is lights.
With him is <hi>many-folded wisdome.</hi>

to whom can this point us but unto Christ; in whom
alone are all perfections of holinesse and graces. There
is illumination in the twelve stones the Church, but not
any perfection; there is some purity in the stones, but
farre from perfection of it. In Christ is perfection in all

                  <p>II. The use of them was to receive by them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from God when the high Priest consulted with
him,<note place="margin">Vse of them.</note> 
                     <hi>vers.</hi> 30. For when the Priest asked counsell of God,
God is said to answer by Urim, that is, not by the colour
of the stones, nor the changing of colour by brightnesse,
blacknesse, or bloodinesse of them (as some Jews) but
<hi>the Lord answered by voyce. Numb</hi> 7. 89. And therefore
it is called the Urim of Judgement, not because it selfe
gave judgement or decided causes; but because the Lord
answered when the Priest applyed the Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim.
This directly looked at Christ, as to whom 1. all
secrets and Mysteries are perfectly knowne. He is <hi>the
Lamb with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God,
Rev. 5. 6. Onely worthy to open the booke, ver.</hi> 9. because of
his abundant grace and wisdome, signified by the seven
spirits. 2. Who makes knowne and continually
reveales to his Church and members, as their need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
whatsoever is meete for them to know, by such
meanes as himselfe hath sanctified.</p>
                  <p>Now although this was a great priviledge of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18740:71"/>
first Temple; and the second did want it, that they might
not be kept from desire &amp; expectation of the true Urim
and Thummim: yet we in the new Testament are farre
beyond them. For as the Oracle by Urim was certaine
for direction: so Christ is the most perfect rule and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
shadowed by that. As the Urim answered by
voice: so Christ by his word preached. As God spake
then by Urim to the Priest: <hi>So now by his owne sonne.
Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Wouldst thou have God answer thee? goe to
the Urim. 1. Frequent his ordinance. God then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
when the Priest consulted. 2. Pray for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<hi>If any want wisedome, let him aske of God and it
shall be given him, Iam.</hi> 1. 5. 3. Feare God. <hi>Psal. 25.
14. The secret of the Lord is with them that feare him.</hi>
4. Follow and obey the voice. <hi>Iohn 14. 21. If any love
me and obey my commandements, I will love him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale

                  </p>
                  <p>The third peculiar garment of the high Priest was the
robe of the Ephod,<note place="margin">3. The Robe: Particulars. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Exod. 28. 5, 31:</hi> On the skirts of
which were fastened, 1. The Pomegranats of blue
silke, and purple, and skarlet round about. This fruit
hath a most pleasant smell, sweet in it selfe, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
other things round about it; and is full of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
iuyce and liquor: 2. Bells of gold between them
round about, a golden Bell and a Pomegranat; the use
of which was that his sound might be heard round about
when hee went into the Sanctuary and holy of Holies.
The whole garment signified the righteousnesse of
Christs humane nature, which is, 1. Most sweet it
selfe, having a most pleasant savour as the Pomegranate.
2. Full of most precious iuyce and vertue, to qualifie
and abate the raging heat of Gods displeasure, as the
iuyce of Pomegranats doth allay the burning heat of
an ague that would shake the body to pieces: 3. Casts
upon us a sweet savour being wrapped in it: For wee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18740:72"/>
by nature, stinking in our sinnes and rottennesse, are
loathsome to the Lord; but once covered with this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
wee are a sweet savour to God; who now speaks
of us as <hi>Isaac</hi> of <hi>Iacob</hi> covered in his elder brothers gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<hi>My sonne is as the savour of a field which the
Lord hath blessed, Gen.</hi> 27. 27. 3. This garment hath a
sweet sound, as of golden Bells, which to heare were
most delectable: because the garment of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
brings grace to us no otherwise then by the
sound of the Gospel. For faith, by which wee put on
Christ, is wrought by hearing the sweet sound and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Bell of the Gospel. Whence some have thought,
that by this part of the Priests Attire, is shadowed the
Propheticall Office of Christ. Sweet is the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospel of peace. 4. The use. That by
these Bells the Priests must bee heard when hee goeth
into the Sanctuary: signifying the power of Christ our
high Priests perpetuall intercession (being entred into
the Sanctuary of heaven) for his elect and chosen.</p>
                  <p>The fourth peculiar garment was the Miter or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
upon his head,<note place="margin">4. The Miter: Particulars. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>verse</hi> 36. 1. Made of blue silke and
fine linnen, <hi>verse</hi> 39. like (as it seemes) to an halfe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet.
2. Beautified with a golden plate, on which
was written: Holinesse to the Lord. 3. The use.
<hi>Aaron</hi> must ever have it on his forehead while he beares
the iniquity of their offerings, to make the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
before the Lord, <hi>verse</hi> 38. 1. The miter and
crowne on the Priests head signified, 1. The Deity of
Christ our head, which as a crowne or circle wants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and end: 2. The Kingly Office of Christ,
with all that honour and crowne of glory set on the
head of our Redeemer, to whom all power is given in
heaven and in earth. And according to his power is
his name; for God hath exalted him, and given him a
Name above all names, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. His stile is not onely
King of Saints, <hi>Revel. 15. 3:</hi> But King of kings, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18740:72"/>
Lord of lords, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 16. 2. The golden plate in
which was written, <hi>Holinesse to the Lord,</hi> did not onely
distinguish it from the miters of the ordinary Priests,
which wanted such a plate: but specially typified Iesus
Christ our head, in whom was most conspicuous (as in
a mans forehead) a most divine and perfect holinesse,
purer then the gold of that plate. Who was not holy
onely, as other sanctified persons, but holinesse it selfe.
Holinesse in his person, holinesse in his nature, holinesse
in all his actions and passions; holinesse in the fountaine
and originall, whence all streames of holinesse issue forth
to his elect members. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 19. I sanctifie my selfe,
that they may be sanctified. Never was there so pure a
plate, such shining holinesse, so deeply ingraved as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can raze it out for ever. 3. The use was signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant;
that as the high Priest, having on this plate with
this inscription, got the iniquities of the people pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which he bare before the Lord: So our high Priest
Jesus Christ, presenting before his Father, his most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
holinesse, gets a pardon for all our sinnes, which
he beares upon himselfe. And as their sinnes were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in respect of the high Priest, who represented
Christ:<note place="margin">Propter summum Sacerdotem.</note> So both theirs and ours are indeed and truth
pardoned, for the true and eternall high Priest, who is
Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The fifth peculiar garment was the embroydered
Coate of fine linnen,<note place="margin">5. The embroydered Coate.</note> 
                     <hi>verse</hi> 39. which was a beautifull,
costly and large garment, reaching downe to his feet,
covering most of his body; curiously wrought with
most precious matter and cunning workmanship: which
noted the dignity of the person, and office of the high
Priest. For in old time long white garments appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to men of high place, and excellent in wisedome:
As in <hi>Iosephs</hi> advancement, <hi>Gen. 41. 42. hee was clothed
with white fine linnen,</hi> when he was to bee Vice-roy, and
next in authority to the King. See <hi>Ester</hi> 6. 8. how <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18740:73"/>
was apparalled by the Kings command. This gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was most proper to our high Priest of the new
Testament Jesus Christ; who is by it described, <hi>Revel.
1. 13. clothed with a robe downe to his feet.</hi> Noting,
1. The excellencie of his person; who is <hi>Prince of

                     <hi>Isai. 9. 6:</hi> For so, long white garments ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened
peace both within the Church and without.
2. That hee excelled in wisedome and counsell, being
the great Counseller, and <hi>the spirit of counsell and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

and beautifull connexion and conjunction of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,
Priestly, and Princely Offices; sincerely and
perfectly fulfilling them, and appearing before God in
them as in a most costly embroydered garment consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many pieces, and many colours fitly couched and
laid together. And this garment hee ware not onely in
earth (as the Priests did) but now after his ascension
he continues to performe the Offices of the high Priest
for his Church: in the same embroydered garment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
before God the merit of his onely sacrifice, and
making intercession to the Father for it.</p>
                  <p>The sixth garment is the girdle of needle worke,<note place="margin">6. The girdle.</note>

use of it was to fasten the Priests garments unto him,
that they might not hang loose upon him in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
And specially points out unto us our high
Priest Jesus Christ described after his ascension, <hi>Revel. 1.
13. to bee girded about the paps with a golden girdle.</hi>
Noting in Christ foure things.<note place="margin">Foure things in Christ noted thereby.</note> 1. The truth and

Girding of the attire hath ever beene a signe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,

12. 35. Let your loines be girded about.</hi> 4. His mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and care in performing his office. For as not gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is a signe of carelessenesse and negligence: So
girding, of care and industry. So our Lord and high
Priest never carelessely cast off any poore and penitent
sinner: But in the dayes of his flesh minded their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
and now in heaven keeps on his girdle, casts not
off the care of his Church, but perpetually accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
whatsoever is needfull for her salvation.</p>

some things for the people. 1. All about the
Priest must bee gold, silver, precious stones, curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
signifying that no vile or base thing must be in the
Ministers cariage or behaviour. But as the Priests costly
garments covered the frailty of their bodies, and graced
them in their office: so the graces of their mindes must
not onely hide their weaknesse, but adorne and beautifie
them for the honour and prosperity of their function.
And the rather, because this corrupt age is bent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
this holy profession, care should be had both of
keeping out, and thrusting out vile persons. And those
who are in this calling should labour to shine in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

plate of gold in which was written, Holinesse to the
Lord:<note place="margin">Speciall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> so the Ministers of the new Testament must labour
for speciall holinesse. If every meane servant in the house
must be holy, much more the steward of the houshold.
And if every private Christian must follow holinesse,
without which no man shall see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. much
more the ministers. They that cary the vessels of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18740:74"/>
Lord must be holy. Alas, how afraid are many of this
Plate, for spoiling of their preferment? It was a chiefe
grace of the chiefe Minister of the old Testament: with
us a chief disgrace; and too much purity to cary holinesse
in our foreheads in our profession. Wee can put on this
plate in the Pulpit, and suppose it fit for the Temple, but
in our private houses cast it aside.</p>
                  <p>V. As the Priests must have in their skirts both bells <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and Pomegranats: so must every Evangelicall Minister.<note place="margin">They must bee good preachers and good livers</note>
1. The bells allow them not to be dumbe dogs, <hi>Isa. 56.
10.</hi> but the sound of the Law and Gospell must clearely
sound in their mouthes to be heard afarre off. 2. These
bells must be of gold, to put Ministers in minde that their
doctrine be pure; not corrupt, not savouring of Popery,
liberty, or selfe-respect. 3. They must never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the congregation without these bells; for Ministers
must still be furnished with some sound matter of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and edification. How is it then that many come
into the Congregation and never bring bells? Many are
afraid lest the sound of their bells should bee heard too
much, and that it would disgrace them to be counted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
preachers? And many scorne others that their
bells sound so often? 2. To the bells ministers must
joyne Pomegranates: With the wholesome word joyne
good workes and holy life. He caries the bell, a minister
whose life is agreable with holy doctrine. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 19.

<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had, both bells (being a burning light in
himselfe) and Pomegranates; being a shining light unto
others. And as the Pomegranates smelled sweet: so
must ministers labour to leave a sweet smell behinde
them every where. Their conversation must not savour
of lightnesse, pride, ambition, covetousnesse, contention,
prophanenesse, &amp;c.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> VII. As the Priests had these garments girded unto

for these garments differ some what from theirs.
They might put off their garments when they came out
of the holy place: but ministers of the Gospell may not
put off theirs when they come out of the Church; no nor
when they goe to bed, nor about any businesse; they must
never come off. Many are so dissolute and ungirt, and
these garments are so loose on them, as they give just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the people to say; that they be good only in the
Pulpit; and so their people learne of them to be good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Church. Wee must girt our graces fast to us.

although they passed from one to another as that Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
did: So no other robe save of this one and onely
true and high Priest must be presented before God; no
robe of our owne workes or merits; no robe made or
woven by men or creatures; not by Popes, Saints living
or dead, or Angels. We must never change this garment;
nor abide to see any challenge it but the high Priest our
Lord Jesus. And hence for ever detest the wicked and
abominable Masse, with those sacrilegious Priests, who
usurpe these garments of Iesus Christ and tell us they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
propitiatory sacrifices for the sinnes of the quick and
dead. The theeves that spoiled Christ of his garments,
and divided them among themselves, did him no such
despite as these theeves doe, who rob him and disrobe
him of all his glory.</p>
                  <p>II. Every Christian is made a priest unto God by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. As a Priest, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. But not legall and externall; for
they were dated by the priesthood of Christ: but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall,
improper, and spirituall. Neither to offer reall,
and externall sensible sacrifices, which all had end by
Christs onely sacrifice upon the Crosse: but spirituall
sacrifices; such as, <hi>Calves of the lips, Heb.</hi> 13. 15. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<hi>of a broken heart. Psal. 51. 17. Of almes, with
which God is well pleased. Heb. 13. 16. Of mortification.
Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and of good works and duties of all sorts.
<hi>Of prayer, Psal.</hi> 141. 2. Now before any of these sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
can finde acceptance we must all put on holy and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
garments. Never was any priest or performance
pleasing without his garments; the use of which was to
cover and adorne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What garments must we put on?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Iacob</hi> before he could get his fathers blessing
must put on his elder brothers garment,<note place="margin">In our priestly garments.</note> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 15. so
must we <hi>put on the Lord Iesus Christ. Rom.</hi> 13. 14.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Put on whole Christ,<note place="margin">How put on.</note> as the Priest all his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
1. By making him our owne; we must weare
our owne garments. Speciall faith unites to Christ, and
marieth us to him, that he is ours, and we his. 2. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thy selfe with the sacrifice of his death. <hi>Adam</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sinned covered his nakednesse with skins of dead
beasts: signifying that all his sinfull posterity must cover
themselves with the sacrifice of Christ dead; the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and perfection of which, is the linnen Ephod in
which thou being wrapped, must offer up thy sacrifice.
3. Array thy selfe with his vertues, to adorne and decke
thee. This is the broidered coat which thou must weare,
of manifold vertues and graces; which as jewels and
ornaments must shine in thy life, as the many glistering
stones did in the breastplate. So the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 4. 24.
Put on the new man created after God in righteousnesse and
holinesse.</hi> 4. Put on Christ by Christian profession. Our
apparell is seene, and makes us knowne to others. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
make themselves knowne by their cloth they
weare, whose they are. The Priest must put on the Plate
on his forehead, and we are commanded to cary the name
of God and the Lambe in our foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. that
men may never see our faces, but therein reade the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and innocency of our conversation. 5. Put on the
girdle, <hi>Have thy loines girded. Luke</hi> 12. 35. Stand in a
readinesse, 1. To all duties of Christianity. 2. To
all acceptable sacrifices of faith, repentance, prayer, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
obedience. 3. To offer up our selves by life or
death to the glory and praise of God. We had need bee
thus begitt that we may stand to the confession and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the truth, not knowing when or what tryalls
will come; besides that the world, nor pleasure, nor lusts
seldome finde us unprepared. And can he be a good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
who is alwayes unprepared for his Princes service;
but ever ready to serve his enemy.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Comfort to the godly.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. From the being arrayed with these garments,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18740:76"/>
the poore members of the Church have a ground of
much comfort; in respect 1. of their head so arrayed.
2. of themselves, and in respect of themselves consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those garments. 1. in the generall. 2. in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. In Christ so arrayed.</note> in respect of our high Priest Jesus Christ thus
gloriously arrayed. 1. In the Ephod we see his mighty
power, who caries his Church upon his shoulders of
power and protection. Alas I where should wee lie if
our Lord did not lift us up, and beare us up! But now we
never need to discourage our selves, by casting what
shall become of the Church or religion, if such and such
projects prevaile, for so long as we are on Christs shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
we are safe. 2. In the Pectorall behold the ardent
and surpassing love of Jesus Christ to his Church. For as
he caries us on his shoulders by his power: so he caries
our names on his heart by his love. This our true high
Priest cannot forget his Saints when he seemes to turne
his backe on them, but still hath their names before his
eye. And this is the happinesse of the Church, in which
she may well rest her selfe; that (according to her prayer
<hi>Cant. 8. 6.)</hi> Christ setteth her <hi>as a seale on his heart, and
as a signet on his arme.</hi> How is it possible to forget that
which is sealed on the heart? How can the eye look off
the signet on the arme? For a signet, because it is most
precious, is most carefully kept; and being upon the arm
of Christ, what arme can pull us off from him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Oh that I might know my happinesse to bee
set on Christs heart!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If thou wouldst be set as a signet on the Lords
arme, become the Lords servant, and be faithfull in this
service. See <hi>Hag. 2. 23. O Zerubbabel my servant, I will
set thee as a signet.</hi> 3. In his Miter wee see our high
Priest crowned with honour and glory above all men and
Angels. And all the Church must say (as <hi>Psal. 132. 18.)
On him let his Crowne flourish.</hi> And if the dignity of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18740:77"/>
head be the honour of the members, and the power of
the head the safety of the members: then from hence
we have no small consolation. 4. In his Plate wee see
holinesse ingraven on his forehead, that all our senses
and thoughts must be fixed in the forehead of our onely
high Priest, from whom all holinesse floweth to his
Church, Oh what matter of joy is it to see, that we (in
our selves so foule every way, in our nature, in our course,
&amp; shut out of heaven where no unclean thing commeth)
have in him a fountaine of holinesse set open for us! For
he is made to us of God wisdome, sanctification, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In respect of themselves. In generall.</note> in respect of themselves (by meanes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ) the members of the Church thus arrayed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
sure and stable consolation. For 1. In generall they
all afford us this comfort, that through Christ our high
Priest we are beautifull and glorious, yea our beauty is
made perfect through his beauty. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 9. The Queen
stands in most royall and costly garments. Never had <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
Queen in all her royalty such sweet perfumed and
precious garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts,<note place="margin">Psa. 45. 9.</note> as hath the spouse of our true <hi>Solomon.</hi>
For 1. Those were provided by <hi>Solomon: Kings daughters
in thy precious garments:</hi> but these provided by Christ <hi>out
of his wardrobe;</hi> and will not endure any other garment or
ornament brought or procured elsewhere. 2. Those were
materiall, gold, silver, and precious stuffe out of earth: but
ours are spirituall and heavenly. What the glorious robes
of the Church are, see <hi>Isa. 61. 10. I will greatly rejoyce
in the Lord; for he hath clothed me with garments of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and covered me with a robe of righteousnesse, and deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me as a bride with Iewels.</hi> What is gold, silver, silke,
pearles; to righteousnesse, holinesse, life, immortality
and glory? 3. Those were corruptible and soone cast
off: but these never weare not teare. For all the sonnes
and daughters of God are clad with incorruption and
immortality, and are heires of eternity. Now it were
no small comfort that we, being so naked and foule, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18740:77"/>
                     <hi>in our blood and filthinesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> or covered with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
clouts and raggs of sinne, and the apparell of death,
should have these <hi>taken away, Zach.</hi> 3. 4. But to be thus
arrayed and covered, yea decked and adorned with such
beautie and glory, is more cause of joy and comfort.</p>
                  <p>II. In their parts they assure our happinesse,<note place="margin">In the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> and seale
up our comfort:</p>
                  <p>I. The Pectorall shews how God esteemes of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
that they are the precious parts of the earth,<note place="margin">Beleevers high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed, as precious stones.</note> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by the twelve precious stones. 1. For price.
A great summe of money will not buy one of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones. For wee are not redeemed with gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or corruptible things; but with precious blood.
Hee must bee some great King that must buy an <hi>Vnion;</hi>
but hee must bee the great God that can purchase one of
these precious stones, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 2. For shining and
beauty. If a man were clothed with the Sunne, he must
needs shine gloriously. The meanest beleever is <hi>clothed
with the Sunne, Revel. 12. 1;</hi> and shineth in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church with the beames of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
as the Sunne in his strength. 3. For hidden
vertues and secret operation. The godly have not a shine
and shew, but the true substance of many vertues and
graces secretly laid up in their hearts, and working
mightily in them: the stones out of common Quarry,
that is, common men have not such things. 4. For
rarenesse. It is an hard thing to find a godly man, these
are rarer then most precious stones. <hi>Elias</hi> could not see
one in the world besides himselfe, though there were
many. 5. For their estimation, and the reckoning of
them with God and good men. Although the world
out of ignorance and malice scorne this pearle, and as
swine tread them under foot; yet the Jeweller knows
them; our high Priest placeth them upon his breast.
And a wise Merchant knowes that a pearle troden under
foot is a pearle: and in it selfe, a pearle lying in the quarry
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18740:78"/>
or sands unknowen, or trampled in the dirt or myr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>, is
as good at when it is taken out. Thou that art an enemy
to good men:<note place="margin">Sin to slight them.</note> 1. See how farre thou art from Gods
judgement. 2. If thou knewest their worth, where
now thou tramplest them, thou wouldest take them into
thy heart. 3. One day thou shalt desire their glory,
but too late.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. The robe of the Ephod hath comfort for the
poore despised members of Christ, whose estate is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Pomegranats.<note place="margin">As Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats.</note> Which, 1. In themselves
have no great beauty without, or on the outside.
2. Their place is below, and they hang in the skirt of
the garment: But within, 1. They carry the colour
of blood, are washed in the blood of Christ. 2. They
are full of excellent juyce and liquor, of grace and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
3. They cast a sweet smell from them, and leave
a pleasant savour behind them: And therefore Christ
fastens them to himselfe inseparably, as the Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats
were fastened to the high Priests garment. Be thou
a fruitfull Christian, no matter what place thou art in, or
in what account among men: Our high Priest hath use
of thee, and must not goe into the Sanctuary of heaven
without thee, though thou hangest in the skirt of his
garment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. The Miter or crowne of our high Priest assureth
us, that we by his anointing shall attaine the like crowne.<note place="margin">As heires of the crowne of righteousnesse.</note>
For hee hath troden all our enemies not onely under his
feet, but <hi>under ours</hi> also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. Let us not cast
downe our hopes and hearts; our high Priest is stronger
then all the enemies that can rise up against the Church.
And we may couragiously combat against sinne, errours,
hereticks, being sure of victory through the Crowne
and Miter of Jesus Christ. This Miter of Christ shall
fetch downe the Miter of Antichrist for us. This
Crowne of our high Priest shall shake downe his tripple
Crowne, and hath already blasted him. And though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18740:78"/>
these Babylonians begin to wriggle, as a snake deadly
wounded, with hope to raigne in these Churches as
sometime they did; and for the sinnes of the land, they
may recover power by their craftinesse to surprize some
ignorant, silly, and unstable persons: yet shall they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
against none whose names are written in the booke
of life; but by the power of our Captaine wee shall
tread downe both Satans and Antichrists kingdome, and
prevaile against all that riseth up against the power of
Christ.</p>

                  <p>Having declared how the high Priest, and priests of

                     </gap>. Many are the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Lawes which the Lord gave to the Priests concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their carefull cariage of themselves above others,
and these may be reduced to two heads. 1. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their <hi>common</hi> actions. 2. As concerning their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>ministeriall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerninig his <hi>common</hi> actions,<note place="margin">Common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Priests: 3.</note> hee was prohibited
diverse things which were lawfull in other men. I will
mention three.</p>
                  <p>I. The <hi>Priests</hi> must keepe an holy abstinence <hi>from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
wine and strong drinke,</hi> for the time they entred into the

who being (as it seeme) drunke, offered <hi>strange
fire,</hi> and were burnt by fire before the Lord. And the
Lord gives a reason of this law: lest their mindes or
sences might be distracted or disturbed, so as they could
not rightly discerne or execute, <hi>the things pertaining to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18740:79"/>
God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>and things pertaining to men, Heb.</hi> 5. The use of
the Law was: 1. <hi>Typicall,</hi> shadowing out the most
holy and sober course of our high Priest Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">The use of this law.</note>
who was never unready or unfit for any part of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but in all perfection of judgement and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
faithfully performed and fulfilled all righteousnesse.
2. <hi>Perpetuall,</hi> carrying in it a perpetuall equity for all
Christian Pastors, and Ministers, who must use such crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and liberties sparingly, as they helpe their naturall
infirmities by them, and helpe themselves forward in
the exercise of prayer, study, preaching, and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
duties; but not to dull, or to make themselves
grosse or distempered by them. And hence is the same
law repeated in the new Testament, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7. A Minister
must not bee <hi>a lover of wine:</hi> Not inhibiting all use of
wine and strong drinke in case of necessity; as in <hi>griefe
of heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 31. 6.</note> or for <hi>healths sake, Timothy</hi> may drinke a little,
1. <hi>Tim. 5. 23;</hi> yea and for honest delight at Feasts and
Mariages may bee a more liberall use of wine, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.
where Christ himselfe was present. But hee may not
be a quaffer, or wine-bibber, one that sits at the wine or
pot, swilling in wine or strong drinke; because this is
as great an hindrance to the faithfull performance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
duties,<note place="margin">Intemperance in Ministers very hurtfull.</note> as may bee. For, 1. It troubles the
understanding, <hi>Hos. 4. 11. wine takes away the heart:</hi> It
disturbs the memory;<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>lest he drinke and forget the decree,
and change the judgement,</hi> not being able to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
cleane and uncleane. 2. It disables and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
a Minister from all his duties. While hee sits at
the wine or strong drinke, how can hee sit at his study?
How can he attend to reading, meditation, to exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or doctrine? How can hee but bee disturbed from
ardency of prayer? Or how dare he (if he could) pray?
How can hee keepe watch with God, or over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or over himselfe? 3. It disables the duties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
suppose them done never so well; seeing by this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18740:79"/>
vice he hath made himselfe and his calling so contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
What authority can an Oracle have in a drunken
mans mouth,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 33.</note> which cannot but use <hi>to speake leud things?</hi>
4. How can such a mans course but wage open warre
with holy doctrine? He must needs shake hands with
as base and wicked company, as a countrey yeelds; and
<hi>give his hand to scorners.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 7. 5.</note> Wine is a mocker, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
a man with mockers of God, and of all good
things, and all good men. He must needs be an enemy to
all that are not of his owne straine; to all that call men
to sobriety and temperate courses, and scorne them as
too pure and precise. Hence shall a godly carefull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
have all such Ministers in a countrey at warre with
him. A man being once warmed with strong drinke,
how many things breake from him in his speaches, in his
actions, unseemely, unsavoury, and disgracefull to his
profession? These things being so, wee cannot but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that this sinne is so much crept into the Ministery,
even in all parts of the Christian world. Alas that the
stewards of Gods house should <hi>sit with drunkards,</hi> and
<hi>drinke,</hi> and bee <hi>drunken, Luke 12. 45!</hi> Drunkennesse
was wont to fly the light, they use to bee drunke in the
night; and should the lights themselves be drunkards or
associats with them, and in the light?</p>
                  <p>II. A second Law for the common actions of the
Priests concerneth their mariage. God doth not <hi>forbid</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
any Priest in the old Testament mariage,<note place="margin">Ministers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> but onely <hi>orders</hi>
it for the holy, modest, and grave cariage of it in this sort
of men above all other. And therefore the Law of God
forbids his mariage with three sorts of women, <hi>Levit.
21,</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Whom they may not mary.</note> 1. Hee must not mary <hi>a widow,</hi> lest 1. Shee
might prove with childe, and bring in a strange seed into
the Priesthood, provided against, <hi>verse</hi> 15. 2. Lest set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
stoutnesse, or evill disposition should hinder her fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for him, who must not be disgraced in one so neere
him. 2. Hee must not mary a <hi>divorced</hi> woman, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18740:80"/>
hath beene put away from her husband, because it may
be presumed she was put away for her misbehaviour, or
badd cariage towards her former husband. 3. Hee
must not mary <hi>one defiled</hi> neither voluntarily or violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
such a blot must not lie on his wife, lest his function
be disgraced. But the law allowes him onely two sorts
of women to mary,<note place="margin">And whom they may.</note> 1. A <hi>maid,</hi> or virgin, <hi>vers. 13;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee may bee more easily guided and ruled, and

must bee of his owne tribe or stocke, both for the credit
of her parentage, and for the certaine knowledge of her
education and manners before hee tooke her to himselfe.
2. The <hi>widow of a Priest, Ezech.</hi> 44. 22. For it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

to sobriety, to a chast and sweet behaviour besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the wife of a Priest.</p>
                  <p>This Law is both <hi>ceremoniall</hi> and significative,<note place="margin">Typicall use of this ordinance.</note> as also
hath in it a <hi>perpetuall</hi> trueth and equity. In the former
use it hath an eye unto Christs mariage with his wife
the Church. Our high Priest marieth not any harlot,
or polluted Synagogue, defiled with Idolatry, which is
spirituall fornication, and going an whoring from God,
doting upon idols, merits, other Mediators: Neither
with a divorced woman, such as is the Synagogue of the
Jewes, as now they are in the East; and the Synagogues
of Satan and Antichrist, as now they are in the West,
since their Tridentin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> apostasie and Anathematizing the
doctrine of Christ; to both whom God hath given a
bill of divorce. Christ our high Priest is not married to
either, howsoever the Church of Rome pretend a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with him, and shew us their Baptisme, and Lords
Supper as the ring and confirmation of their marriage.
But wee know it will neither make her an honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
nor prove her now a lawfull wife to shew her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
ring, who having plaid false with her husband, is
now long since divorced from him. Jesus Christ marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18740:80"/>
                     <hi>a virgin chasi and undefiled,</hi> that is, holy and unspotted
by imputation of his owne righteousnesse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> and <hi>washed
by water through the word, Eph.</hi> 5. 26. He marrieth her of
his owne tribe: For as the first <hi>Adam</hi> must not marry a
wife but of his owne flesh, and out of his owne side:
so the second <hi>Adam</hi> marryeth a wife issuing out of his
owne side, flesh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> his owne flesh, and bone of his bone.
And he will take to himselfe againe the high Priests
widdow, the people of the Jews, and marry them into
one body with the Gentiles. So much for the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>perpetuall</hi> equity of this Law bindes the
Ministers of the new Testament;<note place="margin">Perpetuall.</note> who are not prohibited
marriage by the Scripture, no more then the Priests of
the old Testament:<note place="margin">Ministers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, lawfull.</note> But for the honour and credit of this
office and function care must be had, that their wives
especially be <hi>honest, sober, free from scandall, and</hi> framed
to the rules of the Apostle for Ministers wives, 1 <hi>Tim. 3.
11.</hi> and for the preventing a number of scandals that else
may arise within, and lye upon his family. This care being
had, they being married shall be as holy and honourable
in their function as the Priests of the old Testament:
who being marryed, were said to have the Crowne of
God upon their heads, and to offer the bread of God,
and to be after a speciall manner,<note place="margin">Against the practise of Romanists.</note> holy. But how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
is that filthy whore of Rome, whose filthy
virgin priests hate marriage but not lust; refuse Gods
owne ordinance, and honest wives of their owne, and
like fed horses neigh after their neighbours wives, and
cover the countrey with a bastardly broode; and hold in
their doctrine, better they should have an hundred
Concubines then one married wife, and in their practise
adjudge married ministers to death, but adulterous
priests to a light penance, and that bought out with a
trifle or word of a friend.<note place="margin">Bale. De actis Romanorum Pontificum.</note> One story is memorable out
of the booke <hi>of the Acts of the Romane Bishops:</hi> when the

Kings visiters in England, in the yeare 1538, visited the

religious houses, five, in some ten, in some twenty
Sodomits and adulterers, of which some kept five, some
seven, some twenty harlots. So <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
single life to the Clergy, sent for fish to his ponds,
and had sixe thousand heads; wherupon (sighing) he said,
It is better to marry, then to burne. <hi>Bede</hi> denyes the
story, although of <hi>Huldericus</hi> Bishop of August<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>III. A third Law for common actions.<note place="margin">Mourning for the dead.</note> He must
be very moderate in mourning for the dead. <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 2. 3.
the ordinary priest must mourne, onely for his mother,
father, sonne, daughter, brother or his sister (if a maid)
because she was yet in the house and family; but without
the family he might not lament for any, no not for the
prince, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Might he not mourne for his wife?<note place="margin">Whether for the Wife.</note> For
some thinke not, because she is not named, neither in
that Law, nor in the repetition of it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I thinke he might: But the wife is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
because 1. she is one with himselfe, 2. if for
daughter and sister, much more for wife which is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
3. the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was charged not to mourne
for his wife, being a Prophet and priest, <hi>Ezech. 24. 16;</hi>
which seemes an exception from the ordinary manner.
But for the high <hi>Priest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 21. 12.</note> he might not mourne for any of
them named, neither (in likelyhood) for his wife; nor
uncover his head; nor rent his clothes, nor goe to any
dead body, nor go out of the Sanctuary, <hi>for the crowne of
the anoynting oyle of his God is upon his head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Law had in it both ceremony,<note place="margin">Ceremoniall use hereof.</note> and perpetuity in
substance of it. In the ceremony, the Priest might not
mourne for the dead, 1. Because mourning for the
dead was counted a Legall uncleannesse, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. 2. The
oyle of holy oyntment was upon his head, being oyle
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18740:81"/>
of gladnesse. 3. They must bee contrary to the
foolish manner and fashion of the Priests and people of
the Gentiles, who were so passionate and excessive in
their affected and sometimes forced mourning, as they
fell into indecent and unlimited behaviours. 4. The
Priest, and especially the high Priest, was to be a type of
eternity, and therefore must show no such signe of
weaknesse and corruption, as weeping is. Hence it is,
that wee read not of the death of an high Priest, but
ever before his death another was appointed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled.
So before <hi>Aaron</hi> dyed, <hi>Eleazer</hi> was installed;
and before his death was <hi>Phinehas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 28, Hence
it is, that wee read not of their raignes and times, how
long or short any of them lived, as of the Judges and
Kings; which closely noteth and implyeth unto us, that
they were types of eternity and immortality. 5. In
the ceremony this Law hath a speciall ayme and respect
to Jesus Christ our high Priest, in whom was no blot, no
spot, or morall pollution, as that high Priest most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
was restrained from every Legall pollution. He
wept indeed sundry times for the dead, as for <hi>Lazarus</hi>
&amp;c. because he was to abolish the Legall ceremonies, and
this among other. It being in him sufficient that most
perfectly he preserved himselfe from morall pollution:
In which sence he never <hi>uncovered his head,</hi> that is, was
never so weake or inglorious by passion, but that he ever
maintained union with his father, and abode the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
head of his Church. Neither did he <hi>rent his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
that is, his holy flesh baked as it were in the oven
of afflictions, extended and rent on the crosse, cast aside
in the grave, was never rent off from his divinity, but
was ever from the first moment of Hypostaticall union,
present with it, and shall be for all eternity. He never
goes out of the Sanctuary to mourne for the dead, for
the crowne and oyle of God is upon him. For as in his
life he (being most holy) was not subject to be quite sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18740:82"/>
in the house of death: so now after his resurrection
he hath attained all excellency of glory and happinesse,
free from all misery and sorrow, never to be interrupted
any more by any griefe or adversary power.<note place="margin">Revel. 4. 9, 10.</note> The Crowne
of God is set upon his head for ever.</p>
                  <p>The perpetuity and substance of this Law concernes
both Ministers and people.<note place="margin">Perpetuall.</note> 1. To teach both the one and
the other not to grow into excesse of sorrow or passion,
but to be examples of gravity, moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; wel weilding
of affections; &amp; to be patternes of patience and holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in suffering extreame adversities, as well as in the
actions and exercise of practick vertues. 2. To give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of their hope and assurance of the happy resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of their friends,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 13.</note> for whom they must not sorrow
<hi>as men without hope.</hi> 3. To shew that no occasion or
naturall affection, no not the nearest and greatest change
befalling their outward estate might distract them from
their charge and duty; or so disquiet the peaceable
tranquillity of their minds, as any part of their duty
might be hindred for matter or manner. And therefore
in this case our Saviour (confirming the perpetuall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Law) saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, follow
thou me.</hi> And the Lord is so strict in this case <hi>(Lev. 10. 6)</hi>
that when <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes were so strangely slaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his face, he must not mourne nor stir a foote out of
his Ministery, lest he dye, and therefore the text saith:
<hi>Aaron held his peace, ver.</hi> 3. So no outward respect of
duty to friends must call us from duty to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If the Priest must not weepe, how could they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
repent of their sins?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Priest must not weepe for any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
losses, nor for personall losses; and in naturall regards he
must be impassionate:<note place="margin">Ierem 9. 1.</note> but for his sinnes he might. <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
a Prophet and Priest wisheth <hi>his head a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of teares,</hi> The high priest must weepe for his owne
and the peoples sinnes in the day of expiation, and if he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18740:82"/>
weepe not, he must dye. So <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 17. all the priests must
howle, and cry, <hi>and weepe between the porch and the Altar.</hi>
Christ wept often,<note place="margin">Sin, the proper cause of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> and all for sinne: as, for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> on
the Crosse, over Ierusalem. Whence we note: 1. That
the proper cause of mourning, is sinne. He that must not
shed a teare for any other cause in the world, must shed
teares for his sin upon pain of death. Oh that they would
thinke of this that glory in their sinne! 2. Let us so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our affections, as that our principall mourning may
be for our sinnes; and binde up our affections for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and naturall losses and crosses, so as wee may have
them loosed in spirituall. This law tells us, that sorow
for our onely sonne or brother, or the deare wife that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in our bosome,<note place="margin">Mischiefes of sinne.</note> ought to be no sorow in comparison
of sorow for sinne. Which, 1. separates from God:
2. makes Christ absent, and stand aloofe: 3. grieves
the Spirit, and makes him heavy towards us: 4. sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
soule from body, yea (without repentance) soule
and body from heaven and happinesse. Let us, who have
beene excessive in worldly sorow, turne the streame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our sinnes; and in all crosses set our heavinesse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon some sinne in our selves, which might cause the
crosse, then on the crosse it selfe.</p>

Christ in their <hi>ministeriall actions.</hi> Of these kinde

<hi>proper</hi> to the high Priest.</p>
                  <p>I. Common actions were six.<note place="margin">Common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Priests: 6.</note> 1. The Priest must
kill the sacrifices and none but he: signifying Jesus Christ
his voluntary action in laying downe his life for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
<hi>none could take away</hi> his life from him. And hee
was to be aswell the Priest as the sacrifice; <hi>Iohn 10. 18. I
have power to lay downe my life.</hi> 2. The priests offred
the blood of the sacrifices to God, and sprinkled it on
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18740:83"/>
the Altar; <hi>for they were ordained for men in things of God,
to offer gifts and sacrifices for sinnes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 1.</note> No man might offer
his owne sacrifice,<note place="margin">Levit. 7. 4.</note> but hee must bring it <hi>to the Priest:</hi>
there was no comming to God, but by the priest: Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out Iesus Christ who offers up himselfe a sacrifice
for the sinnes of the world, upon the Altar of his Deity,
which gives both vertue and merit unto it. No other
can offer to God bloody or unbloody sacrifice upon this
Altar, but himselfe. <hi>Iohn 17. 19. I sanctifie my selfe for
them:</hi> even as the Altar sanctifieth the gift. 3. The
Priests prepared the body of the sacrifice <hi>(Lev. 1. 6.)</hi> flay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, divided it into severall parts, washed the intrailes,
put fire unto the burnt offering, consumed the fat, cast the
filth and dung into the place of ashes: Signifying, that
Christ himselfe alone did the whole worke of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He suffered the heate of Gods wrath and justice; he
puts away all our filth, and covers it in his owne ashes;
he burnes up our fat, that is, the senselessenesse of our sin,
and all that savoureth of the flesh, by the fire of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and inwardly purgeth and wholly washeth us in the
fountaine of his owne blood. 4. The Priest must teach
the people;<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>His lippes must preserve knowledge:</hi> and the
people must depend on his mouth: signifying the action
of this great teacher of the Church, who brought to us
from the bosome of his father the whole counsell of
God concerning the redemption of mankinde; which
could never have entred into the heart of man, but by the
teaching of <hi>this great Prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 52. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. He hath the

therefore having the words of eternall life, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

for the people,<note place="margin">Numb. 6. 23.</note> and <hi>blesse</hi> them. A forme of blessing is
prescribed for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes, laying their hands

not only in his holy intercession upon earth, and now

by laying his hands upon them, which was his last action
upon earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 50. 6. The Priests were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Oyle for lights and the incense, and for the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meat offering, and the anointing oyle. And the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of the whole Tabernacle, and all in the Sanctuary,
and all the instruments belonged to their care for the
safety in moving, carying, standing, &amp;c. signifying Iesus
Christ the preserver of all grace in his Church. He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
watcheth for the safety of his Church, for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his holy ministery, and all holy constitutions which
else would quickly be broken up. He plants the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and he removes it at his pleasure. He hath the seven
stars in his right hand. Hee is the great Archbishop of
soules to the whole Church, and no other in this kinde
but hee: So much of common actions ministeriall.</p>
                  <p>II. Actions more peculiar to the high priest were,<note place="margin">Actions proper to the high Priest.</note>
1. daily. 2. weekely. 3. yearely. 4. continually.</p>
                  <p>I. Hee must daily,<note place="margin">Daily.</note> 1. dresse the holy lamps and
lights morning and evening before the Lord, <hi>Lev. 24.
2,</hi> 3. to preserve the lights from going out. Shadowing
Christ, the true light, by whom the light of true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must ever shine in the Church, and never goe
out; by which the true beleevers shall bee delivered
from darkenesse and death. This was formerly figured
by Goshen, there was light when three dayes darknesse
was over all Aegypt. And this was figured by the pillar
of fire that never failed till they came to Canaan. 2. he
must daily burne incense before the Lord upon the Altar
of sweet perfume:<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 7, 8.</note> signifying Christ our high Priest dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offering up, 1. our duties and services done by his
appointment, and which through him smell as a sweete
incense acceptable to God. 2. our prayers, called <hi>odours
of the Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 5. 8.</note> and <hi>a sweet incense.</hi> And as no incense plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18740:84"/>
God but that which was offered upon that golden
Altar:<note place="margin">Psal. 141. 2.</note> so no duty or prayer of ours is farther accepted
then offered up by him and from him, whose golden pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
gives merit and worth unto them.<note place="margin">Revel. 8. 3.</note> And as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
must be offered up by the high Priest morning and
evening: so the continuall vertue of Christs merit as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
daily before God, and perfumeth all the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
neither is there any other way to the father but by
him.</p>
                  <p>II. He must weekly make the shewbread,<note place="margin">Weekely.</note> and <hi>set it
before the Lord continually. Exod.</hi> 25. 30. And more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<hi>Levit. 24. 5, 6. Every Sabbath</hi> he must set on the
table twelve loaves according to the twelve tribes, and
take the old away, to the maintaining of his family; for
which use they might well suffice, every loafe weighing
about seven or eight pounds. Here was a figure of Christ
the true bread of life, who sets himselfe (in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospell, and administration of the Sacraments)
before the face of God (that is, in the assemblies gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together every Sabbath,) the most sufficient food and
refreshing of the Church, to continue it in life, strength,
and good estate from Sabbath to Sabbath till that eternall
<hi>Sabbath</hi> come.</p>
                  <p>III. He must yearely once (and that in the day of
expiation) <hi>goe into the Holy of Holies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Yearely.</note> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 10. and
<hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 2. and 34. <hi>to make an attonement for himselfe,</hi>
for all his house, and for all the people, but not without
blood. Signifying, that Christ by one alone sacrifice of
himselfe hath opened the Sanctuary of heaven, and by his
ascension hath made entrance into it on our behalfe, and
there appeares before God once for all to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for us. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12, 19. And as he must goe
alone without all attendants: so Christ must <hi>tread the
winepresse alone.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isay 63. 3.</note> No friend, no disciple, stands with him;
no fellow, no companion goes with him to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement;
but all feare and flye, that we might cast our

eye on no other Mediatour but him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>IV. He must continually decide the highest contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;<note place="margin">Continually.</note>
he must judge betweene the cleane and unclean;
he must excommunicate the one out of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and receive in the other when he was legally clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Signifying Christ, who in the Church and Scriptures
is the supreame Judge of all controversies. It is his word
alone can binde or loose, justifie or condemne. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his direction obstinate persons are to be cast out,
and penitent offendors received in. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
so God to Christ: <hi>Without thee shall no man lift up
his hand or foot in all the land of Aegypt. Gen</hi> 41. 44.</p>
                  <p>I. Ministers of the new Testament must learne hence
to attend diligently on their charges;<note place="margin">Vse for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> and know, that
the substance of all these duties lyeth as heavy on their
shoulders, as upon those Priests of the old Testament.
Every conscionable Minister is bound. 1. To prepare
sacrifices to the Lord. In the old Law the Priest present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
dead sacrifices: but we must offer living ones. They
dead beasts: but we living men, quickened by faith, alive
by the Spirit of God, holy and acceptable. They exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and unreasonable:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> we <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>spirituall,</hi> such
as God (who is a Spirit) may accept and delight in. They
must first kill and then sacrifice: so we can never present
any man an acceptable sacrifice, without killing his sin.
As the poore beast must be killed, and cut in pieces, and
then offered: so we must by the sharpe knife of the Law
(urging repentance and mortification) cut asunder the
heart-strings of sinne, mangle the body of sinne, and let
out the life-blood of mans lusts and corruptions. And as
they having slaine the beast must wash the entraile, burne
the fat, cast the filth and dung into the place of ashes:
so the Minister after his labour in mortifying sinne, must
bring men to the lavour of sanctification, separate them
from their foulenesse, and bring them to full holinesse in
the feare of God. 2. The Priest must preserve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18740:85"/>
his lips must feed many, hee must stand in the
counsell of God, and bee as his mouth: And as Jesus
Christ brought the whole will and counsell of God from
the bosome of his Father: So must his Minister declare
that whole counsell to the Church, and keepe nothing
backe.<note place="margin">Act. 20. 27.</note> 3. The Minister must daily dresse the holy
lampes and lights morning and evening, and preserve the
light from going out; he must prouide oile for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
feeding of the lights, that is, by painefull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
study of the Scriptures and meditation hee must
furnish himselfe to the worke of the Ministery, that the
light of holy doctrine may shine by him on all occasions;
that having the tongue of the learned he may be alwayes
ready to speake a word to him that is weary, and never
want words of comfort which may bee as oile to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
soule. 4. He must daily burne incense before
the Lord upon the Altar of sweete perfume, that is, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
daily prayers as sweet odours in the Name of Christ,
who is the Altar of sweet perfume both for himselfe and
his people. He must pray also for the people and blesse
them; as <hi>Samuel, God forbid I should sinne against God,
and not pray for you.</hi> For his office is to stand betweene
God and his people. Every man must bee his owne
mouth to God; but hee must bee the mouth of every
man. 5. He must weekly set the Shew-bread before the
Lord, that is, propound Jesus Christ the true bread of life,
the Manna that came downe from heaven, the continuall
strength and nourishment of the Church of God, both
in the ministery of the Word and Sacraments, which
the ancient Church did weekely celebrate, as the Priest
did weekly set these loaves. Nay hee must not onely
set them before others, but himselfe must feed on them,
as the Priests did on the Shew bread, all the weeke and
yeare long, lest it befall him as that Prince, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 7. 20.
that saw plenty of food with his eyes, but tasted not of
it; for being troden under foot, he died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:18740:85"/>
II. Every Christian as a Priest unto God must
1.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse:</hi> For the people.</note> Daily labour in his owne mortification: Every day
kill some beast or other, some lust or other that as
wilde beasts are untamed, and dangerous to the soule.
2. Morning and evening dresse his lights, and looke to
the clearing of his lamps; setting himselfe a taske of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reading the Scriptures for the clearing of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the informing of his minde, and for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his heart and life, that hee may shine every day
more clearly then other in holy conversation. 3. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day burne incense before the Lord, upon the Altar of
sweet perfume both morning and evening. Every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
morning and evening must offer up dayly prayers
and praises as a sweet smell unto God. That as the
smoke of sweet incense goeth upward and disperseth it
selfe abroad in the aire: so the incense of prayer ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
may disperse it selfe abroad for the benefit of the
person, family, Church, at home and abroad. What else
calls the Apostle for,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5.</note> saying: <hi>Pray continually, in all
things give thanks,</hi> but that the Lord should smell the
sweet odours of our morning and evening prayer, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when wee rise and goe to rest? How this duty is
neglected, and with manifest contempt and losse, every
mans conscience can tell him. Now in offering this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
1. See no strange incense be offered, that is, no
prayer without faith. 2. None but upon the Altar of
incense, none but in the Name of Christ. 4. Every
weeke on the Sabbath day (as the Priests in the Law)
provide himselfe of shew-bread, to serve for his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
all the weeke, that is, make such conscionable use
of the holy Ministery, as hee may preserve life of grace,
and strength of grace, which falls to consumption in the
soule except it be continually repayred, even as the body
wasteth without naturall food. 5. Every yeare set
apart a day of expiation, to make an atonement for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for his house, and all the people. This proportion
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18740:86"/>
shewes it not amisse once a yeare to set apart a day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
in serious fasting and prayer, to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our owne and others sinnes. The equity of
which seemes not onely grounded in that Law, <hi>Levit.
16.</hi> 29. which enjoines the Jew a yearly standing fast,
wherein once a yeare every soule should humble it selfe
with fasting before the Lord in one of the great assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 27. bindes all unto it: But also in
good reason,<note place="margin">Reasons for a yearely fast.</note> seeing a yeares space might bring about
many just occasions, 1. Many sinnes might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to provoke the Lord, 2. Many judgements let
in, or to bee let in for those sinnes, 3. Many mercies
wanting, which by ours and others sinnes wee are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
deprived of. And although we ought continually
to humble our selves for our sinnes; yet to helpe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and to doe it throughly, it shall availe us much,
to set a speciall time apart for it, as such who out of sound
judgement esteeme we have sufficient cause once a yeare
thus deepely to humble our selves. For howsoever the
Jews had daily expiatory sacrifices, yet the Lord held it
not superfluous to appoint them besides one set and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
day of expiation. So is it no lesse needfull for any
Christian (notwithstanding his daily humiliation) to
helpe himselfe in his repentance by one day in a yeare at
lest, of more solemne expiation.</p>

<hi>religious vow,</hi> as to this order of the Nazarites; whose
haire increasing on their heads, as an externall signe of
their vow, was called <hi>Nezer, Numb.</hi> 6. 18. By which
order the Lord would have the eminent sanctity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ to bee typified, as well as his sacrifice and
kingly Office by Priests and Kings. Hee was indeed the
onely true Nazarite <hi>separated from sinners, holy, harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and undefiled, Heb.</hi> 7. 26. For, 1. His profession
was,<note place="margin">Christ eminent for sanctity, in 6. respects.</note> 
                  <hi>I am not of this world, Ioh.</hi> 8. 23. 2. He is called
<hi>(Dan. 9. 24.) the holy of holies, or the most Holy</hi> (a title
never ascribed to the most holy persons on earth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance:)
For as the holy of holies (a type of Christ)
was separated from the rest of the Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and excelled both the outer and inner Court in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
So Jesus Christ surpassed not onely common men
but the holiest of men, as farre as the <hi>sanctum sanctorum</hi>
excelled both the <hi>sanctum</hi> and <hi>atrium.</hi> His divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
farre excelled the most pure Nazarites, who yet
are said <hi>(Lam. 4. 7.)</hi> to bee <hi>purer then the snow, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the milke.</hi> 3. He was not of unholy made holy
as they, but hee was alwayes holy and without all staine
of sinne, from the first moment for ever: <hi>That holy thing
which is conceived in her is of the holy Ghost, Matt.</hi> 1. 20.
4. His holinesse was not from any other, but of and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18740:87"/>
from himselfe, whereas whosoever else have any holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it is from him. 5. His holinesse was essentiall
(not accidentall) as he was God; and as hee was man
(by the union of the manhood with his divine nature)
was bestowed upon him in full measure, yea beyond
measure; and therefore is called, <hi>fulnesse of grace</hi> and
holinesse, <hi>Ioh<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> 1. But in the most holy men this holinesse
is a received quality by communicating of his spirit, and
that imperfectly and in small measure. 6. They might
be holy in part for themselves, but could not impart that
holinesse to others: But Christ is not onely holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but sanctifieth them and the whole Church; hee
being the originall and fountaine of all holinesse. They
might be legally cleane in some actions: but he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cleane in all observations. They in some passages of
their life: but hee in his nature, in his disposition, and in
the fulfilling of all righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. Nazarites by the Law <hi>(Numb. 6. 2, 3.)</hi> must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from wine and strong drinke, and all that commeth
of the grape.<note place="margin">Abstemious: and why.</note> 1. Because they were to study the Law
of God, and the Lord will not have them meddle with
any thing that might trouble their braine, or unfit them
to so holy studies. 2. Hee would have them paterns
of sobriety and temperance, and restraine them from
whatsoever might stirre up lust, or occasion intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
In which, what else did they but shadow our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ? Who was a true Nazarite, not in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ceremony (for he did drinke wine, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
provided it for others; yea ordained wine an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Supper, that every Christian might drinke it)
but in the morality and truth of the thing hee was the
onely perfect Nazarite. Never was any so intent in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
invocation, preaching, acting, and suffering all things
for our sake, as he was. Neither was any creature so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinent
and temperate as he was; he fasted fourty dayes
and fourty nights, and after that (being hungry) hee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18740:87"/>
would eate nothing till all his temptations in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were ended. As of all other vertues, so he was an
unfailing patterne in this of holy abstinence and unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
temperance.</p>
               <p>III. The Nazarites were enjoyned to let their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
haire grow, and <hi>no razor</hi> must come on their heads all
the time of their vow and seperation,<note place="margin">Nourishing the haire.</note> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 5. By
which ceremony the Lord intended two things. 1. He
would have them most unlike and contrary to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
orders of the heathen Idolaters, who usually nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
their haire to offer in sacrifice to their gods, as in
many examples I could shew: But these must not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
their haire all the time; and when they cut it off
they must burne it with fire. 2. To be a meanes to
avoid finenesse and delicacy in curious trimming of the
head, and care of the flesh, which is a great enemy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
thoughts and exercises. So the Apostle implyes,
the more <hi>care of the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> the lesse of <hi>putting on Christ
Iesus.</hi> 3. Long haire in men is a signe of strength,
as in <hi>Sampson.</hi> And by this law the Lord would put them
in mind that as they were to avoid esseminate softnesse
and delicacy; so to be manly, strong, and couragious in
performing duties, and resisting stoutly all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and baits that might allure them from the duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
As for our Saviour (whom they shadowed) it
is not likely he nourished his haire, because the Apostle
saith, it was (in that age) uncomely for men to have long
haire.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man have long haire it is a shame unto him.</hi>

                  </note> It was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him, that he was a <hi>Nazarite</hi> in the truth and
substance of that Law, although not in the letter and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ceremony of it. In which respect how did he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
himselfe; who being the Lord of all, denyed himselfe
of all rights and comforts. He was so farre from all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18740:88"/>
that (with an utter refusall of all delights of flesh)
his whole intention was set on his function and office,
submitting himselfe to sorrow, curse, &amp;c. Besides, what
courage and fortitude, did hee expresse through his
whole function and office, in overcomming sinne, death,
Satan, the Crosse, Hell, and all adversaries? <hi>Sampson</hi> the
strongest of all <hi>Nazarites</hi> was but a weakeling to him;
his adversaries, flesh not spirit; his power, faint and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
yea changed into weakenesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> IV. Nazarites must not come neere the dead to
touch them, nor defile themselves by them;<note place="margin">Not touch the dead.</note> nor meddle
with the funerals of father, mother, brother, sister, or any
of their kinred, though they might prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d never so much
piety, affection, or good nature. By which Law the Lord
would teach them two things, 1. That no changes of
this life, nor losse of their dearest friends should turne
them aside from their duty, or from the observation of
the Law of their profession. 2. To teach them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
patience, and magnanimity of spirit in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
outward afflictions, and not to shew a weaknesse or
passion in open or excessive lamentation. Our Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he did touch the dead, and was at funeralls, and
wept at the raysing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and so observed not the
ceremony of Nazarites, because hee was no Legall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite,
but was called a Nazarite as being the truth and
substance of all the Legall Nazarites, as in all other things
so in this: For he onely was the Master, and had the true
command of all his affections; never exceeded measure
in any thing, never was defiled by any person dead in
sinne, never by any dead worke, never touched or came
neere any such defilement, which Legall Nazarites could
not avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> V. These Nazarites must be absolved and released
from their Vow by comming to the doore of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the Congregation with their offering. <hi>Num. 6.

him.</p>
               <p>Now for application.</p>
               <p>I. Acknowledge Christ the true Nazarite.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Christ and his excellency to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</note> Upon
his head let his Crowne flourish. As it was said of <hi>Ioseph,
Gen. 49. 26, he was seperate from his brethren:</hi> so was
Jesus Christ seperated from all other men and Angels,
1. In holinesse and purity, being advanced in holinesse
above all creatures: He alone in propriety and perfection
is a Nazarite purer then snow, and whiter then milke;
yea his measure runs over to his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26.
2. In excellence and perfection of all vertues and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
hee is that Netser, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 1, the branch or flower
which alwaies flourished in all kinds, and perfections of
vertue and graces, and casts from him farre and neere
a most sweet smell, sweet and acceptable to God and
men.<note place="margin">And his great power<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> wherin.</note> 3. In power and authority. The Kingdome is his
and power and glory; all power is given him in heaven
and in earth. He hath power, 1. to do us good; 2. to
withstand our evill; 3. to tread downe Satan, sinne,
death; 4. to rescue his Church, to confound Antichrist
and all enemies: 5. to finish the grace and glory of his
Saints.</p>
               <p>Why must Christ be so pure a Nazarite?<note place="margin">Object.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because his passion could not have beene accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
if his person had not beene as pure as the sunne.
2. Hee was to be not onely righteousnesse in himselfe as
other Nazarites, or righteousnesse in part: but he must
be a perfect righteousnesse to many. <hi>Object.</hi> But how
could he be so pure comming of <hi>Adam</hi> as they did?
<hi>Sol.</hi> He came of <hi>Adam,</hi> not by <hi>Adam,</hi> as they did; that
is, he came not by naturall propagation from <hi>Adam,</hi> but
was conceived by the holy Ghost, and so all originall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
was stopped in the very first moment of his holy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18740:89"/>
conception. <hi>Object.</hi> But did not he take the same
infirmities comming of <hi>Adam</hi> as they did? <hi>Answ.</hi> No,
he tooke such infirmities as he pleased, to fit him for a
mercifull high Priest, not to hinder him, and therefore he
tooke such infirmities from <hi>Adam</hi> as were miserable, but
not damnable, and so remained a pure Nazarite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all sinfull frailty.</p>
               <p>II. Christ the true Nazarite being come,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Difference of the Nazarites vow, and Papists.</note> all sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
must fly away, and therefore this order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites
gives no colour or approbation to any order of
Popish votaries or monasticall persons now in the new
Testament. Besides, that white is not more contrary to
black then monasticall vowes to this. For 1. The
Nazarites were appointed by God himselfe: theirs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by themselves. 2. Their vowes were of things
possible, in their power, and temporary: these are of
things impossible, without their power, and during life,
be the party never so unable to endure it. 3. Their
vowes (though appointed by God) were not able to
merit remission of sinne and eternall life: but these say
that they merit for themselves and others, that their
vowes are parts of Gods worship (which never came
in his mind or booke) and a state of great perfection:

cut their haire: their order stands in cutting and shaving
that they may still looke neate and effeminate. 5. Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
drink no wine nor strong drinke, and are very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in their dyet: these belly gods eat up the fat, and
poure in the sweet till they be monsters, that the very
fasts of Friers (for the delicacy and abundance) is become
a proverbe. 6. Nazarites might not come at fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls:
these follow them (as flyes do fat meat) and suck
out thence their greatest profit, and sweetest morsells.
7. Nazarites (notwithstanding their vow) lived in
holy wedlock: but Popish votaries abhorre marriage, not

lust or whoredome. Yet from this order they would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish

not by vow of seperation, but by imitation and
resemblance of Christ the true Nazarite. For</p>
               <p>I. He must be seperate from others,<note place="margin">Be Nazarites, and how.</note> 1. He must see
that he be seperate from ungodly ones, as one advanced
to an happy estate in Christ. 2. That now his mind,
affections, speeches, and whole course be contrary to the
course of the world; and so (as <hi>Ioseph)</hi> seperate himselfe
from the evill behaviour, and manners of his brethren;
yea complaine of them to his father. 3. He must bee
content if his brethren seperate from him, as did <hi>Iosephs</hi>
brethren when they sold him into Aegypt. This is to bee
a Christian Nazarite.</p>
               <p>II. This Christian Nazarite must strictly keepe the
rules of his profession. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>. he must labour. 1. to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the vow of holinesse made in Baptisme, study and
follow after sanctification,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the will of God even
your sanctification,</hi> he must resigne himselfe wholly to
God; 2. carefully to avoid the least defilement of sinne.
The Lord made a Law <hi>(Numb. 6. 9.)</hi> that if any dyed by a
Nazarite casually and suddenly (though hee could not
avoid it) he defiled the head of his consecration; he must
be shaven and come and offer a <hi>Lambe</hi> for a trespasse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
and then begin his vow againe. Wherein the
Lord shewes that he will not endure any sinne in his
servant (though not willingly committed, nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
if it be but casual or by happe, and stirres up thereby
our watchfulnesse against all, even the least sinne, and
urgeth the shunning of the least touch of dead workes:
<hi>Iude 23, hate even the garment spotted by the flesh.</hi> 2. Hee
must study the law of the Lord to grow in knowledge
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18740:90"/>
and conscience. Men deceive themselves that think there
bee no students but those whose profession is learning,
contrary to <hi>Psa</hi> 1. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39.</p>
               <p>III. He must avoid intemperance, surfetting, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
strongly watch and ward against naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
against the allurings and baits of sinne, remoove
impediments of faith and godlinesse, strive both against
inward corruptions and outward occasions. How many
of much hope, by the immoderate desires and use of
these outward things have besotted themselves? It is
to be doubted that the delicacy of this age affords but a
few Nazarites.</p>
               <p>IV. He must restraine his passions and affections
in the use of every thing about him; use every thing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
as not using it; not suffering any thing to steale our
hearts from us, for then wee can hardly moderate our
selves in the parting from it. Nazarites in all changes
must be unchangeable in their profession: so must Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Nazarites.</p>
               <p>V. When he hath done all in his generall vow and
course of holinesse, he must retaine humility, bewaile his
wants, confesse how unprofitable he is in his service.
The Nazarite that had gone through his vow in the
best manner, in giving it up must bring a burnt offering
and a peace offering; confessing his wants, and craving
acceptance: so must wee in our best strife and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
present our duty with that burnt offering and
peace offering made by Jesus Christ; and in that onely
seeke and find acceptance.</p>

the beginning God permitted all other trees to <hi>Adam,</hi>
onely restrained him in the tree of knowledge of good
and evill; which therefore ceased not to bee good of it

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Very many. 1. To shew the Lords sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
over his creatures, who hath liberty to permit or
forbid any creature at his pleasure without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himselfe or the creature, hee may doe with his
owne as he will. 2. To teach all persons to depend
on God and his word of allowance for and in the use of
all things, even for meats, and drinks, and all comforts;
seeing man liveth not by bread, but by every word of
God. 3. To traine up his people in temperance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
by restraining them so many creatures in earth,
ayre, and sea, as good as any other. 4. That his people
might professe open detestation of the heathenish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
about them. The Aegyptians took for gods, oxen,
sheep, goates, doves: God will have his people sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18740:91"/>
these to his service, and eate those creatures which
they (out of heathenish superstition) might not touch.
The heathens used to offer many kindes of beasts to the
Moone the Queene of heaven, and to Bacchus: God
will have his people detest both in sacrifice and meate
those which they so offered; all to shew how contrary
we ought to bee to Idolaters in whatsoever wee may.
5. To distinguish that people of God from all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
God esteeming them by his grace in the Messiah a
cleane people and all other uncleane. And this was a wall
of partition between Iewes and Gentiles till Christ by
rending the vaile brake it downe also, as in Peters vision,
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. 15. 6. The Lord by this difference of beasts
would have them conceive a difference of persons sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
thereby; of whom some are cleane, some unclean;
the former being elect are cleansed by faith from their
pollution of sinne, the other remaine foule and filthy still.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The cleane are knowne by the two common
markes of cleane beasts,<note place="margin">Marke, of cleane beasts.</note> 
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 3. 1. They divide
the hoofe; that is, rightly distinguish of things, between
nature and grace, between <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ, betweene
the law and Gospell, truth and falshood. They will not
receive things in grosse, and hand over head; but being
<hi>spirituall discerne all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15. 2. They
chew the cud, that is, after hearing and reading the
word, they meditate, ponder, apply, and digest it: as
<hi>Mary</hi> laid up the words in her heart, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 19. 2. The
uncleane are knowne by some naughty and uncleane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
Some like the dogs that prophane the most holy
things; barke against the word and preachers of it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
chew the cud nor digest the word. Some like the
swine <hi>(2 Pet. 2.)</hi> having their mouthes alwayes rooting
in the earth, cannot look up towards heaven; all for their
belly; good for nothing but the knife: neither for plough,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18740:92"/>
nor cart, nor burthens, nor saddle, nor wooll, nor milk;
but onely to feed and dye; besides (while they live) their
filthy wallowing in miery lusts and puddles of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Some like the hare, fearefull creatures shrinking
from faith in God in temptation, and from profession of
it in times of danger and persecution; more fearing cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and losses then God himselfe, or the losse of salvation.
These uncleane creatures cannot enter into heaven: <hi>The

earth, and neglect to treasure <hi>where theeves neither digge
through nor steale. Mat.</hi> 6. 19, 20. Some like the Ravens,
black and unnaturall, feeding on carrion. Some like the
Ostrich, grosse hypocrites, with faire wings but cannot
flye. Some like the Sea-meaw, partly living on water,
partly on land: partly will be saved by faith, partly by

birth, and the womans purification after every

common nature of man is horribly polluted by sin, which
is every where called by the name of uncleanenesse; <hi>Psal.
51. 5. Behold I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne hath my
mothor conceived me. Isa. 64. 6. We have all beene as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

                     <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse? there
is not one. Iohn 3. 6. That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh;</hi>
because that which is begotten, participateth of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that which begetteth. And this uncleanenesse is
not in any one part, but sticks to the whole man both in
body and soule, polluting the minde with blindnesse, the
will with rebellion against the will of God, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with senselesnesse and horrour, the affections with
all maner of disorder, the whole outward man with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
and repugnancy to the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. 2. As
from these inward issues the outward man was many
wayes polluted: So the Jewes and we are put in minde,
that from that filthy puddle and fountaine of originall
sinne issue continually many uncleane issues into the life
and conversation. <hi>Mat. 15. 19. Out of the heart come
evill thoughts, murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false testimonies, slaunders: These are the things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
the man.</hi> 3. As these uncleane issues defiled whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they touched, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 4. to the 15. so herein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them and us, the infection of sinne and spreading
of it, and that the corruption of nature (which will put
forth it selfe in every thing) polluteth all that we touch:
<hi>Tit. 1. 15. Vnto them that are defiled and unbeleeving, is
nothing pure, but even their mindes and consciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi>
4. As those uncleane issues excluded and shut
them out of the campe and society of Gods people till
they were staid: so the foule issues of naturall corruption
(till stopped and stayed by grace) estrange us from God,
and from the common wealth of Israel. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18740:93"/>
The effect of all morall uncleannesse is to thrust every
man and woman under the curse of the Law and wrath
of God; who can no more abide a man in the foulenesse
of his nature, then men can the spawne of a most vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
serpent. In <hi>Adam</hi> all died. 5. As the description
of those issues brought the Jewes to the legall purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for when the Jew saw the danger of his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that if he separate not from it hee shall die in it
for defiling Gods Sanctuary, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. this made him
seeke to the remedy: So the true understanding of a
mans forlorne and desperate estate by nature; and that
<hi>except a man bee borne againe of water and the holy Ghost,
he can never see the kingdome of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 5.</note> this makes a man
flie out of himselfe to seeke righteousnesse and purity in

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18740:93"/>
describing the foulenesse and misery of the disease.
1. Leprosie proceeds from poisoned and corrupted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

men: sinne is of all men, and of all the man. Bodily
leprosie spreads over all parts of the body, but cannot
reach the soule: but this spreads over the whole man;
the soule and all the faculties are weakened and tainted;
there is, not a debility onely, but a corruption in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
will, conscience, memory, in all affections,
in all sences, in all parts; no man, no part of man exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted

and hatefull to men then leprosie: So nothing is so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

servants, no nor Angels themselves, unrevenged; hee

wait on sinne unpardoned; sorrows of this life and of
the life to come: And that we should put on mourning
garments of timely sorrow, and afflict our selves for our
sinnes, seeing wee are all poisoned with so incurable a
disease, as there is no hope to expect any cure in this
life; for every man carries the running issues of sinne to
his death naturall,<note place="margin">Signes of sinne and leprosie.</note> the most to the death eternall. 7. The
signes and symptomes of leprosie are most correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the symptoms and effects of sinne in the soule.
1. As there is a debility and weaknesse of all parts
because the spirits are exhausted: so sinne weakens all
faculties, because the spirit of grace is resisted and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out. 2. There is a tumour and swelling in the
flesh: here a tumour and proud swelling of minde;
none more proud then hee who hath least cause.
3. There is burning and thirst through the adust and
burnt blood by melancholy whereof it ariseth: here is
inflammation and burning of anger, of lust, and thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18740:94"/>
the world, after revenge, after preferments; and this
insatiable as every sinne is. 4. There is filthy putred
matter still breaking forth most loathsomely: so here
from within breaks out corrupt matter of envy, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of goodnesse, of uncleannesse in speaches and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
5. There is an hoarse and weake voice: here
the voice so weake as it cannot pray, or cannot be heard.
God heares not sinners; for either they pray not at all, or
they are in their sinnes. 6. There is a filthy stinking
breath; and therefore they must cover their lips, that
by their breath they might not infect others: So here is
a filthy breath of corrupt communication, of uncleane
and adulterous speaches, swearing and cursing speaches,
lying and false speaches, slanderous and uncharitable
speaches; and seldome doe such cover their lips, being
like the uncleane vessells of the Law which were ever
open to the corrupting and poisoning of numbers.</p>

                  <p>I. From the former description of legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Church and members, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many defilements.</note> note the state of Gods Church and people here
upon earth, subject unto many sorts of defilements and
pollutions within them, without them, and on every
hand of them; by foule and uncleane creatures and
persons, by foule courses and actions, which a godly
man may not touch or tast but hee is presently defiled,
as hee that toucheth pitch cannot but be defiled with it.
Where bee they that will see no Church, if they see any
uncleannesse? Or who say that God is in no such society
where any pollution is? seeing God vouchsafeth to walk
among his owne people, who were daily subject to so
many legall and morall pollutions. God might (if it
pleased him) wholly purge his floore here upon earth;
but it makes more for his glory to suffer sinne and evill,
and to set the Saints in the middest of defilements here
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18740:95"/>
below.<note place="margin">And why.</note> 1. There must be a difference betweene this
heaven and earth, and that new heaven and new earth
in which dwells nothing but righteousnesse; for had
the Saints no warre, there needed no watch, there
could bee no victory; if no seede time, no harvest.
2. GODS mighty power is more manifest in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and preserving a Church to himselfe out of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and among sinners; and hee magnifieth his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
both in covering and curing so great and many
corruptions. 3. The godly in sence of their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
are kept low in their owne eyes, and watchfull of
their waies; and so are driven out of themselves unto
Christ for righteousnesse, and unto God for strength
continually, as privy unto their owne continuall weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
So to subdue presumption <hi>Paul</hi> must have a buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to way-lay security comming on Israel, all the
Canaanites must not be subdued. 4. In that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

where righteousnesse shall dwell, yea the righteous and
holy God shall dwell immediately in the midst of his

most absolutely cleane and holy.</p>
                  <p>II. The Lord by so large a description of legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse

to the contemplation of the foulenesse of our natures, and
uncleannesse even in our birth and originall. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> yet the Apostle (better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the nature of it) calls it, <hi>The sinne;</hi> and
<hi>the sinning sinne;</hi> and <hi>the sinne which dwelleth in us, and
compasseth us about, Rom.</hi> 7. 17. Neither can a man ever
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18740:95"/>
be truely humbled and prepared for Christ, nor can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a good estate in him, whose daily corrupt issues
from an overflowing fountaine make him not seeme
marvelous filthy and uncleane in his owne eyes.
1. What is the reason that so many do Pharisaically
pride themselves, if not in the goodnesse of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
yet in some blinde hopes and presumptions that
they be not so bad as they are, or as some others be: but
because they never saw themselves in this glasse; which
onely lets a man see himselfe a masse of sinne, a lump of
uncle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>nnesse; and that no good thing is in his nature,
which in no part is free from the running issues of that
festred and inbred sinne? 2. Why do many doat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their owne works and sightly actions; either to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
confidence in them as meritorious, or at least (with
many Protestants) to rest in the civility and morality of
them without farther pursuit of the power of religion:
but that they see not that so evill trees cannot send forth
any good fruit, nor so bitter fountaines any sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
which could they but discerne, they would be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the best of their righteousnesse, and cast it away
(with <hi>Paul)</hi> as dung; and conclude that when Aloes and
wormewood yeeld a sweet taste, then might their fruits
be sweet and tastefull to God and themselves. 3. Why
do so many thousands contest against grace, stand upon
their honesty, good neighbourhood, hospitality, charity;
they thanke God they are no blasphemers, no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
adulterers, murderers; they wash the outside,
come to Church, heare sermons, are outwardly cleane
and formall; no man can challenge them, no nor they
themselves? but because they never saw the infection of
their soules, nor the inordinacy of their inner man,
which is a fountaine ever overflowing all the bankes:
most dangerous, most secret: hardest to find out, and
hardest to cure, and this deceives thousands in their
reckonings. 4. Why is the righteousnesse of faith in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18740:96"/>
the blood of Christ so much undervalued, and men so
hardly driven out of themselves to seeke righteousnesse
by him? But because they see not their owne unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and therein their hatefull estate before God untill
Christ the high Priest have made atonement for them.
For as that man who (being sick to death) feeles not his
sicknesse, nor discerns the depth and dangers of it,
seekes not greatly after the Physitian, he applyes either
no means, or some idle and impertinent things to small
purpose: so he that sees not the misery of his disease of
sinne, sees not the need of Christ, neglects the right
meanes, and contentedly deludes himselfe, running any
whither but to the right remedy.</p>
                  <p>It is fit and fruitful to looke a little neerer this disease
of nature,<note place="margin">Good to see and know our filthinesse by sinne.</note> that we may not onely make conscience of the
foulenesse of nature, but be thrust out of our selves to the
meanes of our cleansing: Considering 1. That this
uncleane issue (which the legall issues poynt us unto) is a
sinne against the whole Law of God in all branches of it,
whereas other sinnes are against one of the Tables, and
one of the Commandements. 2. This poyson of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the same in all men, that all may be humbled who
are borne children of the devill, enemies to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
all of us being in our very birth sonnes of death:
for in <hi>Adam</hi> all are dead. And as an image of rotten
wood must needs be rotten: so wee, hewne out of so
rotten a stocke. Who is it that is not a Leper from the
wombe? Let any man thrust his hand into his bosome, as
<hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 6. and he shall pull it out againe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous,
and as white as snow. Every man hath cause to
cry with the <hi>Leper, I am vncleane, I am uncleane.</hi> The
spawne of a Serpent are Serpents; and what are wee
but the spawne, the seed of <hi>Adam?</hi> 3. This Issue is
a generall disorder of the whole man, and of all parts.
Neither is bodily leprosie more generall and universally
spread over all the members, then sinne in the soule,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18740:96"/>
which is seated in all the members,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> so as from the
crowne of the head to the sole of the foot, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sound: but a generall ataxy or disorder in want of
all goodnesse in all parts, and pronenesse to all evill.
4. Miserable are the effects of this close uncleannesse:
As 1. In this Image of sinne, no ugly toad can bee so
hatefull to us, as wee unto God. 2. The whole man
lies subject under the curse and wrath of God; <hi>Rom. 5. 18,
the fault came on all to condemnation.</hi> 3. Nothing can
proceed from us but what is foule and damnable. What
can a Serpent cast out but poyson? Whatsoever our
owne strength or will can bring forth is tainted with
this leprosie; for freewill remaineth onely to evill.
4. Nothing without us that we can touch, but we taint,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

                        </gap>d uncleannesse.</note> noted in the infection of houses ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
garments. Both earthly things, all the creatures, all
our comforts, actions, to the unpure all is so: Yea divine
actions, the word, Sacraments, prayer, almes, all polluted
by us and to us, so long as we be unconverted and in our
uncleane nature. 5. An unregenerate man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with no man, but (as a Leper) he infects him by
example, provocation, corrupt opinions, frothy spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
fruitlesse behaviour. And if they that poyson mens
bodies are worthy extreame punishment, and every
man detests them: how much more severe wrath of God
are they liable unto, that do nothing but poyson mens
soules? 6. No Leper was so worthily cast out of the
campe; as all of us by nature are worthily cast out of the
society of Saints in earth and in heaven, yea from the
presence &amp; fellowship of God and Jesus Christ, and that
for ever. Sinne properly shuts out of heaven, no uncleane
thing comes there: nothing more hateful to God, nothing
but that hated by him. 7. All this misery we our selves
can neither discerne nor remedy. It makes us <hi>pure in our
owne eyes, though we be not washed, Prov.</hi> 30. 12. We lye
wallowing in our filthinesse, and delight in it as the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18740:97"/>
swine in the myre, and never are cured till we get out of
our selves to the high Priest, in whom onely it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to cleanse and cure us. Now seeing in this glasse
our owne disease and need of cure, let us returne to the
meanes of our cure in these three severall sorts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
and in the legall be led to the cure of morall
uncleannesse.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the kinds of legall uncleannesse.</p>

                  <p>I. The first meanes of purging Legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is washing;<note place="margin">Washing: blood of Christ.</note> which shadowed out the washing of
the sinner in the laver of Christs blood. All the water in
the sea cannot wash away the least sinne; that great
worke is appropriated to the blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh. 1.
7, the blood of Iesus Christ his sonne cleanseth us from all
sinne: Rev. 1. 5, who loved us, and washed us from our sinnes
in his blood:</hi> which blood is opposed to all legall wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object. Lev.</hi> 11. 44, this washing is called a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Sanctification is twofold 1. by the outward
signe,<note place="margin">Externi symboli &amp; professionis. Veritatis internae.</note> 2. by the inward truth. They by washing, sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically
and in outward profession by these rites san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
themselves: but thereby beleevers were led to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18740:97"/>
the internall truth, and the laver of the blood of Christ.
All this washing then leads us to the blood of Christ, by
which is meant his whole passion and obedience; by the
merit whereof he hath procured both remission of our
sinnes, and mortification of them. And herein is no small
resemblance 1. Washing is an applying of water to
foule parts:<note place="margin">Resemblance.</note> so in the cleansing of sinne must be a speciall
application of the blood of Christ; called, <hi>Heb. 9. 14, the
sprinkling of Christs blood upon the conscience.</hi> Which is
nothing else on Gods part but the imputation of Christs
sufferings to us: and on our owne part the application of
them to our selves by the hand of faith. 2. In Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
is a rubbing and scowring off of uncleanenesse
which will not easily off; and in some foulenesse they
must wash often for the surenesse of the worke: noting
the paines and true indeavour of the repentant heart in
mortification, and afflicting it selfe. It is well contented
with any beating and wringing, so hee may fetch out
the stayne of sinne, which sticks as close as his flesh to
his bones. 3. The uncleane party was to wash him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that is, his whole man and every part: which noteth
totall sanctification in the whole man and all parts and
members, that the washing may be as large and generall
as the foulenesse is. For whatsoever part is not washed
by Christ, hath no part in Christ, which made <hi>Peter</hi> say,
<hi>not my feet onely (Lord) but mine hands and head.</hi> 4. In
the foulenesse of Leprosie hee must wash againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
to note, that after our justification by the death of
Christ, we must looke to a second washing of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by his spirit. And because we have still washing
worke with us, wee must be still washing our selves by
daily labour in our owne reformation. This was more
lively signified in that other ceremony added to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
in the Leper, that hee must shave his haire againe
and again: signifying the paring away of superfluities and
lusts as fast as they grew; and a voluntary departing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18740:98"/>
from his owne secret corruptions, which were as many
as the haires of his head, and no lesse rooted in him; that
well he might shave and loppe them, but hee was out of
hope quite to unroot them as long as he lived. He must
keepe them under but cannot be rid of them: Hee must
shave the first day and the seventh day, and resist his lusts,
which daily grow up on him, as haire cut, quickly
growes againe. 5. The uncleane person must wash his
clothes as well as himselfe: signifying that we must part
with all impurity even the least, at least in endeavour,
cherishing none, favouring none. He must hate the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
garment spotted by the flesh, all occasions, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of evill, esteeming the least spot of sinne foule and
filthy enough. And all this is requisite in purifying of
the soule.</p>
                  <p>I. Labour against the smallest sinnes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Smallest sins to be put away.</note> Be not a mental
adulterer, banish unchastity in the eye and mouth, avoid
wanton company, as did <hi>Ioseph</hi> that of his Mistris. Thou

No Atheist, but a scorner of the persons and doctrine of
godly teachers? what doest thou but foame out thy
owne shame? If thou shouldst keepe thy selfe never so
pure, but partakest in other mens sinnes, thou art unclean.
This reproveth Magistrates, who (though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

worship to lye in streets, houses, fields, openly, &amp;c.
prophaning thus the day of the Lord, which is to bee

Ministers, openly pleading for drunkards and hatefull
blasphemers. This defileth masters, parents, husbands,

2. This meanes must be a Cow, not an Oxe or Bull. The
imbecillity of the sexe noteth the great humility of our
Lord Jesus; who being the mighty Lion of the tribe of
Judah, would so abase and weaken himselfe for our
sakes. 3. They must take her from the heard: so our
cleanser must be taken from among our selves, being true
and perfect man, taking our nature and our flesh, yea
our infirmities as the weak sexe importeth, in all things
save sinne like unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. The properties required in this Cow are foure.
1. She must be an heifer, in her youth and strength:
Christ offers himselfe, and must be taken for a sacrifice in
the flower of his strength, at three and thirty yeares. He
offers his best gifts, and dyes in his strength, and so his
offering was more free and acceptable. And wee also
should offer up our youth, strength, best times and gifts
to Jesus Christ, who offered himselfe in his best strength
to death for us. 2. The Cow must be red: Signifying
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18740:99"/>
1. the truth of Christs humane nature, being of the same
red earth that the first <hi>Adams</hi> body was. 2. the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse
of sinne which he was to undertake, and the
scarlet staine of it.<note place="margin">Isay 1. 18.</note> 3. the bitter and bloody passion of
Christ,<note place="margin">Isa. 63. 1.</note> and his cruell death. The red skin of the Cow
resembled the red garments of Christ all besprinkled:
1. With his owne blood. 2. with the blood of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
enemies. 3. presented unto his father, like the
coat of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> all stained with blood. 3. The Cow
must be without spot or blemish: to signifie the purity
of our Lord Iesus, in whom was never any spot or staine
of sinne. Though he was contented to be counted a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
yet he was no sinner: And though he had sinne on
himselfe, he had none in himselfe: as the Cow was slain
for sin, not being sinfull. Christ was <hi>ruddy</hi> through his
passion,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 10.</note> yet most <hi>white</hi> and spotlesse by his most perfect
and absolute righteousnesse. She must be without yoke,
on which never yoke came: signifying, 1. that Christ
(not necessarily, but) voluntarily tooke our nature, that
he might free us from our yoke. 2. his absolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from all the yoke of sinne, farther then he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
undertooke the burthen of it. 3. that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
subject to the yoke of humane precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
being the Law-giver to prescribe Lawes to
all, not to receive Lawes from any. 4. that none could
compell him to suffer for sinne, but his whole obedience
active and passive, was a freewill offering, hee having
power to lay downe his life, and to take it up againe.
5. he was more free from the yoke then any red heifer
could be. She indeed must be free in her selfe: he not
onely free in himselfe, but he must free all beleevers from
the yoke; whom the sonne sets free, they are free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>III. The actions about the Cow were five, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.
1. Action. 1. The congregation must deliver the Cow
to be slaine: so was Christ delivered to be slaine by the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18740:100"/>
whole body of the Iews. 2. She must not be delivered to
<hi>Aaron</hi> but to <hi>Eleazer</hi> his successor: signifying that the
death of Christ serveth all the successions and ages of the
Church, and must be taught by the ministers of all ages.
2. Action. She must be led out of the Camp, and there
burnt whole to ashes; her skin, flesh, blood, and dung,
<hi>ver.</hi> 5. Signifying 1. that Christ must be led out of
the gate of Ierusalem to suffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. and there 2.
must be crucified, by which he was made a whole burnt
offering. 3. that whole Christ is our comfort, his flesh
our meate, his blood our drinke, yea the very base dung
of those contumelies cast upon him were a part of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
offered up in the fire of his passion for us, to swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and sanctifie ours. 3. Action. <hi>Eleazer</hi> must take
of the blood with his finger, and sprinkle towards the
foreside of the Tabernacle of the assembly seven times,
<hi>ver.</hi> 4. Signifying 1. the purging of us by the blood
of Christ sprinkled on the conscience. 2. that Christs
death profits none to whom it is not specially applyed:
for the Cowes blood must be not shed onely, but sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
3. that onely the people and congregation of God
have benefit of the death and blood of Christ, for it was
sprinkled directly before the Tabernacle. 4. the seven
times sprinkling noteth 1. that that one oblation hath
vertue and merit enough. 2. the perfection of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
3. the need of often application of Christs
death. 4. the duration of it to all ages. 4. Action.
She must bee burnt with Cedar wood, scarlet lace,
and hysope, all which must be cast into the fire with her,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. signifying 1. three things in Christ. 1. the
Cedar of uncorrupt life. 2. the scarlet of fervent love
to mankinde. 3. the hysope of savoury obedience in
all things to his father, all which were in all his sufferings,
and fire of his passion sweetning it. 2. they noted three
things arising from Christs sufferings. 1. immortality,
signified by the Cedar, which is not subject to putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18740:100"/>
2. the scarlet, the merit of his blood applyed to
justification. 3. the hysope of mortification, healing
our corruptions, as hysope hath an healing quality. All
these three properly arise from the passion of Christ.
5. Action. A cleane person must gather the ashes of the
heifer, and lay them without the Campe in a clean place,
<hi>ver.</hi> 9. signifying 1. the buriall of Christ in a cleane
and new tombe wherein never man lay, a cleane place ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
used before. 2. that the merit of Christs death is
ever laid before God in the highest and holiest heavens.
3. the Christians account of Christs merit and passion,
who layeth them up as his chiefe treasure in the cleane
place of a pure heart and conscience, an onely fit closet to
keep the mystery of faith in.</p>
                  <p>IV. The use and end of these ashes was twofold,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 1. They must be kept for the Congregation:
signifying that there shall never want supply of grace and
merit from the death of Christ to any beleever that sees
his need of them. 2. Of them was made a water of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
thus: A cleane person tooke of the ashes of the
red Cow burnt, and put pure water into a vessell, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hysope dipped it, and sprinkled it upon the tent, the
persons, and vessels, and upon the uncleane person the
third and seventh day, and so he (washing his clothes
and flesh with water) was cleane at even, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19.
signifying 1. that the blood of Christ is the onely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of seperation for persons separate, to seperate them
from their uncleannesse. The water made of the ashes of
Christs death &amp; bloodshed, sprinkled upon the unclean,
can onely purge the conscience from dead workes.
2. that this blood of Christ must be sprinkled with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope
of faith and mortification. For hysope hath a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
quality, and is put sometimes for that which onely
and properly cleanseth,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>purge me with hysope,</hi> that is, with
the blood of that eternall sacrifice, figured by that which
is sprinkled with hysope. 3. that this blood of Christ
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18740:101"/>
must bee often applied; the third day, and the seventh
day: The death and merit of Christ must be often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
and applied to the heart. For it is a perpetuall
and eternall purging and sprinkling water in the Church,
and we must have daily recourse unto it.</p>
                  <p>I. That the Lord hath appointed meanes for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all kind of impurity:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 1. There is a way to cleanse every uncleannesse.</note> 1. That his people and we
might know, that by no infirmity and frailty we shall fall
quite out of the grace of God: 2. That the Lord takes not
the forfeit of all the scapes, and foule falls of his children,
utterly to forsake them: seeing the Jew that was legally
polluted seventy times seven times, was as often recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in againe as he was cleansed, according to the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Sanctuary: 3. That we should not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
nor the weake Christian bee quite dejected in the
sence of the multitude of his frailties and foule touches,
seeing the Gospel affoords us the remedy and meanes to
cleanse all morall uncleannesse, no lesse certainly and fully,
then the Law to the Jews, to purge their legall.</p>
                  <p>II. As the Jew was no sooner defiled by touching a
dead man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 2. Have recourse to the meanes.</note> or bone, or grave, or tent, or any thing about
him, but hee must presently repaire to the meanes of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
cleansing: So every Christian defiled by the least
touch of any dead worke must have recourse to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
appointed in the Gospel. The Law appointed the
water of the ashes of a redd Cow: but the Gospel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
the redd blood of Jesus Christ, sprinkled and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by faith (as by hyssope) upon the conscience. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<note place="margin">Motives.</note>
1. The necessity: The person defiled not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this sprinkling upon him shall be cut off from Israel,
<hi>verse</hi> 13. So whosoever hath not the blood of Christ
sprinkled upon his soule, shall bee cut off from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and inheritance of the Saints, <hi>Mark. 16. 16, hee that
beleeves not shall be damned.</hi> 2. Every sinne is a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God, who being a God of pure eyes cannot
abide the filth of it; and therefore wee had need conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18740:101"/>
to have this water of separation for the washing
of our hearts daily, and often every day; because it is
gathering some uncleannesse every houre, yea every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
3. An uncleane creature or vessell could not bee
of any service to man, for hee must not touch it till it be
cleansed: So a sinner so long as he is uncleane and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
cannot be of any good use, nor present any accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
service to God.<note place="margin">Isai. 1.</note> And therefore the Prophet, <hi>Wash
you, and cleanse you, and then come.</hi> No man dare present
any thing to a King with a foule hand: the Lord will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
no such present. 2. <hi>Cor. 6. 17, 18. touch no uncleane
thing, and I will receive you, and bee a father unto you:</hi>
Implying that the Lord will not receive him that any
way communicats with sinne, if obstinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
4. Nothing else can recover our beauty and first
estate of holinesse and happinesse but this laver. A cloth
once soiled never recovers the beauty and whitenesse
but by washing. This laver onely brings backe a white
and unspotted innocency. All the holy water in the Sea
of Rome cannot wash one sinne; for that hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
no institution, no promise. Besides, all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Ceremonies are dead, which in their life time could
not cleanse by the meere <hi>deed done,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ex opere operato.</note> as they say theirs
doth. 5. How vaine is it to see men and women cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and carefull in washing their bodies and clothes,
they will not suffer the least spot on them, but wash
them weekely: and yet goe on yeare by yeare in the
foule defilements of sinne, and never desire to be washed
and rinsed in the water of separation; nay nothing more
troubles them then to be called to reformation? A clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man will have his clothes washed weekely, but his
hands and face every day: A cleanly Christian will not
be lesse carefull of his heart.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 3. Be very careful to avoid spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. Seeing there was so much businesse in legall
cleansing of the least foulenesse; how carefull were the
Jews to avoid those foulenesses? and how much more
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18740:102"/>
should Christians bee to avoid the morall? 1. In
themselves. A good heart will be affected with the least
touch of sinne, as <hi>David</hi> to cut <hi>Sauls</hi> lappet, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
appearance as well as evill it selfe.<note place="margin">Iustus metuit non solum a peccato, sed &amp; a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione &amp; la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>e pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati. Ambr. de institut. virg.</note> 2. From o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For the Jew might bee impured from others as
well as by himselfe. We must not communicate in other
mens sinnes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. The just man bewareth not
onely sinne it selfe, but even the contagion and infection
of sinne. Watch thy selfe; as privie to thine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and thy adversaries subtlety and strength. Watch
against others sinnes; as being beset with snares. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
with good <hi>Iacob, Gen. 49 6. Into their secret my
soule shall not come.</hi> This strict watching is counted
commonly foolish precisenesse, nicety, hatefull purity:
but God esteemes it otherwise. It is an apparant losse of
mens favour, preferments, and worldly helps: but hee
onely finds the favour of God, and the happinesse to
see God.</p>

is appointed,<note place="margin">Birds.</note> 
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 14, 15. In this, 1. What
fowles must bee prepared for the offering; two Turtles,
or two young Pigeons; and so for the womans, <hi>vers.</hi> 29.
Of the cleane kind of birds: signifying and resembling
the purity of Christs humane nature. Besides his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
simplicity, meeknesse, chastity, charity, fruitfulnesse;
of all which vertues these Doves were expresse Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems.
2. What was the use of these fowles: 1. They
must bring them to the Priest: No man must offer his
owne sacrifices, but must present them to God by
Christ the onely high Priest: 2. They must bring them
to the doore of the Tabernacle; for publicke service
must not bee privately performed; and figured our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
by Christ the doore: 3. One must bee made a
sinne offering, the other a burnt offering. The sacrifices
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18740:102"/>
were types of that onely sacrifice of the Sonne of God
our Redeemer, performed upon the Altar of his Crosse,
for the expiating the sinnes and foule issues of the whole
world. In them both, 1. what they were, 2. what
were the ceremonies about them. 1. The sinne offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was a sacrifice in which the whole beast or bird
was not consumed with fire (as the burnt offering was)
but slaine for the expiation of sinne: The use of which
was to figure and seale up to the Jews the expiation
of their sinnes in Christ.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Now Christ is made manifest
for the doing away of sinne, by the slaine sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;</hi>
and see <hi>verse</hi> 28. The burnt offering was a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in which the whole beast or bird was consumed
with fire offered up therein to God for a savour of rest;
namely to appease and pacifie Gods wrath for some sin,
or sinnes committed: Which signified that Christ was
to bee a whole burnt offering, and to bee wholly consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in soule and body with the fire of his Fathers wrath,
that hee might bee a sweet smelling savour for us. <hi>Hee
gave himselfe for us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>a sacrifice and oblation for a sweet
smelling savour.</hi> Neither did the beleeving Jews thinke
that God was appeased by any vertue in the burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but through the eternall sacrifice of Christ shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein. 2. What were the ceremonies about these
fowles, for they all pointed at Christ. 1. For the sinne
offering of fowles, the ceremonies are appointed, <hi>Levit.
5.</hi> 8, 9. and they bee three. 1. <hi>Rite.</hi> The Priest must
wring the necke of the Dove asunder, but not plucke it
cleane off;<note place="margin">Levit. 1. 15.</note> and the same rite in the burnt offering: The
necke must bee pincht with the naile of the Priest to let
out the blood, but the head must not bee pluckt off from
the body: Signifying. 1. That although Christ was to
die, yet his divinity and humanity should not bee seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
2. That the death of this innocent Dove should
not interrupt his head-ship of the Church. Hee was to
bee pinched to death; but his head should not bee seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18740:103"/>
from his body and members, which is his Church.
3. That Christ should die indeed, but no bone of him
must be broken, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 36. shadowed also in the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.
2. <hi>Rite.</hi> The Priest must sprinkle the blood of
the sinne offering upon the side of the Altar, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. and
the like in the burnt offering, <hi>Chap. 1. 15:</hi> signifying that
all the vertue and merit of Christs blood for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of sinne, was drawen from the Altar of his Deity.
He must be God that must purchase the Church with his
blood,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. God was in Christ. 3. <hi>Rite.</hi>
All the rest of the blood must be powred out at the foot
of the Altar: signifying not onely the powring out of the
blood of Jesus Christ our true sinne offering upon the
Altar of the Crosse, without which shedding of blood
can bee no remission of sinnes: but also the blood pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the foot of the Altar, that is, those clots and drops
of blood plentifully flowing from him in his agony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his passion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. as hee was going up to the
Crosse. 2. For the Dove appointed for the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
(besides the former rites) some other are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.<note place="margin">Levit. 1. 16.</note>
1. The Priest must plucke out the maw with
his feathers, and cast them besides the Altar on the East
side in the place of the ashes: For these were things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane;
and signified that Christ should bring no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
thing to his suffering, but present a most spotlesse
and holy oblation to the Lord; for else had it not beene
of sweet smell. 2. The Priest must divide and cleave
the bird with his wings, but not asunder: signifying
Christ, who seemed by his death to bee burnt, extinct,
and perished; for so he was in the esteeme of his owne
disciples as they were going to Emmaus: but yet hee
was not quite sundred, but rose againe by his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and ever liveth sittting at his Fathers right hand to
make requests for us. Yea his owne words might seeme
to imply a sundring, when he saith; <hi>Why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
mee:</hi> but that the ingemination of his former
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18740:103"/>
words <hi>(my God, my God)</hi> doth strongly prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
3. This bird must bee throughly consumed to
ashes, to make it a sweet savour to the Lord, <hi>Levit. 1. 17:</hi>
signifying that never was any thing so gratefull and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Lord, as the whole burnt sacrifice of his
Sonne; in which hee smelled a savour of eternall rest.
To which the Psalmist alludeth,<note place="margin">Psal. 20. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Let him smell a savour
of all thy oblations, and turne thy burnt offerings into ashes.</hi>
4. When all these rites were observed, the party that
was uncleane shall bee cleane, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. 8. and <hi>Chap. 15.
13, 28:</hi> signifying that a party justified by Christs blood,
and exercising true repentance, and the study of holinesse
and new life; is brought in againe into the right and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of God and his people, whatsoever his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
formerly hath beene. And thus hath the legall
cleansing of this person brought us to the Evangelicall in
Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>I. Sundry grounds of consolation to the Church
and people of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Comfort to the godly.</note> 1, As Christ seemed cleane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and sundred from his Father and from his Church
but was not: so his members often seeme quite sundred
from God and all comfort, but are not, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8. and
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 9. A godly man may bee in such a straight as
<hi>David</hi> was, when thus he brake forth to <hi>Ionathan; As
the Lord liveth, and as thy soule liveth, there is but one step
betweene me and death:</hi> and yet when hee can see no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
God makes a passage forth. Hence may a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
(with <hi>Paul)</hi> challenge all perills and dangers, and
contemne them as too weake <hi>to separate us from Christ,
Rom.</hi> 8. 39. yea in all things wee are not onely conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
but more then conquerours. So was Christ in
death, and from under the grave more then a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Let a Christian be slaine it hinders him not from
being a conquerour; and what ever hee may lose, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not the love of God; who loveth him to the end,
whom hee once loveth; and therefore onely the sound
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18740:104"/>
Christian is in a sure estate. If sorrow be for a night, joy
will returne in the morning; after darkenesse as sure to
see light. As Jesus Christ keepes his headship, and death
cannot sever him quite: so the members may bee pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
(yet not quite off) but abide members still. 2. As
the speciall providence of God watched his owne sonne,
that though hee was in wicked hands that wanted no
will, yet they were kept from breaking one bone of him:
soe doth the same prouidence watch over his members;
that howsoever the wicked of the world pinch and
presse them,<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 20.</note> yet the promise is made to them, <hi>He keepes
all their bones, not one of them is broken,</hi> that is, without
the will of our heavenly Father, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. Not an
hayre shall fall; for the same providence watcheth the
head and members. This consideration is used by Christ
to remoove excessive feare of men. If thou see thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
encrease as bees about thee, ready to strike and sting:
Let thy waies please the Lord, he can 1. turne their hearts
to peace as <hi>Esaus</hi> to <hi>Iacob</hi> when he purposed his death;
and <hi>Labans</hi> to <hi>Iacob</hi> when he intended evill intreaty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. 2. He can turne their counsell to folly, and
bring it on their owne heads, as in <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi>
3. He can turne their evill to thy good and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
according to the saying of <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his brethren,

Christ brought no uncleane thing to his sacrifice (figured
in pulling out the maw and feathers, and casting them

walke amongst an holy people: And teacheth how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
we Christians should be to cleanse our selves from
<hi>all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And that we
should be ever stopping up those uncleane issues which
disturbe our chastity of body or mind, which these Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
issues specially aime at. Oh this chastity of minde and
body is a singular grace. For 1. It stands with the will
of God; 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 3, 4, This is the will of God even your
sanctification; and that every one possesse his vessell in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and honour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Casta Deus mens est, casta vult mente vocari.</note> 2. It stands with the nature of God,
which is most holy and pure; God is a pure chast
Spirit, and will bee prayed unto with a pure and chast
heart. How can foule fornicators and adulterers thinke
that their prayers can get into heaven, and themselves
shut out? 3. By holinesse and chastity of mind and
body thou becommest a Temple of the holy Ghost,
1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19:</hi> Without which thou art no better then a

of the body; which 1. is for the Lord, that is, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
for the glory of the maker. 2. the Lord is for the
body, namely to redeeme it, so as the body also is a part
of Gods purchase. 3. the Lord is the head, and the
bodies are members of Christ. Oh what a great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
(as <hi>Ioseph</hi> calls it, <hi>Gen. 39. 9.)</hi> to make it a member
of an harlot? 5. Follow holinesse and chastity; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

inward purity first. For 1. Whence issue these but
from a wicked and impenitent heart? 2. God lookes
first at the cleannesse of the heart, knowing that if hee
find that uncleane nothing is cleane. 3. Morality and
cleanlinesse make a man care for the cleannesse of his
face, but grace and religion must make him looke to the
cleannesse of his heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 14. Because he knowes that
no beauty of the face can allure a man so much, as the
cleannesse of heart allureth. 4. Get grace into thy
heart, and it cannot choose but send out, as Christ saith,
<hi>According to that which is within.</hi> According to the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart the mouth will speake, the eye will
looke, the hand will worke, the foot will walke. Get
thy heart purged and washed, and it is impossible that
thy life should be foule. 5. In vaine do men struggle
and strive to cast off some wast boughs of sinfull actions,
if they seeke not to strike up the roote. Thou wouldst
avoyd oathes and lyes in thy tongue, but shalt never
doe it while thou hast a swearing and lying heart. Thou
wouldst avoid fornication and adultery in the act, in the
eye, in the speech, but never shalt thou stop this issue, if
thou hast an adulterous heart: And so in other sinnes.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now followes the oblation for the uncleannesse of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie.
The cleansing of the Leper is in <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. where
we read of two sorts of oblations prescribed.<note place="margin">Leper two wayes cleansed.</note> 1. For
the cleansing of him that hee might come into the tent.
2. After his cleansing and comming into the tent, hee
must offer three Lambes, one for a trespasse offering, one
for a sinne offering, another for a burnt offering, with a
number of ceremonies about the Lambes, all leading to
Christ. But in this place we are onely to speake of the
former, concerning his cleansing, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. from <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
to 8. Where 1. The Leper to be cleansed must bee
brought to the Priest. For he onely must discerne and
pronounce of it, whether it be cured or uncleane: signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
that the sinner that desires to be cleansed, must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to Jesus Christ the onely high Priest of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
who onely is able to cleanse and heale our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
of sinne, and herein is farre beyond all those types.
The Priest could discern of bodily leprosie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them cleane if they were so, but hee could not
make them cleane if they were not. But Iesus Christ can
properly forgive sinne, the soules leprosie, being the
healing God, and onely Physitian of soules. 2. The
Priest must goe out of the campe unto him to consider
him: to signifie, how Iesus Christ findes us when he first
comes unto us, namely such as (having the most loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
leprosie running upon us) have no right to the
communion of Saints, nor to any of the priviledges of
Gods people, but outcasts and aliens from God, from the
faith, and from the common wealth of Israel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.
3. The Priest must first see him healed, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the exact cleansing, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. signifying a twofold
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18740:106"/>
action of Iesus Christ in the curing of the leprosie of sin.
For, 1. he must heale the sinner by the grace of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and sound conversion: but this is not all, for there
remains a great deal to do before we can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And therefore 2. he must bestow on us his Spirit, to
worke in us a daily growth and proceeding in sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
before we can be pronounced cleane. 4. The
Priest must prepare 1. two little live birds of the clean
kinde, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 1. two birds, to note the twofold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Iesus Christ, his deity and humanity. 2. two
little birds, to note the humility and meane esteeme of
our Lord and Saviour Christ. 3. two cleane birds, to
note the unspotted and surpassing purity of both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
4. two live birds, one to die and the other to
live, to note that Christ had one nature to dye in, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not subject to death: As also the twofold estate of
our Lord Iesus, his suffering and dying estate, and his
glorious and exalted estate. 2. he must prepare Cedar
wood, scarlet, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ysope: noting (as we have heard)
the excellent graces that Christ brings to his oblation,
both in regard of himselfe, his Church, and his father:
And signifying that Christ and his graces are inseperable:
And teacheth that no man can thinke to bee cleansed by
the blood of Christ, that is carelesse to receive his graces;
which thou must as eagerly desire as himselfe. 5. The
use of these materialls of cleansing, concerne 1. the
dying bird. 2. the living bird. 3. the party to bee
cleansed.</p>
                  <p>First concerning the dying birde. 1. One of the
birds must be slaine: pointing at the death of Christ,
without which is no purging or cleansing of sinne, <hi>Heb
9.</hi> 22. But one bird onely dyed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> so <hi>Christ was put to
death concerning the flesh. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. 2. It must bee
slaine over running water, that the blood might fall into
the water. The blood falling into the water signified:
1. that a fountaine of grace by the death of Christ is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18740:107"/>
both for justification and sanctification. For wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and blood here meet, shadowing the streames of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and blood issuing from the side of Christ in his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. 2. The bird slaine over running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
signified the innocency of the death of Christ, for
though he must dye, yet his blood is in pure streames, as
running water is. 3. That this water must be running
water, not standing; signifying that there is a continuall
cocke and conduit of grace overflowing from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
ever running and issuing from Christ to the refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of thirsty and weary soules beleeving in his name.
4. By the falling of the blood into running water might
also be signified, that the death of Christ should run into
the Ministery of the Gospell, as the waters from under
the Sanctuary every way. As Christ spake of <hi>Maries</hi> fact
preparing him to his death: so much more of his death
it selfe, what he hath done and suffered shall bee every
where preached to the worlds end. 3. This water
must be in an earthen vessell. Not onely to signifie that
Christ must sweat and powre forth in his death, water
and blood according to his humane nature, (which for
the time of his abasement was a fraile and brittle vessell,
subject to infirmities and contempt, and in all things like
unto ours onely sinne excepted) but also that this blessed
treasury of the Church should bee retained and held in
earthen vessells, that is, the faithfull ministers of Christ;
how contemptible soever they are in the world, yet these
shall cary and disperse these blessed mysteries unto men,
as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the live Sparrow. The generall
signification of it was Christ now alive raised from the
dead, who can dye no more, but ever liveth, and sitteth
at the right hand of God, and that by the power of his
divinity. And 1. This Sparrow must be used also to
the cleansing of the Leper. For neither the humanity of
Christ without his deity, nor his deity without his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18740:107"/>
can cleanse or justifie the sinner. Neither the life
of Christ without his death, nor his death without his
life can availe us to righteousnesse. <hi>Acts 20. 28. God</hi>
shed his <hi>blood</hi> to purchase the Church to himself. 2. The
Priest must dip the live bird, and the Cedar, and scarlet
lace, and hysope in the blood of the Sparrow slaine and
pure water, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. signifying 1. That the deity of
Christ (which is impassible in it selfe) can yeeld us no
comfort alone, had it not been joyned to an humanity
subject to passion, which is plainly meant by dipping the
live bird in the blood of the slaine. For therefore the
sonne of God must take our nature, to better our nature,
and take our flesh,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> that <hi>by death he might destroy him that
had the power of death.</hi> 2. The scarlet, cedar and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope
must be dipped also, to shew that all the graces we
receive from him must be dipped in his blood, by which
alone we have both accesse unto grace, and acceptation
into grace. For by the dipping and union of this live
bird and slaine, we come into the grace and favour of
God, being united first to his humanity, then to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and so are knit to his whole person, and by him
we come to the father. 3. The Priest must let the live
bird goe into the broad field, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. signifying 1.
Christs escape and deliverance from death, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the grave. 2. His exaltation after he was once
consecrated, his ascending on high, and being made high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. 3. The publication
and manifestation of righteousnesse purchased by the
death of Christ, in the broad &amp; open field of the Church,
and this in the daily ministery of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, concerning the party to whom this cure
must be applyed. The Priest must sprinkle on him that is
to be cleansed, this blood seven times: signifying 1.
That only Christ Jesus doth sprinkle his blood on penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
soules, from whom only they must expect pardon &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
from sins. 2. That Christs blood must be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18740:108"/>
applyed to every beleever, to every thing that is to be
cleansed: Partly by Gods imputation of Christ and his
merits to the penitent sinner: Partly by his Ministers in
the publishing and speciall applying the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to every soule that is weary. 3. Seven times
sprinkling noteth 1. Perfect justification by the blood
of Christ, the number of seven times, perfect sprinkling;
he is able <hi>perfectly to save</hi> all that come unto him,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 23.</note> and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no other seeking of other merits to satisfie or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
2. To put the uncleane person in minde how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he parts from his foulenesse: and us, that it is no easie
thing to be rid of sinne. 3. How weakly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
our selves apply the blood of Christ, that have need
of so many sprinklings: to humble us for our weaknesse
of faith, and slow progresse in sanctification.</p>

and curing this disease,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. No easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be rid of sinne.</note> in generall teach us two things.</p>
                  <p>I. That it is no small businesse to be rid of the leprosie
of the soule, and infection of sinne; which was but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
in that, as that was occasioned by this. For
whence is bodily leprosie, but from leprosie of the soule?
Or what is it that strikes the body with such contagious
sicknesse, but the infection and sicknesse of the soule? As
in <hi>Gehezi, Mariam, Vzziah;</hi> whose bodies were so fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infected and deformed by the leprosie of the soule, and
corruption of heart. And who sees not how the Lord
would lead them and us to take speciall notice hereby of
the soules leprosie by sinne, in that hee committeth the
knowledge and discerning of this disease of leprosie to
the Priests, sending them to the Physitians of their soules
and not to the Physitians of their bodies, whom one
would thinke, it more specially and properly concerned?
This should admonish us all, that if there be so much adoe
to get cleane bodies, cleane faces, cleane skins; how
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18740:108"/>
great our care and businesse should be to get clean soules,
the soile of which cleaves not to the skin onely, but sticks
closer to us then our skin or bones; and yet wee thinke
every slight sigh, or Lord have mercy, or three words at
our death sufficient to rid us of our sinnes, and soules le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie.</p>
                  <p>II. How carefull the Lord is to sever the cleane from
uncleane for feare of generall infection.<note place="margin">Separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the vile.</note> Teaching 1. the
Magistrate, that as the Lord puts difference betweene
him that sweareth, and him that feareth an oath: so
should they to incourage and countenance the clean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that is, the godly and faithfull. <hi>David</hi> set his eyes
on the godly in the land, not to maligne or wrong them,
but to cherish their persons, and help up religion and the
feare of God in them: As also to discountenance and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the foule blasphemer, the drunkard, Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
idle persons and gamesters, that thrust themselves out
of their calling all the week long. But if a man by his
course shuffle cleane and uncleane together, nay runne
with the uncleane, and countenance gamesters, swearers,
bibbers, how doth he execute the judgements of God?
2. A good minister then stands in the counsell of God,
when he <hi>severs the precious from the vile, Ier.</hi> 15. 19. The
Priest in the Law must pronounce him cleane that is so
indeed. He durst not pronounce a foule person to bee
cleane, nor a cleane person foule. Then how dares a man
that stands to judge between the Lord and his people,
scandalize or scorne such as endeavour most to be clean?
How comes it that we doe not heare drunkards, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
theeves, swearers, blasphemours so rated and disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as them? Or how dare men sell praises of religion to
foule Atheists, swearers, haters and despisers of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(as if men should gild rotten posts, or wash dead
bricks) making them at their death seeme as white as
lawne, who all their life were white as Lepers? Well,
let not the despised members of Christ be discouraged;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18740:109"/>
we know that the judgement of Christ shall passe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
betweene the cleane and uncleane. If thy heart
be upright, let all men cast the foule brand of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
on thee, Jesus Christ shall pronounce thee cleane.
3. Every good man must and will be glad of this sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
rejoyce in that arbitrement that differenceth clean
and uncleane, as most savoury. Wicked men can abide
nothing lesse then this shedding &amp; differencing of men.
Whence are so many tumults? Oh you are more holy
then all other, you are the pure ones, you are all cleane,
&amp;c? but because they have learned a trick to deceive
themselves, and to hide their foulenesse (as they thinke)
by crowding all into one confusion. Now is that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
onely intolerable that fetcheth them out of their
holes, and casts them out among their uncleane fellowes,
for whose company they be a great deale fitter, then for
the society of Saints and beleevers.</p>
                  <p>II. Note in speciall.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Christ discerns the leprosie of sinne.</note> 1. In that the Leper must bee
sent to the Priest to have his leprosie discerned: we see
that our Lord Jesus (who was typified by the high
Priest) can discerne our leprosie. Thou maist hide thy
sinne from man, but thou canst not deceive him, no idle
excuse or fig-leafe can cover thee. If he see thee an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
a swearer, an unjust person, a covetous or proud
person, if he see thee an enemy, a profane person; he will
judge thee a Leper. Thou canst not sinne (though never
so secretly) but thou art sure to be discerned and tryed, by
him whose eyes are as a flame of fire. And if he judge
thee a leper, he will pronounce thee a leper, and thou
canst not appeale from, but must stand to his judgement.
What if men applaud and commend thee for an honest
man, a good neighbour, a just man, if he judge thee a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
What had it beene better, if all the congregation
had taken part with a leper, if the Priest pronounced him
uncleane? And if he pronounce thee uncleane, he will
shut thee out of the campe, out of the society of God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18740:109"/>
and his Saints, till thou be est seasonably cleansed. Men
may faile in their censures, and shut out the cleane for
vncleane (as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 34. the Jews did the man that was
borne blind) and hold in the uncleane for base respects:
but Jesus Christ he shuts him out unpartially, whom hee
pronounceth a leper.</p>
                  <p>II. Then was the leper healed, when in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the Priest hee was so; and then the Priest must
pronounce him so.<note place="margin">Onely they are cleansed from sinne, whom Christ accounts so to be.</note> The Priest could not make him clean,
but pronounce him cleane: Even so, thou art then clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from thy sinne, when in the judgement of Christ
(our high Priest) thou art so; who not onely can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thee cleane, but make thee so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may I know that Christ accounts
mee cleane?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> When his word by the mouth of his servant
pronounceth thee cleane, accounts thee so. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yee bind or loose in earth, shall bee bound and loosed
in heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. Christ onely
properly pardons sinne, and remits it, 1. by merit;
2. by efficacy of conferring; and no Minister can thus
remit sinne: But every Minister must pronounce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
pardon to penitent sinners; and when he doth this
in Christs Name, Christ from heaven pronounceth the
leper to be cleane.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But there may bee errour in the Priests sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and the Ministers judgement is not infallible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The sentence of the Priest was infallible, if hee
kept him to the rules of inquisition: And the Minister
pronouncing pardon upon penitent sinners cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
though thou mayest deceive thy selfe in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
promises and grants of pardon not belonging
unto thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What are the rules of inquisition of direction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If by rubbing the place hee see it grow
red the leprosie is in way of cure;<note place="margin">Marks of one cleansed from sinne.</note> if it bee not red by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18740:110"/>
rubbing, it is incurable: So if the sinner be ashamed and
blush at his sinne, if godly abashment hath begun his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
it is a good signe of cure. 2. If the spot pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with a needle, there come forth blood, it is in the
way of cure: So sinners pricked with the needle of the
Law, if they have sence of paine which makes them cry
out of themselves, and see the need of Christ, it is a
good signe. Men pricked now adaies, stirre up their
blood against the Physician; but such are farre from cure.
3. A leper was healed when his leprosie was stayed,
and went no further: So hee is to be pronounced cleane
who truely turnes to God; sinne hath lost dominion in
him; sinne growes lesse and lesse; the stirrings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
are abated; hee cannot doe as he hath done, or
would doe; nor forget that he was cured. 4. When
the conscience is bathed in that fountaine in which water
&amp; blood have met, then is the leper clean. When by the
merit of Christ the sinner is fully justified, &amp; by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ he is in part sanctified, &amp; riseth up towards
full sanctification; then is he truly pronounced clean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Alas! I am then vncleane still; I find much
foulenesse and folly present with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The leper and sinner may be <hi>truely</hi> cleansed,
never <hi>fully</hi> in this life; for every day will make him
foule even after true repentance: but wee must daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
our repentance for daily cleansing. 2. Remember,
that the leper must shave his haire againe and againe, but
hee leaves the roots behind; yet hee was pronounced
cleane, though the haire was still growing, and for all the
roots. 3. The running water in the basen for the cure
of the leper, signified a continuall flowing of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of grace from Christ to the heart of the sinner, for
his continuall washing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. What every man must doe in sence of his
spirituall leprosie. Something is to bee done before the
cure: something after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:18740:110"/>
I. Before the cure. 1. As the leper discerning his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
owne misery,<note place="margin">What is to be done before this cure.</note> esteemed him an happy man that was
cleane: So thou seeing this disease, must judge thy selfe
most unhappy and miserable of all men, as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.
and never thinke thy selfe happy till thou hast got a cure,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. Every leper cried out, I am uncleane: the
same must bee thy complaint and cry. 2. Get thee to
the Priest: Goe to Christ in humility, as that leper
<hi>(Matt. 8. 2.) Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean;</hi>
and the least touch of Christ shall make thee clean, <hi>ver. 3.
3. Naaman,</hi> being strucke with leprosie, must wash
and bee cleane: So must thou bewaile and lament thy
estate; wash thy selfe in the salt sea of teares, that God
may wash thee with a sea of mercy. Especially in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sinnes (as in a deeper leprosie) take up deeper humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
and repentance; as <hi>David</hi> washed his couch
with teares.</p>
                  <p>II. After the cure. 1.<note place="margin">And what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</note> If God have healed thy le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
be thou thankefull; so <hi>Naaman, 2. King.</hi> 5. 15. Not
as the nine lepers, of whom none returned backe to give
thankes.<note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> Would to God one of ten were as thanfull as
we ought, for so great a cure. 2. Bring thy gift to the
Lord for the curing, for so the lepers were enjoyned:
that is, pay thy vows; offer up thy selfe and all thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<hi>an acceptable sacrifice unto God, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
unto God; present all thy sacrifices by the high
Priest Jesus Christ, in whom alone thou canst finde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Alas, I have nothing worthy giving unto
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Thou canst give no lesse then true endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of obedience; and then, be they never so weake,
hee that accepts the will for the deed, will accept them.
2. God prescribed a smaller offering fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the poore then
for the rich; the poore man must provide a sacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the labour of his hands: To comfort the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18740:111"/>
weake Christian, who offering according to his ability,
is respected according to that he hath, not according to
that hee hath not. 3. The third thing after the cure is
to avoid the company of lepers, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. If a man
be an incorrigible sinner, let him be to thee as an heathen
or Publicane, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 17. A good lesson for Masters of
families to cast out leprous persons from the rest. It is
incredible what mischiefe one swearer, one drunkard,
one wanton, one profane beast may doe in an house. We
have not more usually seene an whole house infected, and
poisoned up by one plaguie person: then whole houses
corrupted by some one leud person; which suffered
(as one swine in a garden) roots up all that is good.</p>
                  <p>So much of holy persons: Now follow holy things.</p>

things.</hi> All which in the old Testament, and Jewish po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
did especially aime at, and point out Christ after a
farre clearer manner then did the former. And therefore
for the confirming of our faith in the new Covenant,
we must goe on to shew the correspondence and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scriptures in both Testaments: And that
Christ is the same in both; and the faith of beleevers
the same in substance, onely differing in the maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
and publication.</p>
               <p>A man that superficially lookes over the bookes of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and sees so great an heape of ceremonies and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18740:111"/>
ordinances, would wonder what the Lord meant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine
so many, and (as reason would judge) so needlesse
institutions to his owne people; of which they can
make nothing by cursory, scarse by considerate reading.
And hence (whereas the Jews were so superstitiously
observant of the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> as that they had at
their fingers ends a great number not of the precepts
onely, but of the letters and pricks of every booke and
chapter:) Christians (unlesse it be in point of history)
almost reject the books of <hi>Moses;</hi> not for their credit
and truth, but for their utility and use, as not touching
them. But to him that readeth and considereth will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:<note place="margin">Vse of legall ceremonies.</note>
1. How truely our Saviour affirmeth <hi>(Ioh. 5.
46.)</hi> that <hi>Moses wrot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> of him:</hi> partly by promises and

him as their greatest Prophet: but) in the speciall
prophecies and promises concerning the individuall
person of Christ; therefore they could not beleeve in
Jesus Christ. 2. How aptly and wisely the most wise
God did accommodate himselfe to this people, in loding
them with so many burdensome ceremoniall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Fitnesse to the Jews nature.</note>
and yet not one of them in vaine. For, 1, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the nature of the people; it was rude and dull, and
needed corporall and externall elements and rudimen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>s
to helpe them. Besides it was not onely naturally super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
and addicted to idolatry: but had lived some
Centuries of yeares in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was infected with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
rites. And further, they were now to goe into
the land of the Canaanites, and were in danger to learne
their fashions, <hi>Deut. 4. 16:</hi> And therefore the Lord
would prescribe to their whole life (both in sacred and
civill things) abundance of Ceremonies; whereby their
senses should be exercised, their faith excited, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18740:112"/>
preserved, and themselves restrained from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
on their owne heads, or appointing to themselves
any other worship or forme of service, then that of the
Lords owne prescribing, which should find them worke
enough, and take up their minds sufficiently. 2. If we
looke on the many kinds of rites, and ordinances, and
compare them with the many ends which the Lord had
in ordaining them, we shall conclude none of them were
idle or superfluous.<note place="margin">Ends of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</note> For, 1. God would haue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christs Kingdome shadowed, and his owne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
gloriously propounded, and reverently received,
not exposed to any contempt; and therefore appoints
the erection and sanctification of a stately Tabernacle
with all the costly vessells, and holy persons garments.
2. He would traine up that people in piety, and stirre
up in their hearts an earnest sence of sinne, and hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mercy: and this hee will doe by appointing so many
kinds of sacrifices, and rites about them. 3. He would
frame them to purity and sanctimony of heart and life,
and will helpe them hereto by the many lavers, purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cleansings, and sanctifications, of which wee have
heard in part. 4. Hee would nourish naturall love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his people; and for this end appoints many feasts,
meat and drinke offerings, and many solennities to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
and rejoice before God. 5. Hee would have
them testifie their thankfulnesse for his great bounty,
and acknowledge themselves homagers as was fit. And
therefore ordaines a number of oblations, first fruits,
tithes, vowes, first-borne, and many moe institutions to
testifie their gratitude. 6. Many of Gods great works
must bee held in their eyes, and must not bee suffered to
slip out of memory. And for this purpose served many
of those institutions; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 20. when thy sonne
shall aske thee in time to come, &amp;c. For this end the
Passeover must bee yearely celebrated, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. 14. &amp; <hi>Ch.
13.</hi> 14. So also the feast of Tabernacles, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 42, 43.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18740:112"/>
7. The Lord so ordered, as the Jewes could not cast
their eyes any way within doores or without, but some
shadow or other should meet them, and preach unto
them either Christ or some grace by Christ, or some
duty unto Christ. In the fields they had first fruits, first
borne of cattell: In their houses the lintels must have the
Law written: In their bodies Circumcision was a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:
on their cloathes, fringes: If at their tables, choyce
of meats: If on their children, the first borne a type of
Christ. So for times, places, and the rest.</p>
               <p>But that wee may propound to our selves some good
order and familiar method,<note place="margin">Substantiall things pointing at Christ.</note> in which we must bound our
discourse: We must know that all the holy things in the
old Testament poynting at Christ, were 1. Substantiall.
2. Circumstantiall. Substantiall are such as concerne the
parts and substance of Gods worship Circumstantial are
such as concern some inferior things about that worship.
The former may be referred to two heads. 1. Sacraments.
2. Sacrifices.<note place="margin">Sacraments and Sacrifices.</note> The difference: In Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts we see God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us all good things in Jesus Christ: In Sacrifices we
present all our duty to God by Jesus Christ. Now for the
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of the old &amp; new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t in general,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> we must
in one word know, that they are outward signes, seales,
and confirmations of Gods word and promise of grace.
For the Lord knowing and tendring the weaknesse of
man would informe him of his good will and pleasure
two waies.<note place="margin">What Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in generall.</note> 1. He would speake to his minde and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
by his word and promise.<note place="margin">Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments goe together.</note> 2. to his outward
sences by externall signes and Sacraments, called by some
of the Fathers, visible words. He is not contented by his
word to declare his will, but also by Sacraments to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and signe that word, for our more full instruction.
If before the fall he covenanteth (by his word) life upon
condition of works, hee addeth a twofold signe to the
sences of <hi>Adam,</hi> the tree of life, and the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
If after the fall he give a promise of the blessed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18740:113"/>
seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. he enjoyneth to <hi>Adam</hi> outward sacrifices
and signes of that his word. If to antient beleevers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ he promise deliverance from sinne, death,
and hell on condition of faith in the Messiah to come,
he sealeth up this promise by two standing Sacraments:
Circumcision, and the Passeover. If to beleevers of the
new Testament he accomplish in his Sonne, all those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
promises, and now preach salvation to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in the name of Christ crucified, dead, buried, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
ascended, and sitting at the right hand of his father,
as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16, This promise he confirmeth with two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, as speciall
seales of his grace. Thus is the Lord still like himselfe in
all ages, and provideth fully for our direction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
for our strength and assurance in the Covenant
of grace and salvation.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer our purpose. The Sacraments of
the old Testament were either before the fall, or after.
Of the Sacraments in Paradise before the fall; we are not
to speake, as the tree of knowledge, and the tree of life:
Because 1. They sealed the Covenant of works, not the
Covenant of grace. 2. They concerned the first <hi>Adam</hi>
without any respect or reference to the second <hi>Adam:</hi>
There was no need of Christ, and consequently no type
of him. Wee are onely to speake of Jewish Sacraments
types of Jesus Christ, and so reject them which never
aymed at Christ, but were before any distinction of Jew
or Gentile. These Jewish Sacraments were either 1. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
or standing.<note place="margin">Sacraments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</note> 2. Extraordinary and occasionall.
<hi>Ordinary</hi> were 1. Circumcision. 2. Passeover Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was the Sacrament of entrance and receiving
the Jew into Gods covenant. The Passeover was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of continuance and growth in that Covenant.
<hi>Extraordinary,</hi> which were in some resemblance both
to them,<note place="margin">Antitypes.</note> and the two Sacraments of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
1. To Circumcision and Baptisme answered the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18740:113"/>
Sacraments of the Cloud and the red Sea. 2. To the
Passeover and the Lords Supper answered Mannah from
heaven and water out of the Rock. Of these wee must
(by Gods assistance) speak in order, not what we might,
for that were endlesse, but what we must necessarily, so
far as they preach Christ unto us, or may set us nearer
unto him.</p>

of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Promisso.</note> For these must be distinguished
from all families of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 4. Neither may we
thinke that women were excluded out of the Covenant
of grace, for they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>prehended under the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of males. And God spared the weaker sexe; because
it was enough to bring them within the number of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity, to be borne of the males circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.
Besides, as the males carry a speciall type and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18740:114"/>
of Christ, (as 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 3)</hi> in order to the
female: so was it fit they should have the thing and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of Circumcision, and the female onely the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and efficacy, Junius. 3. The part must bee the
<hi>part generative. Gen.</hi> 17. 13, My Covenant shall bee in
your <hi>flesh;</hi> and ver. 11. Circumcise the <hi>foreskin</hi> of your
flesh. The very place shewes that Circumcision aymed
to remedy the corruption and uncleannesse of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereof it admonished <hi>Abraham</hi> and his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For neither <hi>Abraham</hi> nor any of his were chosen into
the Covenant, because they were cleaner or holier then
other; but that they might be holier. Gods election is
free, who makes choyce of them that need Circumcision
as well as any other. 4. The time, the <hi>eight</hi> day:
Because 1. the Lord had a mercifull respect to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of infants, 2. not to distinguish, but that those
infants also were within the Covenant, that dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that time: 3. because whatsoever was borne of man or
beast was Legally impure, and in their blood till the
eight day, and therefore no beast must be offered to the
Lord till the eight day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 19. and ch. 34. 26. No
nor men of other nations servants or other must be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
but upon the eight day from their comming in,
4. this precise observation of the eight day was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a mystery, either poynting to the resurrection of
Christ on the eighth day, or leading beyond the weeke
of this present life (in which we cannot be perfectly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised)
unto that eight day in the life to come, when
all our corruption shall be cut away, and perfectly and
at once abolished. 5. The end of Circumcision was
to seale up Gods Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> This
Covenant had three clauses, 1. of the multiplying of his
seed in Christ: 2. of the inheritance of the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
being a type of Heaven. 3. of the blessed seed, the
Messiah that was to come of him typified in <hi>Isaac,</hi> and

II. Circumcision figures Christ:</p>
               <p>I. As it was a Jewish Sacrament,<note place="margin">Circumcision a figure of Christ</note> wherein Christ
shined out clearely; who was and is the substance of all
Sacraments both Jewish and Christian; for Christ is the
substance of the whole Covenant, and all the seales of it.
In this sence the Apostle calls it <hi>a seale of the righteousnesse
of faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> Namely 1. a seale of secrecy,<note place="margin">How a seale of righteousnesse.</note> that locked up the
Covenant onely to that people. 2. a witnessing seale
whereby (as by a visible, perpetuall, and sensible signe in
their flesh, which they could never lay off) the Lord
would still hold in their sences, his owne promise of
grace made unto them in the promised Messiah, and
their promise of obedience made backe againe unto God
to become his people. Which promise of theirs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they were to endeavour in; yet could it not be
fully performed for them, but in the promised seed, in
whom their imperfect obedience and indeavours were
to be covered and accepted. And thus is every Sacrament
a signe 1. of grace.<note place="margin">As every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</note> 2. of duty, and a religious signe
binding God to man and man to God; 3. a strengthning
and confirming seale, by which the Lord pleased to ratifie
the promise of grace, and seale up to them the inward
and invisible circumcision of the heart; called the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
of Christ, Col.</hi> 2. 11. Because he only by his spirit
can worke it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
               <p>II. Circumcision figures Christ, as it was a signe,
1. <hi>memorative</hi> of the Covenant of God made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. which mercifull Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was founded in Christ Jesus, out of whom God
never contracts Covenant with any man. He onely
slayes hatred, and makes God and man to walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as friends. 2. figurative, or <hi>representative;</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing
1. that the Messiah should bee borne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
seed,<note place="margin">Three things foreshewed.</note> and not of the uncircumcised nations, who
being to be <hi>a Minister of the Circumcision,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> was also to
receive Circumcision himselfe, which was shadowed in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18740:115"/>
all their Circumcisions. 2. in their shedding of blood by
Circumcision, was represented to their eyes the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Christs blood; not onely in the first fruits of his
bloodshed in his Circumcision (which was a part of his
humiliation, and a parcell of the price payed for our sins)
but also the full powring out of all his blood in sacrifice
upon the Crosse, wherein the Circumcision of Christ
was fully accomplished. 3. was shadowed their duty
also; that having shed the first fruits of their blood in
Circumcision in obedience to God, they should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to shed all their blood for him whom they expected
to shed all his blood for them. 3. A <hi>distinguishing</hi> signe
of the Jewes from all other people who were without
God, without Christ; and they onely a chosen seed in
that blessed seed, in whom all their prerogatives were
conferred and established.<note place="margin">Demonstrates wound &amp; cure.</note> 4. A <hi>demonstrative</hi> signe,
1. of the naturall sinne and disease of man; and therefore
it was placed in the generative part, to admonish <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his posterity of their uncleannesse; for things
cleane need no Circumcision nor ablution. <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his seed must be led out of themselves. 2. to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the cure and remedy by the Messiah to come,
cleansing our natures two waies,<note place="margin">How Christ cures us.</note> 1. by bearing upon
himselfe the imputation of our impurities; 2. by healing
them in us, partly by his merit and bloody death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
a perfect righteousnesse upon us; partly by his
Spirit daily sanctifying and circumcising our hearts: thus
hath this Sacrament preached Christ unto us.</p>
               <p>Now the observations to make it usefull.</p>
               <p>I. Take notice of our owne estate to humble us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Be humbled for naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
both in state of nature, and in state of grace.</p>
               <p>I. In our nature, wee are all sprung out of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
seed; which although we would forget, yet the Lord
in this Sacrament tooke care that his people should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon their bodies the signe of sinne and death, seazing
upon their whole nature. In place of which comes our
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18740:115"/>
Baptisme presently after our birth; shewing that a man in
his very first frame is filthily polluted, and goeth astray
even <hi>from the wombe, Psa.</hi> 58. 3. Whence also it is called,
Originall sinne. 1. because it hath beene from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world. 2. because it is the originall and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner
of all sinne in us; it is the first of all our sinnes.
3. from our beginning, even from our conception. <hi>Psa.
51.</hi> I was conceived in iniquity; and we from it called
<hi>the children of wrath,</hi> that is, laid under wrath even from
our childhood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>2. After grace received see the weakenesse of our
faith.<note place="margin">And for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull, needeth this
pledge and seale to <hi>support</hi> his weake and shaking faith.
Who can say, my faith is strong enough, which is ever
imperfect in the best, who know but in part, and beleeve
but in part? Why else did the Lord appoynt the use of
Sacraments to the strongest beleevers, and that all their
life long; but to put them in minde of the weakenesse
of their faith, which needeth such continuall props and
supports? Neither is it marvell that men are so heavy to
the reverent receiving of the Sacrament, because they see
no want, no neede, no benefit of faith; they feele not the
weakenesse of faith, which would breed desire of
strength, and drive them to the diligent use of the
meanes.</p>
               <p>II. If Christ be the truth of circumcision,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Be circumcised spiritually.</note> then every
Christian in the new Testament must be circumcised as
necessarily as the Jewes in the old. And though the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and act of circumcision bee worne out: yet the
truth of circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as neerely belongs to us now adayes,
as of old it did unto them.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 11.</note> In whom wee are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through the circumcision of Christ, speaking of the
Gentiles converted unto Christ. In which words, the
Apostle plainely distinguisheth between Jewish circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
and Christian, between legall circumcision and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical,
between <hi>Moses</hi> his circumcision and Christs.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18740:116"/>
Here 1. What this Evangelicall circumcision is 2. the
difference from Legall. 3. the marks and notes of it. 4. the
motives.</p>
               <p>This Christian Circumcision is described <hi>(Col. 2. 11.)</hi>
to bee a <hi>putting off the sinfull body of the flesh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is.</note> that is, in
plaine termes, the mortification of the body of sinnes that
are in the flesh. For the truth and kernell of Circumcision
never stood in the cutting off a peece of skinne (that
was but the shell of it) but in cutting off the lusts of the
heart and life, and parting from corruptions of nature,
which rebell against the Spirit. And this wee have in
Christ alone, being as farre beyond the Circumcision of
the old Testament, as the truth useth to excell the type:
as far as Christ is beyond <hi>Moses,</hi> or heaven above earth.
This renovation of minde was 1. signified by that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
2. promised by every Circumcised person.</p>
               <p>The difference betweene this Evangelicall and that
Legall Circumcision,<note place="margin">Difference from legall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</note> is 1. In the efficient. That was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by God to bee made with hands: but this is a
wonderfull worke without hands, done by the finger of
God himselfe. The mortification of sinne is so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a worke, as the hand of man and Angells can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it. 2. In the subject. That was wrought upon
the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh: this onely
upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed according to the faith, upon belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and members of Christ. That upon the Jew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
this upon the Jew within. That upon <hi>Ismael</hi> as well
as <hi>Isaac:</hi> here no Ismaelite is circumcised. That was
Circumcision of the naturally <hi>borne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nascentium. Renascentium.</note> and males onely, of
Jews onely: this is of the supernaturally <hi>borne againe,</hi>
male or female, Jew or Gentile, for in Christ all are one.
3. In the proper seat. That was ceremoniall in the flesh<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
this morall in the heart. In that a naturall part was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
in this the very corruption of nature. That dealt
with flesh in substance: this with the body of flesh in
quality. 4. In the end. In that every man was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18740:116"/>
in himselfe, and his blood shed to fulfill the rite of
the Law: in this all beleevers men and women are in
Christs blood once circumcised to fulfil the rigour of the
Law. 5. In the effect. By that, the person was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the society of Gods people according to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
profession: by this the sinner is received into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and eternall fellowship with God, and into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Gods people. 6. In the latitude or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
In that, the Priest circumcised in one part of the
body: in this Christ our high Priest circumciseth the
whole man. In that, one beloved part was cast away
with griefe and sorrow: in this, the whole corruption
of nature, and all beloved sinnes; with no lesse griefe
and sorrow of heart for them. 7. In the durance and
continuance.<note place="margin">Qui signum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struxit, verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem induxit.</note> That was temporary, but till the comming
of Christ; <hi>who razed the type, and raised the truth:</hi> but
this is to continue for ever, till the second comming of
Christ; and is most perfectly finished and consummate
in heaven.</p>
               <p>The notes or markes to know inward circumcision
attained by Christ,<note place="margin">Notes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</note> are these. 1. The party to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
was presented and offered to this ordinance of
God, as willing and contented to part with his flesh and
blood in obedience to God: so here thou hast begun thy
circumcision, if thou hast offered up thy soule, body, and
all, <hi>a reasonable sacrifice to God, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. willingly
mortifyng all the deeds of the flesh, and denying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all fleshly lusts and affections, which are as
neere and as deare unto thee as the parts of the body.
So <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. it must bee <hi>a putting off</hi> the sinfull body;
implying, not a suffering it onely to bee violently taken
and cut away: but a voluntary putting away, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with it. Indeed in legall Circumcision the infant
could not cut away the flesh of his body: but in Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Circumcision thy selfe must put off this sinfull
body of flesh, and be more then a meere patient. 2. As
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18740:117"/>
there the whole body was wounded in one part: so see
thy whole body of sinne bee wounded in all parts,<note place="margin">Speciall parts to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</note> not
one member spared, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. put off the sinnefull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
No sinne must raigne, none unresisted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
1. Labour for an <hi>heart</hi> circumcised. There the
Lord begins this worke, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 16.
there see thou hast begun. See thy desires be sanctified;
that the thoughts of thy heart and inward affections be
watched and garded; not suffered to be earthly, wanton,
impious, disordered, or unfruitfull. This purging of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
affections, and fastning them on the right object, is
a note of inward circumcision, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. 2. See thine
eare bee circumcised. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51. the Jews are reproved
for <hi>uncircumcised eares.</hi> All sinnes of the eare must bee
circumcised; and that is done in opening them to heare
God and good instruction, and shutting them against
slanders, false tales, wicked counsells, doctrines of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the like. 3. Circumcise thy <hi>lips;</hi> which then
are so, when they are able to speake for God. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
(in <hi>Exod. 6. 12.)</hi> complaines that his lips were not
enough circumcised. All the sinnes of the tongue must
be cut off. This circumcision admits not a lie, an oath, a
slander, a deceitfull, or filthy, or uncleane speach, unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.
4. All sinnes of the <hi>eye</hi> must be circumcised, by
making covenant with this member; not suffering the
eye to bee envious, covetous, wanton, scornfull, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
And so examine all the parts, that no sinne bee
peaceably admitted, without drawing blood upon it, as
was in circumcision.<note place="margin">True mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> 3. As in that Circumcision was
sence of much paine and griefe in the body; as we see in
the Shechemits, <hi>Gen. 34. 25:</hi> So in this (where ever it is)
is affliction of conscience, paine of spirit, <hi>pricking in the
heart;</hi> as in the Converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. which makes the
circumcised mourne, and cry out of himselfe; judging
himselfe, and breaking his heart with godly sorrow for
sinne. The Priest could not take the knife, and cut off
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18740:117"/>
the piece of flesh without paine and sorow of the child:
Neither can the Minister take the sharpe weapon of the
Law to wound and cut the body of flesh in any part,
but it will be painfull and sorowfull to the child of God;
who will judge and condemne himselfe, and dares not
stand out the threats of the Law, as many contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rebells doe. An hard and secure heart is an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
heart: good <hi>Iosiah</hi> will tremble at the word;
but all Gods words and plagues stirre not <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
4. As that part cut off was never set to the body again,
but was taken quite away for ever: So in this circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ, is not a parting with sinne onely for a
time, but a ceasing of sinne, that is, a constant endeavour
to forsake all sinnes, inward, outward, secret, open: A
parting from pleasing, profitable, deare, and bosome sins;
saying to them (as <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his idols, <hi>Hos. 14. 9.)</hi> get
yee hence; what have yee to doe here? with resolute
purpose never to give them entrance, or entertainment
more. Those that fall to their former sinnes, as who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
they ever washed (like dogs and swine) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
circumcised. The skinne once cut off died for ever:
such a dying to sinne must bee in this circumcision.
5. In that was a joyning to Gods people, and a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the party into the Church and family of God:
See if thou beest joyned to Gods people, not in outward
profession but in sincere affection; embracing them that
feare God, delighting in their society, giving them the
right hand of fellowship, and with the hand the heart;
separating from the fellowship of the uncircumcised and
profane, as the Jews medled not with the Samaritanes.
Doest thou professe circumcision and grace by Christ, but
oppose and pursue the professours of Christian religion,
as <hi>Ismael</hi> him that was borne after the promise? A plaine
signe, all thy circumcision was made with hands. Thy
body was washed with water of Baptisme: but thy
heart is unwashed, untouched with any water of saving
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18740:118"/>
grace. 6. In that was a joyning and admittance to the
outward worship of God, and externall communion in
all holy things: so here thou art become a true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
not outwardly in the letter and ceremony, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in spirit and truth: <hi>A Iew within, Rom. 2. 29.
Phil.</hi> 3. 3. We are the Circumcision, which <hi>worship God
in the spirit.</hi> Hee that worships formally, for fashion,
for Law; and in the meane time can contemne the power
of godlinesse; cannot away with inward watchfulnesse,
sincerity, strictnesse: though by Baptisme he be brought
to the externall communion of the Church in holy
things; all is but in the letter, without all circumcision of
the heart. 7. In that was much rejoycing as in a great
priviledge; and the Jew did much boast, and beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
upon this prerogative; partly upon the externall
worke; partly on their distinction by it; partly because
it manifested them sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the
flesh: and much was their praise among men: But true
circumcision rejoyceth not in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but in Christ;
hath no confidence in the flesh, but renounceth all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, and settles his rejoycing in Christ alone and
his merits; counting all other things drosse and dung in
comparison of him. Let the Jew trust in Circumcision
by the worke wrought, as our Judaizing Papists doe in
their Sacraments; Let him glory of <hi>Abraham</hi> his father,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 33. that hee is beloved because the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
Wee are chosen in Christ, not in <hi>Abraham.</hi> In
him we have atonement and become a beloved people,
and not in <hi>Abraham.</hi> In him wee come boldly to the
throne of grace, and speed in our suits: In him we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
all day long. We trust not in good meanings, as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ignorant persons; nor in merits, as wilfull blinded
Papists; nor in any thing within us, nor without
us, nor without Christ. All our joy and trust is in
himselfe alone. And this is true inward Circumcision,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:18740:118"/>
The Motives are.<note place="margin">Motives to get the spirituall Circumcision.</note> 1. All outward service and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
without this, is rejected; as preaching, hearing,
praying, fasting, weeping. All thy service and labour is
lost, if by the Spirit of God thy mind bee not renewed,
and faith and conversion wrought in thy heart. For as
the Jews (being circumcised) were challenged to bee
uncircumcised (though they had the foreskinne of the
flesh cut off, and had the circumcision made with hands)
and were so farre unworthy of <hi>Abrahams</hi>

<hi>Exod.</hi> 12. to be a lively type of Christ. 1. <hi>Cor. 5. 7.
Christ our Passeover is sacrificed for us.</hi> The name of
this Sacrament hath in it the occasion, for it was (by
God) therefore instituted in memoriall of their great
deliverance in Aegypt, when the destroying Angel (who
slew all the first borne in Aegypt in one night) passed
over all the Israelites houses, whose doores and posts
were striked with the blood of the Paschall Lamb slaine
and eaten in that house. Wherein the godly Iews were
not to fixe their eyes in that externall signe, or the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
deliverance signified; but to cast their eye of
faith vpon the Messiah and true Paschall Lamb; by means
of whom, the wrath and revenge of God passeth over
all those, whose soules are sprinkled with his blood, and
who by true faith feed upon him. And therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the word, Passeover, hath in Scripture many sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications,

it the whole institution of God concerning the Lamb
called Paschall. In which we shall see Iesus Christ most
lively pourtrayed before vs; and that this one legall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
preached (not obscurely) to the ancient Iews,
the whole doctrine of the Gospel, and grace of salvation
by the onely suffering of Iesus Christ. This will appeare
in five things. 1. In the choice of the Sacrifice. 2. In
the preparing of it. 3. In the effusion of blood, and

shadowes or figures hee was (not yearely onely, but)

conditions.</p>

                        <hi>Choice.</hi>
                     </note> It must bee a lamb without blemish,

                        </gap>, amici pariter &amp; inimici testati sunt.</note>
signifying the most absolute perfection of Jesus Christ;
who was, both in respect of his person and actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all spot and exception. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. as of a <hi>Lamb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
and without spot.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perfection of Christ.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. Such an high Priest
it became us to have, as is <hi>holy, undefiled, separate from
sinners.</hi> The reasons are two. 1. Because else his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
were insufficient. 2. He must be perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that must become a righteousnesse to many.</p>
                  <p>2. Condition.<note place="margin">His excellency</note> It must bee a male, for three reasons.
1. Reason. To note the excellency, strength, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ, proper to that sex. For although he seemed
a most weak man in the state of his humiliation; yet must
hee be, not effeminate but masculine; strong, stout, and
potent to destroy sinne and death, and to foile all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of mans salvation. Christ indeed must be the seed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18740:120"/>
of the <hi>woman;</hi> but the woman must bring forth a <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,
Rev.</hi> 12. 5. And though he must be borne of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
yet the Virgin must bring forth a <hi>sonne, Isa.</hi> 9. 6. For
he must divide the spoyle with the <hi>strong, Isa.</hi> 53. 12.
2. reason. Consider Christ in both his natures, it was fit
he should be a male as the Lambe was. 1. as he was the
Sonne of God it was meet hee should bee of the more
worthy sexe of men; for it was unfit that the Sonne of
God should be the daughter of man. 2. as being man, he
was to be the Messiah, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Son of
<hi>David;</hi> and so to be circumcised, to bee a fit Minister of
Circumcision. 3. reason. Consider him in his office. Hee
was to be a King, a Priest, and a Prophet of his Church;
all which necessarily require him to be a man, a male, as
the Lambe was. We conclude therefore hence, that being
the head of the whole Church, he must be of as worthy
sexe as any of his members.</p>
                  <p>III. Condition.<note place="margin">Christus in medio aetatis flore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molatus cuius conditionis ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vid. <hi>Iun. in Exod.</hi> 12.</note> The Lamb must be <hi>of a yeare old,
ver.</hi> 5. to signifie that Christ dyed at a full and perfect
age, in his strength; and therefore had experience also of
our infirmities. For a Lambe of a yeare old is at his state
and growth, and a Lambe of a yeare old is acquainted
with many miseries: Even so our Saviour, living to the
full strength of a man, was a man full of sorrowes, and
acquainted with infirmities. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. we have
not an high Priest which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted
like us, yet without sinne.</p>
                  <p>IV. Condition. He must be taken out of their own
flockes and folds: For so <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh, Exod. 10.
25,</hi> thou must allow us our beasts for sacrifice to offer to
the Lord. Plainly signifying, that Christ was to bee an
Israelite: and within the fold of Gods owne people; for
he was to be of the seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and salvation was
of the Jewes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 22. Yea and the Lords owne Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that the King should bee taken <hi>from among his

<hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1, My elect servant. And thus is called a lambe
seperated from before the foundation of the world,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. 2. In due time actually seperated from all
the rest of the flocke, by 1. a supernaturall conception by
the holy Ghost; whereby he became an high Priest sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from sinners, all the rest of mankinde remaining
sinners. 2. by a miraculous birth of a Virgin, being the
seed of the woman. 3. by an unconceivable union of the
two natures, divine and humane, in one person; by which
he became our <hi>Immanuell,</hi> God with us. 4. by a solemne

chiefe Doctor and Prophet of his Church. Thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
this lambe of God to be actually seperated from all
the rest of the flock: because for all the rest he was to pay
a greater ransome and price, then any other that could
be found amongst all mankinde.</p>
                  <p>II. Observation. The lambe thus seperated must

delivered by his owne mouth and Ministery to the

on the will of man, for his enemies sought many a time

time now come which was so long before appointed,
and in such a month as when light prevailes against
darkenesse, and every thing revives and springs: to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

III. Observation. The Lambe must be slaine, ver. 6:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
signifying that Jesus Christ being (as that Lambe of a

his age and strength might have lived longer) must not
onely dye,<note place="margin">Christ must die a violent death.</note> but by a violent death, and that by Israell.

into foure parts: From sixe to nine, from nine to twelve,
from twelve to three, from three to sixe: This last part
was counted the evening of the day, and the next three
houres the evening of the night: In this fourth part of
the day used the Paschall lamb to be slaine, and the rest of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18740:122"/>
and all their heaviest burthens. 3. All that sprinkling of
blood in their houses, so long as they despise the blood
of Jesus Christ, shall never get them protection from the
revenging Angel. We must pray that God would please
at length to remove their vaile from their hearts, that
they may <hi>submit themselves to the righteousnesse of God.

blood of Christ: 1. in respect of God; 2. of Christ;
3. of the Church. For, 1. God the Father highly
prizeth this blood, and saves it in a golden vessell, that it
may be ever before him; and that the streames of it may
pacifie his displeasure, and confirme the Covenant of
grace with his Church, Whence it is called <hi>the blood of
the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 9. 18 2. It was precious in regard of
Jesus Christ; seeing every drop of it was the blood
(not of an innocent man onely, but) of one that was
God as well as man, <hi>Act. 20. 28. God with his owne blood</hi>
purchased the Church; and therefore it was a blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
vertue and infinite merit. 3. Every true member
of the Church doth most highly esteeme it, as the most
precious thing in all the world; and with great care and
reverence receives it into the vessell of precious and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith, and there keepes it safely, as men doe their
most precious commodities.</p>

lintell and side posts of the doores of the Israelites, <hi>vers.
22.</hi> 1. In that it must be sprinkled,<note place="margin">Blood of Christ sprinkled, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</note> it signified that the
blood of Christ must be applied unto us; for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
stands not in the shedding of Christs blood, but
in sprinkling and application of Christs blood shed and
sprinkled upon our soules and consciences to purge
them from dead works. 2. It must be sprinkled upon
the posts and doores, so as the Israelites could neither go
out of doores nor in, but they must see on all sides the
blood of the lamb: signifying that they and wee should
both at home and abroad, going forth and comming in,
and on all occasions have the passion of Jesus Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, in the holy meditation and deep contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of it. 3. It was not enough for the Jew that the
lamb was slaine, and the blood shed within the house;
but it must be sprinkled without doores, that every man
might see it: and signifyed, that if Christ blood and the
merit of it be shed in the houses of our hearts for justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and righteousnesse, the sprinkling of it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
and bee seene without, in holy life and practise of
sanctification.</p>
                  <p>3. This blood of the lamb must not bee sprinkled

<hi>Hyssope is faith:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hyssopus fides est Augan 4. Num. 33.</note> and faith resembles this herbe in foure
things. 1. It is a <hi>ground herbe,</hi> low and weake: so
faith in it selfe,<note place="margin">Herba humilis.</note> and in us, is weake, fraile, feeble, and of

weake plant, is onely fit to receive the precious liquor of
the blood of Christ. Onely faith draws vertue from
Christ; as in the poore woman that stood behind Christ,
<hi>Marke</hi> 5. 34. And the want of this bunch of hyssope
disables Christ from doing thee any good. Christ could
doe nothing in Capernaum for their unbelief.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By undervaluing it; as Papists, who
thinke it insufficient to ratifie the Covenant unto them
without other additions and supplies from themselves
and others; yea ascribe as much to the blood of <hi>Thomas
Becket</hi> and other traytors,<note place="margin">Tu per Thomae sanguinem, quem pro te impendit, &amp;c.</note> as to this blood. 2. To
be ashamed of Christ and his sufferings. The Jewes must
strike the lintells of their doores with the blood of the
Paschall Lambe, that all might see they were Israelites:
signifying that we must openly professe Christ, and not
be ashamed of his death and ignominy, which is the life
of the world, at which, notwithstanding, the greatest
part of the world stumbleth at this day. To shame at the
profession of Christ, is to contemne his blood. 3. To
contemne it in the meanes in which the Lord would
hold it before our eyes: To reject or neglect the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, wherein Christ is <hi>crucified before our
eyes,</hi> as he was to the Galatians, chap. 3. 1. To neglect and
despise the Sacrament, in which his blood is after a sort
powred out to the mind and sences: Or unpreparedly
to receive the Sacrament, and in the unworthinesse of a
guilty conscience; is to make ones selfe <hi>guilty of the blood</hi>
of Christ; as <hi>Pilate, Iudas,</hi> and the soldiers were. 4. To
despise and wrong the godly, descended of the blood of
CHRIST: redeemed with the blood of CHRIST:
To hate the Church of God, and abuse the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ; is to crucifie againe the sonne of God, and
despise the price of our purchase.<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>In that ye do it to one of
these little ones, ye did it to me.</hi> Thou canst not draw
blood of the Saints, but thou sinnest against the blood of
Christ. 5. To prophane it in gracelesse swearing, as
those branded bell-hounds that sweare commonly
by wounds or blood, as if this precious blood were to
be engaged on every base occasion. Well, they carry
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18740:124"/>
wounds in their consciences, and powre out the life
blood of their soules.</p>

typified. To this eating many conditions are required,
concerning 1. time. 2. place. 3. persons. 4. manner.

                  <p>The time. It must be eaten at the same time; and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
one evening must all Israell eat the Passeover.<note place="margin">Time.</note> 1. In the
evening to signifie our estate of darkenesse and misery by
sinne and death, till Christ came, and when Christ came
to be our ransome. 2. In one and the same evening,
to note the holy agreement and consent of the whole
Church in the faith of Christs death and passion; to
which well agrees the constitution of our Church, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the supper succeeding it in the same time, so all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and formality be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The place. 1. Every particular Lambe must be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in one house:<note place="margin">Place.</note> to signifie the unity of the Church of
God, the house of the living God, and the spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
and agreement of all the faithfull in <hi>one bread</hi>
and <hi>one body, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 17. 2. If one house sufficed
not to eate up one Lambe, they might call in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to a competent number; which might bee about
a dozen, as in our Saviours family: to signifie 1. that the
Gentiles in time, by the voice of the Gospell, should be
called in, to the participation of Christ the lambe of God,
and to the fruition and feeding of the same lambe with
the Israelites. 2. no number is assigned, because the
Lord onely knowes who are his. 3. because there
were many lambes to bee slaine, they must be eaten in
many houses; so as no man must abstaine from the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in paine of death: signifying the speciall application
of the same Christ to severall persons, families, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18740:125"/>
the Church is no salvation. 3. In the night of errors,
heresies, afflictions, and persecutions for the truth (when
God revengeth the worlds contempt of his grace) if we
would bee safe wee must keepe our selves within the
Church, not departing from the particular house or
Church in which we are, to joyne to Idolatry or errors,
least Gods revenge overtake us, as the waters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
all that were without the Arke.</p>

                  <p>1. They must eate it with <hi>unleavened bread:</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
that if we would feed on Christ our Passeover,
wee must purge out all <hi>old leaven,</hi> and become a <hi>new
lumpe, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 7. This old leaven is the fusty, swelling,
and spreading corruption of our owne wicked nature,
the leaven of sinne, false doctrine, heresie, corruption of
manners, sowre and tart affections, that will not stand
with the receiving of Christ and his benefits. All this
we must purge out, and study for sincerity and truth in
judgement, in affection, in action.</p>
                  <p>2. They must eate the Passeover with <hi>sower herbs,</hi>
as sawce: signifying, 1. true repentance and godly sorrow
of heart to bee inseperable with the true apprehender of
Jesus Christ: 2. that Christ and his Crosse are insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and that afflictions (as sowre herbs) are the most
whole some sawce of Christianity: Sowre indeed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to the flesh, but profitable 1. to prepare and
provoke the appetite with more cheerefulnesse and
ardency to all godly duties of prayer, hearing, Sacraments,
mercy, patience, hope, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 2. to whet and
provoke to the practise of all Christian duties of mercy
and love. 3. to excite the desire to bee fully fed with
that sweet tree of life, and that blessed Mannah (in
which is no sowrenesse) in the kingdome of glory,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>3. They must alwaies in eating <hi>repeate and conferre</hi>

of their deliverance out of Aegypt, and in memory of
that benefit provoke their thankfulnesse of God, ver. 26.
27. adding as it were to the Sacrament a word of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
signifying 1. that we should alwaies remember the
death and passion of Christ with due thankefullnesse for
so great a deliverance by it: if they must still speake of
their temporall deliverance: much more we of so great
and eternall deliverance by it, from the spirituall servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sinne, death, the divell, and damnation: 2. it sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
herein its successor in the new Testament, for
the Sacrament of the Supper was therefore instituted to
keepe in remembrance the death of <hi>Iesus Christ. 1 Cor.

cup, ye shew the Lords death till he come. 3. to be a rule
for all Sacraments,<note place="margin">Vt accedat verbii ad elementum.</note> wherein it is necessary, <hi>that the word
be ioyned to the Element:</hi> I meane the word of Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and (if it may be conveniently) of exhortation, that
the seale may goe with the Charter, as (even in these
shadowes) the Lord himselfe straitly enjoyned: these
were the Lawes prescribed for the Anniversary Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
both in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 14, and <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. in neither of
which is any mention of any of the former Lawes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the first Passeover.</p>
                  <p>The last condition in eating concerned the measure.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
The Lambe must be <hi>whole eaten:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Measure of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it.</note> signifying 1. Our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
communion with Christ, who are as neerely united
unto Christ, as the meat we eate, which is turned into
our owne substance. 2. That nothing in Christ is unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
3. That Christ must be received wholly without
dividing of his natures, or destroying any of his offices.
<hi>Arrius</hi> divides the Lambe in denying his Godhead.
<hi>Manichoes,</hi> impugned his humanity. Neither eate the
whole lamb. The Papists destroy all his Offices. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deny any fundamentall Article of Religion, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the lamb. To eate the whole lamb, is to beleeve
whole Christ;<note place="margin">Fides est una Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulativa.</note> according to the rule, <hi>Faith</hi> is but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

yet a copulative: Deny one, overthrow all. Hitherto
served that Iniunction, that no part of the lamb must bee
reserved till the morrow; but if any remained it must
bee burnt with fire, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. The Lord in his infinite
wisedome would prevent all the occasions of idolatry,
which is easily admitted in the reservations of holy
things: As in Popery, what a deale of idolatry is crept
into the Church by reserving superstitious relicks, and
especially their consecrated or conjured bread; as if this
condition did not condemne expresly that Popish reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the hoast or breaden god? Add hereunto, that
the Jewes requiring the body of Christ on the Crosse to
be taken away that night before the Sabbath, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 31.

the house of our hearts with the blood of the Lamb,
<hi>Heb. 10. 22. sprinkled in our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Whosoever

Was there so much power in the blood of the type; and

Passeover: so must hee be baptized that must be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Supper; that is a reverent professed Christian.
For holy things must <hi>not bee cast to dogs, Matt.</hi> 7. 6. The
word and Sacraments are childrens bread, and must not
be cast to dogs, that is, obstinate enemies, scorners, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
to men of uncircumcised lips and eares, who
wilfully repell the meanes of their cleansing. So much
the more pity is it that all sorts of notorious evill men
thrust into the presence chamber of the great King, yea
sit downe at the Lords Table, and like swine swill in
his cup without controll, or any rebuke in many places:
Open blasphemers, common-drunkards, scoffing Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
noted adulterers, obstinate sinners: And where is
the care to preserve the holy things of God from pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
contempt, and profanation? Would a man spread
a table for dogs or swine? If the shadows of these holy
things might not bee cast to doggs: is it nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to them the body and substance it selfe? 1. <hi>Cor. 11.

and many sleepe.</p>
                  <p>2. As the Lamb was taken in the <hi>tenth</hi> day, but was
not slaine till <hi>the fourteenth,</hi> that it might be before their
eyes all the foure dayes before, for the helping of their
meditation, and due preparation to the eating of it: So
no man must come to the Supper without due preparing
himselfe. For if so long preparation was by God thought
fit for the shadow: what preparation can be thought fit
and sufficient for the substance, 1. <hi>Chron. 35. 6?</hi> It was the
counsell of <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at a great mans table, consider diligently what is set before

                     </hi> Much more here at the great Gods Table, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
of the Author, matter, maner, end, fruit, and
use can be sufficient. What a fearefull thing is it to come
as most men doe, not considering the Lords body? How
miserable was the sentence of that guest, that sate down
at the Kings table without his <hi>wedding garment?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 22. 13.</note> Our
common preparation is, to put on our best clothes, and
to cover our bodily nakednesse in most curious manner:
In the meane time the Lord seeth, and mens owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
witnesse against them, how naked their soules
lie, and filthily discovered. The due preparation to this
ordinance would be attended with more comfort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and more reformation without, then wee can espie
in most communicants.</p>
                  <p>3. As the Paschall lamb must never bee eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sower herbes: so we must never come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without true humiliation and sorrow for sinne.
There can bee no sweetnesse in the blood of Christ, till
the heart bee full of bitternesse for sinne. For as sower
sawces whet the stomacke, and provoke the appetite:
so true sorrow for sinne, stirreth up our desire and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
after Jesus Christ, and prepares us to all good duties,
and holds us in a fitnesse to pray, to heare the word<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to
the Sacrament, to works of mercy, &amp;c. What a sweet
sowernesse and bitternesse is that which brings such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
sweetnesse and refreshing after it? Any man of
reason would make hard shift to drinke downe a bitter
potion to helpe his bodily health: and much more a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man will be contented to digest godly sorrow for the
procuring of heavenly joy, and the sweet comforts of
Gods salvation.</p>
                  <p>4. As the Jew might not eate the lamb, till he had <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
all leaven</hi> out of his house: So we must not come to
the Sacrament without the forsaking of our sinne. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can a man expect any comfort by Christs Sacrifice
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18740:128"/>
that hideth the old leaven in the corners of his heart.
Whence the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. exhorteth the Saints, to
<hi>purge out the old leaven; because Christ our Passeover is
sacrificed for us.</hi> Here is to bee considered, 1. What
this leaven is, 2. What is the purging of it. 1. This
leaven is not onely the leaven of corrupt doctrin, which
suddenly sowreth the truth and lumpe of the Gospel, as
leaven doth a lump of dowe: but also the leaven of sin,
both in the corruption of nature; (which is the old lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in our selves, and hath sowred all the lump of whole
mankind, and every man, and every faculty of man) as
also in corrupt and vicious conversation, which sowreth
and leaveneth others with himselfe in societies. 2. The
purging of this leaven is, 1. In correcting and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sinne past; when a constant care is nourished to find
it out, and to cast it out: 2. In serious conversion and
turning to God; both which are expressed in <hi>Ps.</hi> 34. 14.</p>

                  <p>

of his house: So begin thou to purge the inside first,
<hi>Ier. 4. 4. Wash thy heart, O Ierusalem.</hi> An hypocrite can
wash his face, but a sound Christian looks to his heart.

the time of the Sacrament; but the heart is stuffed with

can bee busie to purge other mens houses; but the Jew
must purge his owne house.</p>
                  <p>II. The Jew purged out all leaven, and spared none
not a morsell or a crumme: And shall not a Christian
count every sinne a pollution, and hatefull to God?
Shall any say, Is it not a little one? I may sweare a little; be
drunke, if sildome: I may not kill; but raile and revile,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18740:128"/>
and speake my mind: I may not be an adulterer, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

I may not goe to plough on the Sabbath; but may buy
and sell, ride abroad, or be idle at home. Why? Is not a
little serpent, a serpent; or a little poison, poison? Is not
a little leaven enough to sower a whole lump?</p>
                  <p>III. The Jew carefully and narrowly searched and
swept every corner and cranny of his house, that not
the least crumme might escape him: And shall not we
as carefully throw out this leaven out of every power of
the soule, and every part and member of our bodies?

                  <p>IV. A Jew must begin his purging seven dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and hold on all the feast on paine of death: How
much more should wee beginne to purge our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and hold on so long as our Passeover lasts? And
because our Passeover is not <hi>annuall,</hi> as that was, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall;
wee must continue our cleansing and separating
from this leaven which is not easily washed out. Thou
haste but trifled in this businesse that hangest downe thy
head for a day, and art penitent for the time of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18740:129"/>
unlesse thou continuest to reforme and renew thy
heart and life, and conscionably avoidest all leaven of sin
all thy life; which is, or ought to be a continuall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Passeover.</p>
                  <p>V. As the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ews must eate the Passeover with their
loines girt, with staves in their hands, eating in haste as
tending to their Countrey: So we must never come to
the Sacrament, but with holy hearts and meditations:
1. Seriously considering what strangers and pilgrims we
are here below; not having any <hi>continuing City</hi> here,
but are <hi>seeking a Countrey, Heb. 13. 14</hi> Hee that is a true
eater of our Paschall Lamb, must not pitch downe his
staffe here; but as Christian Rechabites, <hi>Ier.</hi> 35. esteeme
themselves strangers, content themselves to <hi>dwell in tents</hi>
ever ready to remove; not distracting themselves in
building houses, or planting vineyards, or seeking great
things for themselves. Hence was that commendable
admonition of the ancient Church, in the time of the
Sacrament,<note place="margin">Sursum cord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> used in our Liturgie: <hi>Lift up your hearts:</hi>
2. Wee must eate the Lamb hastily, hastning unto
Christ the true Passeover; and not insist in these Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ours, which are still but as shadows of good
things to come; yet serving us through this our strange
Countrey, and speeding us into our owne Canaan and
countrey, and that with all expedition; seeing that to be
dissolved hence, and to <hi>be with Christ, is best of all, Phil.
2. 23:</hi> 3. We must celebrate our Passeover with staves
in our hands, that is, the doctrine of the Law and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
held in our hearts, as a staffe to defend our selves in
the right track and path of holy doctrine, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
to repulse our adversaries that come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, for it is the sword o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> the Spirit; and to leane
upon, as a staffe, in our weaknesse and wearinesse. This
staffe must not lie by us in our books; but be held in our
hands and hearts, and bee (not in our possession onely,
but) in our daily use. Hee hath no comfort of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18740:129"/>
that hath not this staffe in his hand.</p>
                  <p>VI. As the Jewes in eating the Passeover must
repeate and recite the memory of that great deliverance
out of Aegypt by a mighty and miraculous power: so
must we in our Sacrament commemorate and remember
our great deliverance from hell, and that spirituall <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
wrought by the blood of our Paschall lambe. 1 <hi>Cor.
11.</hi> 26, so often as ye shall eate this bread and drinke this
cup, yee <hi>shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> And therefore
it is very fit the word and Sacrament should goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the seale together with the deed and Indenture.
Hence those, that are so devoute at the Sacrament and
neglect or despise the Word, are meere hypocrites and
ignorants; their folly is like his that makes much of a
seale, but teares the Indenture all to peeces, which onely
can convey his inheritance unto him.</p>
                  <p>VII. As the Jewes came together to eate the
whole Lambe:<note place="margin">Whole Christ must be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> so must wee to receive whole Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> When do we receive whole Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First when we reverently receive the signes
appointed by Christ according to his owne institution.
Secondly when we receive faithfully the thing signified,
which is Christ and all his merits.</p>
                  <p>I. For the former,<note place="margin">Notes. 1 Popish abuses taxed.</note> 1. as it had beene a great sin for
the Jewes to divide the Lambe which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be eaten whole: no lesse grievous a sinne is it in
Popery to administer the bread without the cup; of
which Christ hath said expressely, <hi>Drinke ye all of this.</hi>
2. as the Lambe was appointed to no other use by <hi>Moses</hi>
but to be eaten: so was the bread and wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ordained to no other end by Christ but to be eate
and drank: all other holy use of them out of the action of
the Sacrament is Idolatrous, superstitious, and unlawfull.
3. as it had beene a grievous sinne to reserve any of the
lambe till the morning, against so expresse a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
appointing it to be wholly eaten: so grievous a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18740:130"/>
sinne is it to reserve the consecrated host (as they foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
call it) either to boxe up, or to hang up, or to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and adore it, or pray unto it, or carry it in processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or lift it up with both hands above the Priests head,
that it may be worshipped with divine and Idolatrous
worship; or yet (if it be possible) with more blasphemy
to offer it upon an Altar, as an unbloody sacrifice for the
sinnes of the quicke and dead, which abolisheth (at once)
the whole Priesthood of Christ. All which the Lord
would prevent in this constitution, that no part of the
lambe must be reserved, but if any were left it must be
burnt with fire.</p>
                  <p>II. Wee eate the whole lambe, when with the
signes we receive the thing signified, which is Christ and
all his merits. Wee must feede upon and digest whole
Christ; that is, bee united so straitly and undividedly to
Iesus Christ, as the meat which is changed into the
same substance with our bodies; and this by the faith of
our hearts, which so straitly knits us to Christ as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
bonde; and he becomes a perfect nourishment to
us unto eternall life. Neither could our Lord fitlier ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
this strait union, then by feeding and eating; seeing
there cannot be a straiter union in nature, then betweene
the thing nourishing and nourished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What may I doe thus to receive the whole
lambe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Come hungry in sence of the want of
faith,<note place="margin">And how we may receive whole Christ.</note> and desire of supply. 2. Labour to feele the
sweetnesse of Christ; take heed of despising this sweet
Mannah. Let not the hunger of the Onyons, garlick, and
flesh pots of Aegypt thrust downe the desire of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah
which comes downe from heaven; to which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mannah was not halfe so sweet. 3. Thinke it
not enough to eate the flesh of Christ Sacramentally, if
not spiritually. Conceive what a fearefull delusion it is
to eate the Sacrament of the flesh of Christ in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18740:130"/>
and not eate the flesh of Christ by the Sacrament:
Thou hast beene at the Supper of the Lord, but hast not
tasted of his Supper.</p>

The ground of this distinction we have in, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 2, 3:</hi>
where the Apostle leads us by the hand to the distinct
consideration of these Sacraments. First of the Pillar of
Cloud and fire, under which the Fathers of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were baptised. When the Lord in his wise provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
appointed to lead the children of Israel (for the
space of forty yeares) through a dry, uncouth, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Was there any difference between this and
other Clouds?<note place="margin">How it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from other clouds.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes in five things, 1. the matter, 2. the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
3. the motion, 4. the properties, 5. the durance.
1. The matter of it was not of vapours as other clouds,
nor apt to engender raine, but framed by the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
and above the ordinary course of nature. 2. The
fashion: It kept still the figure of a Pillar, whereas other
clouds continually alter the shape and figure every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
3. The motion: other clouds are mooved by
the winde: this mooved it selfe, yea though the windes
mooved most strongly, it stood still. Besides that the
motion of it was certaine, and imitable so as they might
follow it, but so was it never in any other cloud. 4. It
had contrary properties, of light and of darkenesse,
being a Pillar of cloud and fire. 5. In durance. For one
cloud to continue firme and stable for forty yeares long
must needs bee miraculous, whereas nothing is sooner
dispersed then ordinary clouds by winde and weather.
In all which regards it is called the <hi>Cloud</hi> of the Lord,<note place="margin">Nubes Iehovae.</note>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 14. Not that all clouds are not his, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this was so after a speciall and extraordinary
manner.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Quest.</hi> What was the use of this cloudy Pillar?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Threefold,<note place="margin">What was the use of it.</note> the first in respect of God, the
second in respect of the Israelites, the third in respect of
their enemies,<note place="margin">Numb. 14. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 14.</p>
               <p>I. In respect of God; It was a signe and symbole
of the presence of God and Christ. For God often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to manifest his presence by the clouds: As when he
sets his bowe in the cloud, a signe of his favour: God in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18740:131"/>
a cloud appeared to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 19. 9. God appeared
in the cloud upon the Oracle, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 2. So Christ in the
Mount was transfigured in a bright cloud: In his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he was taken out of their sight in a cloud: And in
his comming againe to judgement, hee shall appeare in
the Clouds to judge the quick and dead.</p>
               <p>2. In respect of the Israelites, 1. to shew and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them the way as a faithfull and constant guide
through the wildernesse, for when it mooved they must
moove, when it stood they must stand. <hi>Psa.</hi> 78. 14, in the
day he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a
light of fire: which seemes the chiefe use of it, <hi>Exod. 13.
21.</hi> 2. to shine and lighten them in the way, so as they
might goe by night as well as by day, so in <hi>Psa.</hi> 78. 14.
he led them all night long with a light of fire, noted also,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21, 3. to coole and comfort them (as a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow)
from the parching heat of the Sunne: <hi>Psa.</hi> 105. 39,
He spread the cloud as a covering or canopy over them.
To which the Prophet <hi>(Isa. 4. 5.)</hi> alluding, cals it a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
cloud, which shadow was no small comfort in that
hot countrey, in that dry and parched desert, they still
lying and living abroad in it. 4. as a shield to defend
them against their enemies, for the cloud came betweene
the host of Israel and the host of the Aegyptians to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
betweene them. And therefore it is called <hi>(Numb.
9.</hi> 19. the watch of the Lord, actively, watching over
their safety; passively, which they carefully watched and
attended.</p>
               <p>3. In respect of enemies: It was darkenesse to
the Aegyptians, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 20. For the Lord used two of
his creatures against the Aegyptians especially; water, and
the cloud, as meanes of execution of his justice upon his
enemies: As the clouds and fire shalbe serviceable for the
execution of his last and generall judgement at Christs
second appearing.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherein was this cloudy pillar a type of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Christ?<note place="margin">How it was a type of Christ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:18740:132"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In five respects; 1. as a Pillar, 2. of cloud, 3. of
fire, 4. of cloud and fire, 5. in the use of it.</p>
               <p>I. As a Pillar it signified Christ; who as a Pillar is
firme, stable, straight, strong, and as a Pillar able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Church, and to beare up all the living stones layd
on this foundation.</p>
               <p>II. As a Pillar of cloud, 1. as the cloud naturally
engendreth fruitfull raines and showers: so Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
by the influence and raine of grace, makes the field
of the Church fresh, fruitfull, flourishing; 2. as the cloud
mitigates the heat of the Sunne: so Jesus Christ quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
and allayeth the parching heat of his Fathers
wrath, and is the covering of his Church in this dry and
parched wildernes; So as when the soule of a man is dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and fainteth within him through heat of his sinne,
then hee refresheth it with the sweet and comfortable
doctrine of the Gospell (as with a sweet raine) the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
conscience. He it is, that speaketh a word to the
weary in due season. 3. as the cloud covered Israel from
the Aegyptians fury: so Jesus Christ defends his Church,
1. from the fiery darts and assaults of Satans temptations;
2. from the furious rage of our owne lusts, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of sinne: 3. shelters it from the heat of the Sun
of persecution, and from all bodily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>oes that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe what they will, but what he permits.</p>
               <p>III. Christ was signified by the fiery part of the
Pillar. For 1. as fire hath a quickning heat in it: so hath
Jesus Christ; who is the life of the world; but especially
of his Church and elect: 2. as fire hath light: so Christ is
the true light of the world; whom whosoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
he needs no other light nor knowledg to salvation,
no more then Israel needed any light in the night but
this. All Gods people walke by this fiery Pillar and by
no other, 3. as fire purgeth and purifieth metals from
drosse: so doth Iesus Christ purge his people from all
their sinnes; partly by the fire of his spirit within,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18740:132"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. and perfectly by his blood which cleanseth
from all sinne. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>IV. As a pillar both of fire and cloud, it signified
Christ in his 1. person. 2. actions. 1. In his person:
Being a Pillar both of fire and cloud, it was both light
and darknesse; signifying Christ Jesus, God and man; both
shining in the brightnesse of the glory of his deity, and at
the same time clouded, veiled, darkned, and obscured in
a base and despicable humanity: in which to the blinde
world, was no forme nor beauty, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 2. And as both
fire and cloud make but one pillar, so God and man, one
Christ. 2. In his actions. For 1. As the Pillar of
fire and cloud, Christ both enlightens the Israel of God
to salvation, and is darknes, at the same time, to all Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
that is, a stumbling block and stone of offence to
unbeleevers. 2. As the same pillar, Christ both open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the way of the red sea to beleevers, giving the grace
of Baptisme through the red sea of his blood: as also just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shutteth obstinate sinners from grace and favour; the
meanes of which (being offered unto them) they wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tread under foot, turning all the grace of Christ to
their deeper damnation. 3. As the same Pillar of cloud
and fire, Christ is the guide of all the Israel of God;
whom wee must follow in all our journey through our
wildernesse, both in the rules of his holy doctrine, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of his blessed example. Therefore himselfe saith <hi>(Mat.
11. 29.)</hi> follow me: as they were to follow that cloud;
for that was but a Type of this, leading us to our Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
4. as that same Pillar of cloud and fire, Jesus Christ
protecteth his Church from all enemies: Hee steps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Camps of IsraÃ«lites and Aegyptians, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
their sure defence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 1. 2. This Pillar shall
never rest till the dead bodies of the Aegyptians and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
become a spoile and spectacle to his people.</p>
               <p>V. In the infallible instruction of it, it typifyed Christ.
For as the Lord spake to <hi>Moses</hi> out of the cloudy Pillar,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18740:133"/>
when it descended on the Tabernacle, and delivered his
Oracles in it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 9. so Jesus Christ alone is the
cloudy Pillar by whom the Lord delivers to us his whole
counsell concerning our happy passage through this our
wildernesse to that blessed Canaan, the happy rest of all
the Saints. And as they must heare and obey absolutely
those Oracles,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 5.</note> so we are commanded to <hi>heare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Application followes.</p>
               <p>I. Is Christ the Pillar?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Comfort by Christ as our guide.</note> Here is comfort for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God; who shall want no good things, but this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of cloud and fire shall supply it. For,</p>
               <p>1. The Cloud was a <hi>generall</hi> guide for all and every
particular of Gods people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 5. 6. The cloud was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where seene: and Christ is every where present to be
seen &amp; found in his Church. Wheresoever two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I <hi>in the
midst of them, Mat. 18. 20. Ier. 51. 5. Israel hath beene no
widow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The Cloud was an <hi>unerring</hi> guide; because the
Lord went in the Cloud: so that (except the Lord could
mislead them) they must needs goe aright. Jesus Christ
is the way as well as the truth; follow him in the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his word, in the motions of his spirit, agreeing
thereto: in his blessed example both in doing and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
walke as he did: And as he passed by his Crosse to
the Crown, so shall he lead thee through this wildernesse
to that Canaan and rest, to which he hath gone before to
take thee in.</p>
               <p>III. As the Cloud was a <hi>safe</hi> guide and a <hi>covering</hi>
cloud, so is Jesus Christ the vayl and cover of his Church.
When the Pharaoh of hell pursues us at heels, and is even
ready to snatch us back into eternall slavery; now this
Angell of the Covenant interposeth himselfe to defend
us, and steppeth betweene us and dangers. This Cloud of
Gods protection (seeme it never so farre off) is the sure
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18740:133"/>
wall and defence of the Church, the strongest munition,
and will not suffer the Aegyptian armyes to come neere
the Israelites to hurt or destroy them, but onely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
them, and drive them more hastily to God for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to Canaan for rest. This is a sure comfort, when
we know that all the enemies of grace, Papists, apostates,
recusants, drunkards, scorners and Atheists reach at us to
hurt and hinder us in our way, this cloud shall make them
further us.</p>
               <p>IV. The Cloud was a <hi>powerfull</hi> guide, strengthning
Israel, weakning and discomforting all the power of
Egypt; powerfully and miraculously opening the red sea
for a passage to the one, and shutting it for the others
perdition. Our Lord JESUS is a potent guide, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
and Captaine of Gods Armies, getting himselfe a
name upon Pharaoh and his forces, discomfiting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
all adversary power of our salvation, perfectly
conquering for us all the powers of darknesse, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
upon all the externall enemies that pursue his
people, and making them the dust of his footstoole. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, this cloud powerfully opens the red sea, and
makes a way for the Saints through a sea of afflictions.
Oh the sweet comfort hence, both in the view of the
trouble of the Church in generall, beset with so many
huge armies of Antichrist and his adherents; as also in
sence of our owne particular tryalls! Both whole and
parts are under this powerfull cloud.</p>
               <p>V. The Cloud was a <hi>comfortable</hi> guide, a cooling co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
Cloud: Jesus Christ is the well, yea and sea of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation:
without whom is nothing but scorching heat,
which would burne up and consume the Church. But he
cooles the fire of his Fathers wrath for us, he cooles the
fiery darts of Satans temptations, and quencheth them in
us; he refresheth and cheereth us in the sunne of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and afflictions which satan and his instruments kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
against us; he is our onely shadow for the heat, and a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18740:134"/>
cover for the storme, and for the raine, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 6. Now
therefore get to him by prayer, faith, and repentance.</p>
               <p>VI. The Cloud was <hi>a patient and respective</hi> guide.
It waited all their necessities, it rested that they might
rest, it moved slowly according to their pace, it stayed
for them till they had ground their Mannah, and baked
it; till they had eaten and refreshed themselves; till they
had offered sacrifices, and whatsoever was necessary to
be done, it waited for them. Oh what a patient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Lord have we, who not onely waits on our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
but beares all our needs and weaknesses on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
not onely beares with our infirmities, but beares
them on himselfe and helpes them in us! He stretcheth
his hands all day long, waiting for our return: He knows
our mould and weaknesse, and covers it with his owne
strength and righteousnesse: He would be in all things
like us, that he might in all things helpe us.</p>
               <p>VII. The Cloud was a constant guide. The Lord never
took away his Pillar by day, nor by night from before the
people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 22. not all their journey till they came
into Canaan. Jesus Christ is constant to his Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leaves it without light and direction, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and consolation, without safety and protection. Nay
he not only leads and covers them in this wildernesse,
but never fayles them, no not in the land of their rest.
That cloud which now is like the cloud which <hi>Elias</hi> saw,
like the bignesse of an hand, then shall cover, or rather fill
the whole heavens.</p>
               <p>II. Here is a ground of confidence and security in the
greatest perils.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Confidence and security by Christ.</note> What a marveilous thing is it that a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of fire should sit upon the Tabernacle, and not burne
it? What a strange thing that a Pillar of fire must coole
the IsraÃ«lites, and save them from fire? So shall all fires
kindled, and all extreame dangers threatned against the
Church, tend to the saving and comforting of it. For
1. God never kindles a fire to consume his Church, but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18740:134"/>
(as the pillar of fire) to enlighten it, and direct it to Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
2. The Church is that bush which <hi>burnes</hi> with
fire, but is <hi>not consumed; Exod.</hi> 3. 2. The members of this
Church are not chaffe and stubble, but pure metall, the
longer in the fire the better tryed, and the purer. 3.
There is no Pillar of fire in the Church without the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of cloud: God mingleth his corrections with conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
and in judgement remembreth mercy. 4. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
must runne out of her selfe to doe homage to her
Creator. Fire must cease to burn at his word, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 27.
The fire burnt only the bonds of the three children, but
not their bodies: it not onely saves their lives, but
sets them at liberty, being cast in bound. 5. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God makes all the creatures serviceable to his
Church; the love of God to his Church makes them
comfortable, and the presence of God with his Church
makes them profitable: as the presence of the Angell in
the bush: the presence of a <hi>fourth (like the Sonne of God)</hi>
in the furnace, <hi>Dan</hi> 3. and the Pillar of fire was a signe of
the presence of God in it, who made a pillar of dreadfull
and unmercifull fire a great mercy to his people, yea and
most beneficiall. 6. The wisedome of God can put
understanding into these senselesse creatures to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
betweene an Israelite and an Aegyptian. The fire
shall give light to the IsraÃ«lites, and deny it to the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.
The sea shall give way to Israel, but shut up the
way to Aegypt. The cloud shall hide, cover, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the Israelites, but deny it to the Aegyptians. The fire
shall come out and destroy the Captaines and their fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and send them to hell, but a Chariot of fire shal hoyse
<hi>Eliah</hi> to heaven. Make use of this observation for the
present; in the greatest dangers remembring that gracious
promise <hi>Isa. 43. 2. When thou passest through the fire I will
be with thee,</hi> and it shall not burne thee, no more then the
Pillar did the Israelites Doe the enemies come out against
us as strong as Pillars, as furious and fiery as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ire it selfe?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18740:135"/>
Never was there so hot a Pillar of fire, but there was a
cooling and covering cloud as neere us. The Cloud that
makes the Red sea give way, can conquer Canaanits too,
and all the furious enemies that come out against us.
Were it not for this Cloud of Gods gracious protection,
there were no standing against the heat and rage of such
fiery enemies. Lay up this meditation for time to come:
Time shall bee when our Lord Jesus shall <hi>appeare in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire, 2. Thess. 1: Heb. 10. 7. hee comes with a violent
fire: Psal. 50. 3. a fire shall devour before him.</hi> This shall
burne up the studs of heaven and earth; and now how
shall any man bee able to stand before these great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?
Now know, 1. That that dreadfull fire shall
attend Christ the head as a servant, for the finall salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his members. 2. It shall bee commanded to bee
comfortable to the elect; as most dreadfull to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
driving them to their wits end; even as this Pillar
of fire was: And as the waters of the deluge, which
(while they drowned the world of the ungodly) lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up the Arke, and saved that from drowning.</p>
               <p>III. Who they bee that may expect to partake of
all these comforts from this Pillar.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Notes of them that receive comfort by this Pillar.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Cloud is not the same to all: But the
same cloud that lightned Israel, cast darknesse on the
Aegyptians; so Christ is not the same to all, not sweet,
not comfortable to all: But to such as are,</p>
               <p>1. Of mount <hi>Sion, Isai.</hi> 4. 5. true members of the
Church, sonnes of the Church, known by cleaving to the
Assemblies. <hi>Vpon Sion</hi> and the Assemblies thereof shall
be a cloud. In <hi>Sion</hi> shall be deliverance. And as the hills
compasse Jerusalem, so doth the Lords protection his
people.</p>
               <p>2. Such as be in the Lords wayes, gotten out of the
Aegypt of their darknesse and earthlinesse, and moving
still towards Canaan; for so did the Israelites: So <hi>Psal.
91.</hi> 11. they <hi>shall keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> All the while
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18740:135"/>
Israel was in Aegypt they had no Pillar of cloud and Fire,
and when they came into Canaan they had none, nor
needed any; but while they were walking in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
in unknowen wayes, in danger of enemies: We
are without protection while wee are in the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not called out of our Aegypt; and when wee shall
come into our Canaan we shall need none, because wee
shall be set quite beyond danger and enemies: But now
in our moving towards heaven, in so many dangerous
wayes, among so many mortall enemies, wee need the
Cloud, and the Lord supplies our need.</p>
               <p>3. Such as lift up their eyes to this Cloud and Pillar
for direction. Had Israel refused to move according to
the motion of it, it would not have sheltred and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
but revenged them: Such onely shall obtaine
the mercy of God in Christ, who obediently follow
Christ, and submit themselves to his direction. If thou
waitest upon him for <hi>duty,</hi> thou mayest waite upon him
for <hi>mercy;</hi> for such onely shall attaine it, <hi>Gal 6. 16. Psal.
121. 1. I will lift mine eyes up</hi> to the mountaines; and
then, <hi>verse</hi> 6. the <hi>Sunne shall not smite th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e by day, nor the
Moone by night:</hi> alluding to this place, in which the
cloud abates the heat of the Sunne by day, and the fire
the coldnesse of the Moone by night.</p>
               <p>4. Such as persevere and goe on forward in grace.
For therefore was the Pillar light in the night to Israel,
that they might goe forward day and night: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it a darke cloud to the Aegyptians, that they
might not hinder the Israelites in their way. Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and protection belongs to such as desire to prosper
and profit in grace, and get every day neerer their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But this seemes to be the way to lose all peace
and joy of our lives,<note place="margin">And how this comfort is to be esteemed.</note> seeing none are more assailed by
Satan and wicked men, then godly men, sonnes of the
Church that walke in Gods wayes, that take Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18740:136"/>
and desire to proceed and persever in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
how then are all these promises accomplished?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All promises of temporall good things
are made with exception of the crosse: this exception
impeacheth not the promise. 2. It is a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of good and bad to sustaine many evils, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
many difficulties; but with this difference, that
the wicked have no Pillar to sustaine them, no cloud, no
refuge or hiding place: but the godly hath God for his
refuge, his Pillar, and Cloud. 3. The Pillar still stands
over the Tabernacle, and saves the Armie of Israel:
the whole Church is ever saved by Gods protection,
though some souldiers may fall in the battell; as Martyrs,
who receive not alwaies corporall deliverance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a better resurrection, 4. If this Pillar put not off
some evills, it ever supplies some greater good: If it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
not from death, it delivers by death: If our state
seeme not so good, it will turne it <hi>to good, Rom.</hi> 8. It led
the Israelites to <hi>Marah,</hi> a place of <hi>bitternesse;</hi> but the
next remove was to <hi>Elim,</hi> where were <hi>twelve fountaines
of water, Exod.</hi> 15. 23, 27. It suffers the Israelites to want
meat in the wildernesse, but to feed them with Manna:
If to want drinke, it is to supply them by miracle; to
refresh their soules as well as bodies by water out of a
rocke.</p>
               <p>IV. In the same Pillar of the Cloud,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Mercy and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice met in this type.</note> see justice and
mercy met together and tempered. 1. Mercy to the
Church and beleevers; that now wee behold Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in a cloud. The brightnesse of his goodnesse to us
shines in this darke cloud, in which wee see him as wee
are able. His Majesty hath attempered himselfe to our
debility and weaknesse. For such is our infirmity here
below, that unlesse the glory of God be vailed and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
wee can never bee able to behold it: no more then
the Priests could stand before the brightnesse of the cloud
that filled the Temple, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 11. nor the Disciples
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18740:136"/>
abide the brightnesse of Christ, when a bright cloud sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
them in his <hi>transfiguration.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 17. 5, 6.</note> For as no man can
endure to see the Sunne in his brightnesse and strength,
but in and through a cloud hee may: so no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the glorious Majestie of God, and live. Hence hath
hee pleased to let us behold him here not in his owne
glory, but in his Christ; in whom his excellent Majesty
is vailed and covered with our humanity. This is his
mercy, that we see now as wee may, as in a glasse or mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
preparing us to a farther mercy, then which no
mercy goeth farther, namely to see him as wee would,
and face to face; when with our frailty and corruption
all clouds and vailes shall be removed. 2. His justice
against sinners; whose misery it is, that there is alwayes
a cloud betweene God and them. A cloud of ignorance
that hinders them from the knowledge of God and holy
things; they see no true light: A cloud of darknesse and
misery that suffers them not to enjoy one spark of sound
comfort or consolation: A thick cloud of lusts and sins,
which hinders the passage of their prayers. They may
truely use that speach of the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 44. Thou
hast covered thy selfe with a cloud, that our prayer
should not passe through. As this cloud was a meanes
of greatest mercy to Israel; so was it of extreme misery
and destruction to the Aegyptians.</p>
               <p>V. Is Christ this Pillar of Cloud and fire?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 5. Follow Christ as a guide.</note> Then we
must follow Christ our guide. The Saints in earth are as
Israel in their pilgrimage marching out of Aegypt into
the promised land. God of his mercie affords us as hee
did them, a comfortable cloud to lead us through to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.
Wee must depend on this Pillar: For light of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
against the blindnesse of our minds: For light
of consolation in sorrows and terrours of heart, that we
may say with the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 8. When I shall sit in
darknesse the Lord is my light: For spirituall heat and
warmth; seeing this Pillar onely can kindle true love of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18740:137"/>
God, true zeale for God and his glory, fervency in
prayer, and inflame us with all ardent desires after God.
Wee must follow this Pillar for safety, security, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we follow this Pillar?<note place="margin">And how.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> As the Israelites carefully followed the cloud, in
this manner. 1. Because the clould was placed on
high, they must still looke upwards: So must wee still
looke upwards, not fixing our eye on any other directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about us, or beside us. We must not walke by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of men never so great, never so wise, never so rich,
never so neere us; but onely so farre as they follow this
Cloud. The Sunne of the world, and the Sonne of the
Church herein agree, that both of them are set infinitely
above our heads; that wee should expect our direction
from above, not from below; from the heavens, not
from the earth. 2. As the Israelites contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with that Pillar, as being sufficient: So must wee
with the light from Christ our Pillar. They needed no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
lights of their owne devising; the Pillar of fire
was sufficient (although at midnight) to enlighten
them. The Sunne at noone day was not more usefull to
them then this Pillar at midnight: So Christ in the
Scriptures is a most bright and shining light; not (as the
Papists say) obscure, dark, imperfect, unlesse there bee an
addition of traditions, Fathers, and mens devises. As
that cloud was no naturall direction: so wee must not
walke by direction of nature, dictate of reason, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our owne wills and senses. Follow this Pillar
onely, and (as Goshen was light when all Aegypt was
darkenesse) thou shalt have light when all the world
else sits in darknesse, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 12. But as for such as kindle
themselves a fire, or set up a Pillar to themselves, and
walk in the light of it, and in the sparks themselves have
kindled; the Lord threatens what they may expect from
his hands; They shall lie downe in sorrow, <hi>Isai.</hi> 50. 10.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18740:137"/>
3. As Israel must watch this Pillar night and day, and
frame their whole course unto it for motion or station,
for action or for rest: so must we to Christ (our Pillar) in
the Scripture. Blessed is the man that meditates in the
Law of the Lord night and day. And as they must give
diligent heed both day and night to be ready for their
journey whensoever the cloud should moove; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are said to keepe the Lords watch, <hi>Num</hi> 9. 19. so
must we alwaies watch, and be in a readinesse; because
we know not when the Master of the house will come,
at even or at midnight, at the cockcrowing or in the
dawning, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 35. Remember for conclusion; that
blessed shall that servant be (and he onely) whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
(when he commeth) findeth well doing.</p>

               <p>THe second extraordinary Sacrament of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,<note place="margin">Red sea a type of Christ.</note>
poynting unto Jesus Christ, was the <hi>Red
Sea;</hi> which being miraculously divided by God, the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
(pursued by the Aegyptians) passed thorough the

fruitfull beholding this great worke of God, wee will
consider it, 1. as a miracle in it selfe. 2. as a type and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Christ. 3. as applyable to our selves in some
profitable observations.</p>
               <p>I. In this great miracle are many miracles:<note place="margin">Miracles in the miraculous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of it.</note>
As 1. That so vast a sea should bee devided with the
lifting up of a rod. For the breadth of that Sea, where
Israel went over, was (by computation of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and
other Geographers) twelve or fifteene Germane miles,
at least thirty sixe of ours; so <hi>Chytraeus</hi> upon this place.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18740:138"/>
2. That the Lord should open a way,<note place="margin">Psal. 106. 9.</note> and <hi>lead Israel
through the deepe, as in the wildernesse;</hi> for their passage
was not over the Sea, but <hi>through</hi> it. Neither did they
walke upon the waters as upon the land, which had not
beene so much, for in cold countries it is ordinary for
men and cariages to passe upon the Ice and congealed
water as upon firme land: but they walked in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the Sea as on dry land. Who could deny but
it had beene a worke of omnipotency for the Lord to
have made the sea (on a sudden) a pavement for Israell
(as hard as Christall) to have walked firme upon? but
because every strong frost congeales the water accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to nature, that had beene lesse glorious, more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.
But he provides for the clearnesse of his owne
glory by effecting a worke above (yea against) the whole
frame of nature. 3. That the waters should stand as a
folid wall on both sides, which are naturally fluid, and
seeing nothing is so hardly contained within bounds as
liquid waters, it was exceeding miraculous. And that the
bottome of the sea should on the suddaine become firme
and dry ground, <hi>(Exod. 14. 22)</hi> and even as an high way,
was not the least of these miracles. 4. That the
same sea at the same time should be both calme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous:
For the mighty winds and tempests were so
strong against the Aegyptians that it brake their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
wheeles, and they could hardly moove or stirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; yet all the same time it was a peaceable calme to
Israel; who were very neere them. 5. The time of the
standing of the waters on so vast an heape (whereon lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men agree not) any way concluded, is most miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Some thinke (as <hi>Chytraeus)</hi> that for so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
yea hundred thousands of men women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to walke a soft pace, and to drive their cattell so
many miles, must needs take them foure or five dayes
time, and then the waters to stand so long, was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Others thinke they went through in one night, (for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18740:138"/>
the text mentioneth but one night) and then was it no
lesse miraculous to convey so much people and cattell so
much way in so small time. 6. That the same Sea at the
same time should be both a gulfe and devourer; and yet
a saver from devourers. That the same sea at the same
time should both retire back, &amp; yet return to its course,
for the waters returned upon the Aegyptians on the one
side of the sea, when Israel was not fully over on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as appeareth by comparing ver. 26. with ver. 29.
that the same sea at the same time should moove &amp; stand
with such judgment and distinction, as not one Aegyptian
was saved,<note place="margin">How signified Christ.</note> ver. 28. not one Israelite drowned, ver. 30.</p>
               <p>II. Now consider this great worke of God as a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
and type of Christ; which it must needs be as
it is a Sacrament, which we must consider both in the
constitution, and in the consequents or effects of
it, in all directly poynting us to Jesus Christ hereby typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
In the first to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, the Apostle saith, that
<hi>all the Fathers were baptized in the sea;</hi> whence I gather
three conclusions.<note place="margin">In three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I. Conclusion: That this was a Sacrament figuring
our baptisme, and that all necessary institutions of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
concurre in it: As 1. the author was God, the
Institutor both of the Covenant and seales, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 30.
2. the Minister was <hi>Moses,</hi> ver. 31. 3. the Covenant
sealed was Gods promise and word for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
ver. 15. 4. the signe of the Covenant was <hi>Moses</hi>
stretching of his hand, both for the deviding of the sea,
ver. 16, and the returning of it againe, ver. 27. 5. the
thing signified was salvation by the Messiah, and all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and eternall benefits and deliverances procured
by him sealed up in this miracle. 6. the faith of the
Israelites was the same hand with ours to receive the
same benefits, and things signified: ver. 31. <hi>they beleeved
God: Heb. 11. 29. by faith they passed through the red sea, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi>

               <p>II. Conclusion: There was not one of these
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18740:139"/>
actions in this temporall deliverance, but it signified
and sealed such actions to the beleeving Israelites, as
both confirmed their faith in the Covenant, and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their salvation merited by the Messiah, and so still
led them to Christ, As in these examples. 1. God in
leading his people to Canaan made them a safe way
through the sea: signifying to their faith that God offered
them Jesus Christ the promised Messiah, through the red
sea of whose death and passion they should find a sure
and safe way to passe them through a full sea of troubles
to the true celestiall Canaan, and by him as by a firme
way to walke forward to eternall life. 2. When they
saw the same Jehovah to divide the sea into his division
<hi>(Iunius</hi> calleth them <hi>cuttings off)</hi> and to drive away the
raging waters from overflowing them;<note place="margin">Segmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>a.</note> this action sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to their faith that the son of God by his merit and
mediation would carry them through all difficulties and
dangers as deepe as the bottome of the sea, unto eternall
rest, and so rebuke the seas of their sorrows, and drive
back the raging waves of terrors and temptations that
threaten their destruction, that they shall safely and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
passe through the sea as it were on dry land.
3. When they saw Jehovah the Sonne of God present
with them in the voyage, and that he made the sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to his force againe, both to save themselves and to
overthrow the Aegyptians: It signified to their faith the
action of Christ freeing his elect from all spirituall forces
and armies pursuing them; as also by a mighty overthrow
swallowing up and devouring (in the bottomlesse sea
of his wrath) all those that come out and stand against
them.</p>
               <p>III. Conclusion. There is no Evangelicall blessing
by Christ sealed to us by baptisme, which was not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and sealed to them in the Red sea. So as Christ
was as truely represented to them as to us, though not
so cleerely; and the truth and substance of his merits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18740:139"/>
to them as to us, onely in a manner more obscure
and clouded.<note place="margin">Benefits sealed up by baptisme</note> As in examples, 1. If the waters of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
seal up to beleevers that the blood of Christ alone
saveth and defendeth the people of God from eternall
death and damnation: What could be more plainely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by the waters of the Red sea saving Israel from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death and destruction? 2. Baptisme signifieth
to us that by the blood of Christ (in which Red sea all
beleevers must be baptised) there is dying and a buriall
unto sinne, and a rising unto newnesse of life: What could
be more plainely signified by the Baptisme of the fathers
in the Red sea, who were (after a sort) buried in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but after raised to the shoare, and restored to land
and life? 3. By the benefit of Baptisme (in which the
Red sea of Christs blood is truely applyed) our old man
and flesh is truely mortified, buried, and destroyed; but
the new man is quickned and repaired; and now new
motions, desires, affections are stirred up and preserved
in the hearts of beleevers: what could be more expresly
signified to the Fathers by the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
and his hoste in the Red sea, and the escape of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
safe and sound? 4. When they did see themselves
(by the benefit of the Red sea) freed from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude:
how easily might they gather, that by the blood
of Christ every beleever of Jewes and Gentiles are freed
from the slavery of hellish Pharaoh, and all his Armies
of sinnes and corruptions? And when they did see how
the Aegyptians (once dead and slaine) could hurt them
no more, how could they but gather, that all the armies of
sinne (once remitted and buried in the death of Christ)
can no more rise up to condemnation, then a drowned
Aegyptian to drowne an Israelite?</p>
               <p>I. To note the mighty power of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Obserue the power of God.</note> who can still
and over-master the mighty raging of the sea: which we
see here in that its water, dry land, sands, and shoare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the providence of God, and serve for his peoples
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18740:140"/>
safety. Israel saw the mighty power of God herein, <hi>Exo.
14.</hi> 31. Let us also behold the glory of God herein, and
feare before him as they did. Let not us be more sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
than the senselesse creatures, but heare his voice,
runne out of our owne nature to observe his voice
sounding in the Scriptures and Ministery of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>II. To see and consider the state of the Church and
people of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. The way to heaven filled with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Canaan (whither they goe) is a fine and
fertile country, but the way is asperous and dangerous.
They are still as it were in the bottome of the sea: ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
implacable at their heeles in infinite numbers: seas
of waters dreadfull to behold on both hands, yea rising
over their heads as mountaines threatning to fall over
them: and after a deepe sea, a terrible wildernesse takes
them, in which is no meanes for meat, drinke, nor
cloath. A man would thinke, no man could deale so
with his children: and yet Gods wisedome sees this the
fittest way to Canaan.<note place="margin">And why.</note> He sees how, 1. Every small
content glewes us to our Aegypt. 2. What sluggs we
are in the way, farther then we are chased out. 3. How
little we care for dependance on himselfe, when we are
full of naturall comforts. 4. That Canaan is so rich
a land as is worthy all our labour and suffering.</p>
               <p>Apply this note to awake thee out of thy ease and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
slumber. If thy way be so easie and pleasing to flesh,
sure it leads not to Canaan, suspect it. The Israelites go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Aegypt, had no enemies nor troubles meeting
them; but going into Canaan, they had nothing else.
<hi>Strait is the way that leads to life,</hi> and all the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is strowed with crosses. Apply it also to secure thee
in thy troubles. Art thou in a deepe danger or sorrow
like the bottome of the sea? It is no worse with thee
then with the rest of the people of God. No affliction
overtakes thee, but the same hath befalne the Saints in
the world. Hold on to Canaan, and all is safe: Canaan is
worth all. Happy thou if thou canst get to Canaan, though
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18740:140"/>
thy passage be through the bottome of the sea.</p>
               <p>III. To observe what a many comforts this great
worke of God will load us withall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Many comforts by this great work of God.</note> that are willing to
carry them away. For,</p>
               <p>I. The Lord in strange and unwonted dangers can
worke new and unwonted remedies for his children. As
we heard before that fire shall not burne them, so here
the sea (at his word of restraint) shall not drowne them.
He can make a wall of water more strong for them than
a wall of Adamant: yea himselfe (according to their need)
will be to them either a wall of fire or water.</p>
               <p>II. What danger can prevaile against the Church, if
all these dangers on all hands, above them, below them,
afore them, behind them at once, cannot sinke them?
No, <hi>All the gates of hell cannot prevaile against it.</hi> Every
maine affliction is like a maine Red sea which threatens
to swallow us up, but it shall in the issue onely preserve
the Church. What we have most cause to feare, the Lord
maketh most helpfull and soveraigne. The very raging
sea (rather then they shall perish) shall open her lappe
as a tender mother to receive them from the rage of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
and his pursuing army: Nay the land of Goshen
shall not be halfe so bountifull to them as these waters,
which gave them freedome, victory, and the spoiles and
riches remaining upon the dead bodies of their enemies.</p>
               <p>III. How unweariably the Lord sets himselfe to
overcome all difficulties for his servants. What had it
beene to have passed the oppressors of Aegypt, and to
have beene swallowed up of the sea? Therefore hee
makes a new way, where never any way lay before, in
the bottome of the sea. Afterwards he makes a dry and
barren wildernesse comfortable to them; dryes up Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
as strangely for their passage; gives them a daily har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of Mannah from heaven; breaks a rock to give them
water; and happily in time finisheth their long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
journey. Even so the godly (going out of Aegypt,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18740:141"/>
departing from the kingdome of the devill, and hastning
out of the world towards heaven) come presently into
a deepe sea; not pursued onely by the fury of tyrants and
enemies, but every where threatned with dangers, wants,
and death it selfe: yet the Lord breakes for them one
toyle after another, and happily guides them through a
deepe sea of miseries, and never leaves them till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the shoare, and arrive safely at the haven of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where their songs shall be louder then their cryes
were, and a mighty deliverance shall swallow up all
their danger.</p>
               <p>IV. Here is comfort against the feare of enemies.
1. Spirituall enemies. For here we have both a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and resemblance of the eternall delivery of the
Church from the tyranny of the hellish <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> which
in spight of him is led through a sea of tribulation every
where ready to overwhelme it, into the promised rest
of everlasting life. Againe wee see here our sinnes also
cast into, and drowned <hi>in the bottome</hi> of the Red sea,
<hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 19. These are the strongest and fiercest enemies
that pursued us to death; but these our furious sinnes (as
so many Aegyptians) are drowned in the sea of Christs
blood, and extinct in the waters of Baptisme, <hi>Aug: Psal.
113.</hi> 2. Temporall enemies. How can the Aegyptians
hope to stand before Israell, to whom the waters give
way so strangely? The enemy shall find the same sea, a
wall and a well, a safety and a death. Let enemies looke
here as the heathen did, and let their hearts saint as
theirs, to see God make the sea a wall, a lane, yea a lappe
for his people. Let them behold the ordinary worke of
God, who commonly joynes the salvation of his Church
with the destruction of the enemies. So for <hi>Mordecaies</hi>
advancement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Duty of them that will enioy these comforts.</note> and the Churches deliverance, <hi>Haman</hi> must
be hanged, and his posterity destroyed: as in a ballance,
if one scoale goe up, downe goes the other.</p>
               <p>IV. The godly to partake of these comforts must
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18740:141"/>
learne, 1. To labour for increase of faith: for <hi>by faith
they passed through the Red sea, Heb.</hi> 11. 29. So must thou
get faith for thy vessell to passe thee through. Faith in
tryall is a great victory; in the bottome of the sea, in dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
afflictions it is most glorious. It is nothing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in prosperity: but in desperation to beleeve, in the
bottome of the sea to stand still, yea in the bottome of hel
to hope for heaven, there is faith. 2. To joyne to
Gods people. Let not the Aegyptian thinke the way is
made for him. Except thou goest out with Israell (as
<hi>Exod. 12. 38.)</hi> the sea will know thee for an Aegyptian,
and cover thee. 3. To get God their guide, and to
follow him. Neither <hi>Noah</hi> upon the top of a world of
seas, nor Israel in the bottome of the sea shall miscarry,
if God become the Pilot. Follow thy guide, goe on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
feare not, rest in God for safety in extreame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and thou art the fittest for his helpe and deliverance.
See 2. <hi>Chro. 20. 12. We know not what to doe, but our eyes
are towards thee.</hi>

sixe,<note place="margin">Sixe qualities of Manna.</note> many of them miraculous.</p>
                  <p>1. The Manna came down from heaven.<note place="margin">Dominus Iesus ipse conviva &amp; convivium: ipse comedens &amp; qui comeditur. Ieron. Ep. ad Hedibiam.</note> God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
prepared this food to satisfie the Jewes hunger: so
Jesus Christ is the true bread that came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
all other bread is from earth, but Christ is from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
he hath God for his Father, from whose bosome he
is sent into the wildernesse of this world to satisfie the
spirituall hunger of his people. And as that was an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
gift prepared by God for them; and therefore they
called it Manna: so nothing was more freely prepared
and given by God then Jesus Christ for the life of the
world; hee came without the worlds seeking, without
merit and deserving, yea or accepting; for he came to his
owne, and his owne received him not: And was not this
miraculous above that, that he which sent the Manna was
the Manna which he sent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:18740:142"/>

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>. The taste of Manna was sweet, and <hi>tasted like
fresh oyle, Numb.</hi> 11. 8. or <hi>wafers baked with honey, Exod.
16. 31:</hi> So nothing is so sweet as Jesus Christ to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and hungry heart, The sweet promises of grace
are <hi>sweeter ther honey, Psal.</hi> 19. 10. No fresh and sweet
oile can so cherish the face, as they doe the heart which
is able to apprehend the sweet consolations and joyes of
the Spirit. And as Manna tasted alike to all tastes, and
every whit of it was sweet, and every mouth tasted the
same sweetnesse, as it never was in any other food in the
world: So onely Christ is the same to all that taste him,
and every whit of him is sweet, even his yoake, his
Crosse, and every mouth that tastes him, can confesse
him so to be.</p>

vers.</hi> 14. but full of yeald, sweetnesse, and nourishment:
So Jesus Christ was little and humble in his owne eies,
and in other mens eies liker a worme then a man. Little
in his birth, in his life, in his death, in his followers.
Uery weake in shew and appearance; but full of power,
strength, and grace to sustaine and uphold his Church;
full of nourishment, sweetnesse, and comfort to refresh
his Church to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>2. It was freely and <hi>abundantly</hi> given to Israel as the
raine, and fell downe with the dew: So Jesus Christ
is freely given to the Church, and in him abundant grace
and plentifull redemption. God never expressed such
bounty, nor ever opened the treasury of his rich grace in
any thing so much as in giving his Christ, who never
comes any where without the sweet dewes of comfort,
joy, and happy graces which distill from him into every
beleeving heart.</p>
                  <p>3. Manna fell every morning <hi>round about the campe,</hi>
and no where else; and so much every morning as was
sufficient for sixe hundred thousand men besides women
and children: signifying that Jesus Christ is no where
to bee found without the campe and bounds of the
Church; and that <hi>of his fulnesse all beleevers receiue grace
for grace;</hi> and that in Christ is sufficiency of merit for
all his Church; and there need no other supply for health

would, as feed them, so teach them; namely to rest on
the Sabbath day, as it did: and signified that in that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Sabbath wee shall enjoy Manna without meanes;
and shall eate our fill of that <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> laid up and
prepared for the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17. 2. Every day in
the weeke: to signifie that we must daily feed on Christ
and his grace; and that wee must daily renew the care
of the salvation and sustenance of our soules. 3. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18740:144"/>
morning of every day; early must they gather it, the
first thing they did: To signifie, that wee must embrace
Christ speedily, while the meanes last and offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Christ is worth our first care; and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
is, <hi>first to seeke the kingdome of God.</hi> The foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
virgins sought Oile and Manna too late.</p>
                  <p>3. The measure: 1. Every man hath a measure
out of the common heape: signifying that Christ is the
same treasury to poore and rich, small and great; and
every beleever and Israelite hath his portion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
measured out unto him, (for <hi>he must live by his owne
faith)</hi> and a severed measure of knowledge and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
from others.<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> 2. Every man hath the same
measure. There was one measure for all, a Gomer for
every person: So every Christian hath his Gomer, and
the same measure. For although there is difference in
the graces of sanctification (some being in the higher
formes of knowledge, some in lower; some of little
faith, some of great faith; some whose zeale is as a
<hi>smoaking flaxe,</hi> in some a bright flame) yet justification
by Christ is equall to all, and <hi>doth not admit a more or a
lesse.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non suscipit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis &amp; minus.</note> The youngling in grace is as truely and fully justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as the ancient beleever, though not so fully sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
3. Every man hath a full Gomer a full measure:
to signifie that in Christ is no want, but <hi>wee are compleat
in him, Col.</hi> 2. 10. And as the gathering Israelite (though
he gathered lesse then some other) had his Gomer full:
so hee that hath the weakest grace, and weakest faith (if
true and sound) shall attaine the same salvation which
the stronger beleever attaines. For the <hi>same precious faith</hi>
attaines the same common salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. Wee must consider this Manna in the Jews use
of it. 1. In respect of the dressing.<note place="margin">Their use of it.</note> It must be ground
and baked before it could bee fit food for the Israelites:
signifying that Jesus Christ must first be ground and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon the Crosse, and pounded with passion before
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18740:144"/>
hee could become a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>it food and Saviour of his Church.
Every graine of Manna must be ground and broken: so
must Christ bee broken and bruised in the wine presse of
Gods wrath. Every graine of Manna must bee baked in
the Oven: so must Christ bee parched and baked, yea
and dried up in the Oven of his Fathers displeasure.
And this was extraordinary and above nature in it, that
one heate (namely of the Sunne) melted it; another
heate (namely of fire) baked it; very strange, but sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative
of the same in Christ. The heat of his love to
mankind melted him, but the heat of his Fathers wrath
(as hot as fire) baked him, and fitted him for our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
food. 2. The Manna being dressed must be eaten,
that is, applied to their substance, and digested for their
nourishment: signifying Jesus Christ, who although
(like the Manna) he must be gathered in common, and
must bee received whole (as Manna must bee gathered
whole) yet he must be eaten in severall, that is, specially
applied to every beleever for his food and strength; by
which application hee becomes food in our hunger, and
physicke in our weak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>esse as the Manna was to them,
and other had they none. 3. They must use it all, and
reserve none till the morning; for if they did, it putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and wormes grew in it, <hi>vers. 19. 20:</hi> To signifie,
that not the profession of Christ profits any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faithfull applying of him. Yea and as Manna reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
putrified: so Christ becomes a scandall and a rocke
of offence to the unbeleeving of the world, that content
themselves to heareof Christ and have the word among
them, but apply it not to their hearts and lives. The
sweetest Manna becomes a rottennesse and a favour of
death to carnall professours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did the Lord cause the Manna daily
to putrifie,<note place="margin">Why Manna putrified, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</note> if kept?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He will have them daily depend upon his
hands and provision; that was no time nor place to shift
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18740:145"/>
covetously for themselves, neither was there any need,
seeing every day supplied them with a new harvest.
2. To signifie to them, that <hi>man lived not by bread onely,
but by every word of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 44.</note> How could they thinke that
such corruptible food could preserve them, that it selfe
could not be preserved above a few houres but by Gods
institution? 3. That they might acknowledge God
a free and extraordinary worker in all his administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them. For even this Manna (which kept an
houre beyond a day, suddenly rotted) if God command
to keep it two dayes every weeke for his worship sake,
it shall bee miraculously preserved sweet and savoury.
Yea if for a monument of his mercy he shall command
to lay a sample of it in the Arke; it shall last and bee
kept in the Holy of holies many ages, yea many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of yeares sweet and savoury as at first. And all
this not without signification: that although Jesus Christ
was in his flesh and humane nature subject to sorrow,
death, and passion, yet even in that humanity (now
glorified) he is set in the Holy of holies (as the Manna
in the golden pot) before the Lord for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 33.
and abides for ever in the heavens for all eternity, not
subject to corruption any more, as that golden pot of
Manna was.</p>

before this type or figure, in sixe severall advancements.<note place="margin">Christ infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better then Manna.</note>
1. That Manna had no life in it selfe, but this hath, <hi>Ioh.
5. 26. As the Father hath life in himselfe, so hath he given
to the Sonne to have life in himselfe. Ioh. 6. 35. I am that
bread of life.</hi> 2. That Manna not having life in it selfe,
cannot give to others what it selfe hath not; it could
onely preserve life given of God: But this can conuey
and give life to others, <hi>Ioh. 6. 33. The bread of God is he
which commeth downe from heaven, and giveth life unto the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18740:145"/>
world.</hi> 3. That Manna preserved onely naturall and
temporall life, as other bread: but this preserves spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and eternall life in the soule and inward man.
4. That manna could not preserve this temporall life
for ever, <hi>Ioh. 6. 49. Your father did eate Manna in the
wildernesse, and are dead;</hi> nay it could not keepe them
from hunger above one day to an end: But this bread
once tasted makes a man live for ever, <hi>hee shall not die,
vers.</hi> 50. yea <hi>he shall never hunger more, vers.</hi> 35. 5. If a
man were dead, that manna could not raise him againe to
life<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but this raiseth dead to life, as <hi>Lazarus;</hi> which all
the food, physicke and meanes on earth cannot doe, <hi>Iob.
11. 25. He that beleeveth in me, though hee were dead, yet
shall hee liue.</hi> 6. That manna did corrupt, it melted
daily when the Sunne arose; it lasted not beyond a day<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
it continued not beyond the wildernesse; and that small
portion which the Lord reserved in the Holy of holies,
perished and was lost after the captivity: But this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
is not subject to corruption, but abideth sweet and
precious to every hungry heart; nor subject to violence,
but abides in the Holy of holies without all change or
feare of danger; nor onely lasts in this journey through
our wildernesse, but is the sweetest and most delicious in
our Cannan; when hee shall bee food, physick, raiment,
delight, and all in all, to all the Saints and sonnes of God.</p>

                  <p>I. To note in God foure things:<note place="margin">Vse in respect of God.</note> 1. Patience and

all these to his Church, both Jewish and Christian, and
to all the Israel of God, Legall and Evangelicall. Every
one of these affordeth us speciall matter of instruction.</p>
                  <p>I. His grace and patience appeares in the time of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:18740:146"/>
giving both the typicall and the true manna from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.<note place="margin">Gods patience and love, to be noted.</note>
Then hee pleased to give the manna to Israel,
1. When Israel had great need of Gods helpe, and had
no power to helpe themselves, when they were even
ready to starve: Even so when the Church was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
need of Christ, and altogether helplesse in herself,
it pleased God to give his Sonne from heaven to save
and refresh her. Which the Apostle notes, <hi>Rom 5. 6.
For Christ when we were yet of no strength, at his time died
for the ungodly.</hi> 2. Then God gave Israel manna,
when Israel (murmuring) had deserved nothing but
wrath and vengeance; when they could looke for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fire from heaven, hee gives them food from
heaven, and such food as was Angels food, sweet as
honey: Oh what a tender Nurse is the Lord become to
a froward people? hee will still the frowardnesse of his
first borne rather with the breast then with the rod:
Even so when by our hatefull sinnes of many sorts wee
could neither deserve nor expect any thing but revenge
from heaven, God sent his Sonne from heaven, the true
manna and bread of life, who hath more sweetnesse in
him then the honey combe; which one gift sweetneth
all blessings, which else had beene so many curses. For
what had the Israelites deliverance, victory, lives been
worth in the wildernesse without food and manna,
which kept them in life and strength? Even so had all
our outward blessings been to us (without Jesus Christ)
onely a lingring death and misery. Oh who would deale
thus with his enemy, but hee that hath an Ocean of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Which the same Apostle (in the same Chapter <hi>ver.
8)</hi> leadeth us unto; where hee magnifieth and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Gods love unto us; that, <hi>while wee were yet sinners,
Christ died for us,</hi> yea while <hi>we were yet enemies (ver. 10.)</hi>
he sent us this manna, by whom he reconciled himselfe
unto us.</p>
                  <p>Let this consideration be of use: 1. To stirre up in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18740:146"/>
us a fervent love of God, who loved us with a pitifull
love when wee were in so pitifull a case;<note place="margin">And how it should work in us.</note> as also with so
seasonable love, when our extreme need urged us; yea
with such effectuall love; as spared us the greatest gift of
love, and the richest mercy that heaven and earth can
containe to relieve our want. 2. To labour to love our
enemies, as God did us being his enemies. For naturall
men and <hi>hypocrites can love those that love them, Matt. 5.
45.</hi> but if we <hi>love them that hate us,</hi> we shall be <hi>the sonnes
of our heavenly Father.</hi> 3. To move us to cease from
our sinnes; for who would goe on to provoke so good
a God, that still prevents us with love and mercy? And
if hee please to reserve love for us while wee are yet in
our sinnes, and in love with them; how sweet will his
love be, when we cease to love them? How strong will
it bee, and how constant? For, doth hee not cast us off
when wee are enemies, and deserve hatred, and will hee
ever cast off those whom he thus loveth? This <hi>love</hi> shall
be <hi>stronger then death,</hi> for that shall not quench it.</p>
                  <p>II. See the watchfulnesse and care of God over his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Church. The manna fell with the dew;<note place="margin">Gods watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and care over his Church, to be noted.</note> and while the
people of Israel slept, the Lord watched to spread a
table for them: because, 1. he <hi>that keepeth Israel slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
not nor sleepeth.</hi> The eye of the Lord (saith <hi>Basil)</hi>
is <hi>without all sleepe,</hi> ever watchfull: 2. because hee is
a tender father, and Israel is his sonne and first borne.
A carefull father is waking for his childs good while it
sleeps and takes no care: In like maner hath this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eye kept it selfe waking, from the beginning of the
world till this day. How did it watch over <hi>Abraham</hi>
and all his beleeving posterity; whilest he and we were
all in the night of sinne and death? And whilest wee
were in a dead sleepe, how carefully did hee provide
this heavenly manna, and spread it about the tents of the
Church in all ages? 1. In the promise of the blessed
seed. 2. In the types and shadowes signifying and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18740:147"/>
Jesus Christ. 3. In the holy Ministery of
Prophets and Apostles, in which it was plentifully show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
4. In the spirituall worship of beleevers both in
the old and new Testament. 5. In the blessed incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and appearance of the truth it selfe, who rose as a
glorious sunne of righteousnesse, but as it were at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
when the world lay in such palpable darkenesse as
was thicker then the darkenesse of Aegypt: as manna fell
in the night, and was readier for them every morning
then they were for it.</p>
                  <p>Apply this observation for thy particular comfort.<note place="margin">Comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</note> If
thou beest an Israelite, no night shall befall thee nor sleep
in any night, but this carefull eye of God shall watch to
supply thee.<note place="margin">Instances. 1.</note> As in three instances. 1. The godly passing
through this wildernesse of this world, although they be
in Covenant with God (as Israel was) yet often are cast
into the night of sinne, and in this night they often nod
and slip into a sounder sleepe of sinne sometimes then
they thinke off: but then this eye watcheth them, that
they sleepe not in death and so fall into extreame ruine.
For they being written on the palme of the <hi>Lords</hi> hand,
being as a signet upon his finger, as a jewell on his heart,
and (which is neerer) as the apple of his eye, he watcheth
a season to waken them, to raise them, and erect them
in faith to watchfulnesse and salvation. 2. Many times
the godly fall into the night of affliction, and are cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the darke of many deadly dangers which they should
never (by themselves) be wound out off. Now while
they are thus surprised with a dead and dangerous sleep,
the <hi>Lord</hi> watcheth to prepare some meanes of evasion,
which they never dreame off. How did the Lord watch
over Jonah while he slept under hatches not dreaming
of so present a danger? Nay when he seemes dead and
buried in the Whales belly (as in a grave of silence) how
miraculously did the Lord watch to bring him to dry
land as sound and safe as if he had beene kept in a strong
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18740:147"/>
castle? How did the Lord watch <hi>Mordecai</hi> while he
slept, <hi>Hest.</hi> 6. 1. he slept, but the King shall not sleepe till
he have advanced <hi>Mordecai?</hi> How did he watch over
<hi>Peter (Act. 12. 7.)</hi> whilst he slept so fast in the night as
scarce an Angell could waken him, and brought him
through the sleepie watch? Our experience can tell us
every morning how the Lord keepes our houses, our
selves without feare against robbers, fires, dangers, in the
night he makes us sleepe in safety, and while we are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
naked, sencelesse, becomes a wall of protection
round about us. 3. In the night of death he gives not
over his watch, but watcheth the very bones of the
Saints, that in the morning of the resurrection they may
mory fully enjoy Christ the true Manna, and attaine a full
measure and gomer, and a perfect satiety and fulnesse of
this sweet bread of life. <hi>Psa. 17. 15. David</hi> calls it, <hi>a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
with Gods Image, when he shall awake.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. V.</head>
                  <p>III. See in this gift,<note place="margin">Gods bounty toward his Church, to be noted.</note> Gods bountifulnesse and
freenesse to his Church in three things. 1. He offers
Israel Mannah without the asking, seeking, or buying; it
costs them nothing but gathering: even so he offers us
salvation by Jesus Christ while wee aske not after him.
He is found of them that seeke him not. The first <hi>Adam</hi>
runs away from Gods presence: the second <hi>Adam</hi> runnes
after him to seeke and recall him out of his bushes. Now
what desert or merit could there bee in the first <hi>Adam</hi>
to be followed with grace in his flying from it? And if
there be none in him; how come wee his posterity to
more possibility to merit any thing but death, more then
he? No, here is no merit, no buying of Mannah, but onely
a faithfull and thankfull acceptance of it. 2. He raines
it downe in abundance, his hand is not short; he opened
the windowes of heaven, <hi>and rained downe manna to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18740:148"/>
eate, Psal.</hi> 78. 24. For 1. It is for the honour of God
to be bountifull and rich in mercies, and to powre down
his blessings upon his people. 2. Israel needed daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
and store of mannah, which need he is carefull
to supply. But oh what great goodnesse hath God stored
for them that love him! In his Sonne Jesus Christ he hath
rayned downe bread of life, the greatest arme and
streame that ever flowed from that Ocean. A mercy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
all the tents of beleevers. A mercy that lets the
true Mannah fall enough for a whole world of beleevers,
not on one Nation of Israel onely, but on all the Nations
of the world. For he did not so then to any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but now to all. Nay in this mannah is a mercy not only
covering the earth, but a mountaine of mercy reaching to
heaven. 3. His hand is not weary, but every morning
lets fall enough to feed and fill so many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of mouths and bellies: so the grace of God in
Christ is an unweariable grace. At he gave more mannah
then all the Israelites were able to gather: so he is more
infinitely able to give, then all beleevers are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Hence wee may (with <hi>David)</hi> stirre up
our selves to blesse the <hi>Lord</hi> that lodeth us with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
daily.</p>
                  <p>IV. The wisdome of God in administring his
mercy to his Church.<note place="margin">Gods wisdome in ministring to his Church, to be noted.</note> 1. In that he gives them Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
from heaven not from earth, they cannot now expect
an annuall harvest of corne from the earth, but must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
every day an heavenly showre to bee fed by; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord will not have them fixe their eyes and
se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces on earth, but know they were now to live of Gods
allowance, and for their whole meanes depend on his
hand. Let it teach us Christians to lift up our eyes and
sences from earth and earthly desires, and affect that
manna which is from heaven; every day desire to be fed
with some heavenly shower for the nourishment of the
soule, and preserving the life of grace in it. Let it teach us
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18740:148"/>
to acknowledge the hand of our heavenly father in
the gathering of the mannah, and good things for our
temporall life. Hee is <hi>the father of lights from whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
every good and perfect gift.</hi> The Israelite must
looke to heaven for every morsell of bread that hee
puts in his mouth: and shall the Christian (as the
swine) eate up the mast, and never looke up to the tree
whence it falls.</p>
                  <p>II. In that hee gives them manna every day.
Hee might have given them an harvest of it once a
yeere; or hee might have rained it once a month;
but hee gives it daily.<note place="margin">Manna, why gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daily.</note> To shew 1. that hee had
undertaken for their daily maintenance, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
supplyes challenged the continuall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon his providence. 2. that they must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with daily bread. 3. that it should bee a part of
their calling and exercise in the wildernesse, where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temporall businesse had they none. Let us hence learn.
1. to acknowledge Gods wisdome; if he give us earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manna and meanes but from hand to mouth, he knows
to supply it with true manna. He allowes us to pray but
for daily bread; and <hi>if we have food and rayment we must
be content, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 8. 2. to confine our cares within the
day, not so solicitous to lay up for many yeeres, as the
rich glutton. <hi>Care not for to morrow,</hi> that is, inordinatly,
distrustfully. 3. to take notice of our daily need of the
true mannah, whereof seeing God hath given us daily
meanes, wee must not erosse Gods wisdome to thinke
the reading of Gods word once in a yeare, or month, or
weeke enough; but be daily gathering, and answering the
daily meanes afforded by Gods gracious wisdome, as did
the Jews.</p>
                  <p>III. His wisdome is seene in that he giveth them
no manna on the Sabbath;<note place="margin">Why not on the Sabbath day.</note> but for the Sabbath a double
portion on the day before. For 1. the Sabbath day is
not to seeke temporall food and manna, but spirituall
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18740:149"/>
and eternall. 2. He will not have his Sabbath and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
interrupted, therefore he gives them a double porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the day before. 3. Hee will not have them losers
by being intent in his service; but as a liberall paymaster,
allowes them as largely as any other day.</p>
                  <p>Let this teach us, 1. to nourish the care of Gods
worship above the care of our life, and more intend the
businesse of the soule then of the body. So our Saviour,
<hi>first seeke the kingdome of God,</hi> and then other things.
2. to become more conscionable in the keeping of the
Sabbath, not seeking this day after earthly but heavenly
things alone. For consider, 1. The Lords liberality in
giving thee (not a sixt day, but) sixe whole daies wherein
to gather earthly manna; and wilt thou encroach his day
too? 2. his liberality in giving thee manna for the
seaventh day, blessing the labour of the sixe daies, and
thereby binding thy hands from labour on the seventh.</p>
                  <p>IV. His wisedome is seene in giving to every man
his Gomer;<note place="margin">Measure thy desires in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things.</note> and every man hath his measure. 1. to
measure their desires by Gods measure. 2. that no
man should have just cause of discontent; for hee had a
sufficient measure for necessity, and God was not bound
to provide for their wantonnesse. 3. that no man
might envy another mans disproportion; seeing no man
had want, no man might have superfluity. Let us learne
hence 1. To gather no more of this earthly Manna then
God would have us to gather.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That which his blessing by good and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
meanes affordeth,<note place="margin">How to know Gods measure.</note> is his measure; and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
Gods word in seeking or getting wealth, is to goe
beyond Gods measure. 2. Neither to lay up, nor to keep
any of this manna without or against God. Goods well
gotten shall stand and prosper (as manna gathered in the
sixe dayes.) But gather this manna on the seaventh day,
or lay up without and against Gods commandement,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18740:149"/>
that is to say, that which thou gettest falsly, or well got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
which thou shouldst expend for Gods glory and the
charitable reliefe of the poore members of Jesus Christ,
but doest not, all that shall rot and stinke, as stolen manna
did.</p>

                  <p>II. In respect of our selves also we learne sundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
from the consideration of both the mannahs,<note place="margin">Vse in respect of our selves.</note>
the typicall and the true manna. These instructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
1. our estate. 2. our duty.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning our estate:<note place="margin">Man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe senselesse of the things of Iesus Christ.</note> To note how senselesse and
void of understanding every man is by nature in the
things of God and Jesus Christ, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 15. None of the
Jewes knew what the manna was: No more doth any
man know by nature the things of the Spirit of God.
1. <hi>Cor. 2. 14. The naturall man perceiveth not the things of
God.</hi> If he perceive them not in his understanding, much
lesse can he receive them in his affection. Tell the Jew of
Christ, or let the Jew heare Christ himselfe speaking of
himselfe (the manna and bread of life) they conceive he
is bread for the belly, they must eate him up straight, <hi>Ioh.
6.</hi> 52. Tell <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of the new birth, he can conceive
no second nativity, but of <hi>going into his mothers w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>mbe
againe being old, Ioh. 3</hi> 4. Tell the Samaritan of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of life, she cannot conceive whence to have it, if not
out of <hi>Iacobs</hi> well, which hee and his cattell dranke, <hi>Ioh.
4.</hi> 12. Nay such is our palpable blindnesse in spirituall
things, as we cannot onely not finde them, but even offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto us (as the manna to them) we cannot apprehend
them, nay wee cannot but reject them, as that woman of
Samaria; Jesus Christ offers himselfe unto her, she scorns
him, and will not make nor meddle with him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>The reason whereof is partly in the things themselves,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note>
and partly in our selves. 1. The things are things of
Gods spirit, and cannot be reached or judged by any rule
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18740:150"/>
in nature. For the things of creation, the <hi>heathen knew
them in part from God as God, Rom. 1. 19:</hi> But for the
things of Sanctification (as that God the Father by his
Sonne made the world, or that God the Sonne by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
made a new world) here they are blind as moles. Nay
even in this part of knowledge, the naturall man asketh
what engines or tooles could God get to reare such a
frame, and will not beleeve it could be made with a
word, It will aske, of what prejacent matter, and will
not beleeve that so great a thing could be made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
whereas <hi>we by faith understand, that the world was
framed by the word of God, Heb.</hi> 11. 3. How blind then
must they needs be in spirituall things, that are blind in
things naturall? 2. The reason in our selves is that
we are wedded to our own apprehensions, and not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
led out of our conceits; as vessels hardly let goe the
savour of the first liquor; wee will measure all by the
standard of naturall reason, and by the scantling of our
owne senses.</p>
                  <p>Apply this observation 1. To see our impotency,<note place="margin">Application.</note>
nay the contrariety of our nature to Gods grace. Where
is our free will to good? In what disposition stands dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to entertaine light, which fights against it? <hi>But yee
were darknesse</hi> (saith the Apostle) not darke or darkned,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note>
but darknesse it selfe. Nay <hi>yee were dead in trespasses and
sinnes (Eph. 2. 5.)</hi> not halfe dead (as the Samaritan) but
whole dead. Now let all the Papists in the world teach
us, how a dead man can dispose and prepare himselfe to
life. And let us know how a privation of it selfe can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
to an habit. 2. To see what neede wee have of
the Ministery to helpe us unto the true Manna. <hi>Moses</hi>
must tell the people <hi>(Exod. 16. 15.) This is the bread
which the Lord hath given you to eate:</hi> So must the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospell acquaint all the Israel of God with
Christ (the true manna) by the word preached; and say,
<hi>This is the bread of life which came downe from heaven,</hi> in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18740:150"/>
whom aloneis full nourishment to eternall life. Nothing
is good to salvation, but by Gods revelation. If the word
preached doe not teach thee Christ (the true manna) thou
never knowst him of thy selfe. Let us pitty and pray for
the lamentable blindnesse, not of Popish recusants only,
but of wilfull and carelesse absenters of themselves from
the house of God; whose Judgement is just if they never
come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. 3. Hath
Christ beene made knowne to thee, that thou hast tasted
the sweetnesse of him in the Gospell? As Christ said to
<hi>Peter,</hi> so I say to thee, <hi>Happy art thou, for flesh and blood
hath not revealed him to thee, but the Father which is in
heaven.</hi>

                  <head>Sect 7.</head>
                  <p>2. Concerning our duty we learn sundry instructions,<note place="margin">Our duties in respect of this Manna.</note>
which may be reduced to sixe heads.</p>
                  <p>I. To get in us an hunger and thirst after Jesus
Christ; in whom alone is full nourishment,<note place="margin">Hunger and thirst for Christ.</note> and without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
whom we are farre more miserable then Israel had been
without manna.<note place="margin">Motives.</note> For 1. Onely this hunger makes us
value him, and see our need of him. It is hunger that is
the best sawce that makes manna sweet; and without
hunger a full belly despiseth an hony combe. It is hunger
that makes the prodigall sonne looke towards home.
2. It is the note of a <hi>blessed man, to hunger and thirst after
righteousnesse, Mat.</hi> 5. 6. And this man will not rest till
he be satisfied. <hi>David</hi> was an happie man in such hungry
desires, when hee desired after God, as the chased Hart
after the waters. This thirst would eate out and thrust
out the thirst after the world; that dropsy thirst after
gold and silver, which is never satisfied: As also the thirst
after the puddlewater of earthly pleasures: And this thirst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
would devoure and consume the thirst after revenge,<note place="margin">Take paines for him.</note> as
<hi>Moses</hi> his rod consumed the rods of the sorcerers.</p>
                  <p>II. To goe out of our tents,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> and take paines to gather
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18740:151"/>
our manna daily, as Israel did theirs. For 1. Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
<hi>labour for this unperishing food, Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. and 2.
<hi>Pet. 1. 10. give all diligence to make your election sure.</hi>
2. It is worth much paines and cost to procure Christ
to our selves and others. In bodily famine how farre
will men runne and ride for corne? <hi>Iacob</hi> sends all his
sonnes out of Canaan into Aegypt for food, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 2.
3. Idlenesse is every where blameworthy, especially in
matters of greatest importance. God might have rained
manna into their laps or mouthes as well as about their
tents, if he had pleased; but would not for the tryall of
their diligence: besides he is well acquainted with our
corruptions, who think that worth nothing which costs
us nothing. Give me leave to apply this to many idle
Christians among us, who have this sweet manna round
about their tents, but will not stir out of doores for it.
If it raine not downe within their owne tents, though it
doe round about, they will not stir out of their tents:
Like idle husbandmen that would have a harvest, but
will not stirre out into the fields to plow, nor sow, nor
reape, unlesse it grew at their owne doores, or in their
owne streets. Alas how lamentable and unanswerable
to God is our high unthankfulnesse; who with lesse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
then the Jewes may gather better food, and have
as expresse a commandement as they; gather every man
of this manna according to his eating. But in stead of
gathering we ingratefully reject it, yea <hi>thrust it off</hi> with
both hands, as the Jewes did, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. Take heed in
time, lest the doome come out against us, as did against
them: <hi>Because you have made your selves unworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, we turne from you to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. As Israel, so must wee daily and diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the times and places of gathering manna. 1. The
place is the wildernesse, not Canaan; and all the while
that they are in the wildernesse they must gather manna:
So we, so long as we are in this world, must gather this
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18740:151"/>
true manna. Many seeme to gather when they be young,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
but are weary and give up when they are elder:<note place="margin">Observe times and places to meet with Christ.</note> But even
the oldest man of the Israelites must gather if he would
eate; hee must starve here that ceaseth to gather. Many
have gathered enough, know as much as the best Preacher
of them all, have strong faith, are sound Christians; and
so was the Church of Laodicea: But be it known to thee,
thou canst scarce gather enough of this manna for the day;
and he that sees his daily weaknesse will conclude with
me, that his faith, hope, love, knowledge, and all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
need daily repairing; and that he hath got but a little
of Christ, that feares to get too much. Againe, the place
of seeking true manna is about the tents of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;
it is confined to the Camps of the true Church;
where two or three are gathered, there is Christ to be
found: his parents found him in the Temple. Therefore
1. it is no marvaile if Christ be not to be met with among
Antichristian Synagogues. If men had learning to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and above the Angels, they should not finde the
truth of Christ but among the tents and congregations
of Christ. No marvaile if an Aegyptian misse of manna
be he never so learned. 2. Let us learne to wait in the
Temple (as the ancient beleevers <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth)</hi>
if we would meet with the consolation of Israel. 2. The
time and season of gathering manna was while it lay on
the ground. We must apprehend the season of grace, that
is, while the Church hath peace make use of the peace of
the Gospell; as the Churches did, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. Little know
wee how soone the sunne of persecution may arise, and
melt away our manna. But Christ may make as pittifull
a complaint over us, (and with weeping eyes) as that
over Jerusalem, <hi>O Ierusalem!</hi> Oh England! if in this thy
day thou knewest the time of thy visitation! Oh how
rich in grace hadst thou beene by knowing this season!<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
but it hath beene (in great part) hid from our eyes.<note place="margin">Apply and feed on Christ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. As Israel must bring home the manna, and bake,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18740:152"/>
and grinde it, and feed upon it; for else what had it beene
better for them that manna had laine about their tents in
never so great abundance, had they not brought it home
and sustained their lives with it? so must every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
specially apply to himselfe Christ crucified, and by the
faithfull application of Christ and all his merits become
one with him, as the meat or bread wee eate becomes
one with our bodies; thus will an hungry Christian doe.
An hungry man is not content with onely comming to
a Cooks shop where meat is; it is not the sight, smell, or
handling of meat which contents him; he must eate and
fill his belly: So it is not a bare comming to the place of
the word and Sacraments (which yet many doe not) to
see, and heare, and taste; but thou must feed by faith, or
starve to death eternall. <hi>Heb. 4. 2. The word they heard was
unprofitable, because not mingled with faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How may I know if I apply Christ crucified
to my selfe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The right application of Christ crucified,<note place="margin">And how this may be.</note>
is not to know that Christ was crucified; but when we
are <hi>crucified with him, Gal.</hi> 2. 19. as Elisha <hi>(2. Kings 4.)</hi>
applyed his eyes, face, and hands to the dead child that it
might quicken. 2. So much as thou truely beleevest,
so much thou eatest of Christ, saith <hi>August:</hi> Looke how
much strength thou gettest by the word, so much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
thou receivest from Christ. And so much as
thou refusest, contemnest, or neglectest that, so much
thou refusest Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> V. We must beware of being weary of this manna.
The Jewes esteemed manna sweet at first,<note place="margin">Be never weary of this Manna.</note> and went out
cheerefully to gather it, yea the Sabbath and all (which
was a prohibited time) so greedy were they of it: but
within a little while (although it retained the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
they waxed weary of it. Wee must take heed of
this ficklenesse in goodnesse, which hath ever bewrayed
it selfe in most forward people. At the first building of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18740:152"/>
the Tabernacle men brought too much, but after tooke
it away as fast againe.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>a burning and shining
light,</hi> and they rejoyced in his light, but it was but <hi>for a
season:</hi> and few shining lights but find it so. The Galatians
at first received <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angell, but soone revolted
from him. What flocking and thronging was there after
Christs doctrine and miracles, that the kingdome of God
suffered violence, but soone they had enough of him, and
in short time did tumult as fast against him? The like
was observed in our owne land; at the first falling of this
manna, and beginnings of the Gospell: men were earnest,
glad, joyfull, forward: then was a sweet time of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
welcome of this Manna; happy was hee could get his
Gomer first and fullest: But now what voices heare wee
other then of the ungracious Israelites? Oh our soules
are dryed up with this manna, here is nothing but manna:
so much preaching, so many Sermons, and it was better
with the world in Aegypt, before all this preaching! And
whereas our fathers would have ridden far to a Sermon,
wee, their lazie off-spring, will scarce steppe over our
thresholds.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider here for our incitement,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> 1. how
hard it is to begin well, but harder to hold out; and not
holding out we lose all our labour. 2. that manna is
as sweet as ever, though wee see not our owne neede;
which if we did see, wee would be no more weary of
Gods word were it daily preached, then wee are of our
bread we daily eate.</p>
                  <p>VI. We must be so far from wearinesse, as that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
must highly esteeme this true Manna,<note place="margin">Prize and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> as the sweetest gift
that ever God gave from heaven, and never forget so
miraculous a mercy. That Israel might not forget Gods
extraordinary mercy in this type, they must for ever
keepe a pot of Manna; which was preserved so long as the
Temple stood for many hundred yeeres. And that wee
might not forget this mercy in the true manna, hee hath
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18740:153"/>
and doth for ever preserve his word preached; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Sacraments in which he perpetually holdeth this
mercy before the eyes of the Church. Let us raise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Gods mercies to our selves, and not forget
lesser favours if we would not forfeit them: But such a
mercy as this is in Jesus Christ the true Manna, let it live
in our hearts, in our memories, sences, affections, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in walking worthy of it; for <hi>thus it becommeth the
just to be thankefull.</hi>

long after they must come into the dry desart of Sin,
where they want both bread and patience; for they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
against God, and exclaime against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
At this time the Lord feeds their bellies, and fills
them with miracles of which Manna was full. Thence at
Gods commandement must they come unto Rephidim,

water, Now contend they as fast with <hi>Moses</hi> for water
as before for bread. And as thirst is the more eager ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
so it ineagers their affections that <hi>Moses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
to God they are ready to kill him. God sees their
rebellion and puts it up; and instead of revenge of their
horrible obstinacy and ingratitude, satisfies their thirst
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18740:153"/>
as miraculously, as formerly hee had done their famine
and hunger.<note place="margin">The fact it selfe.</note> Hee commands <hi>Moses</hi> to take his rod and

               <p>Now wee may not thinke that this fact concerned
onely Israel in the wildernesse, but even all the Church
and Israel of God passing through the wildernesse of this
world:<note place="margin">The thing ours as well as theirs: reasons.</note> And that for these reasons. 1. The Apostle
<hi>(1, Cor. 10. 4.)</hi> calleth it a spirituall rocke, both <hi>for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miraculous in effects, and for being a type of what was
to come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propter miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losum effectum, &amp; propter fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi signum. Aquin.</note> It was both miraculous and significant, and
therefore called spirituall. 2. The same water which
they drank, we also drink, as in the same <hi>Chap.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi>
because in the holy Supper of the Lord, the matter of
our spirituall drink is the same with theirs, and that is
the blood of Christ, resembled by theirs: The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is onely in the maner of drinking. 3. Including
this water of the Rock, the Apostle saith: <hi>they are all
types to admonish us, and are written for vs, vers.</hi> 6. &amp; 11.
4. Most plainly he affirmeth, <hi>vers. 4, and that Rock was
Christ;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non per substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, sed per significantiam.</note> 
                  <hi>not in substance but in signification,</hi> saith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi>
Now wee having as much to doe with Christ as
they, wee must farther enquire into this type. 1. To
parallel it with the truth by comparing them. 2. By
applying it in some fruitfull observations to our selves.</p>
               <p>The Rock was a type of Christ three wayes.<note place="margin">The Rock a type in three respects.</note> 1. As
it was a Rock, 2. As out of it issued water. 3. In the
manner of obtaining.</p>
               <p>I. As a Rock, it elegantly typed out Jesus Christ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
fitly compared to a Rock in five resemblances.<note place="margin">In nature: fiue resemblances.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the despicable appearance: The Rock is in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
dry and barren, the most unlikely thing in all
the world to afford water; so as it was incredible to
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> themselves to fetch water out of a
Rock. If God had commanded them to have beaten
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18740:154"/>
fire out of a flinty rock it had not been so unlikely; but
to distill water out of a flint or rock must be miraculous:
Even so Jesus Christ was (for outward forme and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the world) most unlikely of all men to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
any such waters of grace and salvation. <hi>Isai. 53. 2, 3.
hee was as a dry root, without forme or beauty;</hi> as an hard,
barren, and despised rock, the most abject of men, the
refuse of the world, a worme and no man; of whom
when the Prophets preached, they could finde none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that would beleeve their report.</p>
               <p>2. A Rock for exaltation and advancement. A Rock
is a promontory lifted up above the earth: Such a Rock
was Christ advanced above the earth, yea and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
advanced above all men and creatures: 1. In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and purity: 2. In power and authority: 3. In
place and dignity. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 31, hee that comes from
heaven is above all. His person is above all; for God
hath exalted him, and given him a Name above al names,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. His worke is above all that men and Angels
can comprehend in power and merit. His place is above
all; the head of the Church, eminent above all men and
Angels.</p>
               <p>3. A Rock for firmnesse and stability: Hee is the
strength of Israel; <hi>on this Rock</hi> (as on a sure and firme
foundation) <hi>the whole Church is laid, and the gates of
hell shall not prevaile against it, Matt.</hi> 16. 18. Hence he
is a Rock of defence and safety to his chosen; and every
wise man builds his house on this Rock.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A Rock of scandall and offence to wicked men,
Rom.</hi> 9. 32. Not in himselfe and his nature (for hee is a
precious corner stone) but accidentally and passively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men dash themselves against him; as many, at this
day bark (like doggs) against the wholesome doctrine
of justification by Christ without the works of the Law.
Many loose and formall Gospellers scorne the basenesse
and meannesse of Preachers and true professours of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18740:154"/>
Gospel, because their darknesse can abide no light to
come neere it. To all these and thousands moe, Christ is
a rock of scandall by their owne default.</p>
               <p>5. A Rock for waight, and danger, and inayoidable
judgement upon his adversaries; <hi>which on whomsoever
it falls, it crusheth him all to pieces, Matt.</hi> 21. 44. If any
rise against it, they doe but tire and teare themselves:
but if this Rock rise against any man, and fall upon him,
it breaks him to pouder. Witnesse the greatest enemies
of Jesus Christ which the world ever had, <hi>Herod, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
Iulian, Iews, Pilate;</hi> as unable to rise from under
his revenge, as a man pasht to pieces unable to rise from
under a Rock.</p>
               <p>II. It was a type of Christ, as it sent out water in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
abundance to the people of Israel ready to perish for
thirst.<note place="margin">In respect of the waters issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth.</note> For so Jesus Christ is the onely Rock that sends
from himselfe all the sweet waters of life for the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his elect, otherwise ready to perish eternally.
For explanation whereof, marke</p>
               <p>1. As from that Rock issued waters to wash and
cleanse themselves and their garments:<note place="margin">Three things.</note> so from this
Rock streame waters of ablution or washing; which
serve to wash away both the guilt of sinne, and staine of
sinne. For the former; the precious blood of Christ
streaming out of his side is the onely mundifying water
in the world, to wash the soule from the guilt of sinne,
and to scowre away all the execration of sinne from the
sight of God, 1. <hi>Ioh. 1. 7. the blood of Iesus Christ clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
us from all sinne.</hi> For the latter; from the same
side of Christ our Rock issueth water as well as blood,
even the waters of regeneration, called <hi>(Tit. 3. 5.) the
washing of the new birth,</hi> by the Spirit of grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which daily cleanse the staine and filthinesse of sin.
Of these waters reade, <hi>Ioh. 7. 38. He that beleeveth in me,
out of his belly shall flow riuers of water of life: This hee
spake of the Spirit which he would give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:18740:155"/>
2. As from that rocke issued waters to coole and
comfort Israel in their wearinesse and wandrings: so
from Jesus Christ do issue the waters of refrigeration and
comfort, to coole and refresh the dry and thirsty soule;
to allay the heat of a raging and accusing conscience; and
to revive with new strength the fainting soule in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or persecution. And therefore the tryed traveller
and thirsty passenger is <hi>called to these waters, Mat. 11. 28,
Isa.</hi> 55. 1. For nothing but sound grace from Jesus
Christ can quench the tormenting thirst of an accusing or
distressed conscience.</p>
               <p>3. As from that rocke streamed abundance of waters
to make fruitfull that barren wildernesse wheresoever
they ranne: so onely from the true rock issue plentifull
waters of grace to make our dry and barren hearts fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all workes of righteousnesse: <hi>Isa. 44. 3, 4, I will
poure water upon the thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground;
I will poure my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy
buds; and they shall grow as among the grasse, and as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
by the rivers of waters.</hi> All this blessing of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is from the Rocke. See <hi>Eph</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. In the manner of attaining this water, are
many sweet resemblances.<note place="margin">In the manner of obtaining it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. The people might aske <hi>Moses</hi> water,<note place="margin">5. resemblances.</note> but <hi>Moses</hi>
cannot give it. It is God must give it, and miraculously
fetch it out of a rocke, which how it should be, <hi>Moses</hi>
cannot conceive: So men may seeke justification, and to
drink waters of salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in themselves, either by nature,
as Pelagians, or by merit as Popish justiciaries do, either
in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as the Jews, or in Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
as the fond votaries of the Church of Rome: But no
Jew can tell how to procure any water to himself, neither
can <hi>Moses</hi> give it. By the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> no man can bee
justified, nor by any fond devises beyond the Law. But
God of his grace hath devised a way, and poynted to us
a rocke of living waters, to supply unto us <hi>that which was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18740:155"/>
impossible to Moses Law because of our infirmitie,</hi>
Rom. 8. 3.</p>
               <p>2. The rocke gives water but not till it bee smitten,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 6. so Christ the true rock must be smitten with
passion, he must be smitten with the wrath of his Father,
and made a curse for us, before there can issue out of his
side that bloody streame by which the thirst of beleevers
can be quenched. And as the rocke was smitten twice,
and waters gushed out both times: so Christ was twice
smitten, first actually in himselfe, secondly virtually in
the saith of beleevers of all ages, the faithfull before him,
beleeving in the rock that was to bee smitten and suffer
death for sinne, the faithfull after him, beleeving in the
rock that was smitten, dead, and raised already.</p>
               <p>3. It was the Rod in <hi>Moses</hi> hand that smites and
breakes the rocke: Even so it was the Law given by
<hi>Moses</hi> hand, and our transgression against it that breaks
the true Rock. <hi>Isa. 53. 5. Gal 3. 13. he was made a curse for
us,</hi> and our transgression of the Law was laid upon him
that we might be freed from it. And as this was the same
Rod that smote the River to bring destruction on the
Aegyptians and enemies of the Church: so this same Law
and Rod of <hi>Moses</hi> brings the curse and damnation upon
all the enemies of God from whom it is not remooved
by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>4. The rocke was smitten, but it was not so much the
striking on the rock, but the Lords standing upon it that
gets water for Israel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 6. There was no vertue in
the stroake, but all depended on Gods commandement,
and precept, and presence: even so, it is not the death of
Christ, nor the abundance of price and merit of his
blood, nor the striking on this rock before mens eyes in
the ministery of the word and Sacraments, that can bring
one drop of true water of comfort, but by the presence
and word of Gods blessing. The efficacy of grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
not on any meanes or worke wrought, but it is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18740:156"/>
Gods word and presence that doth all in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Then we may give up the use of all meanes, and
pray at home for grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Not so, for meanes must be used, <hi>Moses</hi> must
speake to the rocke. God appoints no meanes in vaine,
but we must not insist and dwell in them, but looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them to Gods blessing and successe. <hi>Moses</hi> must
use the Rod, though a word without the rod might
have done it: so we must use the meanes as being tyed to
them (though God be not) but not stick in them, seeing,
the abuse of them may make them hurtfull not helpefull.
The people of <hi>Moses</hi> (the Jewes) strooke this rocke,
pearced him with thornes and speares; saw with their
eyes the precious fountaine opened in his side (a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
in which they were beyond all people of the
earth) but partly ignorant what they did, partly malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
treading this precious blood under foot, not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
not beleeving the word: this reall striking of
this rocke was unprofitable, yea and damnable unto
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. The waters of the rock smitten <hi>followed</hi> the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
1. Noting the abundance of water not only for their
present supply,<note place="margin">How the Rock followed the Iewes.</note> but also for future: so in Christ &amp; his blood
is abundant and plentifuil redemption and consolation.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 7.</note>
2. <hi>The rock following them, that is, following or satisfying
their desires.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petra conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>te eos, 1, sequente, vel satisfaciente eorum voluntati. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> It followed them every where, where they
desired; followed their necessities, followed their
desires: So Christ Jesus is to the faithfull heart, all it can
desire. He followes them with all sweet and needfull
desires. He is above all that heart can thinke; alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with us through our wildernesse, especially in most
needfull times.<note place="margin">Veritatem seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem significante. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> 3. It followed them, <hi>in signifying the
truth which was to follow.</hi> It signifyed plainely that Christ
was to follow it as the truth the type; and so it followed
them with instruction and admonition: so Christ the
true Rock followes the Church with instruction. His
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18740:156"/>
whole life, Ministery, miracles, actions, passion, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
was a reall instruction. And now by his Ministery
he followes us with daily directions. 4. It followed
them through the wildernesse even unto Canaan. All the
drynesse of that dry and barren wildernesse could not
dry it up: So the waters of grace streaming from the
Rocke Jesus Christ, follow the beleeving Israel of God
through the wildernesse of the world to the heavenly
Canaan. All the persecutions and parching heats and
droughts in the world can never dry it up. Let all the
wildernesse besides want water, in Israels campe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
Where God begins with a man in sound and
saving grace here, it will carry him into the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
True grace must end in glory.</p>
               <p>Hence arise observations twofold. I. In respect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
God,<note place="margin">Vses in respect of God.</note> to confirme our faith in the assurance of his, 1. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
2. power. 3. mercy to the Church.</p>
               <p>I. His presence.<note place="margin">Christ ever present with his Church.</note> He that before was present in the
Pillar of the cloud and fire for their safety, and in the
manna for their sustenance; is now present in the Rocke
for their satiety in their extreame thirst. The presence
of Christ is all in all to the Church; his presence is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
supply of all wants. His eye is alwaies present, for
although it goe over all the world, yet it is alwaies fixed
on the Church. His eare is present, they cannot call to
<hi>Moses</hi> for bread or water, but he heares and supplyes.
His hand is ever present with and for his Church, and is
not shortned. Himselfe is ever present with his, in life
in death, and after; for good, for grace and glory.</p>
               <p>Onely keepe thou these conditions.<note place="margin">Our dutie by vertue thereof.</note> 1. <hi>Be with him,
2 Chr.</hi> 15. 2, that is, walke with him, as <hi>Henoch.</hi> 2. Keepe
in thy waies, for so long he hath promised his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
presence. 3. Rejoyce in his presence, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his spirit, in the signes and meanes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
And then feare not want, sicknesse, nor <hi>to walke in
the midst of the valley of the shadow of death, for God is with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18740:157"/>
thee, Psa. 23. 4. He will also prepare a table for thee in the
sight of the adversary,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
               <p>II. Here is a testimony of such mighty and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
power in God for his people,<note place="margin">An almighty power in Christ for his Church.</note> that even <hi>Moses</hi>
himselfe staggered, and could scarce conceive a worke
of such power from God. Here is a worke of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
<hi>in cleaving the hard rocke, Psal.</hi> 78. 15. To shew
1. That he is a free worker not tied to second causes; but
at his pleasure can hinder, alter, or change the power of
nature, <hi>Psa.</hi> 115. 3. 2. That he can worke by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and out of most unlikely (yea contrary) meanes,
effect his owne pleasure. <hi>Luk 1. 37, Is any thing impossible
to God?</hi> 3. That we should cast our eyes on this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<hi>Psa. 62. 11, Once have I heard it, yea twice; that power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence learne 1. Not to limit the holy one that
made heaven and earth of nothing.<note place="margin">Our dutie.</note> 2. Faithfully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on this power when we see no meanes of safety or
supply, but all the meanes contrary. For the rocke shall
yeeld water rather then thou shalt want what hee seeth
good for thee. 3. In thy fainting and wearinesse, when
thy weaknesse tells thee thou art not able to goe on in
this wildernesse for want of water of comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
nay art hopelesse in thy selfe or any meanes thou
canst make; now hope above hope, Gods power is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in thy weakenesse; <hi>Sampson</hi> shall get both victory
and water by a jaw-bone, the most unlikely thing in the
world for either. And though this power now worketh
not miracles ordinarily; yet before thou that waitest
on him shalt miscarrie, hee will miraculously sustaine
thee.</p>
               <p>III. Heere is a testimony of Gods admirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
to his people.<note place="margin">Gods mercy to his people, admirable.</note> Israel deserved to be smitten for their
murmuring and rebellion; but the rock is smitten for
them. The rock is not smitten for it selfe, but for Israel.
In stead of a revenging power which they might have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18740:157"/>
expected, they find a gracious power which they could
not expect: Even so all ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>kinde was to be smitten by
the Law; but the Rock must be smitten for us. Our Rock
suffered nothing for his owne sinnes (who was purer in
his nature and actions then all the Angels of God)
but all the stroke he suffered was for the Israel of God,
that they might draw out of this well-head waters of
joy and abundant consolation. The mighty power of
God (which we had deserved to be turned all against
us) is all turned to the salvation of the Church, where
mercy rejoyceth against judgement.</p>
               <p>Thus of God.</p>
               <p>From this Rock and water we are also to observe some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
things concerning <hi>our selves.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vses in respect of our selves. See the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of grace opened.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I. Wee have heere the accomplishment of that
Prophecy, <hi>Zach 13. 1, A fountaine is opened to the house of
David, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem for sinne and for
uncleannesse.</hi> Here we have Christ himselfe the true water
out of the Rock; who onely refresheth dry and weary
soules, and comforteth the fainting heart with the sweet
promises flowing from the Gospell. And that wee may
see the excellency and benefit of this fountaine, we will
a little compare this Rock with the other, and set the
truth above the type, to draw our eyes and desires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
               <p>1. In that rocke,<note place="margin">Farre better then that in the wildernesse: 7. waies.</note> the rocke was one thing, the water
another: here Christ is both the rocke and water, both
the giver, and water given. 2. That rock refreshed wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men and beasts: this is bestowed upon and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
onely beleevers. 3. That rock refreshed bodyes
onely: this both soules and bodies. That preserved natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life: but this torrent preserves the supernaturall life
of grace; so as a leafe withers not, nor falls from a tree of
righteousnesse planted by this river of water, <hi>Psa.</hi> 1. 3.
4. That rock might preserve and comfort the living,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18740:158"/>
but could not helpe a dead man: but this quickneth the
dead soule with new and heavenly life. 5. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that rock quenched natural thirst: but this quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all unnaturall. One drop of it tasted by <hi>Zacheus</hi>
quenched all his unnaturall thirst after the world: and in
<hi>Paul</hi> all the thirst of revenge and furie against the Saints.
6. The rock gave water twice: this rock gives wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of comfort alwaies. The water of that rock follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them a great while, but at length were dryed up: but
the waters of this rock are never dried up. The blood of
CHRIST is alwaies running, and a fresh fountaine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dry. 7 The Israelites dranke of that water, and
were contented for a little while; but by and by did
thirst againe: But <hi>he that drinkes of this water shall never
thirst againe, Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. that is, miserably as they: however
he shall desire it still, yet his very desire is his happinesse
and saciety.</p>
               <p>II. How we are to carry our selves to this rock and
fountaine,<note place="margin">Doe as Israel at the Rock.</note> namely, as Israel to that rock.</p>
               <p>1. The Israelites thirst and call for water,<note place="margin">Thirst for Christ.</note> they see
and feele their need and want: so we must feele our want
of Christ, and get a fervent desire after Christ and his
graces, because onely the <hi>thirsty</hi> are called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. and
onely they in want see the worth of the thing wanting.
Now we may not thinke that every wish after Christ is
this thirst; for the worst can wish a part in Christ: but
this thirst and desire must have three conditions:</p>
               <p>1. It must be fervent and eager as <hi>Sampsons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conditions.</note> 
                  <hi>Give me
water, or I die. Iud. 15. 18. As the chased Hart panteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rivers of water, so doth my soule after thee, Ps.</hi> 42. 1.
2. It must be faithfull. We must not thirst with repining
and diffidence, as the Israelites, but with faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
This drawes vertue from Christ, <hi>According to thy
faith, be it to thee.</hi> 3. It must be constant. The Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
thirst still till they obtaine their desire: so we must
not content our selves with desire, or to come where this
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18740:158"/>
water is and goe without it; but we must never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with our estate (though it be never so well with us
for the world) till we taste the sweet comfort &amp; strength
of Christ and his merits.<note place="margin">Continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ll this thirst: Rules.</note> To continue thy thirst, observe
two rules. 1. So long as God hath any grace to give,
or is not weary of giving, thou must not be weary of
thirsting, begging, asking. 2. So long as thou wantest
any grace, or any measure of grace received, thou must
thirst still<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Ever be desiring one good thing after another,
and one measure of grace after another, till thou beest
compleat; and then shalt thou never give over this thirst
while thou livest here.</p>
               <p>2. Israel thirsty runs to the rock:<note place="margin">Have recourse to Christ.</note> so in thy thirst run
thou to the rock. Dost thou thirst for pardon of sinne, for
grace of sanctification, for sence of Gods love, for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of eternall life? come to this Rock for supply.
Art thou ready to faint in thy soule for want of grace and
comfort, art thou ready to sinke in sorrows, feares, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
wants, dangers? runne to this fountaine which God
hath opened for thee.<note place="margin">Motives.</note> To move thee hereto, consider
1. the rock it selfe calls thee which art thirsty (which
that rock could not doe) <hi>Ioh. 7. 37. If any man thirst, let
him come to me and drinke.</hi> 2. That to runne any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
else, is to forsake the fountaine of living waters,
and dig pits that will hold no water. Let Papists runne
to the puddle waters of their owne merits, or seek other
Mediators or Intercessors: say thou with the Apostles,
<hi>Lord thou hast the words of eternall life, and whither should
we goe?</hi> Let others runne to humane helpes and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in their sorrowes; to cards, dice, merry company, let
them runne to devils and witches, and make them their
rock: Let thy heart say, <hi>The Lord is my Rock: and if
the word were not my comfort, I were sure to sinke in my
trouble.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quench thy thirst and be satisfied.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. Israel comming to the rock, did not onely draw
from thence, but drinke heartily: so we must not onely
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18740:159"/>
come to the place where Christ is preached, but we must
beleeve in him, and specially apply to our selves the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his death. For as drinking is a speciall application
of water to the thirsty body, so by beleeving in Christ
we specially apply the waters of grace to the refreshing
of the soule. To <hi>beleeve</hi> is to drinke this water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 38.
with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. Nothing could quench Israels thirst (being
bodily) but water: and onely faith quencheth our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thirst: And therefore (as they to <hi>Moses)</hi> we must say
to Christ, Lord, give us faith to quench our spirituall
thirst.</p>
               <p>Let these motives provoke us to drinke these waters.<note place="margin">Three motives.</note>
1. As Israel was by drinking that water revived and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
so onely these waters from Christ quicken us
with new life, and coole the heat of raging and accusing
consciences. Every beleever hath true tranquillity of
heart, and joyes of the holy Ghost within him; yea so
plentifully doe these waters of consolation rise from the
Rock,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> that he that drinkes them is said <hi>to have the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God in him, which stands in righteousnesse, peace,
joy, &amp;c.</hi> 2. What madnesse and folly is it to lay about
us so eagerly for this puddle water in comparison, and
catching with all greedinesse at the bitter-sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this life, which prove poyson to the most; and
neglect the sweet and pure streames of saving waters of
grace flowing from the true Rock JESUS CHRIST.
Wee reade what strife and contention was among the
Jewes for wells of spring water; and now no man will
lose a dishfull of well water but he will know to whom:
and shall we onely not care for the water of saving grace,
which cost Christ so deare before he could open the well
of it for us? 3. When the woman of Samaria heard
Christ say, that <hi>he that dranke of this water should thirst no
more: Lord,</hi> faith she, <hi>give mee this water, that I may no
more thirst, nor come hither to draw, Ioh.</hi> 4. 15. So let it stir
up our desires after it also, that wee may get within the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18740:159"/>
well that springeth up to eternall life.</p>
               <p>3. What meanes may we use for the attaining of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of this rock?<note place="margin">Means to get water out of this rock.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Be an Israelite. That rock was smitten
onely for them: This rock is laid in Sion, not in Aegypt.
No Aegyptian, no Canaanite, no Romish Aegyptian that
drinkes of that Popish puddle, no profane worldlings
taste of these waters; swill and draffe is good enough for
such swine. 2. Come to the place. Israel must goe
out of their houses as well to fetch water out of the rock,
as to gather Manna. The place whence the rock sends
water is the <hi>threshold of the Sanctuary, Ezech.</hi> 47. If wee
will not stirre out of our dores, wee may justly starve
3. Avoid letts and hindrances that damme up these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
As,</p>
               <p>1. Ignorance of their worth,<note place="margin">Hindrances.</note> and of thy owne neede;
<hi>Ioh. 4. 10. If thou knewest the gift of God, thou wouldest
have asked, &amp;c.</hi> Good reason thou want it, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
it a thing thou mayst best want. Many among us (like
<hi>Tantalus)</hi> in the midst of water die for thirst. 2. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart, which keepes the soule dry and barren;
and abiding in the naturall hardnesse of a rock, all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this spirituall rock are lost upon it. 3. A quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and grieving of the spirit: this turns the stream ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, that it finds another channell. Greeve not the
spirit, but grieve rather that thy selfe art so strait-necked
a vessell. 4. Secure neglect of meanes. A man that
will be rich followes the meanes: so he that meaneth to
be rich in grace: whereas he that meaneth to die a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
casts up all and makes holy day at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>4. Provide 1. the bucket of faith to draw;<note place="margin">Helpes.</note> for <hi>the
well is deepe,</hi> and without this bucket thou gettest none,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 11. 2. Find a fit vessell to put these waters in:
As 1. a cleane vessell of a pure heart. Who would put
Aquavitae or Balme water in a fusty and stinking bottle?
2. a whole vessell, that it leake not out againe. This
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18740:160"/>
whole vessell is a whole and sincere heart, but broken all
to pieces. No vessel here can hold but a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
heart. <hi>God fils the humble: the haughty and proud are
sent away empty.</hi>

occasion of the disease.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. I.</head>
                  <p>I. The occasion of the disease was the peccant humor
of ingratitude and murmuring against the grace of God
miraculously manifested in the wildernesse.<note place="margin">The occasion of it.</note> Never had
any people upon the face of the earth the like mercies
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18740:160"/>
from God, the like experience of God. Never any fed
and feasted with so many miracles as it were in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
They have water following them every where out
of a rock. They have read from heaven, delicate even to
a miracle; but this Angels food is too light, and no bread
will serve them but from earth. God gave them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it for the gathering; he rained it most bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
round about their tents: but their unthankfull souls
loathe it, and tread it under foot. And therefore rising up
against God and tempting him they were destroyed of
Serpents. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
                  <p>Note here by the way 1. The Justice of God.<note place="margin">Which leadeth to Gods justice.</note> Hee
that brought Manna from heaven to feed them, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

to revenge and destroy them. <hi>Rom. 2. 4. 5. The despising
of Gods bountifulnesse,</hi> treasureth up wrath. See the same
Justice on our selves. How lightly did wee in our first
parents regard that upheaped measure of bounty and
grace conferred by God in our Creation and innoceny?
And how justly were we stung to death by the old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for it? The unthankfull person is the greatest rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that is. 2. See the equity of this Justice on the
Israelites.<note place="margin">And the equity of it.</note> They not contented to murmur against the
Lord, set also upon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> his servants, <hi>Why
have ye brought us into the wildernesse to die?</hi> Now their
punishment is answerable to their sinne. They trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
in hot and fiery tongues, and are punished by hot
and fiery stings. Venemous words against God and his
servants are revenged by the mouthes of poysoned and
venemous serpents. Doe thou at thy perill sting God and
his servants with bitter words, God will have some
serpent or other to sting thee. I am out of doubt that
many great plagues have lingred and doe, amongst us in
this land for the poysoned and reviling speeches cast
against God and his servants every where. We sting his
holy profession and servants incessantly, and he stings us
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18740:161"/>
with the scorpions of his Judgements:<note place="margin">And teacheth, not to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of manna.</note> 3. Beware of
being weary of manna. Never did man complaine of
plenty of manna, but was justly stung with want of it.
Doe thou complaine without cause, and thou shalt have
cause to complaine. Israel that complaines of too much
manna, shall shortly change their note and cry out of too
many serpents.</p>
                  <p>II. The kind of the disease.<note place="margin">The kind of it. Why serpents.</note> The Lord sent fiery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
to sting them. Where 1. why serpents? 2. why
fiery? 3. why stinging?</p>
                  <p>1. This disease by serpents lively resembles our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
of soule, which is no other then the fiery sting of
<hi>the old serpent,</hi> which is the devill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. Our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
disease is hence noted to come from that old serpent
at first.<note place="margin">The devill so termed, why.</note> Now satan is aptly compared to a serpent in five
respects: First, because he covered himselfe with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
when he first stung and deceived mankind. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he is more subtle then any serpent; crafty to insinuate
and deceive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. 14. Thirdly, as a serpent dwels
and lies among thornes, bushes, bryars, and feeds upon
dust: so the devill raignes in the thickets and bushes of
worldly cares and lusts, and feeds upon worldlings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
his chiefe power against them. Fourthly, as a
serpent casts out of his mouth venime and poyson: so
the devill casts out nothing but virulent words against
God and his Saints, and spewes out after the Church a
flood of poyson to drowne her. How hee blasphemed
<hi>Iob,</hi> how he is the accuser of the brethren, how of the
head Christ himselfe, the Scripture declares. Fiftly, as a
serpent is cursed above all beasts, so is the devill. The
first cursed creature in the world was this serpent and
hath ever since remained the cursed head of all cursed
rebells and wicked ones, to whose custody and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
they shall all be gathered in the last day. <hi>Mat.
25.</hi> 41. goe ye cursed, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Why called fiery serpents?<note place="margin">Why fiery serpents.</note> 
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. From
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18740:161"/>
their colour. Through abundance of poison they had a
shining and glistring skinne,<note place="margin">Why fiery serpents.</note> and they seemed as if they
had been made of fire. A resemblance wee have in our
snakes, that seeme to shine and sparkle against the Sunne.
2. From their effect. For with their sting they infused
such poison into the bodies of the Israelites, as stirred up
in them an outragious heat and fire. Now these diseases
are most painfull, and so tormentfull as if a wild-fire
were in the bowels, feeding upon the bones, marrow,
and members. 3. From their end. First because they
were appointed by God, and after a sort inflamed and
kindled with desire of revenge of the Lords wrongs;
and they so fiercely assaulted the Israelites, as if a raging
and devouring fire had seased upon them, which no
way they could avoid. Secondly, that in their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they might bee admonished, both what a fearefull
fire of Gods wrath they had kindled by their sin against
themselves; as also that they had deserved a more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fire in hell to seize upon their whole man everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly.</p>
                  <p>3. Why stinging serpents?<note place="margin">Why stinging serpents.</note> 
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To imply unto
us. First, that sinne is the sting of this old serpent; even
a poisoned sting that hee hath thrust into all mankind.
But with this difference; in that this poison is farre
more generall, and the wounds infinitely more mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
then were those of the fiery serpents. For, 1. They
stung a few Israelites, but not all; but this serpent hath
stung all mankind, none excepted. 2. They stung the
bodies onely; but these, soules and bodies also. 3. They
stung one part of the body; this serpent all parts, and
whole man. 4. They to a temporall death, this to an
eternall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to imply that sinne is the sting of a fiery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
1. Set on fire with wrath and cruelty, and desire
to poison and destroy us,<note place="margin">Temptations called fiery darts, why.</note> 
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 17. 2. Setting on
us with <hi>fiery darts.</hi> For so his temptations are called
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18740:162"/>
                     <hi>(Ephes. 6. 16.)</hi> for three reasons. 1. From the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and custome of souldiers in times past which cast
poisoned darts, the poison of which inflamed the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
bodies, and made the wounds incurable. As now
many out of desperate malice poison their weapons and
bullets to make sure with their enemy: So doth Satan
by all meanes poison his darts to speed the Christians
soule. 2. Because as fiery darts they inflame and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the heart all manner of burning lusts and sinnes,
one of them being but as a sparke or firebrand to kindle
another. 3. Because they leave for most part a caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
and seared conscience behind them, as if they were
burnt with an hot iron, which makes the sinner stung
senslesse of his wound. Whence is another miserable
difference betweene the stung Israelite, and the stung
sinner. The former was alwayes felt with griefe and
paine: but this often not felt, and so more desperate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the effect of this stinging was death in many:<note place="margin">The mortall effect of it.</note>
And so the effect of sinne is death in all. The stung Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite
had death in his bosome, and no other could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
so the guilty sinner is stung to death. In his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is every man the sonne of death, and can expect
nothing but death every moment. And as the stung per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the wildernesse had no meanes in himselfe nor
from others, to avoid either the serpent or death from it,
till God appointed them the brazen serpent: So the
poore sinner was destitute of all helpe in himselfe and
others, till the Lord appointed Jesus Christ the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
seed, to breake the serpents head. <hi>There is given no
name else, whereby we must be saved, Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>First note hence,<note place="margin">Observations</note> how deceitfull are the pleasures of
sinne. It is as a sweet poison: <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 12. sweet in the
mouth, but poison in the bowels. What wise man would
drink a draught of poison for the sweet taste of it? Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men hold sinne as a sweet morsell: but sower sauce
followes it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:18740:162"/>
Secondly, what little cause we have to love our sinnes:
for that is to love our owne bane. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 35. Hee that
sinneth against mee, <hi>hurteth his owne soule;</hi> and all that
hate mee, <hi>loue death.</hi> No sinne but the more pleasing,
the more poisoning; the more delicate, the more deadly.
Sinne never so much disguised, never the lesse deadly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that sinners are but <hi>dead</hi> men <hi>while they live,
1. Tim.</hi> 5. 6. An Israelite stung was but a dead man: So
although the reasonable soule in a sinner makes him a
man, yet the want of the Spirit of grace makes him a
dead man. Death waits upon sinne as the wages on the
worke; and hell upon death that comes before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A foole hee is that makes a mocke of sinne.
Who would play with a deadly serpent, or make a jest
of his owne death? or drink up the poison of a serpent
in merriment? or cast darts &amp; firebrands about him to
burne himselfe and others, and say, Am I not in sport?
See <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 18. and 10. 23. and 14. 9. Oh that wee
could discerne our wounds, as sensibly as we are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stung! It would make us runne to God, and get <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to goe to God for us, and pray that these serpents and
painfull wounds might be removed. If wee saw death
as present and as ghastly in our sins as Israel did in their
stinging, we would hasten our repentance, and seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meanes of cure.</p>

                  <p>1. The appointing hath,<note place="margin">God appoints the meanes of health to soule and body.</note> First the person appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which was God himselfe, who devised it and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it to <hi>Moses,</hi> for God will save onely in his owne

meanes. So <hi>God</hi> himselfe <hi>so loved the world</hi> that hee
gave his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. This way
of remedy and cure could bee no devise of man nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
For, 1. The Angels stand still admiring and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at it, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. 2. Men without a superiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
cannot conceive it, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. much lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the thing appointed, a serpent of brasse,
resembling Christ in the matter and the forme.</p>
                  <p>1. The matter was of brasse,<note place="margin">A brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, not gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: five reasons.</note> not gold, for five rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
1. God ties not himselfe to the excellency of
meanes, but by weake and unlikely meanes effects his
great works: And therefore that which had no power
of cure in it selfe must cure and heale, that the worke
may be knowen to be his and not the meanes. 2. The
lower and baser the meanes are, the better may the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
be led through them, and so beyond them. It was
not the will of God that they should rest in the brazen
serpent, which had no power of cure; but through it
bee led by faith vnto the Messiah, who onely could cure
them. 3. Though it was of brasse, yet it was strong:
and signified Jesus Christ, how weake soever in mens
eyes; yet was hee, first the mighty and strong God, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
powerfull and able to deliver his people, thirdly
most invincible and potent also against all his enemies,
he is a wall of brasse, and his strength is as the strength
of brasse, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 15. 4. Being of brasse as it was
strong so was it shining and bright: signifying Christ in
respect of his divine and eternall generation, truely shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and glorious.<note place="margin">Ipsum <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap> gloriae Dei.</note> Hee was the brightnesse of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. the very brightnesse of the glory of God;
excelling all the Angels in heaven, in their clearest glory
and brightnesse, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 16. 5. As that serpent so
shined that the Israelites might look upon it, and their
eyes not dazled: so this great glory was so vailed by his
flesh and humility as we the Israel of God might behold
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18740:163"/>
it, yea approch it, and fetch our salvation and happinesse
from it.</p>
                  <p>2. It resembled Christ in the forme;<note place="margin">Serpents forme notes Christ: how.</note> for the forme
was of a serpent. First a serpent is of an hatefull and
contemptible shape and appearance: so was Christ in
his owne habite, <hi>Isai. 53. a despised man, a worme rather
then a man;</hi> men saw <hi>no beauty</hi> in him, but hid their
eyes. Secondly, the serpent was accursed of God: So
Christ lay under the curse of sinne for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.
Thirdly, that was but like a serpent; in the forme of a
serpent, not a serpent; it had onely the shape not the
life, sting, nor poison of a serpent: So Jesus Christ was
the similitude of sinfull flesh, but no sinner. No venim
or poison of sinne was found in him, neither in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor actions. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. hee was in the similitude of
<hi>sinfull flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> as that of a serpent, but without all sting or
spot of sinne.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the appointment is the end or use
of the serpent.<note place="margin">End and use of it: what to us.</note> It must bee lift up upon a pearch that all
Israel might see it. Which plainly noteth both the kind
of death which Christ must suffer, as also the proper end
and vertue of it: as in these particulars. 1. Both
must bee <hi>lifted up:</hi> So Christs crucifying is called an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
from the earth, Ioh.</hi> 12. 32. 2. Both must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
upon <hi>wood;</hi> the Pole a type of the Crosse of Christ.
3. Both among the Jews; out of the Church is no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
4. Both to be looked upon; one with the eye
of the body, the other with the eye of faith. 5. Both
to recover health and life; one of body, the other of
soule; one frees from corporall death, the other from
spirituall and eternall.</p>
                  <p>II. The applying of this remedy was nothing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the looking upon the brazen serpent: which signified
the sinners beholding of Jesus Christ for his cure.<note place="margin">Application of the remedy.</note> The
meanes of application of the remedy was the eye of the
Israelite: So the instrument of applying the remedy by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18740:164"/>
Jesus Christ, is the eye of faith, which is the eye of the
soule. So our Saviour Christ himselfe expoundeth it
<hi>(Ioh. 3.) As the brasen Serpent was lift up; so shall the son of
man, that whosoever beleeveth in him &amp;c.</hi> That which
<hi>Moses</hi> calls looking on the type, Christ calls beleeving
in himselfe the truth. Which if the Lord had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to expresse, he could as easily have remooved the
Serpents, as appointed the making of another; and as
easily have healed them by his word, as by this signe: but
hereby affords them a double mercy and cure, one of the
body by the signe, another of their soules by the thing
and truth thereby signifyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> III. From this application followes a saving effect.
The Israelite by looking lived,<note place="margin">The saving effect.</note> and received present ease,
with freedome from paine and poyson: So the beleever
looking on Christ by the eye of faith, hath an heavenly
life restored; present ease from the paine of a guilty and
accusing conscience; freedome from the poyson of sinne
both the guilt and staine of it.</p>
                  <p>But herein the <hi>truth</hi> is advanced above the <hi>type.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">By Christ farre more excellent.</note>
1. That brazen Serpent had not power in it selfe to cure;

this brasen Serpent, now a remedy against poyson,

                  <p>I. Note What weake,<note place="margin">Observation 1. God helps his people by weak, unlikely, and contrary meanes.</note> and contrary
meanes the Lord useth, to effect great things for his
Church, and in his Church. Was there any sence or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be conceived in all this counsell and ordinance of
God in healing thus his people? 1. Could a Serpent of
brasse, a shape only more heale then hurt them? 2. Could
a dead Serpent prevaile against so many living and fiery
Serpents? 3. Shall not this shape and image of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
be so much as touched or applyed to the wound;
but the sight of it onely a farre off cure a mortall wound
really inflicted? How inconceivable is this to humane
reason which perhaps would count it foolish and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous?
But the Lord (though he might by many other
more mighty and likely meanes) will by no other meanes
effect their deliverance. He that brought in the Serpents
could as easily have remooved them; if not that, yet he
might have hindered them from biting them; or hee
might powerfully of the same poyson have made a
remedy: but he chooseth most unlikely meanes.</p>

                  <p>When God was by <hi>Ioshua</hi> to demolish the mighty

                  <p>When God sends <hi>Gideon</hi> against an huge army of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites

he would have furnished them with armour of proofe

                  <p>When God is to foyle that mighty Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> a

                  <p>These instances in stead of many may serve to shew

                  <p>This doctrine may be fruitfully applyed to our present
times,<note place="margin">Vsefull to us in these times.</note> in which wee see such tumults raysed against the
Church; such insolencies of the enemy, such hopes, yea &amp;
triumphs before victory. If God give his Church a
check, and his people receive a foyle; oh how the enemy
laughs, and boasts, and blasphemes as if all were theirs!
But let us rayse our faith and confidence in considering
these grounds.</p>

                  <p>2. Gods word and promise for the present causes of
the Church shall be accomplished either with meanes
or without them, yea against them. God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,

24. Ioh.</hi> 9. 6, Christ to cure a blinde man tempered <hi>clay
and spittle</hi> together, and applyed it to his eyes, and bids
him goe to Siloe: A remedie likelier to put out a mans
eyes then to recover sight. There was no reason in the
earth of the remedy, but onely to try whether the blinde
man did constantly beleeve. Yet if the blinde man had
not wholly resigned himselfe to Christ, and shut up his
owne reason; had not he acknowledged Christ able to
do what hee would by what hee would; and to bee the
same God who at first put all sences into a piece of clay,
and now by a piece of clay would recover his sence,
he had never seene, but remained blinde still.</p>
                  <p>So every naturall man, borne as blinde as he in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, till he wholly submit himselfe, and subdue
his reason to the meanes appointed, shall never see any
thing to salvation, but abide in naturall blindnesse still.
What hope hath he to be taught by the spirit, that must
give lawes to the Spirit of God? or what a short met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, &amp; 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14?</hi> Why else did these Jewes

at this day unremooved. And why was Christ foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the Graecian, but that reason would not yeeld,
that life should be fetched out of death, or salvation to
be sought in curse and malediction.</p>
                  <p>2. Hee that shuts not the eye of reason can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
faith.<note place="margin">2. Faith: as in six particulars.</note> There bee sixe things which a man cannot

                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:18740:167"/>
First, he cannot beleeve the word of God, nor depend
upon but scorne the ordinances of God in the word
preached, and Sacraments administred, which is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
word. Reason unrenewed cares not for this <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse
of preaching, 1. Cor</hi> 1. 21. And to a carnall man
the threatnings of God are like <hi>Lots</hi> warning to his
kinsmen; he was as one that mocked or jested. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to a carnall heart, is as tastelesse as the white of an
egge. The wiser men are, the further off they are from
beleeving in a crucified God, or conceiving that by the
foolishnesse of preaching God will save such as beleeve.
Flesh and blood reveileth nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee cannot beleeve the maine promises of
God, which cannot bee comprehended but by the eye of
faith, and not by that till the eye of reason bee shut up.
God hath promised his presence, favour and love with
his children: how can reason conceive the truth of this
promise, seeing them in hunger, thirst, wants; hearing
them reviled, slandered, disgraced; observing them
cast out of companies, and societies as refuse and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweeping;
that were their hopes here onely, they were
of all men most miserable? Reason will not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that God can send us by hell to heaven, yet that
is his promise.<note place="margin">Matt. 27. 46.</note> Humane reason will never pray, <hi>My
God my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?</hi> How could
<hi>Abraham</hi> have beleeved the promise of a sonne by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
had he looked to naturall reason?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he cannot beleeve the maine Articles of faith,
that hath not resigned up his reason. <hi>Example.</hi> Reason
will not beleeve an happy resurrection, seeing the body
raked up in dust and corruption, but denies this Article.
Reason cannot conceive or beleeve an eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it sees it not given but to dead men. It cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how the Sonne of God should become the son
of man, or that this Sonne of man was borne of a virgin
without man. And so of the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:18740:168"/>
Fourthly, he cannot beleeve the miracles of Scripture
for confirmation of Gods truth and our faith. Naturall
reason cannot beleeve that the Sunne ever stood still, as
in Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>eah, much lesse went back ten degrees, as in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi>
time, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20. 11. Or that fire should descend
which naturally ascendeth, and feed upon water contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to nature, as at <hi>Elias</hi> prayer, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 39. Or that
fire should raine downe (as on Sodome) which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to water. Or that fire should not burne the three
children: Or that water should stand as a wall (as in
the Red sea, and in the river Jordan) whose property is
to be fluid.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, he cannot beleeve the worke of creation, if he
will beleeve reason; the universall consent of which is,
That of nothing, nothing can bee made; and not any
thing (much lesse all things) out of nothing. To reason
therefore it will be incredible that there should be light
before the Sunne, or fruits before any raine, as in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Heb. 11. 3. By faith</hi> wee know (not by reason)
that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so
that things which are seene were not made of things
which doe appeere.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, he cannot beleeve the great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For, naturall reason thinks it unreasonable, that the
life of the Church can bee fetched out of the death of
Christ. That a man can be justified by the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of another, and yet there dwell so many sinnes
in him. Reason will not beleeve that one man can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
life by anothers death: no more then one man can
live by anothers soule, or be wise by anothers learning,
or be cured and brought to health by anothers disease.</p>
                  <p>3. So long as the eye of reason is open, a man shall
never attaine sound obedience unto God.<note place="margin">3. Obedience which God will accept.</note> For much of
that obedience required at our hands is cleane against cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature: As the whole doctrine of repentance, of
mortification, or watchfull and carefull conversation, of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18740:168"/>
restraining our selves in unlawfull liberties, yea and in
lawfull; all crosses reason. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> ever sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his sonne, had he consulted with reason? Had <hi>Paul</hi>
ever joyned to the disciples to preach that doctrine
which hee had persecuted, had hee consulted with flesh
and blood, <hi>Gal. 1. 16?</hi> What other reason can bee given
that the word powerfully preached is so generally fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
but that men think they have reason not to obey it,
at least not in all things? They see no reason to bee so
precise; nor is there any wisdome to bee so forward.
Reason tells them they see few great men so strict, and
but a few despised men are so earnest.</p>
                  <p>4. Hee shall never attaine heaven.<note place="margin">4. Heaven and the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 50.
Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdome of heaven;
neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> By flesh and
blood is meant the vitiate and corrupt estate of man; or
flesh and blood severed from the spirit and grace of
God; or the man unregenerate having onely flesh and
blood. So <hi>Matt. 16. 17. Blessed art thou Simon Ionas,
for flesh and blood hath not reveiled it unto thee, but my
Father.</hi> So as here is not required an abolition of flesh
and blood in the being and substance of it, but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of new qualities. As in Christs transfiguration
was not an extinction of his body, but an accesse of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
glory; without which change none can get to
heaven. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. Except a man be borne againe, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the kingdome of God. The Apostle adds the
reason, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flesh and blood in it selfe is corrupted, and so not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that kingdome. Therefore to come to heaven
thou must bee changed in thy will, reason, wisedome
and all.</p>

Why are many wholesome doctrines daily
distasted and quarelled against by our witty men; but
that they think they have better reason to do as they do,
then any that we can bring out of Gods booke? Why
else doe so many fall back to Popery and idolatry, but
because they cast off the teaching of the Spirit, and give
themselves to another teacher agreeing with naturall
corruption and reason? If a man were to bee led onely
by reason, and it were lawfull to cast off religion, I
would choose to bee a Papist, by which doctrine it is
lawfull to be every thing but a sound Christian. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Abraham</hi> left his owne countrey, and went hee
knew not whither at Gods commandment. One would
have thought that this had been folly in him, but that the
Scripture acquits him, and saith, hee did it by faith, <hi>Heb.
11.</hi> 8. And in a more difficult commandement hee rose
early to slay his sonne, not reasoning the case with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
nor with <hi>Sarah,</hi> nor his sonne, nor his servants.
The disciples when Christ bade them leave all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <p>Here let us consider:<note place="margin">Motives.</note> 1. How reasoning with flesh
resists the commandement. 2. <hi>King. 5. 12. Naaman</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

2. To follow reason is to follow a crooked rule. But
admit it were straight, yet is it defective and too short
for mysteries above reason. And if it were straight, and
large enough, yet it is a party, and so unfit to be a Judge in

reade much of the blinde obedience of Papists in their
works to their rules and Superiours, of things scarce
credible, but that themselves have published them in
writing. One <hi>Masseus</hi> a Franciscan tumbled himselfe
in the dust and crawled like a childe, because St. <hi>Francis</hi>
said they could not bee converted unlesse they were as
little children. Another of our Countrey called <hi>Throk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
even in the Article of death, was so dutifull to
his Superiour, as he would not die without his leave as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
as <hi>Everard</hi> a Papist writeth in his commendation.
Another called <hi>Barcen</hi> (as <hi>Diego</hi> a great Jesuit relates)
was so humble and dutifull, that when the Devill appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him; hee ranne to meet him, and prayed him to
sit downe in his chaire, because hee was more worthy
then himselfe. The Jesuits are so formed to obedience
by <hi>Ignatius</hi> his rules, that whatsoever service they are
set upon by their Superiour (suppose it never so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous)
they must fly upon it without question asked.
So as if one of them were talking with an Angel, if his
Superiour call him, he must instantly come away. Yea if
the blessed Virgin vouchsafe her presence to one of the
brethren, if his Superiour call him, hee must presently
break away from her and obey him: as he writes to the
brethren of Lusitania, and a thousand such. To what
end name I these follies, but by Popish and wicked su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Surely because it is a devise of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
upholding humane reason, and upheld by corrupt
reason which first set it up. See it in parts, and in
whole.</p>
                  <p>First for the parts.<note place="margin">Proved in parts</note> 1. Seemes it not good reason to
choose, defend, and stick unto our forefathers religion?
for so the old Idolaters thought: <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 17, they would
still sacrifice to the Queene of heaven, because <hi>their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did so.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> would not consult with flesh and
blood in matter of religion; nor <hi>Abraham</hi> with human
reason: This their reason also is as absurd in true reason,
as if a sonne were bound to put out his eyes because his
father was blind; or never to enjoy liberty, because his
father was in prison or dyed in a dungeon. 2. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of merit, and justification by works runnes with
nature, as <hi>(Luk. 18. 18.)</hi> in the young Pharisee, Master
what good thing  for faine would it finde some
goodnes in it selfe to demerit God: Whereas the second
Commandement saith, God shewes mercy to thousands
in them that love him, and keepe his Commandements.
The Lords prayer also teacheth us to pray for daily bread.
A likely thing that he can merit life eternall, that cannot
merit a crumme of bread. 3. The Intercession of Saints
and worshipping Images stands onely on the legs of
humane reason against divine wisdome. Carnall men
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18740:171"/>
would see their god, and turne his glory into the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a calfe, or other creature. And is it no reason we
should have Mediators? For why should every rude
fellow thrust into the Kings presence, and not first make
way by some of his Court? But divine wisdome saith,
there is but one Mediator, and that we must come to the
King by the Prince onely; and it is high treason to come
by any other. 4. Carnall reason teacheth that every
man is full of doubting, and therefore no man can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
beleeve the remission of sins, or be assured of his
owne salvation. But divine reason teacheth us that this
doubting destroyes not faith, but exerciseth it; and in
our Creed we beleeve remission of sinnes, and eternall
life; which is more then to beleeve in generall as devils
doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">And in the whole.</note> for the whole doctrine and religion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
how plausible is it to the naturall man? For,
1. What easier faith then to beleeve as the Church doth,
no matter what; without any knowledge or faith of
their owne? How at one blow cut they off all paynes in
getting assurance, holding or increasing of faith? 2. What
an easie principle is it, that to be ignorant is to be devout;
and that it is vaine labour which is spent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
as <hi>Hosius</hi> saith; and that they are the bookes of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and they hereticks that read them. What need
we be at any paines to read, study, and meditate in the
booke of God night and day, as the Saints have done?
How was the holy Ghost deceived, yea and holy men
who have studied in Gods Law night and day? 3. How
pleasing is it to nature, to deny it to bee so corrupt as it
is; to say, it is but halfe dead, and being a little helped can
keepe the Law, and come out of Gods debt? whereas
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. &amp; 5, what can a dead man doe but rot? 4. How
pleaseth it nature to offer release from sinne, from hell,
from purgatory for money? Who would not whore,
sweare, prophane the Sabbath, resist Magistracy, riot &amp;c.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18740:171"/>
if for a little money he may have licence? What hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
would not give thousands of rammes, yea the first
borne of his body for the sinne of his soule, <hi>Mic. 6. 7?</hi>
5. Whereas the word laies a continuall care of keeping
the heart and thoughts, how doth that doctrine please
nature, that unlooseth it from this care, that requires no
paine to keepe the heart, or to keepe out the first motions
of sinne: which, they say, is no sinne? Which makes many
sinnes veniall in their nature, put away with a light sigh,
a knock on the brest, or an <hi>Ave Mary:</hi> that a man may
lye in sport, or officiously by equivocation, that to steale
a small thing is but a veniall sinne? <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, a foole
makes a mock of sinne. To conclude, that must be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and sensuall religion, which any thing but Gods word
sets up, and holds up, but this is neither set up, nor held
up by it, for where Gods word comes, downe goes Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
It could never abide the breath of Gods mouth
which blasts and destroyes it.</p>
                  <p>5. Where doctrine is truely taught and beleeved,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
naturall reason rayseth strong ramparts against the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of it.<note place="margin">Natural reason an enemie to the power of godlinesse.</note> For else why doe many Protestants <hi>walke after
the lusts of their hearts,</hi> as the Gentiles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they captivate the Commandement to their owne
reason, and limit and confine the wisdome of God
within the bounds of their owne carnall wisdome?
1. Our Gentry have reason to say,<note place="margin">Instances. 1.</note> that the word in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
is the rule of good life, but bring this rule close
home unto them to reforme their fashions, to leave their
strange apparrell and painting; their vaine discourses,
their idle complements, their gaming, their service of
pleasure, and unfruitfull spending of their time: Oh now
they have reason to scorne and chafe against the rule and
him that holds it before them. What reason he should
be so strict, lesse reason they should be as strict as he?
They know how to put on their clothes, how to behave
themselves every where; and are wiser then to follow
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18740:172"/>
such rules as would make them as despised as himselfe
is. Alas that the wisdome of God shall be a rule onely
for our judgements; but reason must guide our practise!
2. Ordinary hearers thinke they have reason to professe
religion so farre as they may thrive by it, and prosper in
the world; whose godlinesse is gaine: To trust God so
farre as they see him in some sort, else not: To favour
religion and religious persons when times do; else not.
To avoid pernicious and dangerous sinnes which law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth,
as murder, adultery, theft; but not covetousnesse,
not usury, not swearing, not uncleane lusts. <hi>Herod</hi> will
not part with his <hi>Herodias. Ahab</hi> hath no reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<hi>Micah</hi> when he prophecies evill to him. 3. Trades
men, oppresse, cosen, lye, deceive, &amp;c, because they have
reason to make the best of their owne. What reason
but they may serve a Customer upon the Sabbath, so
they come to Church? They have reason to slip all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of grace all the weeke, because they must
walke diligently in their callings the sixe dayes. Thus
reason steps in, and thrusts aside the practise of that
which men in judgement hold not for good and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
and like <hi>Evah</hi> still longing after forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the second observation.</p>

                     <hi>venenum, quod per venas eat.</hi> And as the vaynes and blood
runne through every part of the body, so sinne through
every part of the man. Secondly, as poyson never rests
till it come to the heart, and there strikes and corrupts
the fountaine of life: So our sinne hath mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our very hearts, and strikes at the life of grace in the
soule. Thirdly, as poyson inflames the party with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
thirst, having overcome naturall moysture, and
eaten up the spirits: so sinne in the soule workes an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
defect, and dryes up all waters of grace, and makes
the sinner insatiable in drinking up iniquity like water.
Fourthly, as poyson not prevented brings speedy and
certaine death, but not without extreame paine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
torture: so the poyson of sinne unconquered
brings certaine and eternall death, attended with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of conscience, desperate feares, and torments most
exquisite. Thus must we labour to feele the sting of our
sin in all parts far more mortall then the most venemous
stings of most direfull Serpents.</p>

wounded will seeke to God, to his word and Ministers;
for it knowes that God woundeth and healeth. The feet
of him that brings good tidings are beautifull to an
humbled heart, even as an experienced Physitian to a
sicke party, who else were sure to be lost, for want of

                  <p>A marveilous thing then that of so many thousands
stung so deadly, so few are sensible; that so few trouble
<hi>Moses</hi> or the Ministers with questions concerning their

by faith, in touch of sinne and sence of paine (like a Doe

ease. Some with <hi>Asa</hi> send to the Physitian to purge away
melancholy. Some with <hi>Saul</hi> send for musick, esteeming
soules sicknesse but a sottish lumpishnesse. Some runne
into the house of laughter and wicked playhouses to see
and heare the Lords <hi>Sampsons</hi> and worthies derided, not
without haynous blasphemy. Others fall a building with
<hi>Cain,</hi> or set upon other imployments, perhaps it is but an
idle fancy. Some runne perhaps to the Witch of Endor,
in the meane time send away <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Felix,</hi> or runne

have none but from God and his word: had not thy

will not so lose his time, nor dwell in toyes and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
to thrust out things more profitable. A wise
heart will not for a shadow forgoe the substance; but
will be much in that question of the young man, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. what
may I doe to inherit eternall life? what may I doe to
be saved? what may I doe to be rid of this Serpent, and
of that; of this sinne and of that? How may I doe to get
mastery of my corruptions? In going to Gods Ministers
let thy errand bee the same with the Israelites in their
going to <hi>Moses;</hi> how to be rid of the Serpents.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Moses</hi> directs them to the brazen Serpent erected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
for their cure; for <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe cannot helpe them.<note place="margin">Go wholly out of thy selfe, and all creatures.</note>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:18740:174"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> law cannot cure them; that rather sharpens the
sting, and thrusts it deeper into the flesh and spirit. He
directs them to no merits or works of their owne to
cure them; for their merits brought in those poysoned
stings among them; but he sends them quite out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Gods ordinance, which was the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Thou art never in the way of cure, till thou art sent
out of thy selfe; out of the Law and works of it, which
now cannot justifie; till thou commest to the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
brazen Serpent, there is no hope of cure. As the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite
could never be cured till hee acknowledged the
brazen Serpent the onely meanes: so no more canst thou
till thou acknowledge JESUS CHRIST the onely
healing God; and that there is no other name in heaven
or earth to be saved by, but the name JESUS. <hi>Onely
Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">I. Lambert.</note> 
                     <hi>onely Christ,</hi> said that Martyr: for he onely can
give a perfect righteousnesse: he onely can cover our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection:
hee onely being no sinner, could conquer
sinne: he onely by dying could conquer death: he onely
by entring into the grave could sweeten it: he onely by
sustaining the sorrowes of hell could shut hell for all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.
Had <hi>Moses</hi> sent the Israelites any whither but
to the brazen Serpent, he had deluded them, and they had
lost all their labour.</p>
                  <p>Who now is so void of judgement that cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
whether our religion or the Roman be the ancient
and true religion of <hi>Moses</hi> and the people of God: If
a man stung with the serpent come to us for counsell and
cure as they to <hi>Moses;</hi> we send him (as <hi>Moses)</hi> out of
himselfe to Christ onely, the true brazen Serpent. Our
doctrine leads him out of himselfe, out of his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
out of externall works and ceremonies unto Christ
who is our peace, and left his peace unto beleevers; and
by this meanes through Gods blessing the patient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
true tranquillity of mind, and inward peace of
conscience: and rejoyceth with an unspeakable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18740:174"/>
joy for his recovery, as the Israelites did in theirs.
But let a man stung in conscience goe to a Roman tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
hee leads him any way but the right, any whither
so not to Christ. In stead of Gods certaine direction
in the words of the Prophets and Apostles, which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
of Christ the onely brazen serpent; they send him to
unsound and uncertaine speculations, fables, traditions,
equall (say they) to Scripture; and some of them say, farre
better. In stead of Christs satisfaction and merit, they
send him home to his owne merits and satisfactions;
by which (say they) he may apply the satisfaction and
merit of Christ. But in case he be so bad as he have no
merits of his owne, the Church hath a Treasury of other
mens merits to dispense by taile, so he will come to the
price. So he may buy oyle enough to fill his lampe out
of the Popes Exchequer or Burse, filled to the top with
workes of supererogation. But if he make some scruple
of this; least the wise virgins have not enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others; then they may have the sacrifice of the
Masse not to faile, but never apply that one and only sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
upon the Crosse it selfe. Now whether of us agree
with <hi>Moses?</hi>

                  <p>5. As the Israelite must looke up to the Serpent lifted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
up; so must thou looke up and behold Christ lifted up.<note place="margin">Looke onely unto Christ. Two waies.

This must thou doe two waies. First on the wood of the
Crosse; secondly on the throne of the Kingdome both of
grace and glory. Behold Christ lifted up not in his abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
onely, but in his advancement. First, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace, as hee is lifted up in the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
In which Christ is mightily declared the Son
of God, and preached the Saviour of the world: <hi>Gal. 3. 1,
among whom Christ was crucified.</hi> Secondly in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glory raysed from the dead, ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and exalted at the right hand of God above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and powers; <hi>Phil. 2. 9, God hath given him a
name which is above every name.</hi> Now the looking on
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18740:175"/>
Christ thus lifted up, is the act of faith, not a bare intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sight, or vision, as to beleeve that Christ was thus
exalted on the Crosse, and in his Kingdom; but it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
and applicatory, and to beleeve in CHRIST
crucified and glorified. This looking hath three things
in it. 1. To beleeve that hee was the Sonne of God and
sonne of man; our <hi>Immanuel.</hi> 2. That he being so, was
lift up for the salvation of beleevers. 3. That my selfe
assuredly trust and depend on him alone, as the onely
author, meritour, and bestower of salvation. This is
Evangelicall looking on the Serpent.</p>
                  <p>Now because this looking is the principall thing in
the cure, we will consider, 1. How this looking cures
us. 2. How wee know wee are cured by our looking.

Oh what shall I doe to be saved from death, being so

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Not as it is an excellent grace, nor as any work
of ours. We are not saved and cured for beleeving, but by
beleeving. 1. Because faith is the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and of our cure; as looking was the condition
of the cure of the Israelite. For it was not the having of a
Brazen Serpent, nor the lifting it up could cure; but the
Israelites looking upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it: so it is not the hearing of Christ,
nor the lifting of him up in the Ministery, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18740:175"/>
of his merits can save, unlesse they be received by
faith. A potion never so vertuous, is fruitlesse if not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
As meat uneaten; so is Christ not digested and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by faith.</p>
                  <p>2. Faith cannot cure, considered simply in it selfe as
a quality, or vertue, or gift, or habit; but considered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
with his object, which is Jesus Christ, the Lord
our righteousnesse; for faith is the eye of the soule. But
as it was not the eye of the Israelite, but the eye set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the brazen serpent that cured him: so here, faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his object cureth, because onely faith draweth vertue
from Christ, as in the Syrophoenician who touched
Christ and was cured; but not by touching, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.
More plainely in this comparison. As a jewel
included in a ring enricheth a man or healeth him; it is
not the ring doth it but the jewell, and yet none have the
jewell without the ring: So Jesus Christ is the onely
jewell and antidote aginst the deadly poison of sinne.
This jewell is included in the ring of faith. Now it is
apparently Christ the jewell that justifieth, enricheth,
cureth; but wee cannot have him without the ring of
faith which includeth him. So as faith saveth and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
us onely as a meanes, suppose the hand of the soule
to convey Christ to us for justification, which no other
grace can doe. So not faith, but Christ applied by faith,
that saveth and cureth us.</p>
                  <p>3. As no Israelite could bee cured but by his owne
sight of the Serpent; and no man could bee cured by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mans looking or seeing it: So must every just man
<hi>live by his owne faith, Hab.</hi> 2. 4. No man can be saved by
anothers faith, or the faith of the Church, but by his
owne speciall faith, beleeving in particular upon assured
grounds the remission of his owne sinnes.</p>
                  <p>II. By what marks may I know that I have looked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
on this brazen serpent for cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> By foure marks.<note place="margin">Marks of one cured by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Christ.</note>

1. If thine eye have beene rightly affected; which
will appeare in foure particulars.<note place="margin">Foure qualities of the eye that looks to him.</note> First, if it be a <hi>discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
eye cleared to see in Jesus Christ two things; the
first his power, the second his will to cure. That hee is
able to helpe, being the mighty God; and that hee is
willing to cure, being a compassionate Saviour, who
himselfe was stung to death that he might have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on them that are stung, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18. Secondly, if it
bee a <hi>mournefull eye.</hi> Hee that had seene the Israelites
running about the brazen serpent, should have seene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a teare falling, and heard many a deepe groane, and
pitifull complaints of their deadly paine and poison.
Hast thou come to Jesus Christ with sorow in thy heart,
with teares in thy eyes, with lamentable groanes and
complaints of thy misery by sinne? this is to looke upon
him for cure. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. the members of the Church
shall <hi>behold him and mourne,</hi> as a man for his onely sonne.
Such lookers on him, he looketh upon and easeth, <hi>Matt.
11. 28. Come unto mee all that are weary and heavy laden,
and I will ease you.</hi> Thirdly, if it bee a <hi>wishing</hi> and <hi>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
eye; for there is affection as well as vision in the
eye. As the lame man that lay in <hi>Solomons</hi> porch <hi>(Act.
3. 5.)</hi> wistly <hi>looked on Peter and Iohn,</hi> expecting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
something from them: so no doubt did the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
on the Serpent. And so must thou hold on waiting
and expecting sound cure from Christ, &amp; take no deniall
till thou bee fully cured; for so did the Canaanitish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
prevaile. Fourthly, if it be a <hi>faithfull stedfast eye;</hi>
a beleeving eye carries cure from Christ. Christ was
wont to aske some of his patients that came for cure, if
they did beleeve he could helpe: and in the cure, Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy faith bee it unto thee: and after the cure;
goe thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole: and much
more works hee the cure of soules by meanes of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
faith, and not without it.</p>
                  <p>2. If the sting were gone, and the poison of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18740:176"/>
abated, this was an infallible signe that the Israelite
was cured. Consider if the power and rage of sinne be
removed, the guilt of it gone by justification; if the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and staine of it bee abated and daily abolished, now
art thou in the way of cure. But if the poison remaine,
that sinne lives in thee, prevailes and raignes in thee,
and commands thee as formerly; thou hast not yet loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on the serpent for cure. Justification and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are inseparable.</p>
                  <p>3. A ceasing of paine, and ease and comfort resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
which when the Israelite felt, it was a signe he was
cured: So if after sense of paine and griefe of spirit,
thou hast received sound peace of conscience, joy of the
holy Ghost, and comfort of a good estate in Christ, that
thou art able upon good grounds to challenge thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
in Christ, and maintaine thy selfe stedfastly
assured and cheared in Gods mercie, and the goodnesse
of an excusing conscience; thou hast now looked upon
Christ and Christ upon thee for perfect cure.</p>
                  <p>4. When the sting with the paine was gone, the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite
could goe as strongly and chearefully about his
businesse as ever before; he had new life, new strength,
new motions, by which he might be sure he had looked
upon the serpent: So if thou canst find so happy a change
in thy soule, as new life, new motions, new actions,
new affections, and in a word, the whole renewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
all these are the fruits and effects of thy faith, and
faithfull beholding of Christ, and of his looking upon
thee. Of this new obedience and renewed strength of
a Christian having lately spoken, I passe it over more
briefly.</p>
                  <p>III. Motives to stirre us up to this looking upon our
Serpent,<note place="margin">Motives to look up to our Serpent.</note> are:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Nothing else can cure us but Christ. The Israelits
had gold, silver, Manna from heaven, water out of the
Rock, yea the Arke, the Oracle; but none of all these
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18740:177"/>
can helpe them, onely the Serpent must cure them; no
sight else can cure. Thou mayest see gold, silver, lands,
friends, playes, pleasures, nay couldst thou see heaven it
selfe without Christ, there were no helpe or cure in it.
In respect of this sight the Apostle counted all things
losse and dung; and desired to see and know nothing but
Jesus Christ and him crucified, and lifted on the wood.</p>
                  <p>2. No not Christ himselfe can cure without this loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and faithfull beholding him: as the brazen serpent
not looked on, healed not. The want of the eye or sight
disabled the Israelites from cure though the serpent
were by them: so the want of faith disableth God after
a sort, and Christ himselfe from doing a man any good.
<hi>Mark. 6. Christ could doe no great cure in Capernaum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their unbeliefe.</hi> Neither can any ordinance of
God doe him good that wants faith: no more then this
serpent ordained by God, could doe a blind Israelite
good. If wee should send a man to the word, it must
be a word of faith must doe him good; that is, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because it is a begetter of faith; but because it must be
mingled with faith, else it proves <hi>unprofitable, Heb.</hi> 4. 2.
If to the Sacraments;<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> if hee bring not faith, they are not
to him the <hi>seales of faith,</hi> but as seales set to blanks. If
to prayer; it must be a <hi>prayer of faith</hi> that, is availeable,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 5, 15. If to good works, and good life; it must be
a life of faith, led by faith; for the just must live by his
faith. If to the Church of God; hee must bee of the
<hi>houshold of faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> else he shall be but as <hi>Iudas</hi> among the
Disciples. Faith must be every where diffused, to walk
by faith, live by faith, and die in faith, as the Saints in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages have done for our imitation.</p>
                  <p>3. We must hold on this expectation on our Serpent,
as the Israelites did till they were perfectly cured. And
because we can never bee perfectly cured in this life, but
onely in part; wee must still looke up to Jesus the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and finisher of our faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> till we be fully and perfectly
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18740:177"/>
healed. Hence it is, that the Lord will never have this
Brazen Serpent taken downe as the other was after a
short time, but hath appointed the Ministery to lift him
up, and hold him perpetually before our eyes so long as
wee are here below, and enjoyned us the constant use of
it all the while wee are in this wildernesse, which were
needlesse if we had once attained our perfect cure. This
is a strong motive to hold our eyes fast fixed upon Jesus
Christ, till we come to enjoy him as he is; when all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
shall cease, and the Lamb shall be all in all.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. VIII.</head>
                  <p>From this so excellent a figure ariseth a bright Sunne
of light and comfort for all the faithfull.<note place="margin">Vse of comfort, in 5. particulars.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Israelite that could looke to the serpent, if
his eye were never so tender, weake, or dimme, yet was
cured. Thou that art the weakest beleever, bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
thy weake faith shall save thee, thy smoking flaxe
shall not be quenched, but cleared to farther brightnesse.
Thy weake hand shall bee able to receive and hold the
gift of righteousnesse and eternall life. It is not the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of thy faith that saves thee, but the <hi>truth</hi> of it. Yet
with this caution. If it be true it will strive to encrease.
And, if there bee so much comfort in weake faith, how
much is there in strong?</p>
                  <p>2. The Israelite stung never so often; if so often hee
did looke on the serpent, so often hee was cured. Oh
singular comfort! Thou that renewest thy sinnes every
day, and every day goest over the same frailties, renew
also thy faith daily, and thy repentance, and thou art safe.
That brazen serpent lost his vertue of healing, but our
Brazen Serpent never loseth his. If thou sinnest seventy
times seven times, and so many times returnest by faith
in Christ, and say, It repents mee: by this looking upon
the brazen serpent all those wounds shall be cured. Yet
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18740:178"/>
with this caution. That as he had been a madd Israelite,
who, because there was a serpent set up to cure him,
would therefore runne of purpose among serpents to be
stung by them: So is hee no lesse wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>esse a Christian,
who therefore willingly makes his sinne abound, because
grace hath abounded. A madd man he is that will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
breake his head, or wound his members, because he
hath a soveraigne plaister by him.</p>
                  <p>3. The Israelites stung never so deadly, never so des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately,
never so long wounded, yet looking on the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
were cured. If thy sinnes bee as redd as scarlet, and
never so great: if in thy sense some one of them deserve a
thousand hells, and the guilt of it or them rings continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the eares of thy conscience, frighted with feares
of hell and death; if thy sinnes bee festered and of long
continuance: Now come to the Brazen Serpent. Never
was any Israelite that could looke on the serpent, sent
away uncured: But there is ten thousand times more
vertue in Jesus Christ, then in ten millions of brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
onely looke on this Serpent by the eye of faith,
turne from all thy sinnes, and be saved.</p>
                  <p>4. The Israelites looking on the serpent brought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
cure and ease, and they went away rejoycing. If
thou beleevest in Jesus Christ, thou art perfectly cured.
As Christ was wont to say to his patients, so I say to
thee, Goe in peace, Thy faith hath made thee whole.
Onely this grace can quiet the heart distressed, and can
keepe it from sinking as once it did <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 14. 29. In
this is the beginning and accomplishment of thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The converted Gaoler went away <hi>rejoycing that he
&amp; his house beleeved, Act.</hi> 16. 34. Now if one sight of faith
in this our absence from Christ bee so joyfull a thing:
what shall the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ight of fruition doe in his presence?</p>
                  <p>5. The Israelites having once the brazen serpent, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not for the fiery serpents. They might sting them
now, but not much hurt them; they might now poison
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18740:178"/>
them, but not kill them: So the beleever looking to the
true Brazen Serpent, may triumph over the old Serpent,
and all the serpentine seed: and say as the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
1. <hi>Cor. 15. 55. Oh sinne where is thy sting? oh hell
where is thy victory? Nay, Thanks bee to God, who hath
given us victory by our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Great was the
power of the Israelites looking upon that serpent; for
when the fiery serpents were present, it made them
powerlesse, and not hurtfull. Greater is the power of
faith in the Lord Jesus; which though our sinnes in
themselves are most venemous and poisonfull stings, and
such as wee cannot be rid of them; yet it so blunts them,
and makes them so powerlesse, that they kill us not:
Nay that they hurt us not: nay more, that they helpe us,
