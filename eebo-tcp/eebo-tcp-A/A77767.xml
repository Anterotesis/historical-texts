            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A BRIEF REPLY <hi>To Two Papers given into the Houſe of Lords, ſince my Book was given in: The one call'd</hi> The Chriſtian Faith, <hi>&amp;c. Signed by</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>and</hi> 17 <hi>more, the other ſtil'd</hi> The Ancient Teſtimony, <hi>&amp;c. not Signed at all</hi>
               </head>
               <head type="sub">In the Firſt to the Lords the QUAKERS declare. <hi>That they believe in and confeſs to Jeſus Chriſt, both as he is true God and perfect Man. 2ly. That they own the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament to be given by Divine Inſpiration,</hi> &amp;c. Next followeth their contempt of Chriſt and the Scriptures, which ſhews the fallaciouſneſs of their now pretending to own them.</head>
               <p>A Queſt. to Profeſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 33. <hi>Now the Scriptures do expreſly diſtinguiſh between</hi> CHRIST <hi>and the</hi> GARMENT <hi>which he wore between</hi> HIM, <hi>that came, and the</hi> BODY <hi>in which</hi> HE <hi>came; between the</hi> SUBSTANCE <hi>which was</hi> VAILED, <hi>and the Vail which vailed it: There was plainly</hi> HE (<hi>ſay the</hi> Quakers) <hi>and the</hi> BODY <hi>in which</hi> HE <hi>came; there was the</hi> OUTWARD VESSEL <hi>and the</hi> INWARD LIFE, <hi>this</hi> WE CERTAINLY <hi>know, and can never call the</hi> BODILY <hi>Garment</hi> Chriſt: <hi>But that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and dwelt</hi> IN <hi>the Body,</hi> p. 27. <hi>is not the Subſtance the Life, the Anointing called Christ where-ever it is found: And doth not the Name</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>belong to the whole Body; and every Member in the Body; as well as to the Head, &amp;c.</hi> The Sword of the Lord drawn, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Your imagined God beyond the Stars; and your carnal Chriſt is utterly denied, and teſtified againſt by the light; To ſay that Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, it is a Lye;</hi> for more of this, ſee <hi>The Quak. ſet,</hi> &amp;c. p. 43. to the end: <hi>News coming up,</hi> &amp;c. p. 14. <hi>Your word is carnal the Letter; ſo duſt is the Serpents meat; their Original is but duſt, which is but the Letter, which is Death; ſo the Serpent feeds upon duſt: And their Goſpel is duſt,</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luke <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>which is but the Letter,</hi> &amp;c. as more at large in <hi>the Quak. ſet.</hi> &amp;c. p. 46. If any object on their behalf, and ſay; poſſibly theſe Paſſages might be wrot in their miſtaken Zeal; but if they'll now retract and condemn the ſame; and ſteadfaſtly own their New Confeſſion; might not their former errors be buried in Oblivion. Anſw. That's granted, for who is it that hath not erred: But if they ſhall prove pertenacious, and ſtand to maintain &amp; defend thoſe errors, as wrot by the Eternal Spirit and Infallible dictates thereof; then 'tis the duty of every Chriſtian to reject their counterfeit confeſſions; which they make uſe of to ſerve a turn only.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Paper not ſigned, it ſeems fallacious from top to bottom; for what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit can be given to a Paper not ſigned, only ſaid to be given out at a Meeting in <hi>London.</hi> The King's Proclamations are ſaid to be given out at his Court at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> but not without his Name <hi>W. Rex.</hi> But it ſeems the <hi>Quakers</hi> conceive themſelves of that Credit, that they need not Sign their Papers; that's below them: Or elſe it muſt be to leave room for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, when time ſerve: I grant they ſay they pray for the King, but what King they do not tell; No? that's a ſecret; they alſo ſay, they cannot Sign the Aſſociation, and thereby declare the King their Rightful and Lawful King for Conſcience ſake: And yet they tell you that their not Signing, is not in oppoſition to his being declared the Rightful and Lawful King; who ſays ſo? no body; for there is no Name to it, nor from what Meeting it was given out; whether Yearly, or Quarterly, the Six Week Meeting, Monthly, or ſecond day Meeting; or whether from 2 or 3 <hi>Quakers</hi> under the Hedge.</p>
               <p>Again, You cannot Sign the Aſſociation, in regard you cannot take revenge for your ſelves nor others: That's ſtrange, was there not lately a <hi>Quaker</hi> murthered on the Road, between <hi>Kingſtand</hi> and <hi>Shoreditch;</hi> and did you not proffer 50 <hi>l.</hi> Reward for the Diſcovery of the Perſon, which did it; was he not found and tryed at the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> and hang'd in Chains near <hi>Stone-Bridge;</hi> and all this Proſecution by <hi>Quakers:</hi> And can you revenge your ſelves of the Blood of a private Perſon; and can you not Sign the Aſſociation to avenge the Blood of your Prince, for Conſcience ſake: Are your Conſciences ſo nice that you can neither ſay nor do; any thing for the Publick Good, what can you receive benefit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Government; and can you not defend it for Conſcience ſake: You may remember how frequent it was with you to Addreſs the Late King <hi>James:</hi> And alſo you know, you never made an Addreſs to His Preſent Majeſty, ſee <hi>New Rome Unmask'd,</hi> &amp;c. p. 27. No, your Conſcience will not allow you, neither to Addreſs, Sign the Sociation, nor Sign your Paper, wherein you pretend to pay ſome kind of Reſpect for the Liberty you enjoy: You could tell <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> that if he choſe the Lord to be his Counſellor, he ſhould proſper; and that you would be a ſtrength to him, and ſtand by him in the day of trouble, and DEFEND him in his juſt Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for more of this, ſee <hi>Burrough's Works</hi> p. 252. 273. 274. But you cannot Sign the Aſſociation, and thereby ſtand by and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend King <hi>William,</hi> for Conſcience ſake; what Conſcience is yours, that thus differ from the Lords and Commons, and all other Dutiful Subjects of our Sovereign Lord the King 5 or has no Body any Conſcience but you, Signed in Concurrence with the Loyal Aſſociation by me</p>
