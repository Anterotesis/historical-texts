            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16672:3"/>
seemed to mee that Wrath was gone out against vs, and that the Hand of God was vpon vs. On the other side, when I saw the dulnesse and deadnesse of Men, who hauing the stripes freshly smarting and bleeding on their backs, and the sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s galling in their sides, yet are like the Horse and Mule that haue no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the dulnesse of the people seemed to me more fearful then the punishments. For when a Nation growes stupid and senselesse at the Chastisements of God, and doth not or will not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods meaning in them, there goes out a speech from the Highest, Why should they be smitten any more? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:16672:3"/>
this is the meaning; In stead of a fatherly Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there must come a swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Desolation. Therefore I thought it necessarie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Interpreter to the people, though the meanest of a thousand, to shew Gods meaning in his chastisements; for by them God would haue something to be done, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof may cure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them. It may bee that some will require a propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spirit, rightly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the Iudgement of God, as the rich Man would haue one to come from the Dead to conuert his Brethren; but to these I giue the same answer that was giuen to him; That the Scriptures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> left vnto
<pb facs="tcp:16672:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs for sufficient Interpreters. As Gods chastisements haue beene interpreted in them, so may we still interprete them. By this paterne haue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Ancients of the Church made construction of Gods Iudgements, and by great Reason. For God is still one and the same both in Iustice and Mercy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath left one and the same Word, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue his Iudgements and Mercies. Accordingly from Gods Word in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 11</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs in the New, That Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments on the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the first Times of the World, are to be examples to vs on whom the ends of
<pb facs="tcp:16672:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the World are come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs boldly, because safely, march vnder the Shield of so great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, beleeuing with him that now, as heretofore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments and sinnes are tyed together. Indeed, if God would haue altered his course, and by a new kind of gouernment send generall punishments where there are not generall sinnes, there might haue beene need of new Prophets, to haue broght vs Newes of a new Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But before wee begin this warrantable Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, let vs turne our Eyes to things most dangerously vnwarrantable, the Abuse and misconstruction of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

commonly vsed. Some take no notice at all of the strokes of this Wrath, but with the Mirth and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Wine and Pleasures, take away the knowledge of it, as the Sacrificers in the Valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> by the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the greater Cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lion hath roared; and such beasts are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; so that the greater the number is of these mad men of mirth, the greater had neede to be the company of Mourners, or the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Company. It is the mourning of the penitent, that maintaynes the mirth of the Delinquent, and it is the ten righteous Men that keepe fire and brimstone from a company of abominable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites.</p>
            <p>Others there are that gaze on the stroke, and stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at their miserie, but looke not vp to the highest Striker; yea, by murmuring and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So then if wee want the benefit of the Flocke, and haue a losse in stead of it, the substance of the Curse is vpon vs, though the manner may differ. And if we will doubt whether this Losse be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Gods wrath, Let vs but looke about vs, and see with what Miseries it punisheth vs. The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord feeles a losse in his Rents and Fines; the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a disabilitie in paying either; but especially the

And though Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of Trade, and this Scarsitie be some Kin, yet hath this more kinred besides, for pouertie comes more wayes then one. By the losse of this bloud the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16672:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Commonwealth faynteth, and the limbs therof grow feeble. Hospitalitie dyeth, Almes are diminished, and Neede increasing, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Neede decreaseth. Commerce deceiueth and is deceiued, and euen Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie it selfe growes like Dishonestie, while it fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to performe what it promised, because another promise fayled it. No Trade prospers so steadily as the Trade that deuours trades; for the scarsitie of Money makes a plentie of Vsurers; their hunger deuouring most Money, when least is to be gotten. A strange ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, that Mony should bring most to the Lender,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16672:22"/>
when it brings least to the Borrower; and that the Rent of Money should bee dearest, when the Rent of Land is cheapest. By this Meanes pouertie in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, is like pouertie in the Body Naturall. For pouertie in both breedes store of Vermine, which being bred of pouertie, doe increase that which bred them. And while Pouertie by the mediation of Vsurie increaseth Pouertie, Vsurie in the middle of these two Pouerties growes the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher by both of them. A Plague begot of a Plague, the effect of an old Want, and the Cause of a New. So while the Dragons giue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16672:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their brests to their young ones, and each thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth and preserueth his Kind, Man onely is cruell to his owne Flesh, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth the Miseries of his owne Kind; he releeueth not Want, but releeues him selfe vpon it. Yet men must bee mannerly in touching this Vice, for else they will amend their fault with a worse, and in stead of a lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable vndoing by lending, they will vndo men at once by calling in suddenly what they haue Lent. And so from the vnmercifulnesse of an ouer-cruell Lending, they fall into the vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of not Lending. I wish they could finde the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16672:23"/>
middle way betweene hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by lending, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by not lending, which perchance might bee this, when such a Rent is set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on money, as both the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower and Lender might be able to thriue. For this I thinke is the golden Meane of lending in Commerce; though I know there is a Lending beyond this, a worke of Almes and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which lends to the Lord in the poore, and neither lookes for lending againe in exchange, nor for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly Reward.

                  <p>A First is that mayn and capitall point of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16672:66"/>
The turning vnto dumbe Idolls from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. For if <hi>Paul</hi> make<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 2. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thess. 2.</note> that the Character of a Conuert, euen the turning from dumbe Idolls to the liuing God, then it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Character of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata to turne from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God vnto dumbe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls. For in the same path wherein the Conuert walks from Idolls vnto God, in the same doth the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta goe backe from God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolls. And whereas there hath beene a sleight excuse for so grosse a fault, That an Idoll is the Image of nothing in the world; surely, this answere is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world. For the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16672:66"/>
Image of those things that are, may be Idols, if diuine worship bee giuen vnto them, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Th. Aqu. 2, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The meaning therefore of the Apostle is manifestly this, That an Idoll is not at all that thing for which it is worshipped; or in regard of that Godhead which by worship is attributed to it, it is nothing in the world.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16672:67"/>
This interpretation doth<note place="margin">Idolatrie practised most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily by the Papists.</note> 
                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> himselfe giue, and reason it selfe doth shew it. For though as it is a piece of Metall, or a Starre, or Man, it hath a being, yet as it is an Idoll, and by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship made a God, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll of it is nothing in the world. It is a meere lye, as the Prophet sayes, euen an affirmation of that which is not, For it tels the People it is a God when it is not. And for this reason doe we detest this wickednesse of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> because by curious shapes, rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forged miracles, and dangerous Doctrines, they<note place="margin">And taught by their Doctors.</note> draw the people to giue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship to that which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16672:67"/>
is nothing. And lest wee should doubt much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuine worship bee by their Doctrine ascribed to Images, wee shall find that in plaine termes they haue confessed it. Indeede the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath<note place="margin">How the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> is a generall Councell.</note> herein dealt most cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet withall most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the intent of a Coun cell; since herein it onely deserues to be called a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, because it couers many Questions with generall Termes; and so in this Question it sayes, wee must worship Images <hi>debit a veneratione,</hi> with due worship. Surely, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell should haue resolued doubts, and not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16672:68"/>

But if their Councells will not tell vs their Doctrine, we must aske next of their Doctors, and some of them plainly shew vs that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Idolatrie. <hi>Aquinas</hi> though he saith that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is the giuing of diuine worship to a Creature, yet<note place="margin">Aqu. part. 3. quaest. 25. art. 2. 3.</note> he excepteth the Image of Christ, and sayes, diuine worship belongs to that. His reason is most weake for so mightie a Doctor, but we must remember his iudgement was preiudiced by Custome and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Because of Christs Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16672:68"/>
saith he, Christ must be worshipped, &amp; the Image for representing Christ. But what doth Christs Deitie to the deifying of a piece of wood? Not by Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for the Godhead, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, is not like siluer<note place="margin">Act. 17. 29.</note> or stone. Neither by Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Communication, for the Deitie hath by no meanes giuen it selfe so much vnto stone that it should be worshipped.

is a chiefe worship due to the true God, and being giuen to an Image, it is true Idolatrie. And though for his owne part, he would fain in this point, as in others, bee somewhat neater then his fellows, yet shal we find in his Doctrine two mayne props or parts of Idolatrie: the one, where he sayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the worship giuen to the Image, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined or bounded in the Image. And herein he doth no other, but make the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, a very obiect of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And secondly, lest by making it a lower kinde of worship, and an improper <hi>Latria,</hi> he might flie out at a back-doore, which hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16672:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leaues open for that purpose: hee saith further, That an Image may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bee worshipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> if wee ioyne the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage<note place="margin">Cap. 23.</note> and the Paterne in one Imagination. Then a strong or intense Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may worship Images with diuine worship, which is flat Idolatry. This strong imagination is indeed one of the strong delusions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Chayre of Pestilence, by which men are led to beleeue lyes. A noble subtiltie, and meere trick of a Iuggler, which makes things really diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, seeme to be one; and from a seeming Vnitie, will enforce a reall Vnitie of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16672:70"/>
worship: The Image and the Paterne are asunder in themselues, and together onely in the Imagination, then how can they scape I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, that giue diuine worship, to a thing really and truly diuided from the Deitie? Surely, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reason, if it be holpen, will onely goe so farre, That men may worship the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which is in their Brayne, and not the Image before their Eyes. For the Image in their Brayne, hath an imaginarie Vnion with the Paterne, but the Image before their eyes hath none at all. But what is this, but to become vaine in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, &amp; while men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16672:71"/>
themselues to bee wise in their subtilties, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come stark Fooles, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks vpon the same<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21, 22.</note> subiect. It must bee a reall Vnion, as that is betweene the Deitie and Humanitie of Christ, that must giue a reall Communitie of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. I would fayne know of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> if hee came into the Popes Wardrobe, and there saw the Robes of the Pope, and imagined them on the Popes body, whether hee would fall downe, and giue the same honour to the Clothes, that he would doe to the Pope himself, if the clothes were worne by him. And yet I may tell him farther, That
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16672:71"/>
the clothes being worne by him, there is no reall or personall vnion betweene them, and therefore there is some difference of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, giuen to the Man, and to the clothes which are no part of the Man.</p>
                  <p>Now, if these great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors maintayne sdolatrie, what shall the blinde Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude doe but stumble, at<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 20.</note> these stumbling-blocks laid before them by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? The flesh inwardly is prone to Idolatrie, as the Scripture teacheth; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect without by beautie and conformitie is fit to tempt to Idolatrie; <hi>Ducit enim &amp; affectu quodam infirmo, rapit infirma corda mortalium,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:16672:72"/>
                     <hi>formae similitudo, &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum imitata compago.</hi> As <hi>Ionas Aurelianensis</hi> hath out<note place="margin">De cul.

And to the two temptations inward and outward, is ioyned in the Middle a Doctrine to consummate the worke of Idolatrie, by ioyning a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Heart, to the beloued Image, in a wretched wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. I may notdenie an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of grace, which was found in <hi>Israel,</hi> when their estate was outwardly so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate, That <hi>Elias</hi> could not see one true worshipper

But I find both by Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that Church is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and maynly giuen to Idolatrie. <hi>Agobardus,</hi> a reuerend Bishop, and neare to eight hundred yeeres Antiquitie, saith, <hi>Nullus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquorum</hi>

There are too many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to proue this Truth, and wee need not to set sayle for the fetching of them; for euen in this land<note place="margin">Sir <hi>E.

But as pittifull as it is, yet true it is, That a Popish prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, being transplanted by a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> doth too often proue a stocke on which Murther and Crueltie is

Let vs therefore feare the Communion of this bloudie Citie, lest wee get a Communion of their bloudinesse, which if we doe, let vs looke for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their plagues, let vs expect a part in all the vengeance belonging to innumerable Murthers. Then may wee feare that the bloud of former dayes shed in this Realme, will light vpon vs, when wee partake with the Doctrine that shed it. If the Son see<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 14</note> his Fathers sinnes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd them, they shall not bee imputed to him. But if a bloudie Father bring a bloudie Sonne, then the bloudinesse of the Father

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16672:79"/>
for a share in the whole rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of bloud which that Doctrine hath shed.

For by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of cloathes there is a generall remoue, and the Lower is stept into the place of the Higher, and each goes about to bee like them who are vnlike him.

                  <p>BVt before I passe to a farther Consideration, I must needs meet with an ill custome of the Vulgar. When Miseries are vpon them, they haue common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mutinous and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts; and from thence issue their censures of gouernment, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry for want of Lawes, or want of keeping them. In this is a fault, and I desire they may know it. For whither their censure bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true or false, they are in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be blamed. If it be false, an apparant falshod is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16672:102"/>
an apparent fault, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs not to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But if it be true, they are to blame in the vn-due effects that issue from it. For besides that, Mutinie is an ill remedie of Miserie, the greatest Miserie being a bad helpe of the lesser, they are to blame in this, That they looke so farre from them, and aboue them, for the finding and amending of faults, which they should haue done most aptly at home. For if sinnes be the radicall cause of Miseries, then it is also the Cause of the Causes of Miserie. So, if faults in gouernment bee the causes of Miserie, sinne may be thought to be the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16672:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cause of those Causes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Salomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 2.</note> That for the sinnes of the Land the Princes are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that is, because a Land is wicked, it is punished with a confused gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

the faults in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, which they seeke to amend beyond themselues, and by quitting their owne euill, escape that euill which dependeth vpon it. If the<note place="margin">Ex quorum causa pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauit, <hi>saith</hi> Gregorie.</note> sinnes of <hi>Israel</hi> be the cause of the sinnes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the taking away of the sinnes of <hi>Israel,</hi> had beene the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest way of preuenting that sinne of <hi>Dauid.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou wilt haue any thing amended abroad, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it at home in thy self, for there is thy work which properly belongs to thee.

to the yoke. Thirdly, he shewes the operation of Gods chastisement in him; it stirred him vp to call on God for the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Turne thou mee and I shall be turned: And fourthly, the tendernesse of Gods mercy to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> being penitent in most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate wordes; <hi>Ephraim</hi> my deare Sonne and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Child, since I spake to him I doe earnestly still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him: Therefore, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will surely haue mercy on him.

to the Teacher or the Practiser. The wrath and punishments which sinne hath twisted together, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence vntwineth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth. Sinne calleth for punishments, Punishments call for conuersion from sinne, and conuersion from sin expelleth punishments. Infinite it were to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late<note place="margin">And by the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> Gods Promises of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to repentance, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such Promises per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Back-sliding <hi>Israel</hi> vnder the <hi>Iudges</hi> often fell backe to their sinnes, yet often returning from their sinnes, were deliuered from their miseries. Yea, euen <hi>Ahab</hi> by the out-side of repentance, which he wore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16672:111"/>
on his body, in his garment of sack-cloth and gesture of going softly, deferred the rooting out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie for the terme of his life. When <hi>Manasseth</hi> had laden himselfe, and <hi>Iudah</hi> with the roaring sinnes of bloud and Idolatrie, yet <hi>Manasseth</hi> by repentance is vnladen himselfe, and to <hi>Iudah</hi> it is offered by <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 26. 2, 3.</note> That yet they should hearken and repent, that God might repent of the euill, which for their euill doings he purposed to doe vnto them. Accordingly in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> time, which was a time of reformation, God spared <hi>Iudah,</hi> though bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with these sinnes, for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16672:111"/>
one and thirtie yeares. And yet to say the truth, it seems that <hi>Iudah</hi> all that while was but outwardly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and inwardly rotten. Such a blessing to a people<note place="margin">Ier. 25. 3. 5. 7. Zeph. 1. 1. &amp; 3. 1. 2.</note> is a godly Prince, striuing for a true reformation, though attayning but to a seeming one. Yea, it seemes that God did not punish <hi>Iudah,</hi> vntill they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinnes like to those of<note place="margin">2. Kin. 24. 3. Ier. 22. 15. 16. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Manasseth.</hi> So doth <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> interpret that place; yea, <hi>Ieremie</hi> affirmeth the substance of this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For hee saith it was well with <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who did Iustice and Iudgement, but the eyes and the heart of <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iosiah</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:16672:112"/>
were not, but for his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, for to shed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, for oppression and for violence. Behold, a true paterne of the sinnes of <hi>Manesseth;</hi> but that yet wee may bee sure to finde none of them wanting, let vs heare the Scripture plainely affirming, He did euill in the sight of the Lord, according to ALL that his Fathers had done. And what followes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately<note place="margin">2. Kin. 23. 31.</note> thereupon, In his dayes <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> came vp, and <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his seruant, and when he rebelled against him, the Lord sent the <hi>Caldees, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> against him; yea, hee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16672:112"/>
sent them against <hi>Iudah</hi> to destroy it. Thus wee see that Repentance for sinne preserueth a Kingdome, though taynted with crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and crying sinnes, but the same Kingdome retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Repentance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sinnes, and by new sins resembling the old, beareth the burthen in a fearefull destruction both of the new and the old. Neither hath the mercie of God extended it selfe onely to the penitence of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the Children of the Couenant, but euen to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh,</hi> a Citie of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and strangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel.</hi> Yea, by fact hee there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth

what by word els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note place="margin">Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings though neuer so affirmatiue yet vpon a condition haue an implyed Negatiue.</note> he publisheth. That the sentence of punishment though outwardly neuer so positiue, and resolutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue, yet inwardly it hath an implyed negatiue, vpon the condition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion and amendment. The Lord saith by <hi>Iermie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 18. 7. 8.</note> When I shall speake of a Nation, and of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to plucke vp and to pull downe, and to destroy it; behold a peremptory sentence of destruction, If that Nation against whom I haue pronounced it turne from their euill, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the euill I thought to doe vnto them; behold a negatiue of that Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

and loathing and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wee must turne to the contrarie Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to this wee must ioyne vehement inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wee may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, for we haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed them in acting them: Our sinnes with <hi>Sodome</hi> were not hid in the doing, let them not with <hi>Adam</hi> be hid in the curing. Yea, those that are more secret, God by punishments hath now publikely proclaymed, As in <hi>Absolons</hi> open Incest, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> secret Adulterie was punished. Wherefore, if wee had not shame to doe that sinne by which God was offended, and wee are

therefore Christs iustifying bloud is giuen vs by the sanctifying Spirit, &amp; with the taking away of the filth, the taking away of the guilt is conioyned. The Parable of Christ, with some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and some difference, may make it more cleare to lower capacities. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath two Sonnes, and the yonger cals for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and spends it; yea, hee makes a debt beyond it, and sets it on his Fathers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Afterward, he is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his prodigalitie, he returns to his fathers house, and there desires his elder brother to mediate for him. The Brother intreates the Father, he offers payment
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16672:133"/>
of the debt, only he intreats mercy and pardon for his Brother. The Father lookes aswell for amendment, as for satisfaction, and wil not accept this elder Sonnes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, vntill he be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his younger Sonnes penitence and conuersion. To testifie this, it appeares to the father that he hateth his former life, because he hateth himselfe for it, and out of that hatred hee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth himselfe with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, lying on the ground, and humbling himselfe to an equalitie with seruants. Vpon this penitent humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, his brothers satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is accepted. It is the elder brother that satisfies,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16672:134"/>
but the penitence of the yonger makes him capable of that satisfaction. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our sins, Christs bloud is still the propitiation of our sinnes, but by serious penitence (the fruit of his mortifying Spirit, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of these exercises of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation are fruits) that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation is made ours, and is receiued for vs. This is no new Truth, but hath been anciently known and approued. <hi>Poenitens anima</hi>

Therefore<note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must be Seers and Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> euen at this Day must the Ministers bee Seers, they must see sinnes, and see iudgments.

And if carnall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie could truly say (as it is readie to say any thing; yea, to sinne quietly vnto Death, rather then to take the paines of Repentance) that there is no feare of such a wrath, as speculatiue men may forge out of the strength of Imagination, yet this is all the danger of this side, That by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Repentance, men are lesse sinfull, more iust, and more safe; whereas on the other side, If our Sins, and Gods Iudgements bee so
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16672:151"/>
neere together, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Proofes doe inforce, the danger of vnrepentance is no little one, but an vtter ouerthrow, and an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of desolation.
