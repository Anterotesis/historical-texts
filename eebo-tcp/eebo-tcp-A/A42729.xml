            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>If your Land be not ſo naturally, it muſt be made ſo by Art,</p>
                     <p>As for your Claiy Land, make Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to draw the water from it, which ſuch Land long contains, and if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtiff cold and moiſt, then dig it often, throwing it on heaps or ridges, the Sun and Froſts will meliorate it: Mix with it a great deal of Sea ſand, if it be to be had, for want whereof River or Brook ſand, on the ſand that the Land flouds have left, according to the quantity of your Ridges, filling the Gutters 'twixt the heaps or rows with old Thatch ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Straw, Broom, Fern, or Heath, mixing it with the earth in thoſe Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you intend for beds for your flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Your Allies or Walks need not that trouble, for the barrener they are the better.

Then may you know what flower to expect in ſuch or ſuch a place, and when they are paſt flower, know what roots you take up, and diſpoſe them accordingly; when they put forth their leaves, if any of them appear not, or their leaves fade, open the earth to the bottom to find its diſtemper, if the root moiſt and ſquaſhy tis paſt hopes of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but if hard, recoverable by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry ſand and ſoot to it, but not to blow that year; and when you take it up, which you muſt as ſoon as the fibres are gone, be ſure to keep it in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing free from moiſture till the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon require it to be ſet again.</p>
                     <p>Your Tulip Rocts ſet, being bulb roots need no watering, as all ſtringy roots do, nor any attendance but what before expreſt; but when they begin to flower, on with your Tilts, eſpecially in the night, to keep of the ſharpneſs of the froſts that may curdle the buds and ſpoil the beautiful form of the flower, taking them off in the mornings, you will find the effect worth your pains; what flowers hang their heads tie them up to ſmall rods ſtuck under them that will juſt reach the flower, and when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47410:53"/>
full blown, keep your paper Tilts on conſtantly, but when you would pleaſe your own or others eyes with a full ſight of their luſtrous glories. When they fall their leaves, break off the pods of all but what you intend ſhall ſeed, and thoſe muſt be clean and three ſquare podded (you may correct the word but an apter does not quickly offer it ſelf) and of ſuch flowers as are ſtrong and luſty, good bottoms and Tamis <hi>i. e.</hi> blew, dark, or purple of well and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant marked flowers ſuch that will not run, <hi>i. e.</hi> one colour ſlubbering into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, theſe muſt ſtand longer than the reſt, becauſe of the ſeeds ripening; as ſoon as the ſtalks of all your other Tulips are dryed down and withered, the roots will have loſt their fibres, and then they muſt be taken up yearly, thoſe eſpecially of any value, and every ſort put by themſelves, that you may know how again to ſet them without confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which your account in your book will direct you; lay them upon diſtinct papers in the Sun to dry, with their names writ on the papers, that you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not in their lapping up, and by that means abuſe your friends or ſelf,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47410:54"/>
put them in boxes in a dry room, once in a fortnight or three weeks look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, leſt they moulder, which if not gently whiped and aired in the Sun will ſpoil the root; if any of them are rivel'd or crumpled on the outſide, and feel ſoft, it is a ſign of its conſumption, and as my Father-in-law directed, wrap it up in wool dipt in Sallet Oyl, and place it where the warmth of the fire may but juſt reach it; about the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſet it in the ground, mixing wood-fire-ſoot and ſand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and place about it; cover it with a pot that no wet may hurt it till the fibres are put forth, which will be at the end of <hi>September</hi> (or not at all) about which time you muſt ſet your other roots in that form and manner as before directed, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that your earth if any dung be in it, let it be Neats dung that hath lain long enough to be ſufficiently rotted and digeſted, for want of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine flower hath been ſpoil'd; the beſt compoſition for them, if your freſh earth be not naturally light enough, (for they cannot endure a ſtiff ſoyl) is one part of well rotted Neats dung,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47410:54"/>
two parts of freſh earth, next under the turf, and two of Sea ſand, inſtead of which brook ſand may ſerve, and this too ſhould have lain mixt a while before made into a Bed to lodge your Tulips in, that the rawneſs of the Earth and Sand by ſometimes ſtirring it might be by that means taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>Now for raiſing new varieties of Tulips, there is but one ſure way, and that is by ſeeds ſown; you may wait many years before a mode changes, perhaps never, and off-ſets they will quickly bear Flowers, and at the firſt be better marked, and like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhew prettier faces than their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which youthful beauty ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes and too often degenerates, as from their Parents ſtability ſo from their lineaments too, and become not worth the looking on: and therefore not to be cheated by fair ſhews is to have natures product by ſeeds ſown with that advantage, that by years ſhortens the time which Mr. <hi>Woldridge</hi> ſayes, is only ſit for a dull Floriſt (it ſeems too mercurial a Gentleman to have patience) and a way that moſt I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47410:55"/>
am ſure have not cuſed, and ſew know, and my ſelf lately received it from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Prelate, every way ingenious and ingenuous, as well as an excellent Floriſt, whoſe name I have not leave (and therefore with Reverence forbear) to mention it in ſuch a trifle as this Book. The way then and ſecret is this,</p>
                     <p>After you find that your ſeed Veſſels of your beſt Flowers (left for that purpoſe) are ripe, which may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by the Pods opening at the top, and the ſtalks being withered, cut them all off: Keeping their heads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, (as directed in <hi>Auricula</hi>'s) which will fall out to be in <hi>July,</hi> ſooner or later, as the heat and mildneſs of the ſeaſon ſutes, tying the Pods of your beſt Flowers by themſelves, and up to the Bar of a Sunny Window, which will perfect the ripeneſs of the ſeed; let them ſo remain till about the end of <hi>September;</hi> and then ſeparate the Flat or Parſnip-like ſeed from the chaff, by gently blowing it away with your mouth. Still preferring the beſt by it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in your boxes of about ſix inches deep; fill them four inches full of the fineſt ſifted Mould you can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47410:55"/>
get; let it be light and rich, not too ſandy for this uſe, or rather ridled in and not preſſed down, but as equally thick as you can, upon which ſow your beſt ſeeds not too thick, but that they may be half an inch aſunder; then riddle more of the ſame earth over them not above half an inch thick, and you have done as yet with that in Boxes. If you ſow in Beds, let them be thus prepared; empty your Beds four inches deep of their old Earth, laying Tiles flat all over on the reſt, then fill them up again upon the Tiles with the fineſt Sifted earth, as in your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Boxes, no higher than before; let the earth lie light and even, and thereon ſow your ſeeds, and cover them as directed, when ſown in Caſes or Boxes; theſe ſown in Beds by reaſon of the earth under the Tiles will be apt enough to keep that above moiſt, but a little watering now and then, when <hi>March</hi> approaches, will be convenient for thoſe ſeeds ſown in Boxes or Caſes: But where is this rare ſecret all this while? any Floriſts reaſon may tell him in the ſhalloweſneſs of the ſoil the ſeeds are ſowed in; for from their firſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47410:56"/>
rooting, from each root runs a ſtring of a conſiderable length into the ground drawing that little bulb, it proceeds from, after it, in which it ſpends it ſelf till it meets with oppoſition, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that year a root no bigger than an ordinary big pins head; now were that ſtringy ſubſtance prevented, which is more than three or four times the quantity of the root, nature would throw that into the ſubſtance of the root, and by that means leave you a root as big the firſt year, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in three, which muſt neceſſarily, by ſo much time haſten the flowring of the ſeeds ſown, and no way to do that, but by checking its progreſs by a cloſe oppoſition, which the evenneſs of the ſoil in Boxes or Caſes, and the nearneſs of the Tiles in Beds, is available in: Let not the eaſineſs of its performance make it ſlighted, for all ſecrets are ſo, when once ſhown; as the way to make an Egg ſtand on one end, on a bare Table, that made the Country-man ſo angry for looſing his Wager, when afterwards, he could have done it himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus mannaged ſeeds, the roots from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47410:56"/>
them each year, till they flower, may be taken up, aſſoon as the ſingle leaves they produce are dried down or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, and kept choicely free from moiſture or too much drineſs, till the later end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and then ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at wider diſtances; three years may make them produce two leaves, and that year they flower: but after the firſt year you may ſet them in a deeper ſoil, but not barren; for a rich one to thrive in is beſt, tho a barrener and ſandiſh one to flower in, and that not conſtantly neither, for a rich one, one year, and a barrener another is the beſt for trying experiments on ſuch flowring roots as Tulips: Yet have I tried the richeſt earth for one Bed of Tulips ſeveral years, and have found them come conſtantly well marked: Modes, that is, ſelf colours, I would ſet them in as barren Earth one year as would but keep them alive, and in the other extream the next, to force to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigate: As for Tulips, ſo for other flowers, be provided a year before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for apted ſoils to their natures, making new compoſitions every year, that may by concocting and often turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47410:57"/>
over till you uſe it: this you will find no ſmall advantage to other flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as Tulips, of which let me thus take my fancy in verſifying.

narrow leav'd or ſoft <hi>Anemonies,</hi> are more valued than the broad or hard leaved ones, being of greater variety, of divers colours, whether plain, edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, marked or ſtriped: which on tall ſtalks bear fair and long flowers of one row of broad leaves, with a hairy head in the middle, which after the flowers are paſt, grows big and long, yielding ſtore of flat brown ſeeds, wrapped in down, which muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gather'd as the down riſes, elſe they will be blown away.</p>

to them; if theſe ſigns of diſtaſte appear, take them up as ſoon as the green leaves turn yellow, put them into ſand, and in ſome dry place for a month, and afterwards taken out and kept in Papers in ſome dry but cool place, till their time of planting; for ſhould the roots lie in the ground after their fibres be gone, if the Earth was too barren, they would languiſh, not having received ſufficient nouriſhment from it; if too rank, or over hot by undigeſted muck in it, they would moſt of them rot and conſume away, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a rainy ſeaſon follow.</p>
                     <p>For raiſing new varieties, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence yearly acquaints us, that ſome double <hi>Latifolia's</hi> bear ſeeds, as the double Orange Tawney, which ſown, yield pretty varieties, but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, reds, or Crimſons, very few, or ſuch as draw too near their Original, to be call'd new faces, only a little deeper or lighter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the light colours are preferable, as white Aſh colour, Bluſh or Carnation, light O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, Skie colour, and Pink, whether ſingle or double, if bearing ſeed; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the <hi>Tenuifolia's.</hi>

                     <p>All your ſeed obtain'd, lay it to dry for a week or more, then in a Baſon or Earthen Veſſel, rub it with a little ſand or dry earth gently, to ſeparate the ſeed from the wool or down that encompaſs it: let the Earth be fine and proportionable to your ſeed, with which you part it from its down, which muſt be ſtirred or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed till there none appears; about the Full Moon in <hi>July</hi> next enſuing, let it be ſown, (and ſo gain a year in its growth) on a ſmooth bed of fine ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earth, or rather in Pots, Boxes or Tubs not too thin, for all will not come up, then gently ſift ſome fine freſh earth over them, half a finger

thick is full ſufficient for this firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, a month after they are come up, Riddle over them again fine light earth to the ſame thickneſs; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, ſhould the Seaſon be dry, often gently watering them; thus doing you ſhall have them ſpring up and grow able before Winter, to abide its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of froſts or cold, if in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, you uſe ſome little care to cover them with Peaſe Straw or ſuch like, ſupported by ſticks that it lies not too near, or far from them: The next year in <hi>Autumn,</hi> they ought to be taken up and ſet in fine looſe and freſh mould, as rich as may be, but beware of too much muck, at ſuch diſtance as bearing roots, which many will prove the year following, all of them the third year, tho ſome have affirm'd from ſeeds ſo ſown, they have had <hi>Anemonies</hi> in flower within ten months from their time of ſowing.</p>
                     <p>You may do well to put a thin layer of rotten ſally Wood or Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low earth, under your young Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny roots, at their firſt tranſplanting, it will cauſe them the ſooner to put

                        <hi>Roſa Hiſpanica Moſchata,</hi> The Spaniſh Musk-Roſe, riſes as high as the laſt, with greater green branches, and bigger green leaves; the flowers ſingle, of five large white leaves, with an eye of bluſh in them, ſcented like the laſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Roſa Eglenteria, flore duplici,</hi> The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eglentine, differs only from the wild one in that the flowers are double, of two ſometimes three rows of leaves, of a pretty reddiſh colour, leaves and flowers ſcented like the wild and ſingle kind. All theſe Roſes I have, more or leſs of a kind, which bring forth their fair flowers in <hi>June,</hi> and continue flowring all that Month, and moſt of <hi>July,</hi> except thoſe onely expreſſed in their deſcription; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47410:90"/>
the beſt of theſe ſweet and profitable flowers you will find this *; and ſuch no floriſt ought to be without.</p>
                     <p>Roſes are increaſed by inoculating the buds of them in other ſtocks, or by laying down the branches in the earth; the beſt ſtocks to inoculate upon, which muſt be done about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> are the Damask, White, <hi>Francford,</hi> the wild Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine.</p>
                     <p>All ſtocks of budded roſes muſt be kept from ſuckers, and the buds inoculated as near the ground as may be, that after one years growth, the budded lance may be laid in earth to root; firſt prick about a joynt that will lye in the earth many holes with an awl, and then cover it with good Mould: this done in the Spring, and ſo pegged down that it riſe not again, if water'd now and then in dry ſeaſons, by Autumn will be ſo rooted as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and cut from its other part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the roots, and becomes a natural Tree, one whereof is worth ten others that are onely budded or grafted, for that every Sucker that comes from them will be of the ſame kind.</p>
                     <p>But ſince all Roſes are not apt to yield Suckers, therefore the ſureſt way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47410:90"/>
any, is gently to bend down part of the Tree, or the whole in the Spring, as before expreſt, and lay all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as before directed in the ground, and apply to them old and well-rotted dung, about the places where they are laid, 'twill make them root the ſooner, and you by Autumn have as many root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trees of the ſame kind as Branches laid in the earth, without prejudice to the old one, which when the new ones cut off, may be eaſily brought to its place again, and the next year bear as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as ever; nor does this hinder the bearing of flowers, for the branches laid will be as plentifully ſtored as if the Tree erect and not laid, ſo that they looſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the profit nor pleaſure of that year, and Trees bearing Roſes.</p>
                     <p>The double yellow Roſe bears not ſo well when thus natural as others, nor in the Sun as other Roſes, but muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſhade, and for its better bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and faireſt flowers, firſt in the ſtock of a <hi>Francford</hi> Roſe (as my Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law Mr. <hi>Rea</hi> well advis'd) put in the Bud of a ſingle yellow Roſe near the ground, which will quickly ſhoot to a good length: about a foot higher in that ſprout,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47410:91"/>
put into it a bud of the double yellow Roſe, the beſt kind, which growing, keep Suckers from the root, (as in all other Roſes inoculated) and rub off all buds, but of that kind deſired, when big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear: the preceding winter prune it very near, cutting off all the ſmall ſhoots, and only leave the bigger, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the tops of them alſo as far as they are ſmall; in the Spring when it buds for leaves, rub off the ſmalleſt of them, and when it buds for flowers, if too many, let the ſmalleſt be wiped off, leaving ſo many of the faireſt as you think the ſtrength of the Tree may bring to perfection, which ſhould be a ſtandard then up to a wall, and rather ſhaded than in too much heat of the Sun, and in dry weather ſometimes water'd; by which means you may expect fair and beautiful flowers, ſuch that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence your pains in their propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>For the making Roſes come earlier then ordinary, as ſome adviſe, by placing them in a declining houſe againſt the Sun, and watering with water inriched with hotteſt dung diſſolved therein, or ſhavings of Horn and Lime ſteeped in it,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47410:91"/>
or watering with warm water, to acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate their blowing earlier than they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally do; I truly think it not worth the while, becauſe other beautiful flowers would be in being, and diminiſh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their glory, which is the more, blowing in a ſeaſon when none others to vie with them; and if ſuch means as before expreſt uſed, I have reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the killing of Trees thereby, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved loſs for following irrational and unexperimented impoſitions.</p>
                     <p>But for retarding the blowing of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that is more acceptable, eſpecially when no more pains than ſheering off the buds when they new put forth, and then when others are quitting their lovely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments they will be putting on theirs; and I ſuppoſe a ſecond ſheering them off, may cauſe them to be as much more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo have Roſes when no other flowers in being; but then be ſure to ſerve the whole Tree ſo, for if you ſheer but one part of it, the part unſheer'd will ſpend that ſtrength and ſap that you expected ſhould put forth new buds in the places of thoſe cut off, and ſo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate your defign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47410:92"/>
As ſoon as your Roſes done blowing, cut them with your ſhears pretty cloſe to the old wood; and near the Spring each branch ought to be cut again with a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knife, cloſe to a leaf, bud and all dead parts taken away, or any that is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, to bring your Tree in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome form; they are all hardy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſevereſt winters well enough; they may be diſpoſed up and down your Garden in Buſhes, or to the walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your Fruit, or ſet in rows and hedges, intermixing the ſeveral colours ſo, as to have no two of like colours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the well-placing them much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances their proſpect to the eye, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the diſpoſer of them.</p>
                     <p>Let none of your Roſe-trees grow high, which is diſgraceful, rather lower than above yard and half, except your Musk-Roſes, which bear not well except againſt a wall, pale, or houſe-ſide, and ſuffered to grow to their full height, which uſually is eight or nine foot high.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Dew-empearled, Muskie, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant perfuming flowers, deſerve the moſt principal place among all others whatſoever, being not only eſteemed for its beauty, vertues, and odoriferous ſcents,

                  <p>I have heard but of two kinds that are of three colours; the one is, <hi>Bedford-</hi>Tawny, Tawny, Scarlet, and white.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the beſt of each ſort now in requeſt, and to be had as my Gardens furniture may declare; there flowering from the middle (ſometimes beginning) of <hi>July,</hi> till the ſame time in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A chief thing to be conſidered, for their producing fair and gallant flowers, and many Layers, is the Soil wherein
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47410:107"/>
they ought to be planted, which muſt be neither too ſtiff, nor over-light; the beſt courſe is to provide a quantity of good freſh earth, that which the Mole caſts out of good ground, that is not ſtiff nor over-ſandy, that hath lain long untill'd, or taken four or five inches deep from under the Sward; but I prefer the Mole-hills beſt, that have not been long caſt up, and mix the ſame with a third part of Ox, Cow, or ſheep-dung, that hath been long made, intermingling a little lime; leave your heap high and round, that it take not too much wet; let it lie by ſo long till well digeſted, which will be the ſooner effected, if often tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over and well ſtir'd together; and be ſure this Earth be well mellowed ere you put it in pots or beds for planting your Layers in, and your ſucceſs in flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be the more proſperous, taking off your Layers either in <hi>September,</hi> or in <hi>March,</hi> which I account always beſt; from your Layers cut off all dead leaves, and the tops of all that are too long, and then take them up, with earth about the roots, and ſet them in your pots, filled with the before-mentioned prepared earth, which ſet in the ſhade, and gently
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47410:107"/>
watered, will grow well, and then they may be removed into the morning-ſun, which is the onely Sun theſe flowers willingly admit of; never over-glut any with water, and moiſten them not with any out of Well or Pump, till it hath ſtood two days at leaſt in ſome veſſel ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for raw water too much chills, and rather backs tender Plants, than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages their growth and flouriſhing, nay, often deſtroys many. In winter till <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> water in the morning, otherways your moiſtned earth about tender roots, may ſo freeze, as to kill them; and after that time, the Sun growing more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in heat, water in the evening, and your pots as ſoon as the Sun off them; otherwiſe the Suns heat exhales the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture before it can have time to give due refreſhment to the Plants.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of earth for <hi>July-</hi>flowers I was acquainted with by one Mr. <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi> Gardiner to the worthy Sir <hi>John Packington</hi> of <hi>Weſtwood</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> in which I ſaw his flowers flouriſh and mark beyond expectation; it was thus compounded.</p>
                  <p>Rotten Tan, <hi>i. e.</hi> the relicks or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of a Tanners pit, that by long lying, is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47410:108"/>
converted to earth, this layn on a heap for a quarter of a year to ſweeten, for in its own nature 'tis too ſour for ſuch uſes; to one barrow-full of which, four of good rotten wood-pile earth, and the rubbiſh of old-walls, for want of which a little old decayed lime, a quarter of a peck at moſt, mixed well together, and let lie a fortnight ere you put it in your pots for your <hi>July-</hi>flower-layers to be tranſplanted in, is a ſecret few know.</p>
                  <p>When your flowers begin to ſpindle, nip off all but one or two at the moſt of the biggeſt at each root, leaving them only to bear flowers; and when they come to bud for flowering, nip off all thoſe too, but three or four that are beſt placed, by this means will your flowers be the fairer, and more layers gained; by which your kinds are continued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Remember to be often tying up their ſpindles, as they grow in height, to ſmall rods, ſet by them on purpoſe for their ſupport, leſt by their bending down they break off, and you looſe the pleaſure of their flowers.</p>
                  <p>From the middle of <hi>June,</hi> till the ſame time in <hi>July,</hi> is the prime time of laying <hi>July-</hi>flowers: which is thus performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:47410:108"/>
Make choice of ſuch ſlips as are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, having joynts ſufficient for laying; prune off the ſide and end of the top-leaves, cut the undermoſt part of the middlemoſt joynt half through, from thence ſlit the ſtalk through the middle upwards to the next joynt; open the earth underneath to receive it, then gently bend it down therein, with a ſmall hook-ſtick ſtuck in the earth to keep it down, keeping up the head of the ſlip, that the ſlit may be open, and ſo preſſed down and earthed up, which as ſoon as performed, muſt be ſure to be water'd, which muſt be often reiterated, eſpecially if the ſeaſon dry, it will make them root the ſooner, and ſhoot forth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres ſufficient to be removed with earth about them the beginning of <hi>September</hi> following, into pots or beds of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned prepared Earth, which muſt be ſhaded and gently watered; but take heed of too much moiſture, leſt it rot their young and tender fibres; therefore for preventing great rains, ſhelter them under boards ſupported by forks and ſticks laid on them, but not too near them, leſt on the other hand they periſh for want of Air, in a freedom of which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47410:109"/>
they chiefly delight, many having been ſuffocated for want thereof, as too cloſe houſing in winter hath ſhewed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and in tranſplanting your lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſet them not too deep, for that hath rotted and ſpoiled many.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>July-</hi>flowers in Summer ſhoot up but with one ſtem or ſtalk, without any layer; if you ſuffer it to blow, the root dies, therefore if you have no more of that kind, ſuffer it not to flower, but timely cut off the ſpindle that it may ſprout anew, which preſerves the root.</p>
                  <p>When any <hi>July-</hi>flowers in your pots die, empty it of its old earth, and put in new before you plant another <hi>July-</hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it, otherwiſe the proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being drawn out, and ſpent by the firſt flower, will viſibly appear in the ill thriving of this ſecond.</p>
                  <p>When your roots produce too many layers, if in good flowers, covet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or four to be laid, for they draw ſo much nouriſhment from the root, as not enough to aſcend to the flower, ſo hindring both fairneſs and bigneſs; but in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> (not too far in the laſt Month neither) ſeek out from the ſtems ſuch ſhoots onely, as are reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47410:109"/>
ſtrong, that run not up to ſpindle: cut theſe off cloſe to the ſtem, and throw them in a pail of water for twenty four hours, then in a bed of rich and fine mould, that hath been ſifted through a wire riddle, cutting off your ſlip cloſe at a joynt, trimming away the lower leaves cloſe to the ſtalk, and cut off the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt even at the top, make a hole in the earth with a little ſtick, and put your ſlip therein ſo deep, that the upper leaf may be wholly above ground; then cloſe the ground to the ſtem of the Plants; and laſtly water them, remembring to do it often, unleſs rain ſaves you that labour, and that this bed be as much as may be in the ſhade.</p>

                     <p>Now for the watering all the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plants and Flowers obſerve with me.</p>
                     <p>If you fear dry weather, do not defer too long before you water, but do it gently before the earth is too dry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had to the depth of your roots and thoſe that are deepeſt water moſt; and when you begin to water continue it as long as you find occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Uſe not Well water, for tender Plants,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47410:131"/>
for it is ſo ſtrained thorough the earth or rather barren Sands or Rocks, and for want of the Sun ſo chill and cold, that having no nouriſhment, rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, doth more hurt than good; Rivers that run quick and long on ſharp gravel are little better, but if you are forced to uſe ſuch, let it ſtand ſometime in Tubs in the Sun mixed with Dung.</p>
                     <p>Let the quantity and quality of the Dung mixed with the water, be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of your plants; if your Plants be great growers and require heat, then put Horſe-dung in your water: If your water be bad, then put dung into it to help it; Let it ſtand in the Sun and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air uncovered: If your Plants be fine and tender; then put Sheep or Cowes dung, Deer or Aſſes dung in to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the worſe the ground and more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, be ſure to put in the more Dung. Take care you water no Plants with ſtanding ſtinching Ditch water, nor no water that ſtinketh; for ſweet water, (not too clear) and freſh mould (not muſty or tainted by ſtinking weeds) is as proper for tender Plants, as ſweet and good food, warm and clean lodging, for tender and fine bred perſons.</p>

Rain water is very good if not too long kept, but if your Veſſel be large, the oftner you ſtir it the longer it will keep ſweet.</p>
                     <p>Large and Navigable Rivers, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much ſoil by waſhing ſtreets, and the many ſinks that run into it, and which by its own motion doth cleanſe it ſelf from that which is noxious, both to man and plants, is an excellent water for all ſorts of plants.</p>
                     <p>The larger the Ponds be, the better the water is for Plants, the opener to the Sun the better, the more motion they have, by horſes waſhing in them, or Geeſe and Ducks ſwimming, 'tis ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Water all ſeeds with the ſmalleſt or rain-like drops you can, and not too much at a time or to fiercely, leſt you diſcover them.</p>
                     <p>For Flowers and Plants whoſe leaves lie on the ground, water them at ſome diſtance, by making a hollow Circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the plant and pouring water into it, by which means you avoid annoying the leaves by diſcolouring water, or chilling the roots by too ſuddain coldneſs.</p>
                     <p>Uſe not any Liquors, for watering ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>In Summer time or all warm Seaſons, the Evening is beſt for watring, becauſe the Water will have time to ſink into the Earth, and the Plant attract it, before the Suns heat exhales it; But in Winter or cold Weather, the Morning is the moſt proper time, that the ſuperfluous moiſture may be evaporated ere the cold Night overtake you, and Chill perhaps kill a tender Plant.</p>
                     <p>A Plant that delights in moiſture, or a drooping Plant that you think water will preſerve, may be watred by filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſet an earthen, or wooden Veſſel on a Brick full of Water near your Plant, that all the Water may be higher than the Earth; wet a thick woollen Liſt, put one end with a Stone or bit of Lead to it into the Water, that it may keep to the bottom; lay the other end on the Ground near the Root of the Plant, and the Water will diſtil out of the Boul or Pot through the Liſt, becauſe that part of it out of the Pot of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hangs lower than that within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Experience gives us this Truth, that ſuch Flowers as differ in number of leaves, in ſhape, in colours; the Seeds of ſuch will produce Flowers much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the ordinary kind of Flowers, tho produced all of one Flower but a year or two before: Nay, a particular Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer among many other of one Plant, ſhall bring more double ones, than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty others that are not qualified as it; and is, or ought to be known to all that raiſe Flowers; as for Example, the Stock-Gilly flower that hath five, ſix or more leaves, the Seed of ſuch a particular Flower or Flowers, will produce more double ones, than thoſe Plants that bring forth but four leaves, quantity for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Seed, twenty for one. This Flower indeed ſhews it more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I know; for having no Thrum in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47410:133"/>
the middle as many others have, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given it this ſign to inform us, that thoſe that have a leaf or leaves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it more than its uſual kind, will bring forth thoſe with many leaves, and make a fine double Flower; which when it hath attain'd to, it then is come to the bounds of Nature, it neaver beareth Seeds more, but by endeavouring, blows it ſelf to death.</p>
                     <p>If you be curious, as Floriſts ought to be, you may obſerve the ſame Rule in ſeveral other Flowers that have no Thrum in the middle; as Auricula's, Primroſes, Wall-flowers, Campians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When you find one or more leaves than your ordinary number, you may conclude, there Nature hath ſet one ſtep forward in altering from the ordinary kind; There a Lover of Plants ſhould be diligent, and whenſoever you ſee your Miſtreſs Nature, (for Floriſts are her Servants) ſtep out of door, (like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Uſher) wait upon her to her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end; For 'tis on the diligent ſhe beſtows her favours. Thoſe Flowers alſo which bear Seeds when double, as the Gillyflower, Affrican, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſowing the Seeds of ſuch double Flowers, they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47410:134"/>
will bring you more and better flowers, a hundred to one than ſingle ones; and in ſowing the Seed of ſuch, you ſhall have ſeveral varieties, but moſt marked with the colour of the Mother-Plant; and ſome of theſe will run as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of Nature, and then they will break, or have Pods in the middle, and then never bear ſeed more. July<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers have alſo their ſign, which will bear Seed and which will not: Thoſe that will bring ſeed (if weather and other accidents hinder not) have their Horns in the middle of the Flower: It is obſerved alſo in the marking of flowers, that the ſeed of thoſe that be ſtriped, ſhall bring the moſt ſtriped ones, and ſome of different colours and ſtripes their ſeed all alike.</p>

                  <head>The REASONS of inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ALMANACK, are,</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>THat the Gardener or young Flowerist may do all things in due and fit Seaſons, and the more knowing be each month minded of what he otherwiſe may forget, and ſo be prejudiced in Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Setting, or Removing Plants or Flowers unſeaſonably: for the wiſe</hi> Solomon <hi>(who was best skill'd in all Plants) avers,</hi> That to every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. <hi>And as to Seaſons of the year, ſo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To ſutable Aſpects and influences of the Planets, the</hi> Moon <hi>in chief, as nearest, and under whoſe influence are the ſucceſsful growth of most Plants and Flowers, and their managing to be ſuited as ſhe is placed in the Signes, or to her
<pb facs="tcp:47410:151"/>
increaſe,</hi> viz. <hi>the first quarter, her being in full; her decreaſe,</hi> viz. <hi>the last quarter, new or change; for which reaſon you are informed of each in the enſuing Kalendar: As for example, in ſome few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If you prune your Vines the</hi> Moon <hi>in full, and poſited in</hi> Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, <hi>or</hi> Sagittary, <hi>neither Worms nor Birds will infest your Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Trees are not to be grafted, the</hi> Moon <hi>wayning or not to be ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Cut what Trees you would have quickly grow again, when the</hi> Moon <hi>is above the Earth, in the firſt quarter; and if it may be, joyn'd to</hi> Jupiter <hi>or</hi> Venus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Sow or plant when the</hi> Moon <hi>is in</hi> Taurus, Virgo, <hi>or</hi> Scorpio, <hi>and in good Aſpect of</hi> Saturn.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Set or ſow all kind of Pulſe the</hi> Moon <hi>in</hi> Cancer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Dreſs your Gardens, and trim your ſmall Trees and Shrubs, when the</hi> Moon <hi>is in</hi> Libra <hi>or</hi> Capricorn.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:47410:151"/>
7. <hi>Set or cut any Tree or Shrub that you would have its growth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, in the decreaſe of the</hi> Moon <hi>in</hi> Cancer.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Set, cut, or ſow what you would have ſpeedily ſhoot out again, or ſpring and grow, in the increaſe of the</hi> Moon.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>When you ſow to have double Flowers, do it in the full of the</hi> Moon; <hi>and when the Plant's grown to a bigneſs fit to be removed, do it alſo in a full</hi> Moon, <hi>and as often as you tranſplant them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Neither graft, ſet, ſow, or plant any thing that day whereon there happeneth an Eclipſe either of</hi> Sun <hi>or</hi> Moon, <hi>or when the</hi> Moon <hi>is afflicted by either of the Infortunes</hi> Saturn <hi>or</hi> Mars. <hi>I might have given you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; but theſe may be ſufficient at preſent.

                     <p>The beſt way of grafting old Stocks, known by few: Cut the body of the Tree off four or five foot above the ground; when the head pared, take a ſmall Gouge, ſuch as Joyners uſe, with which ſtrike out a ſmall ſcollop out of the ſtake where you intend to place each Graft; then with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wnimble bore a hole in every Scollop into the wood of the Stock; then mark your Grafts with the ſame Gouge through the Rind, and fit the lower parts of them to the holes, ſo as that your Scollops of the Grafts and Stock may joyn together; then clay them according to the rule of grafting. Stocks thus grafted ſhall be cover'd in three years, and bear plentifully: the Cions will grow moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therefore prune the inward parts, leaving the outmoſt ſprouts, for ſpreaders. This way preſerves old moil Trees the longer in being, that otherwiſe would have decayed: place Earth a foot length about boughs for circumpoſition.

Take out your Indian Tuberoſes, parting their off-ſets (not breaking their fangs) and put them in natural Earth (not forced) in a Pot; a larger of rich Mould beneath, and about it to nouriſh the fibres, but not touch the bulbs: then plunge your Pots in a Hot-bed temperately warm, giving them no water till they ſpring, and then put them under a South-wall; in dry weather water them freely, and expect in <hi>Auguſt</hi> a rare Flower. Thus treat the Narciſſus of <hi>Japan,</hi> or <hi>Garnſey-</hi>Lilly for a later Flower. Put Tilts over your beſt Tulips, which are commonly ſet together to be ſo ſerved. Begin to open the doors and windows of your Green houſe, and uſe the Inhabitants by degrees to the Air. Shelter your young ſeedling Auricula's from hot gleams of the Sun, or expect them all to be kill'd: What Auricula's that are ſtriped, that any part of them come of a ſelf-colour, ſo mark that it may, if not preſently, be parted from the reſt: for otherwiſe 'twill infect the whole, and after come all of a ſelf-colour, and never return again.

                  <p>UNder the Number at the top, 1683. you have the Quarters, Change and Full of the Moon; and under that, the Moons and Suns places in the Signes, for that year, entitled <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> pl. ☉ place.</p>
                  <p>Under the number 1684. you have the Moons place in the Signes, and time of Sun riſe; and the Moons Quarters, Full, and New, over them, as in the other.</p>
                  <p>Under 1685. what Signe the Moon is in, and Sun ſetting.</p>
                  <p>Under 1686. Moons place and Break of Day, for every fifth day of the month.</p>
                  <p>And in 1687. Moons place, and the Length of the Day for every fifth day of the month.</p>
                  <p>Now for Length of Day and Night, if it be not the ſame as ſet down that you would know, take that of them that is neareſt to it: So in that for Break of Day; or if you will be ſo exact, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the time betwixt them. Any of theſe in each month, ſerves the ſaid month in every year. Thus much ſaid, there needs no more for the reſt.</p>
