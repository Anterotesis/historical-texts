            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> where his Court is, he hath a very fair House adjoyning to his Castle,<note place="margin">His Court.</note> which is called his <hi>Chancery.</hi> In the which place are five principall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, or Courts.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105735:5"/>
with a few others, whereof the chiefest be Doctors of the Civil Law, doe daily sit to consult of matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance touching the state of his Country: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of forreign Princes Ambassadours, dispatching of his Ambassadours to forreign Princes: the bestowing of his Children in marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Counsell, whereof the Chancelour is cheife, is of a few Civillians,<note place="margin">2.

In the which all Civill controversies and causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Subjects, and Actions, both personall,<note place="margin">3. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</note> and reall, are by Law decided, and in the which, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if he be injured by his Prince, may have the Law against him, from the which Court, it is not lawful to apeal to the Chamber of the Empire, except the cause doth surmount the some of six hundred <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Counsell is the Consistory Court and is of Civillians, and Spirituall men,<note place="margin">4. Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell.</note> wherein all Church matters, both for Doctrine, and Discipline are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: Testaments proved, and controversies in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage decided.</p>
            <p>This Prince hath reformed this Court, and whereas before, it had no other Counsellours then Spirituall men,<note place="margin">His refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the spiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Court.</note> now he hath joyned together with them, certain honest discreet Ministers, some of his wisest and best-learned Counsellours.</p>
            <p>The fifth Counsell (whereof the <hi>Camer Master,</hi> that is the Chamberlain or the Treasurer is President) is of certain Doctors, and of houshould Officers,<note place="margin">5 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</note> in the which there is accompt taken of all his Revenues, how his debts are to be paid, his Houshold ordered and served, his Lands sett and lett, his Customes and Tolls examined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105735:6"/>This Prince maintaineth commonly in his Court of all sorts of People twenty four Tables,<note place="margin">Officers of his Court.</note> eight persons to every Table, the which do eat commonly in two sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all places. In the one place, which is a faire large Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, sitteth himself, his Wife and Children, at one Table standing alone in the upper end of the Chamber: and his Gentlewomen, and Preachers at two other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and about ten Tables more adjoyning to those, two Tables which stand in a rowe, on one side of the said Chamber, whereat doe sit his Gentlemen, who immediatly after the Prince is set down, do likewise sit and eat continually at one hour, which is at ten and at five of the clock.</p>
            <p>In the other place the rest of his Family; as his Guard (which are twenty four Halberders) with others of his Yeomen, and Groomes, together with all the Officers and Gentlemen Servants, who likwise eat together at one time, which is at nine and four of the clocke: before which houres they are continually warned by the noise of eight Trumpets and two kettle Drummes.</p>
            <p>His Houshold Officers, be the Marshall, the Steward, the Treasurer, the Secretary, and the Clarke of the Kitchen: The Marshall first placeth all men and seeth good order kept: the Steward seeth all things provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the House and Houshould: The Treasurer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burseth the money: The Secretary taketh the accompt and writeth the Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Clarke of the Kitchen seeth all things ordered in the Kitchen, and everv one served according to their degrees, and of all the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould expences keepeth a Book. The Prince is served in Silver with four courses, besides fruit, and in every course nine covered Dishes, which three Gentlemen with their Caps on their Heads, do alwayes bring to the Carver, having the Marshall to goe before them with his staffe, and when they have delivered their Dishe, they sit lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise down at a Table appointed only for them in the same Chamber. There waiteth ordinarily on the Prince at the Table, a Sewer, a Carver, a Gentleman of his Chamber
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105735:6"/>
that waiteth on his Cup, and taketh the same, and two or three Pages that waite on his trencher which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alwayes giveth. The Carver giveth every one to eat in like sort as it is at the Lord Majors of <hi>London</hi> his Table. All the other Tables be served by the Princes Guard. In the Princes Chamber, one of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth alwayes say Grace, both before and after meat, and in the common Hall the Clark of the Kitchen, who is there in the Place of the Marshall, causeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thankes to be given to God by one of the poor Schollers that the Prince keepeth of purpose. The meat that is left in both places is alwayes forthwith giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the poor by the <hi>Almner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Counsellors have alwayes allowed them every one according to his virtue and quallity, a very good stipend both for his Fee and diet in their own Houses.</p>
            <p>There is straight Discipline in his Court against swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Blasphemy, and Drunkennesse, Whoredom, Fighting and all other kinds of Vices, in which cases notwithstanding, some more respect is had to the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment of a Gentleman, then of an other, and yet none spared.</p>
            <p>Dauncing also is forbidden in his Court, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Land.</p>
            <p>The charge of his Stable hath the Master of his Horse, &amp; every Gentleman that by his commandment keepeth any Horses, is allowed Oates sufficient, and for every Horse tweny five <hi>Dollers</hi> the year, towards pay and stable roome; and every Yeoman twenty five <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because I have entered into some discourse of his Houshould matters,<note place="margin">The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of the <hi>Pallatine.</hi>
               </note> it shall not be impertinent to shew this Princes order, and conversation, how he spendeth his time: both because the example is notable and worthy of all good Princes to be followed, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that hereby he winneth great favour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pele.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105735:7"/>His order is to arise every morning at five of the clock, and at six he cometh to his Chappel, with his Wife, Children, and Family, where one of the three Ministers (which he alwayes keepeth in his Court to say Grace, preach, and administer the Sacrament) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>Psalm</hi> sung by Children, which are kept in his Court for that purpose, doth preach and pray untill seven of the clock, and then the Prince goeth straight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into his Court Chancery, where he tarrieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ten, which is the houre to dine. At dinner he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sitteth two hours, and after dinner one hour, talking with his Wife and Children. After he riseth up (which is about one of the clock) he goeth straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes into his Closet, where he tarrieth till five, in perusing and reading his Subjects supplications, which are duly given to him as he goeth and cometh from the Chancery: the which supplications, the next day he sendeth to every Court as the matter requireth, where immediatly justice is administred. At five of the clock he goeth to supper, where he sitteth two hours, and afterwards either walketh, or otherwise passeth the time with his Wife, and Children untill it be nine, and then he calleth both the Gentlemen, Grooms, and Pages of his Chamber to his Privy Chamber door, where they hear him pray half an hour, and so he goeth to rest. This is the conversation commonly of this good Prince, the which order he breaketh not but upon some very great occasion.</p>
            <p>Somtimes as he sitteth at his Table he heareth his Musitians, whereof he hath five, playing excellently well on <hi>Shalmes</hi> that be made, the one like a Halberd, the second like a Crossebow, the third like a Boarstaff, the fourth like a Handgun, and the fifth like Javeline. The same Musitians have also Cornetts, Violins, and Virginals, which they mingle one with an other, as it is the Princes pleasure to hear them: Other pastimes he exerciseth not, except when he hath no supplications of his Subjects to read, which is very seldome. He then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105735:7"/>
hunteth the Stagge or Hinde, according to the season of the year; or else seeth his Sons and Gentlemn ride his great Horses and run at the Ring, or else rideth about certain Villages, and converteth the Curates, to the understanding of the true Doctrine of the Sacraments, wherein a number of his Country are not yet well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded.</p>
            <p>When this Prince hath any War towards,<note place="margin">His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon some urgent cause for the Weale of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and conservation of his State, he calleth (as the manner is of all other Princes in <hi>Germany</hi>) a Parliament, which they tearm a <hi>Landstage,</hi> to the which all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Country, and certain Burgesses of every City within his Dominions doe come. By whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent, either a Subsidy is granted to be levied of all his Subjects or else new Statuts are made, or old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, or reformed, according to the state and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the time, the which Statuts are called <hi>Quandtz ordnuce</hi>: and are alwayes expounded by the rules of the Civil Law, when their intent is not well otherwise to be understood.</p>
            <p>This Princes Country lieth,<note place="margin">His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> partly along both sides of the River <hi>Rhine</hi> from <hi>Argentine</hi> unto <hi>Collen,</hi> the which he Governeth himself, and partly in <hi>Bavaria superiour,</hi> whereof the principall City is <hi>Amberge,</hi> upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Fills,</hi> where his eldest Son, Duke <hi>Lewis</hi> doth Govern under him, and hath the same order in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministering Justice (as near as the manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will permit) as his father hath at <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> from which place notwithstanding the Subjects may appeal to <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> because that is the highest Court by reason that the Elector, who is chiefe of that House, dwelleth there.</p>
            <p>This Prince, although his Father was a great <hi>Papist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> yet he being perswaded by one of his Sisters that was of the Religion, and chiefly instructed by <hi>Eberhard,</hi> Earle of <hi>Eberbache,</hi> a godly and wise Gentleman, and then Steward to <hi>Ottho Henrye,</hi> his predecessor in the Elector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105735:8"/>
as soon as he came to the same estate, which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1558. he reformed the Religion in his Country, as much as was possible for the obstinacy of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi> And at this day throughout all his Dominions the Gospell is sincerely preached, Images, and other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Ceremonies which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> throughout all <hi>Germany</hi> yet use) were abolished, and the Sacrament as well administred, as it is at present in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the which his reformation he was like to have suffered great trouble in the <hi>Diett</hi> at <hi>Augusta,</hi> in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1566.<note place="margin">His touble in the <hi>Diett</hi> at <hi>Augusta,</hi> for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> Where the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> that now is, with all the Electors, and States of the Empire, his Eledest Son Duke <hi>Lewis,</hi> and his Sons in Law the Dukes <hi>John Fredrick,</hi> and <hi>John William</hi> of <hi>Waymar</hi> in <hi>Saxon,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Swebrooke,</hi> and <hi>Wirtemberge,</hi> were so earnestly bent against him for the same, that in case Duke <hi>Augustus,</hi> the present Elector of <hi>Saxon,</hi> had not been, many supposed that he should have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison. and deprived of his Electorship. In the which Convention he did so wisely, Godly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly defend his cause before them and against them all (having only the Duke of <hi>Casimere</hi> his second Son that stood alwayes by him, with the Bible in one hand and the confession off <hi>Augusta</hi> in the other, that he did convince them and put them all to silence, and during his aboad there, caused his Preachers openly to set forth the true Doctrine of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in their Sermons in his House at <hi>Augusta,</hi> where they had a wonderfull audience, to the great grief and dispight of all the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to knitt up the discourse of this good Princes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Godly conversation, I think it not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to shew what word he useth in all purposes and events, and the which I heard him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eighth day of <hi>Aprill</hi> last in <hi>Anno</hi> 1569. when a great part of his estate at <hi>Heidelburge</hi> was sodenly by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty in the night set on fire, and the whole in great danger to be utterly burnt and consumed notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the exceeding great watch that is nightly there kept by four men, which at every quarter of an hour doe blow great base hornes, and at every hours end do sound Trumpets in four quarters of the said Castle: At that time, even in the extremity of the flame, he said with his hands lift up to Heaven, not once but often, (<hi>Herenach dine will</hi>) which is to say, <hi>Fiat voluntas tua Domine.</hi> Thy will be done, O Lord.</p>
            <p>Now like as before is shewed of the <hi>Count Pallatines</hi> order of Justice, in like sort may be said of the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> now Elector, saving that his Counsels, and Courts of Justice be not all at one place. For his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery where he holdeth his Privy Counsell and Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, are at <hi>Dresden,</hi>

            <p>This Elector, albeit he kepeth not so many Tables in his Court as the <hi>Count Pallatine</hi> doth, yet he kepeth a greater State, and giveth ordinary entertainment to more then the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> doth.

            <p>Of all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the present Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> is the richest, and of the greatest power, both of men and money: for his yearly Rent of Assise is reckned to be above seven hundred thousand <hi>dollers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Taxes, Tolles and Impositions of Beer, and Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is accounted to amount yearly to as much more.</p>

            <p>By the benefit and great quantity of Iron and Copper which are gotten in those Mines, the Prince hath furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such an Armory, at his City of <hi>Dresden,</hi> as by report of them that have travelled farre, the like is not to be found in any other place in <hi>Europe,</hi> I shall describe the order thereof as I did see it the twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> 1569.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105735:10"/>First the House is builded four square of Free stone, the two lengths are each one of them three hundred foot long, and the breadths each one of them one hundred seventy five foot broad, every one of these lengths, and breadths hath three roomes or Stories. In the lowest roomes are the great Ordnance, being about fifty six double Cannons that carry a shot, which waieth one hundred and sixty pound, and three hundred and fifty Culvernis, half Cannons, Cannon pieces, Sacres, Fawcons, Rabnets, and other small Field pieces, all of brasse ready mounted on very good carriages, and furnished with all things necessary, as shot made with the Hammer to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number, Chargers, Scowrers, Horsetraines, Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers tooles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And every of those have three or four great peices hanging for them on the walles, eleven harquebushes, a crock. In the two uppermost roomes or stories are Armor, as Corslets, black and parcell white, very good and of the newest fashion, Calivers, long Curriours; Daggs, Pikes armed and unarmed, Lances, Halberds, Partisons, Holy water sprinkles, two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swordes and swordes with basket hiltes, thirty six En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, Drums, Fiffes, and all other things necessary for the furniture of four Regiments, to every Regiment ten Ensignes, and to every Ensigne three hundred men, which is twelve thousand Footmen, and Curaces for the proofe for two thousand Horsemen, so that of the sodain this Prince is able to furnish into the Field fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men with Armour in every point, which is only in his City of <hi>Dresden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Cities besides at <hi>Lipsia, Wittimberge,</hi> and <hi>Guicca,</hi> are said to have also their severall Armories, besides that every Subject in all his Dominions, to his ability is bound to have his proper furniture both for himself and his Servants, for as many as every man keepeth, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selet, a Harquebush, a Halberd, and a Pike, of the which (that are able to bear Armour) the Prince, if need require, may well make into the Field eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, whereof six thousand shall be Horsemen,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105735:10"/>
leaving his Country notwithstanding with sufficient Guard. This Prince as he hath not the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God like unto the <hi>Count Pallatine,</hi> even so is his conversation such as misliketh all men universally; he is misliked for his inaffability, for ever since the Wars of <hi>Gottha,</hi> he hath kept himself so secret, as no man, except one or two of his Privy Counsell, can either see him or speak with him, he keepeth himself still within his Privy Chamber, where he learneth to play on the Virginals, the which exercise he doth so earnestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as almost he never ceaseth but when he must either eat or sleep. Not long since his mind was to learn the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> whereof he was utterly ignorant, and now he hath so profited in a short time therein, that he is able commonly to understand any thing that is either spoken or written in <hi>Latin.</hi> The great delight that he hath in hunting the Stagg, and wild Boar, bringeth him some time abroad, but then he is so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied on either side with all his Guard, and with at the least, four hundred Horsemen that no man almost, for what cause so ever it be, is suffered to come to his speech: he seldom giveth any Princes Ambassadors audience in his own person, but answereth them by his Chancelour or chief Councellour. The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> do not love him, (although by reason of his great power and authority, they flatter him) because of his extream dealing with his kinsman, Duke <hi>John Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> from whose Father Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> this Electors Brother did take the Electorship and the most part of this living besides (all which the said Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> dying without issue male, left unto Duke <hi>Augustus</hi> his Brother, whereupon such displeasure grew between these Houses (as I shall hereafter declare) that the eldest Son of <hi>John Frederick</hi> the old Elector, is spoiled both of all his Land &amp; Liberty.</p>
            <p>Further this Duke <hi>Augustus</hi> is hated of his Nobility and Gentlemen, as well for the cause last recited, as also for purchasing of late the Lands of one <hi>Miltitz,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105735:11"/>
in <hi>Misnia</hi> in a manner against his will, for the which he paid one hundred and sixty thousand <hi>Guildr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and as it is said, the Woods only on the same Lands, were worth as much. He offendeth his Nobility also for his other cruelties, in tormenting of Men with such Deaths, and specially for cutting in four peices of late on <hi>Carolutius,</hi> a Gentleman of an ancient House and one of his Houshould servitors, who albeit he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things worthy of death, yet the manner of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution seemed so strange, and was so odious to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Court<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as they all went forth of the City that day that he suffered death. The People of his Cities love him not for his Covetousnesse, because there is no traffique nor handleing whereof there may arise any commodity or gain, but he getteth it into his own hands. As for example, the gain that they were wont to have in buying and selling the Mettall that riseth of his Mines, he hath now taken into his own hands. Besides that he maketh Silke, dieth Cloth, selleth Malt, and handleth every thing himself whereof any proffit may grow. He hath furthermore raised such taskes and impositions upon his People, and hath turned the Tenants out of certain Lands that he lately purchased, whose Ancestors have held the same time out of mind: and they know not now where to place themselves again, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the same to his own use, in such sort as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Country there is great complaint of him. All these things are the more grievous, and specially marked, by reason that the memory of the late Princes his predecessors, is fresh, who albeit in some respects wanted not their faults, yet generally, for affability, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulness, and liberallity, were very much commended; The cause why this Elector was s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>irred to deal so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Cozen <hi>John Frederick,</hi> I think it not amiss to insert in this place, as well because it is not yet to my knowledge set forth truly by any other, as also for that upon the grudg between the Princes of this House, dependeth almost the Weale or ruine of all <hi>Germany,</hi> by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105735:11"/>
reason of the Alliances that either part hath with the most Noblest Houses, not onely in <hi>Dutchland,</hi> but in other Kingdoms neer about. The story as I have heard it credibly reported is this, In <hi>Anno</hi> 1567, <hi>John Frederick</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> Son unto <hi>John Frederick</hi> the late Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> kept within his Jurisdiction one <hi>William Grombache,</hi> and certain other Rebels to the Empire, for the which cause he was also declared by a publick Decree, a Rebell to the same State of the Empire. This <hi>Grombache</hi> was an Ancient Captain about threescore and ten years old, born in <hi>Franconia,</hi> of a Noble and Ancient house, and from his Youth was brought up in the exercise of War, and was of nature sediciously disposed, always attempting new designs in his Countrey; for in the Wars that Marquess <hi>Albert</hi> made against the Bishops and Churchmen, he took part with him, and never left him so long as he kept the field. And although he was oftentimes called home by the Bishop of <hi>Wertzburge,</hi> whose Vassall he was, under the pain of Confiscation; yet he continued with the said Marquess untill he was overthrown: Whereupon the Bishop seized on his Goods and Lands. After the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Marquess <hi>Albert</hi> he went into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the second, of whom he received great summes of money to levy Souldiers to serve against the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>; but peace being concluded between them at <hi>Amienz</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1558, he returned into his Countrey, where, by secret means he had caused the Bishop of <hi>Wietzburg</hi> to be slain, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1557, because he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated his Lands.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in <hi>Anno</hi> 1564, he was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to Levy certain Souldiers for the service of the <hi>French</hi> King, whose Colonell he was, against them of the Religion in <hi>France</hi>; but peace being then also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he was not there imployed, whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, and with part of those Souldiers whom he had taken up with the <hi>French</hi> Kings money, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the other Bishop of <hi>Wertzburg</hi> and <hi>Bamberg</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105735:12"/>
the which succeded him that before he had killed, where he not only by force recovered his goods taken away by the said Bishop, but also spoiled and made havock of both those Bishoppricks; for which cause he procured to himself the Bann of the Empire and was Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Rebel, by reason whereof he was forced always to keep a good guard of souldiers about him, for the safety of his Person. But in the last <hi>Dyett</hi> holden under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> an Edict was published, that no man of what Degree soever he were, should keep any man in Arms except it were by the publique consent of the States of the Empire. Notwithstanding <hi>Grombache</hi> did not only keep his old band of men still together, but also Levyed new, and practised with some Personages of Name and Authority to enteprise somewhat for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of such as were oppressed and sustained wrong in the Empire. Of the which enterprise the forenamed <hi>John Frederick</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> was one of the chiefest favourers, being perswaded by the same <hi>Grombache,</hi> that then the time served him to recover the Electorship, the which was taken by force from his Father, and that the most part of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> would aid him therein. Whereupon, in the <hi>Dyett</hi> holden by <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the Emperour that now is, at <hi>Augusta,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1566, by the common consent of all the States, the said <hi>Grombache</hi> was declared a Rebell of the Empire, with all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and order taken to proceed against him as against a sedicious man, and disturber of the Commonweale. This notwithstanding, <hi>Grombache</hi> continuing his faction, was received by <hi>John Frederick</hi> into his Castle of <hi>Gottha,</hi> the which was of such force, as they in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects thought themselves safe from their enemies.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Augustus</hi> now Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> being in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Dyett,</hi> appointed the Emperors Lieutenant for the Wars, and having at the charges of the Emperor six thousand horses, thirty Ensigns of Footmen, and forty pieces of great Ordnance, besieged the Town of <hi>Gottha,</hi> and Castle of <hi>Grimsteteine,</hi> which thing the Citizens and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105735:12"/>
certain Captains there perceiving, and weighing with themselves that the matter was taken in hand by all the Estates of the Empire, were contented to yield, both <hi>Grimbache,</hi> the Town and the Castle to the said Elector, who as soon as he was entred, took <hi>John Frederick,</hi> and sent him, with a sufficient guard to the Emperor, with whom he remaineth still a prisoner in the City of <hi>Presburge,</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> above one hundred <hi>English</hi> miles beyond <hi>Vienna,</hi> near <hi>Turkey,</hi> and executed above twenty of the chiefest Rebels, whereof <hi>Grombache,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanz,</hi> Chancellor to Duke <hi>John Frederick,</hi> with certain others, were quartered quick. This Victory was so joyfull to the Elector <hi>Augustus,</hi> that in memory thereof he caused <hi>Dollers</hi> to be coyned with this Inscription, <hi>Tandem bona Causa triumphat,</hi> A good cause at last prevails. After he had sent Duke <hi>John Frederick</hi> away Prisoner, he caused his Castle, which was one of the fairest houses, and strongest fortresses in all <hi>Germany,</hi> and the principall Mannour house of the old Elector <hi>John Frederick,</hi> to be utterly razed and destroyed, so as there is not one stone left upon another. I heard as I passed through the town of <hi>Gottha,</hi> that the razing only of that Castle <hi>Grimsteteine</hi> and the Walls of <hi>Gottha,</hi> cost him seventy three thousand <hi>Guilderns,</hi> which the States of the Empire (as I hear) do grudge to repay, because, as they alleadge, repay they did not consent to the razing thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grombache,</hi> and divers others that were executed with him and since, before their death confessed, that their intent was to have killed <hi>Augustus,</hi> and to have reduced the Electorship to <hi>John Fredicks</hi> house, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Grombache</hi> in that respect did clear, as not privy to that enterprise for the killing of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested that he was not culpable in any thing but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, to the which he said, by great perswasions he had also allured him.</p>
            <p>And moreover because his brother, Duke <hi>John William,</hi> would not agree to this enterprise, but ever withstood the same, the said <hi>Grombache</hi> found means to set dissention,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105735:13"/>
betwixt him and his brother about the partition of their third brothers part, who died a little before the same time; for the which cause Duke <hi>John William</hi> was content to assist <hi>Augustus,</hi> the Elector, against his brother in the siege of <hi>Gottha.</hi> By means whereof both his brothers parts were given unto him, the which he at present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth. Notwithstanding there is now a heart-burning betwixt the Elector <hi>Augustus</hi> and the said Duke <hi>John William,</hi> as well for the cause of their Electorship, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his foresaid brother to the former enterprise, as also for certain controversies in Religion that are between their Preachers, whereof I shall speak further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Now because I have not heretofore touched the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and custom that the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> have in the devision of their Lands, I think it good in this place to shew what I have learned thereof. The manner commonly of all the Noblemen, Princes, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Germany</hi> is by their last Will to dispose to every Child their Portion, both of Lands and Money. The Women, so long as there liveth any Male of the Name, do never inherit any Land. He that hath many sons and beareth an affection to one more than to another, if he be a great Prince, then he calleth the Gentlemen and great States of his Countrey and Cities together, and by their consent establisheth in his life time the division of his Childrens portions, and giveth to some more to some less, according as he favoureth, and as his Estates will agree, whose consent commonly dependeth upon the Princes pleasure. But to disinherit any son, or to make too much an unequall devision of Land, is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as it appeareth by that which <hi>John Selden</hi> writeth in the fourteenth book of his History, touching the devisions of the Lands of the Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of sprang the first quarrell betwixt them of that house, and was cause of a great Civill War in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such inequality in Partition is not therefore lightly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105735:13"/>
seen, except it be for certain such causes as are prescribed in the Civil Law; that is, in case the Son conspireth his Fathers death, or doth not his endeavour to redeem him out of Prison if he be taken by their Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Father dieth <hi>Intestate,</hi> then doe his Children divide his goods equally <hi>pro raeta Portione:</hi> Sons have the Land, and the Daughters the Mony; and in case there be no Mony left, then the Sons are bound every one out of his portion of Land, to pay a certain summe of Money towards the Dowry of his Sisters. In the which cases there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ordinances whereby every one knoweth what to have, according to their quality.</p>
            <p>The Subjects of all the Princes and Gentlemen in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> do hold their Lands, ether in <hi>Feodo,</hi> for paying a chief rent and acknowledging Homage, or in Fee-Farm, paying a certain Rent, either in Money, Corn, or Wine, or in all. Or else there are Tennants, at the will of the Lord for so many years, and for so much Rent as is agreed between the Lord and the Tennant. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no Prince, Nobleman, nor Gentleman but hath certain Vassals that of right do owe them their labour, some to sowe, some to mowe, till, carry, ditch, hedge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by whose labour their Demesnes are for the most part Manured.</p>
            <p>Thus I have as briefly as I could, set forth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the <hi>Count Palatine</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the form of Government in Politicall matters of the two first Estates, that is to say, of the Spirituall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Potentates, who both in their Houshold service, and Civill Affairs, have also the most part the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Form that the foresaid Electors have.</p>
            <p>Touching the third estate, which I said was of the Free Cities, thus much is to be understood; that of the same Free Cities, some are meerly Subject to the Empire, as <hi>Augusta, Acona, Argentina, Francfordia ad Menum, Lubeca, Hamburga, Vlma, Colonia, Spira, Noriberge,</hi> &amp;c. And other some, for that they were once under another Lord, to whom every one yet acknowledgeth a certain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105735:14"/>
duty, do therefore yield no such contribution, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Cities do: as for Example: <hi>Magdeburge, Erford, Breme, Brunswicke, Luniburge,</hi> &amp;c. have each of them a severall Lord, who is either the Bishop, or Duke of the name that every one is called by, to whom they owe their Homage and a small Duty besides. But they use notwithstanding their own proper Municipall Laws, which have their ground on the Civill Laws, and their Ancient Customs, as the Imperiall Cities do, from the which their Laws, Ordinances, and Customs, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Citizens in some cases to appeall to the Chamber of the Empire which is at <hi>Spires.</hi> They are all Governed, either by <hi>Democriti's,</hi> that is by certain chosen out of the multitude of the common people, or by the State of <hi>Olygarchy,</hi> that is, by a few of the Wealthiest and most Principall of the People: Or else by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,</hi> that is, by a few of the best sort, not in respect of their Wealth, but of their Vertue.</p>
            <p>They got their liberties, either by purchase of money, or else by the favour of the Emperor, or by force of Arms from that Prince that was their Sovereign, and have by that means of liberty, such traffique, and handling, as they are grown so rich that they have fortified their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Territories in such sort as they fear not the force of the Enemy be they never so mighty. There are four Cities which are called by an Ancient name, The four Cities of the Empire, and are free, that is, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusta, Metis, Acona, Lubeca</hi>: Whereof <hi>Metis</hi> is at present under the <hi>French</hi> King, and is not free as the rest be. Also there are four other Cities which are named the <hi>Dorffes,</hi> that is, the Towns of the Empire, <hi>viz. Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berga, Erlistadia, Haganoa, Ulma,</hi> whereof, <hi>Bamberga</hi> is now under a Bishop, and <hi>Salistadium,</hi> under Archduke <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> the Emperors brother that now is. There be also four other Cities which are termed The <hi>Boores</hi> of the Empire, that is, the Villages, but yet are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing great Cities, as <hi>Collen, Regensburge, Constantia,</hi> and <hi>Saltzburge</hi>: the which three last are all Subjects to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of that name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105735:14"/>There be many other Cities of great fame, and force, as <hi>Magdeburge</hi> which sustained the siege by the space of thirteen moneths together, of the Emperours Lieutenant, Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and others the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> In the which siege they took Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> and in the end com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded not with so unreasonable conditions as the other Cities did, in the Wars of <hi>Smascald.</hi> For they would never agree to receive the <hi>Interim</hi> no more than the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Brunswiche, Hamburge, Lubecke,</hi> and the sons of <hi>John Frederick,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxon</hi> did.</p>

The said Duke <hi>Julius</hi> is now agreed with them, and entreth the Town with seven hundred Horse, the third of <hi>October</hi> next; but is not to remain there with any force. In this City is an Ancient Monument of a monstrous Brazen Lyon, the which beast Duke <hi>Henricus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Leo,</hi> is said to have brought thither with him out of <hi>England.</hi> There is also made in this City the best Harnis for the proof, and otherwise, and the best Daggers, and Firelocks that be in all <hi>Europe.

               <hi>Regensburge</hi> (as was before said) is now under a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but once was meerly subject to the Empire, where <hi>Caesar Frederick</hi> the third, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1446, did hold a <hi>Dyett,</hi> to the which <hi>Diet</hi> for certain respects, a strait com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was given by the Emperour, that no Earl should bring more servants than three, nor no Knight nor Gentleman more than one. At the same time there was a Gentleman named <hi>Babo,</hi> of <hi>Abenspurge,</hi> the which by two lawfull Wives, had eight Daughters, and thirty two sons all living at one time, and of good Age and Stature, and hearing of this <hi>Dyett,</hi> brought his thirty two Sons thither, being all apparelled in red, and thirty three Servants with them, all well mounted, his Sons riding before him, and his Servants after him. And when the Emperout heard that the said <hi>Babo</hi> was come to the <hi>Dyett</hi> with so many Horses, he sent for him and asked where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had broken his Commandment? To whom <hi>Babo</hi> answered, May it please your Majesty, I have not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105735:15"/>
your will, for I and my thirty two Sons of my Body lawfully begotten, and therefore right Gentlemen, have but thirty three Servants, which is for every Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Servant, according to your Majesties command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Emperour marvelling at the blessing of God, gave unto him at that present great possessions to maintain his Geneology with all, and caused a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made in the City of <hi>Regensburg</hi> of him and his Children, the which at this day remaineth there to be seen. But now there is none alive of that House; for in the Wars that were betwen the Dukes <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Christopher</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1485, <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperge,</hi> which only remained of all that Stock, was slaine by a servant of the said Duke <hi>Christophers,</hi> and his Inheritance given away.</p>

               <hi>Spire</hi> also, is the Chamber of the Empire, where all controversies in Law between the Princes and the Free Cities of the Empire are decided. In the which Court the Emperour presenteth the President, who is commonly either an Earle or Baron, who hath for his Fee yearly three thousand <hi>Guildernes,</hi> and two other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105735:17"/>
Assessors, the which have fifteen hundred <hi>Guilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> apeice.

To this Court all the other Courts, except before excepted, both of the Princes and Free Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> do appeal, and receive by the Civill Law there a definitive sentence.</p>
            <p>All these Free Cities for the most part do stand upon Rivers, whereof the principall are <hi>Danubius, Rhenus, Albis, Menus, Mose, Mosella, Amisia, Visurgis, Egra, Odera, Vestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> &amp;c. Of the which <hi>Danubius</hi> falleth into <hi>Mare Euxinum</hi> by <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the rest into the <hi>Ocean.</hi> And by the benefit of these Rivers and other small Rivers that fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these, the abovesaid Free Cities are cheifely maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for by meanes thereof they have traffique with the most part of other Nations. The Commodities that commonly are had in <hi>Germany,</hi> are, Copper, Brasse, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Wine, Rie, Firr-tree wood, Woll, Madder, Hopps, Wax, Flax, Blew-sclate, Harnis, Harquebushes, Daggers, Locks, and all kinde of Iron work, Horses, Onyon seed, Paper, Furrs, Glasses for windowes, and Drinking Glasses, with such like, the which are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported from one City to an other, and so to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for other Comodities that they have need of.</p>
            <p>There be also in <hi>Germany</hi> divers great and rich Cities, that partly are fallen away from the obedience of the Empire, and partly forced under the power of other Princes or States adjacent, as <hi>Basilia, Geneva, Schaffhaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> and <hi>Milhawsen,</hi> the which at divers times have been all won to the confederacy of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> or <hi>Switchers.</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105735:18"/>
1525, <hi>Rostocke</hi> was taken by the Duke of <hi>Mechleburge. Constance</hi> is under the King of the <hi>Romans, Mettz, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> and <hi>Verdune</hi> are possessed by the <hi>French</hi> King. <hi>Vtrict,</hi> and <hi>Cambrais</hi> King <hi>Phillip</hi> enjoyeth, with many others which now are not contributers to the Empire as other Free Cities are.</p>
            <p>The Free Cities, because they cannot otherwise be commanded, are called in all necessary affaires of the Empire, as is aforesaid, by the Emperour to the <hi>Diet</hi>: In the which <hi>Diet,</hi> as they be called three Estates, so they are three Counsels. Into the first Counsel come only the seven Electors. Into the second the Princes Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and Temporall, and for every Abbot of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire enter two Parsons, and for every <hi>Count</hi> and Baron enter likewise two. And into the third Counsell come those that are sent from the Free Cities.</p>
            <p>Unto all those three severall Counsels are propounded such matters as either the Emperour, or the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or any other Prince of the Empire hath to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of. Upon the which every of them give their advise a part. An in this <hi>Diet,</hi> the Free Cities give only their advise, but are allowed no sentence.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the politicall Government of these three Estates in Civill affaires. Now it remaineth that I speake something of their Religion, whereof in <hi>Germany</hi> there be three kinds especially used, <hi>viz. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Calvenism</hi> (as they term it) and <hi>Lutherism.</hi> They which abide in <hi>Popery</hi> are the three Spirituall Electors, with all the rest of the Archbishops and Bishops, except the Bishop of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> who is the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgs</hi> eldest Son and Heire, and the Archbishop of <hi>Bream,</hi> who is the second Son to Duke <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Lawen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> the which two have induced their Dioces from <hi>Popery</hi> to <hi>Lutheranism.</hi> Of the three Archbishops E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, the Archbishop of <hi>Treere,</hi> who is of a mean Gentlemans House, is the most vehement in <hi>Popery,</hi> and the greatest enemy to the other professions. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who is also of another mean Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105735:18"/>
House in <hi>Hessia,</hi> called <hi>Daniell Brendell,</hi> albeit he favoreth <hi>Popery</hi> with all his heart, yet doth he suffer every man to use the liberty of his conscience through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Country; And in many of his Cities the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> preach the Gospell. The like may be said of the Archbishop of <hi>Collen,</hi> who is the only Heire male of the County of <hi>Isenburg,</hi> and is by reason thereof Feo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>darie to the <hi>Count Pallatine,</hi> Elector, who wrote to him in <hi>December</hi> last in <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. At which time the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the said County fell to the said Archbishop, that according to the Laws and Customes in <hi>Germany,</hi> he should within one year next following, being the on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Heire male left in his House, either take a Wife, or else he would, as by right he might, being cheif Lord, seize upon the said <hi>County:</hi> whereupon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop made answer, that he would within the said time marry a Wife, which yet he hath not done as I hear.</p>
            <p>Of all the rest of the Ecclesiasticall Princes, the Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> is the greatest enemy to the true Religion, and the greatest suporter of the contrary. The Abbot of <hi>Fulda,</hi> who is the Emperesses Chancelour by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, hath in his Teritories all sorts of Religion, <hi>viz. Jesuits, Jews, Lutherans, Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. Of the Temporall Lords that dwell in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavire</hi> only maketh open profession of <hi>Popery,</hi> whose Country abideth still in the dregges thereof. As also the Country of <hi>Tirolis,</hi> and <hi>Alsatia</hi> do that are under Archduke <hi>Ferdenando,</hi> and <hi>Stiria,</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> that are under Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> the Emperours Brethren.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Lawenburg,</hi> and Duke <hi>John William</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> albeit they professe <hi>Lutherism,</hi> yet being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, partly by poverty and needinesse, and partly by the sinister perswasion of their Preachers, who maketh them believe that the <hi>Calvenists</hi> be worse then the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> they have been contented to aide the <hi>Papists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganist them of the Religion: the one with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> in whose hire he yet remaineth: and the other
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105735:19"/>
which is Duke <hi>John William</hi> in the second Civell Wars in <hi>France,</hi> served the <hi>French</hi> King. The like also did of late <hi>Philibert, Marques</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> who was slaine by the Admirall in the last conflict of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be also other Noble men of <hi>Germany,</hi> that this day live out of their Country, partly for lack of living, and partly because their Country is against their will reformed in Religion, as Duke <hi>Erick</hi> of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and <hi>Peter Erneste</hi> of <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> who have abandoned their Country and live at present under the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> And the Counties of <hi>Ringrave,</hi> who serve the <hi>French</hi> King. But all these that thus have, and doe serve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Religion, are with the most part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and states of their native Country the worse esteemed, and have the lesse credit The <hi>Count Pallatine,</hi> and the Electors of <hi>Saxony,</hi> have through all their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and Circles of the Empire, commanded all their Subjects of what estate or degree soever he be, by publike Edict, which now are in the service of any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> that they within a certain time, upon pain of confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Lands, and Goods, shall return home, and have by the same given commandement to all other their Subjects, that they, nor any of them, upon like pain, shall hereafter goe unto the service of the <hi>French</hi> King, the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> or of any other forrigen Potentate, without their lycense and consent.</p>
            <p>Of the Free Cities that are not Subject to any other power then only to the Empire, besides <hi>Munster, Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and <hi>Collen,</hi> I know not any that professeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet in all these, any man may use his conscience without constraint to live after their order: And in <hi>Collen</hi> a number of those which are banished out of the <hi>Low Countrys</hi> for their Religion, have liberty at this day to remain; whereof the principall are the Prince of <hi>Oringe,</hi> the Countesse of <hi>Horne,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Killingbrooke</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Cities of <hi>Colmar, Sledstat, Kaysersberge,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia Superior,</hi> not withstanding that they are after a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105735:19"/>
sort Imperiall, yet they be properly under the Archduke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and therefore do maintain <hi>Popery</hi> still; the which Religion the common people and most part of the Citizens there, do so little regard, as, if they had means, they would reform it in like sort as their Neighbours of <hi>Hagona, Turkeine, Mynster, &amp;c.</hi> of late about three years past, have done.</p>
            <p>The second kind of Religion that is used in <hi>Germany,</hi> is that which they call <hi>Calvenisme,</hi> of the which, amongst the Nobility, onely the <hi>Count Palatine</hi> and the <hi>Grave</hi> of <hi>Embden</hi> maketh profession, and have accordingly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Countries. And of the free Cities <hi>Breme</hi> only beginneth to incline that way, by reason that the chiefest Burgomaster <hi>Danyell van Buren,</hi> and <hi>Millanus,</hi> the chief Schoolmaster there, are earnest in that opinion, and labour all that they may to reduce the State there to their minde.</p>
            <p>All the rest both of the Princes and free Cities in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> except before excepted, are <hi>Lutherans</hi> in profession of Doctrine, and <hi>Papists</hi> in Ceremonies: for they have at this day in their Churches, Images, Lamps, Torches, Copes, Vestments, Albes, Surplices, Crosses, Altars, and the very same Superstitious Rites and Ceremonies, both in Administring the Communion (saving that they deliver it in both kinds in their mother tongue without any elevation.) In Baptism, Marriage, Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and burying, even as the <hi>Papists</hi> have.</p>
            <p>There is at this day two sorts of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> whereof the one sort is called <hi>Truncistae,</hi> because they affirm that a man is born, <hi>Quasi truncus in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione,</hi> having no power of himself to do well, and that works be not necessary to Salvation: And that the Church is too much burthened with Ceremonies. This opinion did <hi>Matthias Flaccus Illericus</hi> as <hi>Argentine</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi>; whom, <hi>Wigandus</hi> of <hi>Gena,</hi> with all the rest of Duke <hi>John William</hi> of <hi>Wimars</hi> Preachers, do follow.</p>
            <p>The other sort are termed <hi>Sunergistae,</hi> because they say
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105735:20"/>
that God draweth <hi>Hominem volentem in regenerationem,</hi> and that good works are requisite to follow faith in mans justification, and that Ceremonies be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things indifferent. Of this sort is <hi>Georgius Major,</hi> who, with all the Divines in the Universities both of <hi>Wittemberge,</hi> and <hi>Leyipzeigke,</hi> and withall the Princes of the Elector <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> do maintain this to be the Doctrine of <hi>Philip Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton.</hi> This contention is gone so far between these Preachers and Divines of both sides, that the Princes of each side are become parties therein, for the pacifying thereof it was thought good by the wisest of either side to have the matter openly disputed, the which was done at <hi>Aldenburge,</hi> a Town in <hi>Saxony,</hi> between both the said Princes Dominions, in <hi>Feb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> last 1569. The which Disputation is set forth in Print. But the Faction not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding continueth, and to what end that will come, the Lord in heaven onely knoweth. But wise men doubt that these are but the beginnings of a further mischief to come upon <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation, who both for their security in Religon, dissolute living, and horrible drunkenness, do exceedingly provoke the plague of God unto them.</p>
            <p>To these three kindes of Religions used in <hi>Germany,</hi> there may be added a fourth, which is of <hi>Newtrals,</hi> such as are the Duke of <hi>Cleive,</hi> and the Emperour. And first touching the Duke of <hi>Cleive,</hi> albeit for his own part he professeth <hi>Lutheranisme,</hi> yet by means of his Wife, who is the Emperours sister, and of his Chancellor, who is an earnest <hi>Papist,</hi> the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion is permitted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Dominions, to as many as like the same, who are not a few.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Emperour, although he make publick profession of <hi>Popery</hi> in his Court; yet as well in his Countrey of <hi>Austria,</hi> which is a member of the Empire, as also in all his other Dominions, for the most part the confession of <hi>Augusta,</hi> is for certain respects, and after a sort, granted to such as are desirous thereof; but the greatest number of his Subjects do dwell still in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105735:20"/>
Popery, The which Religion, the Emperour himself, as it is reported, doth not in Conscience like, although for some wordly respects he dare not but dissemble the same; for there are, both some of his Privy Councill, whom I know, that professe openly the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Divines, both Learned, and Noblemen in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the which have had secret conference with him in that behalf, who do affirm assuredly, that he knoweth the truth in Religion, &amp; that for pollicies sake he dissembleth the same: but howsoever the matter doth stand, and whatsoever he maketh men to believe to the contrary, Sure I am, that in all his actions, both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, he hath shewed himself an enemy to all those of the Religion: And on the contrary part, hath favoured and supported the <hi>Romish</hi> faction, for the which respect he hath at this present so little favour with the Princes, Protestants in <hi>Germany,</hi> as both his authority is with them the less regarded, and their minds so alienated from him, as they are purposed never in their time to establish the succession of the Empire in his house, neither yet during his Reign, to come any more themselves in person to any <hi>Dyett</hi> that he shall appoint for what cause soever it be. Wherefore considering the premisses, a man may gather hereof a State conjecture, and conclude with the saying in the Gospell, that for as much as this Nation of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> is in so many respects divided in it self, that it shall in the end suffer desolation.</p>
