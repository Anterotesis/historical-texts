            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no duty more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in it self or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us then that of Prayer: Wherein we have sweet communion with God and free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the throne of grace, laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a gracious Father all our wants and grievances, in hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to have our suits granted, our sinnes pardoned, our necessities sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and our griefs removed and relieved. It is that hand and key which helpeth to unlock and open the treasury of all Gods graces for the enriching of our souls with all his blessings, the horsmen and chariots of the Israel of God, whereby they get victorie over all their enemies, yea
<pb facs="tcp:42240:3"/>
they prevail with God whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to oppose against them as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and to wrestle with them that he may foil and overthrow them, as he did with Jacob. In all which and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other respects as it is to be esteemed the chiefest exercise of a godly and Christian life, which can never be too much practiced, as the Apostle implyeth where he injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to <hi>pray continually,</hi> and <hi>in all things to give thanks;</hi> so can it never be sufficiently insisted upon in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it, whereby we are pressed &amp; perswaded to the frequent exercise of it, and taught to perform it in a right and acceptable manner. In which regard though much already hath been excellently spoken and written upon this subject, yet let no man think it superfluous to have more
<pb facs="tcp:42240:3"/>
published of this argument; seeing that can never be too much taught which is never sufficiently learned and loved.</p>
            <p>The ensuing Treatises were the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of that learned, judicious and godly Divine D. <hi>Downame,</hi> late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Dery in the Realm of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, my most dear brother, which were penned with his own hand for his private use, but for the publick service of that part of Gods Church over which he was a painfull and faithfull Pastour, conteining the summe of many of his sermons which he preached on this argument. The which if he had been pleased to have polished and perfected with his own learned hand, no doubt much would have been added to their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre and beautie. Yet seeing this was
<pb facs="tcp:42240:4"/>
not done according to his better abilities, I thought it a dammage to Gods people, that they should lose the substance for the want of some circumstance, and have no use of a well-compacted bodie, fit to do God and his Church good service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not decked with gay or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. And therefore I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to the view of the world, and indeavoured to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a brother to him that is decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, though not to raise this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all seed to him (for it was of his own begetting and composing) yet to give unto it birth and being in the world, without which it would have proved abortive, and so have been buried in perpetuall oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The which service I have the
<pb facs="tcp:42240:4"/>
more willingly undertaken for the benefit of all that will take pains to peruse this work, because I am now disabled by age and many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to produce any further labours of mine own in this kind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have not been wanting in my more able and mature times, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proportion of my small ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which my great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath entrusted me with: Herein imitating the example of the weaker sex, who after they have been fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in bearing children themselves, and now being come to older age are disabled to have any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, do some of them become midwives, who are helpfull to those who are young and fruitfull for the bringing of their children into the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42240:5"/>The Lord, whose onely blessing maketh all our indeavours profitable by giving efficacie unto them by the inward operation of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, blesse these and all other labours of his servants, that they may bring forth plentifull fruits for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory and the benefit of all his children, who are willing to make use of them to these ends.</p>

In treating whereof I purpose (by the help of<note place="margin">The method observed in this tractate, Of prayer.</note> God) to observe this order: First, I will set down the doctrine of invocation, and then explain that absolute form or pattern of prayer prescribed by our Saviour Christ, wherein the practice of the doctrine is conteined.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine must first be generall and common to both the sorts of invocation, <hi>viz.</hi> prayer and thanksgiving; and then speciall and peculiar to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>The phrase of <hi>invocating</hi> or <hi>calling upon the name</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the name of Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Prayer.</note> 
                     <hi>of God</hi> sometimes signifieth the profession of the true religion whereby we take the name of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and are called after his name: as Gen. 48. 16. and 4. 16. Isa. 63. 10. Acts 9. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>And first, as touching the name; This part of Gods worship is usually in the Scriptures expressed by the phrase of <hi>calling upon the name of God,</hi> and therefore is fitly called <hi>invocation,</hi> that is, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, whether it be by way of praying or praysing. In which generall sense the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>tephillat,</hi> is sometimes used; 1. Sam. 2. 1. Psal. 86. 1. Isa. 56. 7. <hi>Domus orationis, oratio,</hi> and <hi>invocatio</hi> in Latine: and by a Synecdoche <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> in the English tongue; though properly it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that <hi>species</hi> or kind of invocation whereby we crave any thing at the hands of God. By a Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the signe it is sometimes called <hi>the lifting up of the hands,</hi> Psal. 141. 2. and 44. 20. sometimes, <hi>the lifting up of the eyes,</hi> Psal. 123. 1. more properly, <hi>a lifting up of the heart unto God,</hi> Psal. 25. 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the other are but sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42240:9"/>
when we pray, <hi>to lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens,</hi> as Jeremie speaketh Lam. 3. 41. So much of the name.</p>
                  <p>In the definition the nature of Invocation is set<note place="margin">Of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> forth: both the generall, which Logicians call the <hi>genus;</hi> and proper, in that which is called the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> The generall, in that I call it <hi>a religious speech.</hi> For of religious speech there are two speciall sorts: the one of man unto man in the name of God and in the stead of Christ; which is preaching: the other of man unto God in the name and mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ; which is prayer or invocation: And both of them somewhere in the Scriptures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by one and the same name of <hi>prophesying:</hi> which for Preaching is used, 1. Cor. 14. 3, 4. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for Invocation, both in the sense of praying, 1. Kings 18. 29. with 26. and of praysing, 1. Chron. 25. 1, 2, 3. First, I say, it is a speech. And because the religious speech is the chief speech which we can use, therefore as preaching is called <hi>Sermo,</hi> so prayer is of the Latines <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>But where I say prayer is a speech, you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that whereas there is a twofold speech, <gap reason="foreign">

Sam. 1. 15. As for that prayer which is onely the outward speech of the mouth without the inward of the heart, it is not a prayer in truth, but a meer lip-labour. For to call upon God in truth, is to pray with our souls, and to call upon him with our hearts, to lift up our hearts and to poure forth our souls before the Lord, as I shall shew more fully hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But I adde, that it is a religious speech, to note that prayer is a part, and indeed a principall part of that religious adoration and worship which we ow unto God: and consequently to teach us, that it is a dutie to be performed religiously and devoutly, as intending thereby an holy and acceptable service unto God. So that true prayer is not a bare reading or recitall of any form of prayer without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, without affection, without devotion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith; but a religious service devoutly offered unto God out of an upright and pure heart, 2. Tim. 2. 22. Psal. 119. 7.</p>

unto, In whose name, In what manner, By whose help, and For what. For in all invocation that shall be acceptable unto God, there is required, 1. That<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in all invocation acceptable to God.</note> the person which prayeth be faithfull; 2. That the partie to whom we pray be the onely true God; 3.

For the manner, that it be <gap reason="foreign">

Epist. 5. 14. <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> that is, that in our invocation or prayer we perform those things which God hath willed and required in his word to be performed in prayer. 5. Because we are not able of our selves to perform any of those things which God hath required, I adde, that we are to call upon God by the help of the holy Ghost. 6. And lastly, I shew that the object of our invocation, that is, the things concerning which we do speak unto God in prayer, are good things apperteining to his glorie and our good; as namely and especially, the benefits and blessings of God, for which we do either pray unto him, or praise him. Of these six in order: And first for the partie which is to pray. When I say that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a speech of the faithfull, you are to understand, 1. That we speak of prayer as it is <hi>officium via<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> a duty injoyned unto men living here upon earth as pilgrimes in the Church militant, unto whom alone the doctrine of Invocation doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertein; and not as it is <hi>exercitium spirituum beato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the exercise of the Saints and Angels in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42240:11"/>
Church triumphant in heaven, to whom neither the commandments injoyning this duty, nor the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses made to prayer, nor the directions which teach how to pray are directed. For although the word of God hath revealed that they are conversant in the one part of invocation, that is, in praising &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God (wherein we are to imitate them, that we may do this will of God, 1. Thess. 5. 18. as the Saints and Angels do it in heaven) yet as touching the other part, which is prayer or petition, for what or for whom they pray in particular, the Spirit of God in the Scriptures hath not revealed: and it is but foolish curiositie to seek to be wise above that which is written. For herein especially is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> supra nos nihil ad nos,</hi> that is, Things above us belong not unto us: much lesse ought we with the superstitious Papists upon an erroneous conceit of theirs, I mean the Saints and Angels in particular, that is, such Saints and Angels praying for us in particular, ground an idolatrous practice of our praying unto them. But of this also more hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing we consider it as the dutie of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Isa. 38. 19. we are more particularly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both who in this world are required to pray, and also what is required in them that do pray. This dutie is required of all men living without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: All are to call upon God. And that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be accepted of God, it is required of all that they should have faith. For as much therefore as we are to define prayer as it is effectuall and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable, for that cause I defined it to be the speech
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42240:11"/>
of the faithfull: not but that all are bound to pray, but that none pray effectually and acceptably but they onely that believe. Concerning the partie therefore which is to call upon God, I am to shew these two things: 1. That it is required of all to pray; 2. That it is required of all which do pray that they be faithfull. The former I am the rather in this place to perform, lest when I have defined <hi>Quid sit,</hi> and so taught how we are to pray, I leave place to the question <hi>An sit,</hi> Whether we are to pray at all or not.</p>
                  <p>For howsoever it is a great honour and favour for a sinfull man who is but dust and ashes (as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham upon this occasion confesseth, Gen. 18. 27.) that the Lord should admit him to familiar speech with his great and glorious Majestie (For as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome saith, <hi>Quis non admiraretur tantam benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem</hi>

For which cause all nations being never so barbarous, though they know not the true God, yet by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of nature think themselves bound to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which they suppose to be God. If therefore those nations which did not call upon the true God, whom indeed they did not know, are subject to the curse of God, Psal. 69. 6. Jer. 10. 25. how shall they escape the curse of God who knowing him do not call upon him? for by their not calling upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42240:12"/>
him they do deny him, Tit. 1. 16. and therefore this is observed as a note of the foolish Atheist, who saith that there is no God, that he doth not call upon the Lord, Psal. 14. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a principall part of that worship<note place="margin">2. Because it is the end of our creation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of God for which the nature of man was at the first created according to his image, and for which it was redeemed, <hi>viz.</hi> that we might worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse: and therefore those who will not call upon him rob God of that honour that is due unto him, and as much as in them lyeth go about to frustrate that end for which they were created and redeemed: So principall, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the duty of invocation is put for the whole worship of God, as Gen. 21. 33. &amp; 26. 25. as if it were all in all. In which regard the temple which was provided for Gods worship was called <hi>the house of prayer,</hi> Esa. 56. 7. And no marvell, for by this one duty of invocation we exercise and testifie our religion, our faith, our love both of God and man, our affiance and hope, &amp;c.</p>

And if you ask in what part of the law; I answer, In both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; as a duty of religion to God, and of charity to our neighbour, for whose good we either pray or give thanks: In every commandment; as the common means whereby we are enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the severall duties, and to attein those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are therein prescribed: But chiefly it is commanded in the commandments of the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42240:13"/>
the obedience whereof in a great part consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth herein: For hereby God is worshipped in the spirit or inwardly, <hi>praecept.</hi> 1. adored in the body or outwardly, <hi>praecept.</hi> 2. sanctified or glorified in the mouth, <hi>praecept.</hi> 3. and a good part of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the sabbath <hi>praecept.</hi> 4. standeth in this.</p>
                  <p>Now if any man shall object, That he is a sinfull<note place="margin">Object.</note> man, and that by his sinne he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unworthy to tread upon the earth or to look up unto heaven, and much more unworthy to present himself before the Lord with hope to be heard; and consequently, that it were great presumption for him to call upon the Lord: I answer, That it<note place="margin">Answ.</note> were indeed greater presumption to come before God then it was to rush into the presence of the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esth.</hi> 4.</note> kings of Persia, were it not that the Lord did in like manner hold out unto us the sceptre of his word, therein by his manifold commandments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning us this duty, and by his gracious promises encouraging us thereunto. This therefore may be a fourth argument or motive: For if God hath commanded us to call upon him, and hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to heare us, in obedience to his commandment and in faith in his promises we are to call upon him, being assured that he who hath commanded us to pray and hath promised to heare will graciously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our prayers.</p>

I will cite a few places where they are conjoyned: Psal. 50. 14, 15. <hi>Offer unto God thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving:</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42240:13"/>

Thess. 5. 17, 18. <hi>Pray without ceasing; in every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</hi> And to the promises that in Psal. 145. 18. belongeth, <hi>The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</hi> And therefore they can no sooner call but he heareth, Dan. 9. 23. Yea, before we call the Lord hath promised to heare, Esa. 65. 24. Which sheweth that he is more ready to heare then we are to call upon him.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>The decision of the first question is needfull, not onely because some hereticks have held prayer to be superfluous, but chiefly because our adversaries father this heresie upon us.</p>
                  <p>Those that take away the use of prayer ground their fansie on the knowledge and providence of God. For first, If God our heavenly Father do know<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> our wants, and be of himself ready to supply them, shall not we seem to doubt either of his knowledge or of his goodnesse if we pray unto him. <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Our Saviour indeed doth teach us that God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father doth know our wants, and is willing to supply them, Matth, 6. 32. but yet in the same chapter he teacheth us to pray, and promiseth that by prayer we shall obtein, Matth. 7. 7, 8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in obedience to the commandment, and in faith in the promise, we are to call upon God, whatsoever flesh and bloud can object to the contrary.

knowledge of our wants and readinesse to supply them must free us from distrustfull care, and move us with affiance to seek unto God in all our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to which end our Saviour Christ informeth us of Gods knowledge and fatherly love. And so the Apostle Phil. 4. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Be not distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carefull for any thing, but in every thing let your requests by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving be made known before God.</hi> The perswasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Gods knowledge and love must not hinder us from prayer, but rather incourage us with faith and affiance to call upon him. Neither do we call upon God either to inform him in that which he knoweth not, or to move him to that which he hath not purposed, but to do our duty to God and our selves: to God, in worshipping him by this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and acknowledging him by prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to be the authour of all good things: to our selves, in using that means which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the obteining of our desires. God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and promised to give good things, not to all but to those that use the means: There is a promise of receiving and obteining, but to those that ask; of finding, but to those that seek; and of opening, but to those that knock. And moreover, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine saith, the Lord would have us to exercise and increase by prayer our desire, our hope and our faith, that so we may be the more capable of those good things which God hath promised to give; For they are great, <hi>sed nos ad accipiendum parvi &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusti</hi>

For whereas we teach that all things come to passe according to the counsel of Gods will, Ephes. 1. 11. which is unchangeable because it is alwayes the best, hereupon some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that we take away the use of prayer: For if all<note place="margin">Hunnius, De Providentia.</note> things come to passe according to the immutable counsel of God, then to pray for any thing is needlesse or bootlesse: Needlesse, if God have already appointed that which we desire: bootlesse, if he have determined the contrary; for we may not think that by our prayer we can alter his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which cannot be changed. <hi>Answ.</hi> It may<note place="margin">Answ.</note> well be that some do thus abuse the doctrine of Gods providence, as many do to the like purpose the doctrine of predestination, falling into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conceit of the Predestinatours. For if I be elected (say they) a godly life is needlesse; if not, it is bootlesse. But the same answer will serve for both: 1.

of means. See Jer. 33. 3. Luke 18. 41. Psal. 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Papists object against us, that we<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarm. De bonis operib. in particul. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> take away the efficacie of prayer in obteining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes or any other good things. The former, because we teach that faith alone justifyeth: the latter, because we teach that the prayer which must obtein any thing proceedeth from speciall faith, which cannot be had. But more worthily the Papists may be charged for denying the efficacy of obteining remission both to faith and to prayer, which they ascribe to the Sacraments, especially of Baptisme for sinnes going before, and Penance for sinnes following after Baptisme, which they hold do free from sinne, and conferre the grace of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> whereunto they require nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer nor faith, nor any other good motion or disposition in the party, save onely that he do not <hi>ponere obicem peccati mortalis,</hi> put in the way the barre or stop of mortall sinne; affirming that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments do contein grace as vessels, and that they are physicall causes of grace, justifying by efficacie put into them by God, as the heat of fire is the cause of burning; abusing that place, Acts 22. 16. <hi>Be baptized and wash away thy sinnes, having called on the name of the Lord.</hi> But let us come to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. To the first I answer, That we do teach that remission of sinnes is obteined by prayer; and that to that end our Saviour hath taught us to crave remission and hath acquainted us with the example of the Publicane who by prayer obteined justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as David, Manasseh, and the faithfull and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners in all ages have done: which hindreth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42240:18"/>
not but that we are justified by faith alone. For it is not every prayer, but the prayer of faith, as S. James calleth it, which is impetratory; I say, it is the prayer of faith which by prayer obteineth pardon.</p>
                  <p>To the second: Where our Divines define faith to be a full and certain perswasion of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in Christ forgiving our sinnes, &amp;c. they define it in the highest degree and perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of whereunto we must alwayes aspire. But there are two principall degrees of faith: The first is an assent to the truth of Gods word, and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the promises of the Gospel, assuring salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all that believe in Christ. This assent in the judgement to the Law and Gospel, if it be true, lively, and effectuall, worketh in the heart and will a lothing of our sinnes, a resolution to leave them, a desire of grace, and a hungring and thirsting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christs righteousnesse, and a resolution to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Christ to be our Saviour, and to rest upon him alone for salvation. And howsoever those who have but this degree cannot say that they are assured of forgivenesse and salvation, yet their desire of grace proceeding from this lively faith expressed in their prayer is acceptable before God, and obteineth that which is desired. Now they which have this degree must proceed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: For seeing the promises belong to them concerning justification and salvation, they ought to apply them to themselves. And look how sure a man may be that he believeth, that is, giveth a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e and lively assent to the doctrine of the Gospel,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42240:18"/>
so sure ought he to be of the remission of sinnes and salvation by Christ. And of this assurance there are degrees according to the measure of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore this point; We ascribe to faithfull prayer efficacie to obtein that which we desire in the name of Christ according to the will of God, and by the Scriptures do demonstrate the efficacie of prayer; which now we are to shew by the wonderfull effects which by prayer have been brought to passe.</p>

                     <hi>to the like passions with us</hi> (which the Apostle James noteth chap. 5. 17, 18. that we might in like manner hope to be heard) <hi>prayed a prayer,</hi> that is, prayed effectually, <hi>that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth for three yeares and six moneths: and he prayed again, and the heavens</hi> (that is, the aire) <hi>gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning fire, we have two examples of the same Elias: the former, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kings 18. where by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he brought down fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice: the latter, 2. Kings 1. where also by prayer he brought down fire from heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the two captains with their fifties.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the elements, let us in our cogitations<note place="margin">2. of the heavens and heavenly bodies.</note> ascend into heaven. For most admirable is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Josh. 10. 15. where at the prayer of Joshua (for he is said to have spoken to the Lord, and the Lord to have hearkened to his voice) <hi>the sunne stood still in the middest of heaven for the space of one whole day, untill the Israelites were avenged on their enemies.</hi> And no lesse admirable is that example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Isaiah, 2. Kings 20. 11. at whose prayer not onely the shadow in the sunne-diall but the sunne it self in the firmament went back ten degrees, Isa. 38. 8. Ecclus 48. 23.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the efficacie of prayer seen upon those creatures alone which are without sense, but upon those also which are indued with sense and reason. Jonah when he was swallowed up of the whale, and lay in the belly thereof as in a grave for the space of three dayes and three nights, having cried to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42240:19"/>
Lord <hi>de profundis,</hi> he was restored safe to land, Jonah 2. As touching men; the efficacie of prayer<note place="margin">3. of men.</note> appeareth in the deliverance not onely of particular men, but also of whole cities and countreys from the fury and force of their enemies were they never so mightie or so many. When Peter was by Herod cast into prison, and kept by foure quaternions of souldiers, lying in the night before he should be put to death between two souldiers bound with two chains, the keepers also before the doore keeping the prison, at the instant prayer of the Church which effectually prayed for his deliverance, the Lord sent his angel to set him at libertie, Acts 12. 5. Elias the Prophet being armed with the spirit of prayer when Ahaziah the king had sent three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains of fifties one after another to apprehend him, he not onely brought down fire from heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the two first with their fifties, as I said before, but also he brought the third captain upon his knees, humbly intreating him that his own life and the lives of all his companie might be precious in his sight, 2. Kings 1. Elisha also, upon whom the spirit of Elias was doubled, when Ben-hadad king of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria had sent an armie of men with horses and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots to apprehend him, the armie having by night en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed the citie where the Prophet was and besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, by prayer he had them in his power, striketh them blind, leadeth them to Samaria, and having<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.</note> by prayer opened their eyes that they might see their present danger, he victualleth them, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them away as vanquished.</p>
                  <p>Now for the defense and deliverance of whole
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42240:20"/>
peoples and common-wealths, such is the efficacie of prayer, that those who are indued with the spirit of supplication may not unworthily with Elias and Elisha be called <hi>the horsemen and chariots of Israel.</hi> By prayer Asa, 2. Chron. 14. Jehoshaphat, 2. Chron. 20. 25. Hezekiah, 2. Kings 19. overcame most mighty armies of their enemies, which by their own strength they were in no sort able to resist. But most remarkable is that example of Moses at the battel of Rephidim: whereby it appeareth to be true which Chrysostome upon that occasion no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>,</hi> the prayers of the righteous more prevail then arms.

For the former; Jam. 5. 15. <hi>The prayer of faith shall save,</hi> or <hi>make whole, the sick.</hi> Examples, Num. 12. 13. in Miriam; Acts 28. 8. in the father of Publius; but especially in Hezekiah, who, though he had received the sentence of death, obteined by prayer the prolonging of his life, 2. Kings 20. 2. For the latter; we reade of many who by prayer have been restored from death unto life: as namely, the widows child of Sarepta, 1. Kings 17. 21. the sonne of the Shunamite by Elisha, 2. Kings 4. 35. Dorcas by Peter, and all by prayer. Yea, the devils
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42240:20"/>
themselves, who are said to have the power of death, give place to prayer: yea, that kind of devil which by no other means can be cast out, is cast out by prayer, Matth. 17. 21.</p>
                  <p>And yet we stay not here: For the efficacie of<note place="margin">5. of God, prayer is of greatest effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie.</note> prayer is not onely seen in and upon the creatures; but <hi>the effectuall prayer of a righteous man availeth much with God,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. For the Lord being omnipotent and of a most simple and pure nature, and therefore not subject to passive power, cannot properly be said to suffer any thing: yet having by most gracious promises bound himself to grant the faithfull prayers of his children, they are said to prevail with him; both because they obtein such blessings at his hands as otherwise would not be granted, and turn away such judgements as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would have been inflicted. For else when the Lord was ready to have destroyed the Israelites for their idolatry, had not Moses stood up in the gap, Psal. 106. 23. why did the Lord bid him let him alone, Exod. 32. 10. but that Moses by prayer laid hold upon God, as the Prophet speaketh, Isa. 64 7. and staid his hand? And why is Jacob said to have prevailed with God, and thereupon is called Israel, but that the Lord suffered himself as it were to be overcome by his prayer? whereby he laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, who is meant by that Angel, and would not suffer him to depart untill he had granted him a blessing, Gen. 32. 26, 28. And so the Prophet Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea teacheth, that when Jacob wrestled with the Angel, he prevailed with him not so much by strength of body, as by earnest and effectuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42240:21"/>
                     <hi>He had power,</hi> saith he, chap. 12. 4. <hi>over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and prevailed, he wept and made supplication to him,</hi> &amp;c. And in this sense the Apostle exhorteth the Romanes, chap. 15. 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>together with him to wrestle in their prayers for him.</hi> And Epaphras in like manner is said, Col. 4. 12. to have wrestled for the Colossians in prayer. And what else mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the parable of the widow and the judge, Luke 18. 2. and of the two friends, Luke 11. 5. but that the importunitie of our prayers prevaileth with the Almighty? And thus the woman of Syrophenicia, Matth. 15. 22, 28. having taken divers repulses, yet at the length by the importunitie of her faithfull prayer prevailed with Christ.</p>
                  <p>The use of this doctrine is, 1.

                  <p>For first, if the party be an impenitent sinner, the<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>The second limitation in regard of prayer is, That<note place="margin">2. That we must pray according to Gods will.</note> it be according to Gods will, 1.

                     </gap> is of an active signification, as Gal. 5. 6. Ephes. 3. 20. Col. 1. 29. so in regard of the former it is passive, as 2. Cor. 1. 6. In which sense they are said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Rom. 8. ingenerating this inward efficacie in our prayers which we in our selves are not able to give them. So that the orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an oratour is <hi>efficax</hi> in respect of the inward efficacie, when therein is performed what art requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42240:22"/>
in respect of the outward, when it perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; and that efficacie dependeth on the hearers pleasure. But prayer which is effectuall in it self, alwayes prevaileth with God.</p>
                  <p>In particular, that we pray in truth, fervencie,<note place="margin">What in particular is required to effectuall prayer.</note> and faith. In truth: for to that is the promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, Psal. 145. 18. In fervencie, Jam. 5. 16. In faith, Mark 11. 24. Jam. 1. 5, 6, 7. With out the first prayers are dead: without the second, cold: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the third, uneffectuall: for it is the prayer of faith which is effectuall, Jam. 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>For the end: Jam. 4. 3. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye ask amisse, that ye might consume it on your lusts.</hi> The end must be good or the prayer is bad. The end must be that God may be glorified, Psal. 50. 15.</p>
                  <p>The third limitation is in respect of things. God<note place="margin">The third li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, in respect of the things prayed for.</note> hath promised to give good things to them that ask, Matth. 7. 11. But if the thing which thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest be not good, either in it self, as if it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or not to thee, as if it be unprofitable, it is not within the compasse of the promise, nor ought to be within the compasse of thy desire. Or if it be good, perhaps it is not yet good for thee to have it, but in due time thou shalt find grace. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer case the Lord seemeth to denie, in the latter to delay our suits; and yet in both he doth grant our prayer, if it be rightly conceived. For first, we must not circumscribe God, or prescribe unto him the time and means, but so desire that our request may be granted as he shall judge most fit both for his glorie and our good. Secondly, when as the good things which we ask are either necessarie to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42240:22"/>
salvation or otherwise; the former we are to ask absolutely, and absolutely we are to believe that we shall obtein them. Yea, know this for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that if God hath given thee grace to ask spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and saving graces effectually, thou hast alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die obteined: for the sincere desire of any grace is the beginning of that grace which is so desired. But those blessings which are not necessary to salvation, whether spirituall or temporall, we are not to ask absolutely, but with condition if the obteining thereof may be for Gods glory and our good. So shall we be sure to obtein our desires of the Lord, who alwayes heareth his children, if not <hi>ad volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> according to their will, yet <hi>ad utilitatem,</hi> for their profit (as wise parents deal with their children) seeming many times to denie to his children in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love that which in anger and indignation he granteth to others. Perhaps therefore, as Augustine saith, <hi>negat tibi propitius quod aliis concedit iratus,</hi> In mercie he denieth that to thee which in anger he granteth unto others. And therefore the hearing of our prayers is not to be measured by sense but by faith.</p>

                  <p>THe third question: Whether any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is to be expected from prayer besides ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining our requests.</p>
                  <p>The profit is twofold: the one of reward freely<note place="margin">Two benefits accrewing by prayer.</note> bestowed by God on him that calleth on his name:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42240:23"/>
the other, the increase of grace wrought in them by Gods Spirit who give themselves to prayer.</p>
                  <p>As touching the former; Though by reason of our wants and imperfections in prayer the Lord if he should deal in rigour with us might justly reject our prayers, yet such is his mercie that he doth not onely cover our wants, and for the intercession of Christ accepteth our prayer, but also granteth our desire; and not onely that, but because prayer is a dutie of pietie, and a principall part of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship whereby we glorifie God, he doth graciously reward it, godlinesse having the promise of this life and that which is to come. Our Saviour therefore promiseth, Matth. 6. 6. that when we call upon God, though it be but in secret and private prayers, and much more in publick, our heavenly Father will reward us openly. <hi>The Lord is rich to all that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 10. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>For the other: By the frequent and religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this dutie our faith and affiance in God is increased, our experience of his bountie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards us in hearing us confirmed, our love to his majestie augmented, Psal. 116. 1. our hope nourished, our patience exercised. By it we grow in acquaintance with God, and tast how good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is: By it we learn, being Gods dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suiters, so to behave our selves as not to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to appear before him: By it we elevate our minds above earthly cogitations to mind things that are above, and to have our conversation in heaven: By it we grow into assurance of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42240:23"/>
because the same spirit, which is the spirit of supplication, is also the spirit of adoption whereby <hi>we cry in our hearts, Abba, Father; and which testifieth</hi>

                  <p>But the Papists not content herewith, ascribe two<note place="margin">The Papists confuted, who hold that prayer is satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious.</note> other fruits to their prayers; that they are also Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie for their sinnes, and Meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Satisfactorie, as being penal works; and therefore both voluntarily undertaken, and by their Priests injoyned by way of penance. So that this exercise which is so honourable and so profitable as you have heard, being also a chief prerogative to the faithfull to have free accesse to God, is to them a punishment or work of penance to satisfie for sins. But their prayers performed with these conceits of satisfaction and merit are sacrilegious and deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to the all-sufficient satisfaction and merit of Christ, though otherwise they were commendable. But the impietie of their assertion will better appear, if we take a brief survey of their prayers. For first, whereas our prayers ought to be directed unto the Lord alone, they pray to Saints and Angels, yea before images and crosses, and by their prayers commit most horrible idolatry. 2. Neither do they pray in the name and mediation of Christ alone, but unto him joyn other mediatours of intercession, by whose merits and intercession they desire and hope to be heard. 3. The most of them pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding for that which they utter in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as praying in an unknown language; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pray without attention or actuall intention,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42240:24"/>
which they say needeth not; without faith or hope, without reverence. 4. They number their prayers upon beads oftentimes by most grosse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>attologie, repeating the same words, perswading themselves that the more <hi>Pater nosters, Ave Maries,</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> (for those also are prayers with them) they shall mumble upon their beads, the more satisfactory and meritorious their prayers b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. Now their prayers being thus every way abominable and odious, what horrible impudencie and impietie is it to obtrude such prayers upon God, not onely as acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto him, but as satisfactory and meritorious? by which they can merit nothing but damnation, and for the wickednesse whereof they shall never be able to satisfie but with endlesse torments.</p>
                  <p>Let this suffice us, that prayer is of so great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and admirable efficacie, that our prayers rightly conceived and made are alwayes heard and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that besides the benefit of obteining, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have their reward with God, and notable fruits, conferring and increasing Gods graces in us.</p>

of the means; as being the means ordained by God for the obteining of all good things which he hath either purposed or promised to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for our good: so that if we ask aright, we have; if we ask not we have not, as S.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42240:25"/>
are the Saints of God. And thus are they to be qualified who will either pray unto God or praise him. For prayer, the holy Ghost saith, that <hi>every one that is godly shall pray unto God,</hi> Psal. 32. 6. and <hi>the prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> Jam. 1. 16. For praise and thanksgiving; <hi>unto God be glory in the Church,</hi> saith the Apostle, Ephes. 3. 21. that is, in the company of the faithfull. And so David, <hi>Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his; give thanks at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his holinesse,</hi> Psal. 30. 4. It is true that all the works of God do praise him, as the matter of his praise; but the Saints do blesse him, as the instruments of his praise, Psal. 145. 10. For both, see Psal. 50. 14, 15, 16. where the Lord, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the faithfull (to whom his speech is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected v. 5, 7.) to offer unto him thanksgiving, and to call upon him in the day of trouble; so he taketh exception against the wicked: <hi>But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldst take my covenant in thy mouth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee?</hi>

abstein from all things forbidden, if he do not also the things commanded, if he do not all, and that in that manner and measure which the law prescribeth, if he do not continue in doing all the things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but breaketh the course of his obedience by any one sinne, though but of omission, though but in thought, he is notwithstanding all his obedience by the sentence of the law not onely a sinner but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so accursed, Gal. 3. 10. By this righteousnesse no man since the fall of Adam could be said to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Christ onely excepted: but we had all need to pray with David, Psal. 143. 2. <hi>Enter not into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy sight shall no flesh living be justified: viz.</hi> by the works of the law, Gal. 3. 16. <hi>For there is not a just man upon the earth that doth good and sinneth not,</hi> Eccles 7. 20. <hi>Yea, in many things we offend all,</hi> saith S. James, chap. 3. 2. <hi>And if we say we have no sinne,</hi> saith S. John, 1. epist. 1. 8. <hi>we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Wherefore <hi>the law concludeth all under sinne,</hi> and consequently under the curse, Gal. 3. 22. So that there is no man so godly and righteous, but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the sentence of the law he is a sinner. Which serveth notably to confute the Popish hypocrites, which teach that none are justified but such as are formally just by a righteousnesse inherent in and performed by themselues (that is, habituall and actuall) according to the law of God; and that no man who is a sinner in himself, by reason of sinne inherent can be said to be justified. But whatsoever Pope-holy men do conceive of themselves, we must confesse with the forenamed Apostles, that we are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42240:26"/>
sinners in our selves, and had need daily to pray as our Saviour taught them, for the forgivenesse of our sinnes, and so to appeal from the sentence of the Law to the promise of the Gospel: <hi>for the law hath concluded all under sinne, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe,</hi> Gal. 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>The Evangelicall righteousnesse is that which<note place="margin">Evangelical: what it is.</note> without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, whereby men that are sinfull in themselves, I mean believing sinners, and penitent sinners, are accepted of God as righteous in Christ.

The former is perfect and not inherent, being the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith: The other is inherent but not perfect, being our new obedience wrought in us by the spirit of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And whosoever being displeased with himself for his sinnes doth unfeignedly desire and truly purpose amendment of life, he doth repent to sanctification. And he that but thus believeth and repenteth is within the latitude of those faithfull and righteous men whose prayers are acceptable unto God, and whose persons are accepted, yea, blessed of him; Matth. 5. 3, 4, 5. and 11. 28. Psal. 34. 18. Examples, of Manasseh, 2. Chron. 33. 13. the Publicane, Luke 18.

                  <p>NOw how necessarie it is that he which prayeth acceptably should be a righteous or faithfull man indued with some measure of true faith and unfeigned repentance, it may appear both by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest reasons and manifold testimonies of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: wherein the promise of hearing the prayer is restrained to the righteous, and all hope of being heard denied to the wicked.</p>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42240:27"/>First then it is necessary that he who calleth upon God should be indued with faith: <hi>For how shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10. 14. and, <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. and likewise with repentance: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a man repent he reteineth a purpose to go on in sinne; and this his impenitencie or sinne not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of is as <hi>a wall of separation between God and</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, before our prayers or other actions can be accepted of God, our persons must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in Christ: Neither can the fruit be good while the tree is bad: neither can we hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God by intreaty, whiles we do not desire to be reconciled unto him; but as we were born the children of wrath, so his wrath abideth upon us, John 3. 36. and we do continue in our enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no accesse to God but through Christ by the holy Ghost, Ephes. 2. 18. and 3. 12. But the unbelieving and impenitent sinner, as he hath no part in Christ, so is he void of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it cannot be but that the prayer of the unbelieving and impenitent sinners is very absurd and odious in Gods sight, because they ask many times such things as they do not desire, and promise such things as they do not mean to perform, and bear the Lord in hand that they be such men then whom they are nothing lesse, going about to deceive the Lord with their mouthes, and with their lips

speaking lies unto him, Psal. 78. and in all their prayers and praises concerning spirituall things playing the notorious hypocrites before God. For the manifestation whereof let us take a brief sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Lords prayer, whereof the impenitent sinner is not able to utter one word aright; and if not of that then of none, for that is the summe of all.</p>
                  <p>First therefore they call God their <hi>Father</hi> in<note place="margin">That the impeniten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

John 3. 8. and, <hi>his children they are whose works they do,</hi> John 8. They say, <hi>Our Father, Give us,</hi> as though in brotherly love they prayed for the whole bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of the faithfull, whereas they being void of Christian charitie seek onely themselves, and have no part in the communion of Saints. They direct their prayers to God <hi>who is in heaven,</hi> infinite in majestie, glory and power, themselves being on earth vile and base creatures, Eccles 5. as if they came in great humility in respect of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, and reverence in respect of the glorious majestie of God; whereas indeed they rush into the presence of God with lesse regard, and speak unto him with lesse reverence then they would to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, who is but a little their superiour. They call him <hi>Father,</hi> noting his love, <hi>which art in heaven,</hi> noting his power, as if they believed that their prayers should be granted, as being assured that God is both willing and able to grant their desires, and yet have no faith in God, and therefore call not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him aright in whom they have not believed.</p>
                  <p>In the first place they beg the advancement of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42240:28"/>
Gods glory, as if that were more deare unto them then their own good; whereas in truth they have no zeal of Gods glory, but unto it preferre the obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any worldly and sinfull desire. They pray that <hi>his name may be sanctified,</hi> which they do daily pollute with their mouthes, and by their lives do cause it to be blasphemed. They desire that <hi>his kingdome may come,</hi> and that <hi>his will may be done,</hi> as though they did first seek the kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, whereof indeed they have no studie or care, but are wholly addicted to worldly desires. They pray that the kingdome of grace may be advanced, and that God would rule and reigne in them by his Spirit according to his word; when they are in the number of those who say, <hi>We will not have this man to reigne over us,</hi> resisting the spirit, and casting the word behind their backs. They pray that the kingdome of glory may be hastened by the speedy coming of Christ unto judgement, and yet desire nothing lesse then the second coming of Christ. They desire that <hi>Gods will may be done,</hi> which themselves will not do. The will of God is their conversion and sanctification, that they should abstein from those sinnes whereunto they are more specially addicted: but though they know it to be the will of God that they should turn unto him, they will not turn; that they should leave their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sinnes, they will not leave them, as the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard his drunkennesse, the whoremaster his fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. and yet like egregious hypocrites do pray that <hi>they may do the will of God as it is done in heaven,</hi> that is, after an angelical manner, readily, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42240:28"/>
speedily, uprightly, faithfully, constantly, fully; when as in truth they do the will of God no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the devils in hell, which howsoever in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their intent rebell against the will of God, yet if you respect the event, they become (maugre their spite) the instruments to bring to passe that which God hath willed and decreed.</p>
                  <p>They crave <hi>bread</hi> at the hands of God, as if a small thing would content them, when they desire excesse of riches, neither can be satisfied with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. They crave <hi>daily bread,</hi> or, as the word si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth, such a portion of temporall blessings as God shall judge most expedient for them; as if they meant not to be their own carvers, but in these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things resigned themselves into the hands of God, and submitted themselves to his fatherly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when they are such as have set down with themselves that they will be rich, 1. Tim. 6. and will come to great matters whether God give them good means or not, and will frame their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. They beg for a day, as if they would depend upon God for tomorrow, &amp; yet distrustfully hoard up for many yeares. They desire temporall things to be given them of God, and yet seek them by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unlawfull means.</p>
                  <p>They desire God <hi>to remit their sinnes,</hi> as if they repented of them; which they still retein, as if they did in mockery desire the Lord to forgive the sinnes which they will not forgo. Yea, they desire the Lord in hypocrisie <hi>so to forgive them their trespasses, as they forgive those that trespasse against them,</hi> when as they nourish hatred and a desire and purpose of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42240:29"/>
&amp; so in stead of obteining mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at Gods hands, they call for the fierce wrath and vengeance of God to be executed upon them.</p>
                  <p>They desire that <hi>God will not lead them into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and yet themselves run into tentations, and seek occasions of evil. They desire that <hi>they may be delivered from evil,</hi> and yet wilfully go on in evil, and will not be reclaimed, as though they had made a covenant with hell.</p>
                  <p>They ascribe <hi>kingdome</hi> to the Lord, and yet will not obey him as his subjects; <hi>power,</hi> and yet neither fear nor trust in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>glory,</hi> &amp; yet do not glorifie him</p>
                  <p>They subscribe to their prayers and say <hi>Amen,</hi> as though they unfeignedly desired and assuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that their requests should be granted, when as they neither desire that which in hypocrisie they ask, nor believe the granting of that which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith they have begged. And finally, in all these requests they <hi>draw neare to the Lord with their mouth, and with their lips do honour him, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their hearts farre from him,</hi> Isa. 29. 13.</p>
                  <p>It is evident therefore, that as the prayer of the righteous is acceptable to God as the evening sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Psal. 141. 2. so the prayer of the wicked is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable unto him. Which may further be proved by expresse testimonies of the holy Scriptures. <hi>The sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>and his eares are open to their erie: but the face and angry countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</hi> The man which had been blind, John 9. 31. deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth this as a received truth in the Church of the Jews: <hi>This we know,</hi> saith he, <hi>that God heareth not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> that is, impenitent sinners: <hi>but if a man be a worshipper of God and doeth his will, him he heareth.</hi> Wherefore it is manifest, that the promises made to them that call upon God, are restrained and (as it were) appropriated to the godly. And therefore whosoever desireth to pray unto God with hope to be heard, must turn unto the Lord by repentance, and lay hold upon Christ by faith, unfeignedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing amendment of life: <hi>For the name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth unto it and is exalted,</hi> or <hi>set in safetie,</hi> Prov. 18. 10.</p>

I answer, That they and all other promises of the Gospel are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood with the condition of faith and repentance, which many times are expressed, and where they are not, they are alwayes to be understood, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the promises to the faithfull. For whereas Joel saith, chap. 2. 30. that <hi>whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,</hi> our Saviour restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the righteous, Matth. 7. 21. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,</hi> (that is, which calleth upon me) <hi>shall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven:</hi> and the Apostle, Rom. 10. 13, 14 to the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>But how shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?</hi> And whereas our Saviour saith, <hi>That whatsoever ye shall ask in my name the Father will grant it,</hi> John 16. 23. that also is restrained in the 1. epistle of John 3. 22. to the righteous; <hi>Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ask we receive of him, because we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.</hi> And so our Saviour, John 17. 7. <hi>If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the wicked, the Lord denieth to heare them, though they cry loud in his eares, and make many prayers unto him: Isa. 1. 15. <hi>When ye spread forth your hands</hi> (saith the Lord to the impenitent Jews) <hi>I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers I will not heare:</hi> whom not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their repentance he promiseth to heare and to receive into favour, v. 16, 17, 18. So in Ezek. 8. 18. <hi>Though they cry in mine eares with a loud voice, yet will I not heare them.</hi> Psal. 18. 41. &amp; Micah 3. 4. <hi>They shall cry unto the Lord, but he will not heare them; he will even hide his face from them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Jer. 14. 12. <hi>When they fast I will not heare their cry.</hi> Neither doth he onely refuse to heare them, but the godly also praying for them, 1. Sam. 16. 1. Jer. 15. 1. Ezek. 14. 14, 20. and therefore forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many times the godly to pray in their behalf, Jer. 14. 11. or if they do he protesteth that he will not heare them, Jer. 7. 16. and 11. 14. When as therefore impenitent sinners do call upon God and are not heard, let them not think that the Lord is not able to heare or help them. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the

                  <p>As first to Cruelty &amp; Oppression, Isa. 1. 15. <hi>Though ye make many prayers I will not heare, for your hands are full of bloud.</hi> And not to cruelty onely, but also to Unmercifulnes, &amp; Want of pitie towards the poore: For, <hi>he that stoppeth his eare at the crying of the poore, shall cry himself and not be heard,</hi> Pro. 21. 13. Whereas contrariwise those that be mercifull shall find mercy with God, Matth. 5. 7. <hi>Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am,</hi> Isa. 58. 9. <hi>If we love not in word and tongue alone, but in deed and truth, hereby we may have confidence before God,</hi> 1. John 3. 18, 19.</p>

If men harden their hearts against the word of God, the wisdome of God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to heare them, Prov. 1. 24. <hi>He covereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a cloud that our prayer should not passe through,</hi> Lam. 3. 44. But if men humble themselves before God <hi>and tremble at his word,</hi> being of humble and contrite hearts, the Lord hath promised to heare, Psal. 66. 2. and 34. 18. and 51. 17. <hi>The prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds,</hi> Ecclus 35. 17. If men <hi>choose not the fear of the Lord, the Lord will not heare them,</hi> Prov. 1. 28, 29. on the other side, <hi>He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him; he will also heare their cry an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As for temporall benefits, I cannot deny but that the Lord many times in respect of them doth grant unto the wicked their hearts desire. But yet even in these also there is great difference betwixt the Lord

his hearing of the godly and the wicked. For in temporall matters the Lord heareth men either as a gracious and loving Father, or as a mercifull Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, or as a severe Judge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In speciall favour as a gracious Father in Christ he heareth his faithfull children, ever sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinating their good to his own glory; not alwayes satisfying their carnall or worldly desires, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes granting their requests as shall be most for his glory and their spirituall and everlasting good: under which conditions our prayers for temporall blessings ought alwayes to be framed, and being so conceived they are ever granted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a mercifull Creatour the Lord heareth men crying unto him in their extremity: And thus he heareth all sorts of men, but especially the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for <hi>he is the saviour,</hi> that is, the preserver, <hi>of all men, but chiefly of the faithfull,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 10. The godly have a promise of deliverance when they call upon God; Psal. 50. 14, 15. and 145. 19. and 91. 15. and 34. 17, 19. So have not the wicked; Psal. 51. 16. and 18. 41. Yea, in many places, as ye have heard, he threatneth that when they cry unto him in their trouble he will not heare them. The affliction and deliverance of the godly do both turn to their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good; Rom. 8. 28. and being delivered they glorifie God, consulting with themselves what to render unto the Lord for his benefits, and <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42240:32"/>
Lord giving them over as incorrigible: Isa. 1. 5. Jer. 2. 30. and when they are delivered they seek not to glorifie God, nor repent of their sinnes, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their vomit, making shew of repentance no longer then the hand of God is upon them: And so both their affliction and deliverance (through their own default) turneth to their ruine. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance out of affliction when men cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God is a common benefit, the Lord hearing and delivering men of all sorts as a mercifull Creatour and Preserver, as is testified Psal. 107. where it is often repeated, that divers sorts of men <hi>when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Psal. 22. 24. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the cry of men in distresse cannot many times be said to be a prayer, but onely that voice which the extremity of their grief expresseth from them, yet it is <hi>vox creaturae clamantis ad Creatorem,</hi> the voice of the creature crying to the Creatour; and the Lord as a mercifull Creatour heareth the same. So he is said to have heard the cry of the child Ishmael,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42240:33"/>
Gen. 21. 17. And thus also <hi>he heareth the cry of the young ravens, and lions,</hi> and of the rest of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>giving them their food in due season,</hi> Psal. 147. 9. and 104. 21, 27, 28. and 145. 15. Which I do the rather note for the comfort of the faithfull: For if the Lord doth heare the cry not onely of carnall men but also of those creatures which want reason, yea sometimes of the devil himself, Mark 8. 12.

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving spoken of the person which doth invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, we are now to intreat of the party who is called upon, that is, God. Where we are to shew two things: 1. That God alone is religiously to be called upon; 2. That in our prayers we are so to conceive of God as he hath revealed himself in his word. Both which points are of great moment: for if we do religiously invocate any besides the true God, we commit sacrilegious idolatry; or if we shall conceive of God, either in respect of his nature or of the persons, otherwise then he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, we shall in stead of the true God worship an idole of our own brain.</p>
                  <p>That God is to be called upon I have already shewed, and it needeth no further proof. <hi>Call upon me,</hi> saith the Lord, Psal. 50. 15. <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father,</hi> Luke 11. 2. <hi>The true worshippers shall worship</hi>

                     <hi>the Father,</hi> John 4. 23. But that God alone is to be called upon religiously, though it follow upon the former, (for God will be worshipped alone or not at all, <hi>praecept.</hi> 1.) yet it is gainsaid by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian church, the mother of spirituall fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in this part of Gods worship addeth to him both Angels and Saints departed.

But God alone is religiously to be worshipped and adored. For the exhibiting of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship unto any that is not God, is idolatrie; such as is religious adoration, invocation by prayer and thanksgiving, reposing our affiance and trust, vows, oathes, sacrifices offered to any creature: 1.

But those prayers that are made to God, and they onely, are made in faith and hope: In faith, because God hath commanded us to call upon him, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to heare us: In hope, because God to whom we pray is omnipresent; and therefore is acquainted with our wants, and secret desires, Psal. 38. he is omnipotent, and therefore <hi>able to do for us exceedingly above all that we can ask or think,</hi> Ephes. 3. 20. and for his bounty and goodnesse more

ready to heare and to grant then we are to ask, Isa. 65. 24. On the other side, prayers made to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are made neither in faith: For there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scripture for such a prayer, no doctrine which teacheth it, no precept that injoyneth it, no promise to confirm it, no example to commend it. And this is confessed by Eckius, <hi>viz.</hi> That neither it is warranted or taught in the Old Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the people were prone to idolatry, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deceased were <hi>in Limbo;</hi> nor in the New, lest the Gentiles should return to their old idolatry, and lest the Apostles should seem to direct Christians to invocate them after their decease. And therefore by their own confession no testimonie of Scripture can be alledged to this purpose. Neither can such prayer be made in hope: because none but God is either omniscient or omnipresent to know the wants or heare the desires of men in all places calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, nor omnipotent to grant their desires.

That they know us not it is testified by Isaiah, chap. 63. 16. <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel knoweth us not:</hi> Eccles 9. 5.</p>
                  <p>The Papists except, First, That the Saints having <note place="margin">1. Exception of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> the blessed vision of God, they do see <hi>in speculo Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis</hi> the things done in earth.

But this glasse is a forgerie of their <note place="margin">The glasse of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity forged.</note> own brain: For if they say it is the essence of the whole Deitie, then is it most simple and unvariable; if the glory or splendour of God whereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth the place of the blessed, it will no more fellow that they beholding this light should see those things which God beholdeth, then that he which looketh on the sunne should see all that the sunne shineth upon.</p>

They will not have us go directly unto God or our Saviour, but (as in Princes courts) to some that are neare unto them, that they may mediate our cause; and in the upshot, we cannot go directly unto them, I mean the Saints, but God himself must be fain to be a mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them, to acquaint them with our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that so they may pray unto him for us.</p>

As if a woman taken in adultery should alledge for her self, that she loved the adulterer not as her husband but as her husbands friend. For religious worship doth as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong unto God as conjugall love unto the husband. But do not they give Divine worship to the Saints whom they invocate, prescribing thereby unto them omnipresence, omniscience, omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and thereby also professing themselves to repose their trust in them? For when they pray to Saints departed, do they speak unto them as present or as absent? If as to present, they being in heaven &amp; they on the earth dispersed in many places &amp; countreys, then they ascribe unto them omnipresence; if as to absent, they ascribe to them omniscience: Both which are blasphemous. Besides, when they invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate they ascribe omnipotencie to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repose their trust in them: But God alone is to be trusted in, because he alone is omnipotent; and <hi>cursed is he that trusteth in man,</hi> Jer. 17. 5.</p>

Therefore the ancient Fathers termed the Arians (who supposed Christ to be God by creation, and yet worshipped him) idolaters; and the Nestorians likewise, who supposed the humanitie of Christ to be a distinct person from the Sonne of God.</p>

                  <p>It may well be supposed that the Saints departed<note place="margin">Answ.</note> do pray in common for the faithfull upon the earth, as fellow-members of the same bodie.

Such was the erroneous conceit of the Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites, and such is the superstitious worship of the Papists at this day. Likewise in respect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whosoever shall call upon God as not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into three persons, howsoever they may professe that they invocate one onely true God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heaven and earth, yet they do not worship the true God but an idole: for the true God is the Father, the Sonne, and holy Ghost. Forasmuch therefore as the Jews and Turks do not worship the Trinity, they are not worshippers of the true God; but as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said of the Samaritanes, <hi>They worship they know not what,</hi> John 4. not acknowledging the true God, nor Jesus Christ whom he hath sent: John 5. 23. <hi>Hc</hi>

both God and man. Since our Saviour Christ was incarnate and did personally and inseparably unite unto himself the humane nature, his whole person as he is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. But the humanitie of Christ, as it doth not subsist of it self, so are we not severally to worship it with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius, but the whole person both God and man: But yet so as that our prayer be not directed to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, which is a creature, but to the Sonne of God having assumed and united unto himself the humane nature. So saith Cyrill, <hi>Non igitur tanquam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>

                  <p>HAving spoken of the subject of invocation, <hi>viz.</hi> men; and the object, <hi>viz.</hi> God: we are now in the third place to enquire, how it cometh to passe that man being stained and polluted with sinne, and by reason thereof an enemie to God, should have any accesse unto God, or be admitted to any speech with him, who is most just and terrible, a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, &amp; hating all iniquitie with perfect hatred. Indeed it must be confessed, that sinne maketh a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between God and man, and that both we are unworthy in our selves to appear before God, and our prayers also by reason of our manifold wants and corruptions unworthy to be offered unto him. And therefore of necessitie a mediatour was to come between God and man, who reconciling us unto God, and covering our imperfections, might make both our persons and our prayers acceptable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42240:42"/>
unto God. And for as much as it was needfull that the justice of God should be satisfied in the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein he had been offended, neither could obedience be performed to the law given to man, nor the punishment due to the sinnes of man be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but by man, neither could the righteousnesse be meritorious for all, nor the price of ransome suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if the person which should perform both were not God. It was likewise needfull that the mediatour who should reconcile us unto God and make us and our prayers acceptable unto him should be both God and man: therefore God in his unspeakable mercy hath appointed and given his onely begotten Sonne to be our Mediatour, Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and Intercessour, who having assumed our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should therein satisfie his justice and appease his wrath; and having performed perfect obedience for us, and given himself a ransome for our sinnes, should ascend into heaven, and there sitting at the right hand of the Father should make intercession for us, that both the persons of such as believe in him and their prayers which call upon God in his name should be accepted of him.</p>
                  <p>But as in the former points we were forced to prove two things, not onely that God is to be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, but that he alone is to be called upon, and not Saints and Angels; so in this we are by the like su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the Papists compelled to demonstrate two things: first, that Christ is the onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here therefore I will shew two things: 1. That they seem to acknowledge other mediatours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and so in deed overthrow that which in word they confesse; 2. That none can be mediatour of intercession who is not also of redemption. For as touching the first; in many of their authorized prayers they desire God to have mercie on them in forgiving their sinnes, and in giving unto them good things as well spirituall as temporall for the merits and intercession of the Saints; and so plainly thrust the Saints into the office of Christ. And not onely so, but they invocate also the Saints as they do Christ to bestow good things upon them, and to aveit evil from them, substituting them, as I have shewed before, into the room of the tutelar gods of the heathen.</p>
                  <p>But let us see whether there be any mediatours of intercession who are not also of redemption. We denie not but that in a large sense they may be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>i inter,</hi> namely between God and man. So Moses
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42240:43"/>

                     </gap>, Gal. 3. 19. Deut. 5. 5. and 27. 31. Pastours likewise and preachers, who are both the mouth of God to the people in preaching and of the people to God in prayer: But they are not in that sense intercessours as we acknowledge Christ, and the Papists do esteem the Saints, that we for their merits &amp; intercession should hope to be heard. In like manner the Saints upon earth, who in mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charity do pray and make intercession one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as they are required 1. Tim. 2. 1. Jam. 5. 15, 16. may be called intercessours, but such as whose intercession dependeth wholly upon the intercession of Christ, and whose prayers are alwayes made in his name.</p>
                  <p>Why then may not the Saints in heaven be<note place="margin">Object.</note> esteemed intercessours?</p>
                  <p>For the intercession of Saints departed there is<note place="margin">Answ.</note> no testimonie of Scripture. It is not to be doubted<note place="margin">How the Saints in heaven may be said to pray, and for what.</note> but that they do use to invocate the name of God by praise and thanksgiving, bearing a part (as it were) in the quire of Angels. And it is not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but that they pray for that which is wanting unto them whilest their bodies sleep in the dust, that is, their full redemption; that the number of the elect being accomplished, the Lord would hasten the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Christ for their full redemption. In which prayer also they pray for us, as we also do for them; and in regard thereof we are as well interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours for them as they for us. It is also probable, that they being members of the same mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, indued with perfect charitie, do in generall pray for their fellow-members upon earth. But that in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42240:44"/>
particular they pray for any of us it is improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because they know not our persons, nor heare our prayers, nor understand our particular wants: or if they did, yet would it not follow that either we should pray to them, as I have shewed before, or that we should desire the Lord for their merits and intercessions to grant our desires. Neither is it to be doubted, but what praises or prayers they utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, they offer them onely in the name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ, desiring that for his merits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession their invocation may be accepted.</p>
                  <p>And in this sense Christ alone is the Mediatour of intercession. So Augustine speaking of those words<note place="margin">

Epist. 2. 1. saith, John doth not say, You have an advocate, for so should he separate himself from sinners: nor doth he say, You have me for a mediatour (as Parmenianus in a certain place maketh the Bishop a mediatour between God and the people) for then what good and faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian could indure him? who would look upon him as an Apostle of Christ and not as Antichrist? And again, All Christians do mutually commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto God in their prayers: <hi>pro quo autem nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus interpellat sed ipse pro omnibus, hic unus ver úsque mediator est:</hi> that is, but for whom none interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth but he for all, he alone is the true Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>Now that Christ is the onely Mediatour of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as wel as of redemption it is evident; because these being the two parts of his mediation, and not two sorts of Mediatours; the latter of intercession dependeth on the other of redemption, as being the representation of it unto God, and the application
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42240:44"/>
thereof to the faithfull: the dignitie, I say, efficacy and vertue of his intercession dependeth on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of redemption. For had Christ not been the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of redemption he could not have been the Mediatour of intercession. For when it is said that Christ maketh intercession for us in heaven, we are not thus to understand it, that he falleth down upon his knees and prayeth to God for us (John 16. 26. <hi>I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you</hi>) but that sitting at the right hand of his Father he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth his own merits unto him, and offereth the prayers of the faithfull unto God perfumed with the odours of his own sacrifice, as he is described, Revel. 8. 3, 4. So Anselme <hi>in Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Vnigenitum Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium pro hominibus interpellare, est apud coaeternum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem seipsum hominem demonstrare:</hi> The onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne is said to make intercession for men, when he sheweth himself man before his coeternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>The holy Ghost therefore joyneth both the parts<note place="margin">The holy Ghost joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption both in one.</note> together, 1. Tim. 2. 5. where speaking professedly of prayers, and saying that Christ is the onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour between God and man, he addeth, <hi>who gave himself a ransome for all.</hi> So 1. John 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man sinne we have an advocate Christ Jesus the righteous, &amp; he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> He onely is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, because he onely can plead his merits for us. He onely is perfectly &amp; fully just, he onely is the propitiation for our sinnes. And as he is the onely Intercessour because he is the onely Saviour, Acts 4.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42240:45"/>
12. so is he the perfect Saviour, <hi>because he ever liveth to make intercession for us,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. For whereas they ordain other intercessours for whose sake they desire to be heard, they do it altogether without warrant of Scriptures, wherein there is no doctrine, no precept, no promise, no example to warrant it: and consequently such prayer cannot be made in faith, neither can it please God. And with what forehead can they take from Christ his office and the honour thereof which he purchased with his bloud, and without any warrant from him assigne it to others: as though Christ having for a short time exercised the office of mediation, should to the end of the world have resigned it to his servants. But the holy Ghost teacheth the contrary Heb. 7. 25. that Christ is therefore <hi>able perfectly and fully,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to save those which by him do come to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he liveth ever to make intercession for them.</hi> Yea, the Scripture every where directeth us unto Christ and to no other mediatour, and therefore to no other must we slie, Ephes. 3. 12. Heb. 4. 16. and 7. 19. Christ is the onely way and the onely accesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: Those that leave this way and this accesse, they have no way nor accesse to God with hope or comfort; or if any will go to God any other way, in stead of a throne of grace they shall find a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of justice and terrour, and in stead of a mercifull Father a just &amp; terrible Judge. Our Saviour Christ in plain terms saith, John 14. 6. <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by me:</hi> and the Apostle, 1. Tim. 2. 5. <hi>That as there is but one God, so but one Mediatour between God and man, the man Christ, who is both God and man.</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42240:45"/>
For as S. Augustine, The Mediatour between God<note place="margin">

But Christ alone is both God and man, and therefore he alone is Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>The high Priest in the law was a type of Christ:<note place="margin">The high Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But to what purpose do they flie to other media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours? is it because the mediation of Christ is not sufficient? or is it because the Saints are in greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God? or lastly, because the Saints are more favourable to us then our Saviour Christ? If the first, they denie Christ to be a perfect Saviour, which the Apostle affirmeth Heb. 7. 25. If the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, they denie him to be the Sonne of God in whom he is well pleased with the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If the third, they deny him to be their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and mercifull Saviour, who hath loved us with the greatest love, unto which the love of the Saints being compared is as a little spark to agreat flame, or a drop of water to the great sea. He took our <hi>nature and infirmities,</hi> that he might have <hi>compassion on us,</hi> Heb. 2. 17, 18. and 4. 15, 16. He graciously inviteth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42240:46"/>
us to come unto him, and who do come he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not to reject, Matth. 11. 28. John 6. 37. Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious therefore and blasphemous are they against Christ, esteeming him as austere, and seeking to the Saints as more propitious; especially when they commit the administration of justice to Christ, and of mercy to his mother; and therefore appeal from the tribunal of his justice to the throne of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mercy. But besides the horrible superstition and idolatry, besides the sacrilegious injurie offered unto Christ, besides their own infidelitie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse towards Christ, it is extreme folly and madnesse rather to seek to other mediatours, seeing in Christ nothing is wanting which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a perfect Mediatour. For by his all-sufficient merits he hath satisfied the justice of God, so that for his merits we may trust to be heard: He is in highest favour with God, in whom the Lord graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously accepteth whomsoever he loveth; &amp; therefore we may be bold to pray that for his sake we may be heard: He heareth our prayers &amp; is acquainted with our persons and wants, and he is most gracious and favourable in commending our suits unto God: He hath commanded us to call upon God in his name, and hath promised that we shall obtein: Whereas the Saints have no merits to plead for themselves, and much lesse for others, but those of Christ. In Christ they are loved and graciously accepted. They heare not our prayers, neither are acquainted with our persons or wants; and all the love they have is but a small reflexion of the beams of Christs love shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42240:46"/>
neither have they either by commandment or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise moved us to seek to their mediation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have directed us unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That for Abrahams or Davids sake the Lord is said or requested to do something; In these examples not the merits of those Saints, but the covenant of grace which the Lord made with them is interpofed. If they plead antiquitie for their using the mediation of Saints, the first that brought in this superstition into the East-churches was Petrus Cirapheus the heretick, about the yeare 500, and in the West Gregory about the yeare 600.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures in this case give us the like coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to that which was given to Themistocles: For having occasion to use the favour of Admetus the King of the Molossi, who was offended with him, he asked counsel of the Queen how he might obtein the Kings favour; and being instructed by her, when the King returned from the Temple, held the Kings sonne between his arms, as desiring that for his sake he would receive him into favour, by which means the King was pacified towards him.</p>

                  <p>BUt to leave them. For our own instruction we are to learn, that we are alwayes to call upon God in the name of Christ. Now they are said to pray in the name of Christ, who believing in him and reposing their affiance in the merits and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ, do desire the Lord that not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42240:47"/>
their own unworthinesse or demerits, he would be pleased to heare them for Christs sake, and for his merits and intercession accept of their prayers.</p>
                  <p>The which includeth two things: 1. A desire that for Christs sake we may be heard. 2. A belief that for Christs sake we shall be heard. Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire we are here to speak; of the belief or faith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                  <p>That we are thus to pray in the name of Christ, is proved, 1. by the commandment of Christ, John 16. 24. 2. by his promise, John 16. 23. and 14. 13, 14. 3. by his prediction, John 16. 26. 4. by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the faithfull not onely since the ascension of Christ, who have alwayes used to conclude their prayers with this clause, <hi>per Dominum nostrum Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum Christum,</hi> through our Lord Jesus Christ; but also before the incarnation, Dan. 9. 17. <hi>for the Lords sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this was diversly figured in the law. For 1. Whereas by the propitiatory which covered the ark Christ was represented, therefore the faithfull when they were to pray turned their face towards the place where the ark remained.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereunto tended their sacrifices, which were a figure of Christs sacrifice, that for the merit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the prayers of them which did offer the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice might be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, as the high Priest once a yeare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the sanctuary, bearing on his shoulders the names and on his breast twelve stones the tokens of the twelve tribes, prayed for the people, who stood
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42240:47"/>
in the courts of the house: even so Christ being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heavenly sanctuary maketh intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, Heb. 10. 19. Apoc. 8. 3, 4. Therefore as Augustine saith, If you require a priest, he is above the heavens, where he maketh intercession for thee who in earth died for thee. He is the onely way by whom we have accesse unto God, John 14. 6. he is the onely Mediatour by whom we have <hi>accesse with boldnesse,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. he alone in whom God is well pleased with us, and appeased towards us, Rom. 3. 25. so that coming in his name, neither the sense of the dreadfull majestie of God, nor the conscience of our own unworthinesse shall dismay us. He is the altar, Heb. 13. 10. on which the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our prayer or praise being offered is thereby sanctified, vers. 15. He is, as Ambrose saith, our mouth by which we speak unto the Father, our eye by whom we see the Father, our right hand by which we offer our selves to the Father, without whose intercession neither we nor the Saints have ought to do with God. And herein especially the prayers of true Christians do differ from the prayers of others, that we call upon God in the name and mediation of Christ alone.</p>
                  <p>The use of all is, Heb. 4. 16. and 10. 19. that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have such an high Priest who maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us, that we should with boldnesse and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of faith offer up our prayers unto God: For 1. the <hi>Spirit of</hi> Christ <hi>helpeth our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. 2. God the Father justifieth and accepteth of us in Christ, v. 33. <hi>Who therefore shall lay any thing to our charge?</hi> who can condemn us seeing Christ died
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42240:48"/>
for our sinnes and rose again for our justification, and now sitteth at the right hand of God making intercession for us, v. 34. and with the odours of his own sacrifice perfumeth our prayers, making them acceptable unto God, Revel. 8. 3, 4.</p>

John 5. 14. So I said in the definition, That invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a religious speech of the faithfull made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in the name of Christ according to the will of God: where by the will of God we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, not his secret will and counsel which we know not, but his will revealed in his word. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is therefore made according to the will of God, when in our prayer those things are performed which God in his word prescribeth to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prayer.</p>
                  <p>This and the former point are of great moment: for when a man prayeth and is not heard, it is, as Bernard saith, because <hi>out praeter verbum petis, aut propter verbum non petis,</hi> that is, because thou prayest either beside the word or not for the word; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other side we have this confidence in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us, 1. John 5. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Now for the manner of prayer there are duties to

be performed not onely in the action it self, but also out of the action, that is to say, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the action of invocation the duties respecting the manner belong either to the internall form or externall. The former are the inward duties of the soul, the latter the outward speech and gesture of the bodie.</p>

So that true prayer is not the lifting up of the voice, of the eyes, or hands alone; but a lifting up of the heart with the hands unto God that is in the heavens, Lam. 3. 41. To the same purpose in the Scriptures we are directed to pray in the heart, Col. 3. 16. and in the spirit, that is, the soul, Ephes. 6. 18. to pray with the whole heart, Psal. 111. 1. that is, with an upright heart, Psal. 119. 7. with unfeigned lips, Psal. 17. 1. in truth, that is, in sinceritie and uprightnesse of heart, Psal. 145. 18.</p>

Both which folly and impietie the Psalmist noteth in the Israelites, Psal. 78. 36. That when the hand of God was upon them slaying divers of them, they sought him and called upon him: neverthelesse <hi>they did flatter,</hi> or go about to deceive him, <hi>with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him.</hi>

He is said to pray with feigned lips whose lips agree not with his heart, nor his words with his desires and thoughts; So saith Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, <hi>Labiis dolosis or at quis, cùm vox oris non convenit voci cordis;</hi> A man prayeth with deceitfull lips, when the voice of the mouth agreeth not with the voice of the heart. This is to pray with an heart and an heart, and thus prayeth every one which asketh that with his mouth which he doth not desire with his heart, and pretendeth that in his prayer which he doth not intend, which promiseth that in his prayer which he meaneth not to perform, or praiseth God for that whereof his conscience doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42240:50"/>
This is the condition of all impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to play the hypocrites before God in all their prayers concerning spirituall things.</p>
                  <p>We must learn therefore with David to pray with unfeigned lips, Psal. 17. 1. and to praise God with an upright heart, Psal. 119. 7. For if it be the propertie of a sound Christian, to speak unto his neighbour <hi>the truth which is in his heart,</hi> Psal. 15. how much more shall we think it to be our dutie when we call upon God who trieth the heart and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reins, to speak from the ground of our hearts. And if we will not stick to speak dissemblingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, who seeth our thoughts long before, Psal. 139. 2. what hope is there that we will make conscience to speak the truth unto men, who see no further then our mouthes? Let us therefore avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this leaven of hypocrisie, which sowreth our prayers, imbrace integrity and uprightnesse of heart, setting the Lord before our eyes, and behaving our selves in our prayer as those who sought to approve themselves to him who trieth the heart. Thus seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord with upright hearts we shall be sure to find him, and calling upon him in truth we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein our desires.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42240:50"/>
majesty of God to whom we speak, nor sense of those things whereof we speak: For if we consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we are speaking to the most mighty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, could we imagine that we ought to think of any thing rather then of that which we speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Do not men (as it were) gather their wits and cogitations together, so that no part thereof be derived to any thing else, when they do speak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any whom they do reverence? Or if our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were unfeignedly set upon those heavenly things whereof we speak, would we suffer our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations to wander about trifles on the earth? Wherefore as at all other times so especially when we pray we must (as the Wise man adviseth) <hi>above all observations observe and keep our hearts,</hi> Prov. 4. 23. that they wander not from God, (for, as Bernard saith, <hi>nihil cord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> fugacius,</hi> nothing is more fugitive then the heart) and that with David, 2. Sam. 7. 27. we may find our heart to call upon God. And to the same purpose let us pray, that as at all times so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in prayer the Lord would <hi>knit our hearts unto him,</hi> Psal. 86. 11. that they go not astray after vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Let us resist the suggestions of Satan, let us shake off our own sluggishnesse; and to that end let us set before us the infinite majestie of God to whom we speak, the excellencie and necessitie of those graces for which we pray and give thanks: let us also pray with David, Psal. 141. 3. that the <hi>Lord would set a watch before our mouthes, and keep the doore of our lips,</hi> that neither our minds go a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vanities, nor our tongues, which should be as the <hi>pen of a ready writer,</hi> be rash to utter any thing before
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42240:51"/>
God; and to utter nothing but that which the <hi>mind doth indite.</hi> And therefore we must take heed that the speech of the mouth do not go before but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow the conceit of the mind. For many times it cometh to passe, that as the musicians fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers will run over a song which he hath been used to play although his mind be otherwise occupied, so in prayer the tongue will run over that form of words which it hath been used to utter, though the mind be roving about other matters. But this ought not so to be: for howsoever the Schoolmen do not require an actuall intention of the mind in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but onely a purpose to pray in the beginning (therein framing their doctrine to their practice, and not their practice to Gods word) yet seeing this kind of prayer proceedeth from the mouth and not from the heart, it is but lip-labour in the sight of God.

                  <p>And to conclude, let the absurditie of the fault it self, and the grosse abusing of the majestie of God, breed in us a lothing of this fault and a care to shun it. For when at any time our minds have wandred in prayer, let us endeavour to joyn into one speech the prayer of the mouth and the speech of the heart,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42240:52"/>
both which do sound in the eares of the Lord, and then consider whether we would make such a speech, I say not, according to Malachi's rule, to our Prince, but, to any man whom we regard, which we are not abashed to offer unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And thus have you heard the two faults opposed to praying in truth: whereof the former is a note of hypocrites and impenitent sinners; the latter, though a foul fault and carefully to be avoided, yet incident to the children of God: For even in this sense the best of us may complain with David that our heart forsaketh us, Psal. 40. 12. and as Augustine citeth<note place="margin">

                  <p>THus much of that which is generally required in the soul: Now let us see what is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly required in the mind and in the heart. In the mind two things are required, Knowledge and Faith.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge 1. Of God to whom we pray, and<note place="margin">First, we must know God.</note> of his will according to which we are to pray; 2. Of that which we in our invocation do utter in the presence of God. First, there is required knowledge and acknowledgement of the true God, and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent: otherwise we are subject to the censure of our Saviour given to the Samaritanes, John 4. 22. <hi>You worship you know not what.</hi> First we must know God before we can believe in him, and we must believe in him or else we cannot call upon him, Rom. 10. 14. Therefore David exhorteth his sonne Solomon, 1. Chron. 28. 9. first <hi>to know,</hi> then <hi>to worship the God of his fathers with a willing mind and an upright heart.</hi> For all worship of God which is not guided by knowledge is mere will-worship and superstition. Neither is that to be accounted religion or pietie which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from ignorance; as the Papists hold igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be the mother of devotion. But that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is blind superstition. Knowledge is as it were the stern which guideth us in the right way of serving God according to his word, without which we wander into will-worship and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inventions. And therefore as of God there is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42240:53"/>
knowledge required, so also of his will revealed in<note place="margin">2. We must know Gods will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pray accor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Secondly, there is required knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of that which we do pray; otherwise we are subject to our Saviours reproof, Matth. 20. 22. <hi>You ask you know not what.</hi> Prayer not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood is the lifting up of the voice, and not of the soul unto God, and a pouring forth of our breath and speaking into the aire, and not a pouring forth of our hearts and souls unto the Lord: for as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine saith; Seeing as it is Psal. 89. 16. <hi>Beatus populus</hi>

Quid opus est jubilare &amp; non intelligere jubilationem? ut vox nostra sola jubilet, &amp; cor non jubilet? Sonus enim cordis intellectus est:</hi> that is, Blessed is the people which understandeth the joyfull sound. Let us therefore haste (saith he) after this happinesse, let us understand this joyfull sound, and not vent it out without understanding. What use is there of a joyfull sound and not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it? that our voice onely should make this joyfull sound, and not our heart? For the sound of the heart is understanding. Wherefore the Apostle, Col. 3. 16. exhorteth us that the <hi>word of God dwell in us plenteously in all wisdome, teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing our selves in psalmes and hymnes and spirituall songs, singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord.</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42240:53"/>
Where the Apostle as he doth in generall require in every Christian a plentifull knowledge of the word of God to direct him in his worship of God, so he teacheth us the use of our Psalmes and songs which we sing unto the Lord, to wit, that we and those that heare us may be instructed and edified thereby, which without understanding of that which is said cannot be done, as the Apostle sheweth, 1. Cor. 14. And to the same effect doth the Prophet David ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us, Psal. 47. 7, 8. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Here therefore two sorts of men are condemned: the first of those who pray in an unknown tongue; the second of them who praying in their own tongue do not understand their own prayer.</p>

                  <p>First, That which the Lord by his Apostle hath commanded to be done, that is necessarily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: But the Lord by his Apostle hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the sacred service should be done in a language known, and not in a strange language un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the people. For what he there teacheth he testifieth that they were the commandments of God, v. 37.</p>
                  <p>But let us heare the Popish shifts used to avoid the force of this testimonie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Apostle speaketh not of prayer but<note place="margin">The Papists shifts avoided which they use to clude the Apostles words, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> of preaching and exhortation, which they confesse are to be made in a known tongue, otherwise that they are unprofitable and edifie not. Why then by the same reason do they not reade the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in a known tongue unto the people, but hide the light of Gods word under the bushel of a strange language? But I answer, That the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the whole Divine service of God, the Church as well praying and praysing of God, as preaching and prophesying, v. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, but the Apostle speaketh of such as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<note place="margin">Object.</note> the gifts of tongues, did pray in a tongue which themselves knew not; and of them he saith, that <hi>in their spirit,</hi> that is, in their affection, <hi>they pray; but their mind,</hi> not understanding what they say, <hi>is unfruitfull,</hi> namely to themselves.</p>
                  <p>It is not credible that they which had the gift of<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42240:54"/>
tongues did not understand the language which they spake (though some of the Fathers have so concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) for that had been an unprofitable gift to them and others. Chrysostome <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>Homil.</hi> 35. You will say, Doth the tongue edifie no bodie? Not so. For he that speaketh, saith he, with tongues edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himself, v. 4. which verily cannot be except he understand what he saith. Neither is it the Apostles<note place="margin">
                        <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</note> meaning, that his understanding is unprofitable to himself (as Bellarmine affirmeth) for he saith that he edifieth himself, but to the hearers who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him not. Neither is it <hi>to pray in the spirit</hi> in that place, to pray in affection without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing himself: but <hi>to pray in the spirit,</hi> is to pray in the closet of a mans soul, being not understood of others; and <hi>to pray with understanding,</hi> is to pray that others may understand. So the Apostle seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to expound the phrase v. 19. <hi>In the Church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the people of necessitie ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the publick prayers made in the Church: therefore they ought to be made in a language known to them. The antecedent is denied by the Papists under this pretense; Publick prayer is made<note place="margin">Object.</note> not to the people, but to God for the people, which may be as available for them in an other language as in their own.</p>
                  <p>If God understood or regarded no language but<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Latine, there were some shew of reason in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: but all tongues are alike known &amp; esteemed of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42240:55"/>
God; and he is no accepter of persons, much lesse of tongues. Again, publick prayer as it is made for the people, so it is the prayer of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and we shall prove that every one ought to understand his own prayer. The Minister doth pray, but the people ought to concurre with him in their prayers, and to give their consent thereunto by saying, <hi>Amen:</hi> which they cannot do if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not what is said, v. 16. <hi>Else when thou shalt blesse in the spirit, how shall he which occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Papists say, That the Apostle meaneth not every one unlearned in the Laitie, but the clerk of the Church, who supplieth the place of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But the words do signifie not him who supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place or stead, but he that filleth or occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place of the unlearned, that is to say, one of that rank, and so is expounded by the Greek Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, why is speech used at all in publick prayer? and why do the people assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereunto? For speech is not needfull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, who searcheth the heart; neither is the presence of the people necessarie at a prayer which is onely made for them: but words in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer are used that the people both might be guided and edified, and also that they might joyn with the speaker and adde their consent, in which respect also their presence, is necessary.

Because, as I have said, it is their prayer, whereunto also they are to give their consent, which the Apostle saith they cannot do unlesse they understand what is spoken, v. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prayer uttered in a language unknown is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the congregation, as the Apostle saith; <hi>If I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you?</hi> v. 6. <hi>such an one speaketh in the aire,</hi> v. 9. that is, saith the Greek Scholiast, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all things must be done to edification: Which generall the Apostle applyeth to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, v. 26. For it is a most true saying of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Fourthly, all things must be done decently and in order, v. 40. But when publick prayers are made in an unknown language, there happeneth much disorder and confusion, like that of Babel.

The minister and people meeting to publick prayer use not publick prayer but private, for it is not the place but the congregation that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it publick. But the minister praying in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known language, his prayer is private; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they do pray at all, betake themselves to their private devotions.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto adde examples and precedents. For the Patriarchs and Prophets under the law, the Apostles and Primitive Church did alwayes pray in a known tongue. Neither can any sound testimonie or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved example be produced to the contrary for six hundred yeares after Christ. Vitalicus the Pope about the yeare 666, which is the number of the beast whose name is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is thought to have been the first authour of this ordinance, concerning Divine service to be done in Latine. Origen saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Contra Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, lib.</hi> 8.</note> That every nation in their mother tongue make their prayers unto God and yield him due praises. So Basil, <hi>Epist.</hi> 63. <hi>ad cler. Neocaesar.</hi> And to the examples of the ancient Church we may adde the practice not onely of the reformed Churches, but also of the Ethiopians and Egyptians, Syrians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Moscovites, Moravians, and Sclavonians;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42240:56"/>
all which at this day observe the ancient form of praying in their vulgar languages.</p>

And yet will the Papists be counted Catholicks, who in this point, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, go against the practice and doctrine uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall of the Primitive Church for six hundred yeares after Christ.</p>
                  <p>But, say they, the Latine tongue doth better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note place="margin">Object.</note> the majestie of the Divine service, which is diminished in vulgar languages.</p>
                  <p>The commendation of prayer consisteth not in<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the language, whereof there is no difference to be made in respect of God, but in the sense of the words and devotion of him that prayeth. That which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42240:57"/>
the Apostle speaketh against praying in unknown tongues, is as much verified concerning the Latine tongue, in respect of them which understand it not, as concerning any other.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but holy mysteries are not to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated<note place="margin">Object.</note> to the vulgar, nor precious stones are to be cast unto dogs and hogs.</p>
                  <p>But holy mysteries are to be expounded to the<note place="margin">Answ.</note> people of God; who may not be compared to dogs or swine, by whom are meant profane persons and scorners of religion.</p>
                  <p>But since prayers have been made in vulgar<note place="margin">Object.</note> tongues devotion is waxed colder in those parts and religion decayed.</p>
                  <p>Many are made worse by the preaching of the<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Gospel; and where best means are used, the people if they be not the better are the worse. In respect of them devotion is decayed, but in respect of all sound Christians it flourisheth. Neither was that true devotion or religion which they say by vulgar prayers is decayed, but will-worship and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which men are usually more fervent then in the profession of the truth. For such is the common hypocrisie of men, that when they think to satisfie the Lord with outward observations, they will be forward in that kind; Micah 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching private prayers in an unknown<note place="margin">Of private prayers in an unknown tongue, and the evils thereof.</note> tongue, it is certain that they which so pray do scarcely perform any dutie that is required, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise any grace which is to be shewed in prayer. For first, he prayeth without understanding, and therefore not as a man, but rather as an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42240:57"/>
creature, as Augustine saith; <hi>Quid hoc sit quod in</hi>

                        <hi>In Psal.</hi> 18. <hi>Expos.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Psalmo dicitur,</hi> AB OCCULTIS MUNDA ME, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere debemus, ut humanâ ratione non quasi avium voce cantemus: Nam &amp; merulae &amp; psittaci &amp; pici &amp; hujusmodi volucres saepe ab hominibus docentur sonare quod nesciunt:</hi> What this should be which is said in the Psalme, <hi>Cleanse me from secret sins,</hi> we ought to understand, that we ought to sing with humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not (as it were) with the voice of birds: For even black-birds, parrots, pies, and such like birds are often taught by men to sound that which they do not understand. So Cassiod. <hi>in Psal.</hi> 46. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo sapienter facit quod non intelligit:</hi> No man doth wisely that which he understandeth not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doth he pray in spirit, but the prayer not understood is a mere lip-labour. The sound of the soul is the understanding. Neither is that any speech of the soul which it doth not understand, neither can they pray but with continuall wandring thoughts: For the mind will not attend that which it doth not understand: or if they do, they do but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the words, and not to the matter, which they do not understand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As he which prayeth before others in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage unknown to them, his understanding is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them, neither are they edified thereby; so when a man prayeth in a language which himself understandeth not, his understanding is unfruitfull to himself. And as he which praying in an unknown tongue to others, is to them a barbarian; so he which prayeth in a tongue which he doth not understand, is a barbarian to himself.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42240:58"/>4. Neither can he pray with faith that his request shall be granted, when he knoweth not what his request is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What reverence is here shewed to the majestie of God, when men presume to babble before him they know not what? And what conceit have they of God, when they hope by such lip-labour to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for their sinnes and to merit eternall life?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How can men either ask with fervencie of spirit or give thanks with alacritie of heart when they do not so much as know whether they pray or give thanks?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Bodily exercise profiteth little,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 8. for God respecteth not the mouth but the heart: But this prayer in an unknown tongue is a mere bodily exercise; and so in the church of Rome is usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to penitents as a penall work.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Battologie is to be avoided in prayer, Matth. 6. But this babbling and multiplying of prayers without understanding, especially joyned with numbring of them on their beads, as though by how much the more and longer so much more meritorious and satisfactorie, is most grosse batto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14. 37, 38. <hi>If any man think himself to be a prophet or spirituall, let him acknowledge what the prophet hath written</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the use of a known tongue in the service of God, <hi>to be the commandments of God: But if any,</hi> saith he, <hi>be ignorant let him be ignorant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like may be said of those who praying in their mother-tongue, do not understand what they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42240:58"/>
say. For the prayer which is made without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">Prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in our mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, if we pray not with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> is also without faith, without feeling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true devotion: neither is it a lifting up of the mind but of the voyce unto God, and a bare reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of a set form of words without any inward grace; such as parrots might be taught to make. Wherein many are so grosse that they use the Creed and the ten Commandments for prayers, and recite them with the like devotion as they do the Lords prayer. I deny not but that it is good for the simpler sort to meditate both of the Creed &amp; of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, the one conteining the summe of that which we are to believe, the other comprising the summe of that which we are to do; &amp; likewise to pray unto God that he would increase our faith in the one and our obedience to the other. But neither of both is to be used as a form of prayer, because in neither we do either ask any thing which we want, or give thanks for that which we have received. Let men therefore which would call upon God, labour for knowledge and understanding. For a prayer of five words (such as was the Publicanes prayer, <hi>Deus, propitius esto mihi peccatori,</hi> God be mercifull unto me a sinner, uttered with understanding is better then a prayer of an houre long not understood.</p>

The former is that perswasion or assurance of the soul, whereby we believing in Christ are in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure perswaded of Gods love towards us in Christ, and therefore are incouraged to come with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the throne of grace, not doubting but that both we and our pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>rs are acceptable unto God in Christ, Heb. 4. 16. And this assurance of faith is grounded partly on the will and love of God, and partly on the merits and intercession of our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

On the will of God, 1. in generall, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 17, 18.</note> in his commandments injoyning this dutie, and his gracious promises. For if God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to call upon him, and hath graciously promised to heare us, why should we doubt but that this our service is acceptable unto him? 1. Thess. 5. 17, 18. <hi>Pray continually; in all things give thanks: for this is the will of God</hi> (the acceptable will of God in Christ) <hi>concerning you.</hi> But chiefly on the promises of God is our faith to be grounded: Which promises are either generall; and those not onely that he will heare and accept, but also graciously reward this exercise of piety performed to him, Matth. 6. 4. <hi>Godlinesse hath the promise both of this life and of that which is to come:</hi> or speciall, for the granting of that which we desire, as Gen. 32. 9, 12. Exod. 32. 13. 2. Sam. 7. 27, 28. 1. Chron. 17. 25. Secondly, in particular, that the thing which we either pray or praise be good; as being referred to Gods glory and our good. For if it be not good, we are neither, if we have it not, to desire it, and much lesse to pray for it, nor if we have it to praise God as the authour and giver of it. We must have warrant in Gods word that the thing for which we call upon God be such as God hath promised to give, otherwise our prayer is turned into sinne. And in this sense the Apostle saith, <hi>Let every man be perswaded in his mind: for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne,</hi> Rom. 14. 23.</p>
                  <p>Likewise our faith must be grounded on the love of God and goodnesse: First, in generall, that is, Psal. 5. 7. his bounty and readinesse to heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all those that call upon him. Heb. 11. 6. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

Secondly, in particular, to our selves in Christ: John 16. 27. Rom. 8. 32. and 5. 5. and 8. 15, 16. Psal. 55. 16, 17. <hi>I will call upon God, &amp; the Lord will save me. Evening and morning and at noon will I pray, and he will heare my voice.</hi> Psal. 4. 3. <hi>The Lord will heare when I call unto him.</hi> Psal. 56. 9. <hi>When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know, for God is for me.</hi> Psal. 86. 7. <hi>In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the merits of Christ, whereby we are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in his intercession, whereby our prayers are made acceptable, Heb. 10. 22. And in this sense al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we are to pray in the name of Christ, that is, not onely with desire that for Christs sake we may be heard, but also with perswasion and some measure of assurance that for Christs sake we shall be heard, John 16. 23. To call upon God in the name of Christ implyeth two things: 1. To desire that for Christs sake we may be heard; 2. To believe that for Christs sake we shall be heard.</p>

Publicane, in conscience of his sinfulnesse: The Pharisee in a brave manner thanketh God that he was not a sinner like other men; the Publicane in most humble manner acknowledgeth himself to be a sinner, and craveth pardon for his sin. But what was the issue of their prayer? Which speedeth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? the humble sinner, or the proud justitiarie? The Publicane goeth home justified; the Pharisee remaineth in his sin: according to that John 9. 41. And the reason is, because, as our Saviour saith, <hi>every one that exalteth himself shall be brought low, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</hi> To this accordeth Psal. 138. 6. <hi>The Lord is high, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the lowly: but the proud he knoweth a farre off.</hi> Psal. 51. 17. <hi>The sacrifices of the Lord</hi> (that is, that which he esteemeth above all sacrifices) <hi>are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite spirit: a broken and contrite heart he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise;</hi> meaning, that he doth in speciall manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it.

                  <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of Reverence required in prayer, and Heartinesse.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe second thing required in the heart is a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Majesty of God to whom we speak, according to Davids both advice, Psal. 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with reverence, and rejoyce with trembling;</hi> and practice, Psal. 5. 7. <hi>I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercie</hi> (that is, trusting therein) <hi>and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>he fear or reverence of thee will I worship towards thy holy temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we are thus to call upon God, I shall not need to prove: For if when we are to speak to a Prince, we are touched with great reverence of an earthly Majestie, how are we to be affected when we speak unto God? And if the blessed angels being in Gods presence and sounding forth his prayse, are described in the Scriptures as having six wings, whereof two pair serve to cover their face &amp; their feet, Isa. 6. 2, 3. thereby betokening their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reverence of God; how much more should we, who inhabit these houses of clay, subject to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and corrupted with sinne, be strucken with an awfull reverence of God?</p>
                  <p>If therefore we did but seriously consider, That we<note place="margin">Meditations to stirre up reverence.</note> are to speak vnto God, and did set him before our eyes who is in Majestie most glorious, and therefore to be reverenced; for power omnipotent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be feared, Luke 12. for greatnesse or infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse rather in every place, and therefore present with us to heare what we say and to behold what we do; for knowledge omniscient and a searcher of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42240:65"/>
the heart, and therefore throughly acquainted with what disposition and affection we do come before him; for holinesse and justice a most pure Spirit, and therefore will be worshiped in spirit &amp; truth; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is, as Malachi speaketh, our Father, and therefore to be reverenced; our Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be feared, chap. 1. 6. If, I say, we did set him before our eyes, and our selves in his presence (as we ought alwayes to do, but especially when we call upon him) it cannot be but that we shall be touched with great reverence of his glorious Majestie, and therefore shall behave our selves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, doing speaking thinking nothing but that which may become his presence, and whereof we may be bold to admit him to be the hearer and the judge; all light behaviour, all wandring thoughts being far removed and abandoned, and we for the time being elevated above all earthly cogitations and having our conversation in heaven, supposing (as Chrysostome saith) our selves to be in the midst of the Angels, and performing the like exercise with them.</p>
                  <p>You see our duty: But what is our practice? Do no we vile wretches when we present our selves before the Lord behave our selves many times with lesse reverence or regard then if we were speaking to a mortall man that is our supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>iour? Insomuch that we hold it for good advice, (as indeed it is, respecting our weaknes) In such sort to speak to men as if God did heare us, so to speak to God as if man did heare us. And is not this an evidence that we are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nall, that our hearts are affected with no more
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42240:65"/>
then our senses apprehend, and that we want those eyes of faith which Moses had, Heb. 11. 27. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be moved to behave our selves in the presence of God <hi>as seeing him that is invisible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to move us both to humilitie and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, let us consider, as Solomon adviseth Eccles 5. 1, 2. that God to whom we speak <hi>is in the heaven,</hi> full of majestie and power; (which consideration our Saviour also teacheth us to have in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our prayer, Matth. 6. 9.) and we which do speak <hi>are on the earth,</hi> base and vile, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our mould, being but dust and ashes, but especially in respect of our sinnes, whereby we have made our selves unworthy to appear in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. And unto both these we are excited Psal. 95. which is prefixed as a preparative to our Liturgie, v. 6. <hi>Come let us worship and fall down, let us kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our maker: For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing is heartinesse, devotion, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour<note place="margin">Of hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cie, and devotion r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in prayer.</note> of the mind, when we are throughly affected with those things whereof we speak, calling upon God with our whole hearts. For if that be good counsel which the wise Solomon giveth, That <hi>what we do we do it with all our might,</hi> Eccles 9. 10. it is especially to be followed in prayer, wherein we are not to be cold or careless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. This heartinesse in prayer, is servencie or earnestnesse of desire; in thanksgiving, alacritie and chearfulnesse: the former arising from the sense of our want, the latter from the sense and experience of Gods goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: And it is that which giveth wings to our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42240:66"/>
prayers, and causeth them to ascend before God: This is called <hi>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here therefore two things are to be avoided: The first is coldnesse; when men call upon God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sense either of their wants in prayer, or of Gods blessings in thanksgiving; calling upon God for fashion or custome sake, <hi>usu mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s quàm sensu oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> praying rather out of use then sense. Such a prayer wanting lively affections is dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore counterfeit and hypocriticall, and a mere bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worship. For this is to call upon God with our mouthes but not with our hearts; this is to pray without desire, and to give thanks without grace in our hearts. The other is <hi>taedium in orando,</hi> weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in praying; That is, when mens hearts being set on other matters, all time that is bestowed in prayer is thought too long: and therefore the prayer as it is unwillingly begun so is it wearisomely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the end of the prayer many times being more desired then the end for which prayer was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. But our invocation must be as a free-will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering, and our service of God must be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a willing mind: neither is that to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a service of the soul which is without either the understanding (as I said before) or the will.</p>

Now we are to speak of those things which are required in the body: For though bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise being severed from the inward worship is little worth, yet being joyned with the inward it is of some moment. For where the Lord commandeth any duty or forbiddeth any sinne, there also he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth or forbiddeth the signes and appearances thereof; and therefore where he requireth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship of the soul in prayer, as <hi>honorem facti,</hi> the honour of the deed, there also he requireth the outward of the body when it may be convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercised, as <hi>honor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now our bodies and members thereof, as<note place="margin">The signes of worship ought out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to be expressed with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and the reasons why; 1.

As at the first the Lord created and afterwards redeemed both our souls and bodies, so must we worship him in both, 1. Cor. 6. 20. therefore where the worship of God may be performed in both conveniently, both must be used.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the two first commandments where the<note place="margin">2.

And so in other places, as the yielding of outward worship to any other is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, Isai. 2. 9. Psal. 44. 20. and the deniall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commended, Dan. 3. in the three children; 1. Kings 18. 19. so the performance thereof unto

                     </note> we are to consider the gesture of the body and the speech of the mouth: For neither of which can there any certain universall rule be prescribed as necessarie to be observed alwayes in private prayer. In publick prayer we are to follow the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church where we live, if it be without scandal and superstition.

                  <p>Now the Church is to direct it self by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the godly recorded in the Scriptures, and practice of the Primitive Church. First for gesture: Concerning which thus much in generall may be

                  <p>The varietie of gestures mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do shew that we are not perpetually tied to any particular as necessary in it self: but that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are indifferent and arbitrarie if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and prescribed by the Church.

                  <p>The gestures to be considered in prayer are either of the whole body, or of the parts. As 1. the turning of the body towards some part of the heavens, east or west, &amp;c.

If therefore they were in the east from it,

they were to turn into the west; and to pray towards the east, turning their backs towards the temple, was a fault, Ezek. 8. 16.

The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the head in men.</note> among us is an usuall signe of reverence. In the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male sex it is otherwise; in which the covering of their head and face is noted in the Scriptures to have been a token of subjection, 1. Cor. 11. 4, 7. But in men it is a fit gesture to betoken their reverence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uncovering and so abasing of the highest and chiefest part; and by some is called <hi>depositio magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiae,</hi> the laying aside of magnificence: as we see in the foure and twenty elders, Apoc. 4. 10. which fell down and cast their crowns before the throne.</p>

The former is most usuall, betokening the lifting up of our hearts unto God, and our faith in expecting help from him; and is sometime put for prayer it self, Psal. 123. 1, 2. <hi>Vnto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 141. 8. <hi>But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord, in thee is my trust,</hi> Psal. 25. 15. 2. Chron. 20. 12. To omit other examples, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>rist himself is ofen noted in the Gospel to have <hi>lift up his eyes to heaven</hi> when he called upon God: as Matth. 14. 19. John 11. 41. and 17 1.</p>
                  <p>The casting down of the eyes is a note of great dejection and humiliation, whereby we being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in our selves, as knowing our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42240:69"/>
to look up unto heaven, do cast down our eyes on the earth. Example, the Publicane, Luke 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the hands.<note place="margin">3. Of the hands.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As 1. the Lifting up &amp; stretching forth of the hands: A gesture fit to expresse our humilitie, our earnest affection, as being the gesture of suppliants and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest suiters; as also to testifie our faith and hope, and to signifie the lifting up of our souls. And it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of such moment that it also is put for prayer, Exod. 9. 33. Psal. 28. 2. and 44. 20. and 63. 4. and 88. 9. Isai. 1. 15. Examples, in Moses, Exod. 9. 29, 33. and 17. 11. David, Psal. 141. 2. and 143. 6. Solomon, 1. Kings 8. 22, 54. It is commanded Psal. 134. 2. Lam. 2. 19. and 3. 41.</p>
                  <p>The other gesture of the hands is the Knocking of the breast: Which is most fit in deprecation; for thereby is signified both our acknowledgement of guilt, and an earnest desire of pardon; as Luke 18. 13. and 23. 48.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you heard the several gestures: Among which I would commend unto you as fit most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ordinarily to be observed, uncovering of the head in men, standing, or rather (if we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently) kneeling, lifting up of the hands and of the eyes to heaven. For whereas in the soul are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired faith, humilitie, reverence, and ardour of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which we are to expresse in the bodily ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, whereby we give God <hi>honorem signi,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the signe; these gestures are most fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse these inward graces. For the uncovering of the head signifieth reverence and humility; which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42240:70"/>
also are more expressed by kneeling: Faith and hope is represented in the lifting up of the eyes &amp; hands; in which also, as in kneeling, the ardour of affection is expressed.</p>
                  <p>But here our greatest care must be (because it is easie to observe these outward gestures) to give God in truth the inward worship of the soul as well as the outward of the body, which without the other is hypocriticall: And therefore as we unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads, so to lay aside all opinion and conceit of our own worthinesse, and with all reverence to set our selves in the presence of God; and as we kneel outwardly, so to bow the knees of our hearts and to humble our souls before the Lord; and with our eyes and hands, to lift up our souls unto God who is in the heavens. And withall we must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to lift up pure and innocent hands to God, 1. Tim. 2. 8. For if our hands be stained with sinne or polluted with bloud, the Lord will not heare, Isai. 1. 15. <hi>Quid manuum in oratione vult extensio?</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the Voyce to be used in prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>COncerning the voice it may be demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Quest.</note> it be needfull in prayer, seeing the Lord heareth as well and regardeth more the prayer of the heart then the voyce of the mouth. And this doth Elias signifie 1. Kings 18. 27. when he mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Baals priests, saying, <hi>Cry aloud: he is a god,</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that if he were a god he could heare them though they did not cry aloud. I answer, That the<note place="margin">Answ.</note> voyce is needfull not in respect of the Lord, who heareth and respecteth especially the cry of the heart, but in respect of us and others with whom we pray, &amp; therefore is to be used when it may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, for the reasons before alledged. Indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the private prayer of one alone it is more convenient to use the inward speech of the heart
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42240:71"/>
alone, when the outward speech of the tongue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be used but that it shall be heard or perceived of others. For private prayer must be made in secret, as Christ commandeth Matth. 6. 6. lest we pray, or at least seem to pray, that we may be heard or seen of men. When as therefore we are occasioned to pray by our selves alone in presence of others, we must pray in the closet of our heart, using no voyce nor making any outward shew of prayer: and the Lord which seeth the secrets of the heart will reward openly. Thus Abrahams servant standing at the well, unto which was ordinary resort, prayed in his heart, Gen. 24. 45. and Moses being among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Exod. 14. 15. and Nehemiah being in the Kings presence, Neh. 2. 4. and Annah the mother of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel in the presence of Eli, 1. Sam. 1. 13. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in private prayer it is most convenient, and in prayer with others, whether in the Church or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it is necessary that the voice in prayer should be used: for otherwise those that are present cannot consent to our prayers and say <hi>Amen;</hi> neither can they be edified thereby unlesse they heare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the prayer.</p>
                  <p>Our duty is (as I have said before) to worship God both in body and soul: And as we are to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God with all our members and powers, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by our tongue and speech: For therefore hath God given us the facultie of spee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>h above other creatures, that we might not onely be the matter of his glory as they are, but also the instruments to sound forth his praise. And therefore is our tongue called our <hi>glory,</hi> Psal. 16. 7. and 108. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> because it is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42240:71"/>
that instrument by which we are to set forth Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as the gesture of the body so much more the voyce of the tongue doth serve both to stirre up the affections of the heart and also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the cogitations from wandring about other matters. And of such moment is the voice in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as that first the voice, or cry with the voice, is put sometime for the prayer it self, 1. Sam. 7. 8, 9. Psal. 66. 17. and 77. 1. and 142. 1. Secondly, the holy Ghost in many places where he speaketh of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is carefull to mention <hi>the voice;</hi> as in the places even now cited out of the Psalmes, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as Psal. 71. 23, 24. and 119. 171. <hi>my lips shall utter praise.</hi> For which cause prayer and prayse are called <hi>the calves of our lips,</hi> Hos. 14. 2. Thirdly, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid prayeth, <hi>Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise,</hi> Psal. 51. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>But here we must alwayes remember, that with our voice we must lift up our hearts to God, and that the cry of the voyce must proceed from the cry of the heart: For the Lord respecteth the heart; and if the cry come not from thence he will not heare it, Hos. 7. 13, 14. no, though men should cry loud in his eares, Ezek. 8. 18.</p>
                  <p>The voyce used in prayer is either inarticulate, or articulate.</p>
                  <p>The inarticulate is that which is uttered in sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, groning, and weeping: For the children of God many times do best expresse their desires by sighs and grones a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the spirit of God, which teacheth us to pray <hi>with sighs that cannot be expressed,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. <hi>And he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit,</hi> v. 27. For as David saith Psal. 38. 9. <hi>Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groning is not hid from thee. Thou tellest my wandrings: put my tears into thy</hi>

                     </gap>, according to the meaning of our Saviour, is in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ayer to use multitude of words and idle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions with this conceit, That for the multitude of our words we shall be heard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the reason which our Saviour gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; <hi>Christians in their prayer must not be like to the heathen.</hi> The heathen affected prolixitie and used superfluity of words and idle repetitions with this perswasion, that for their much babling they should be heard. But why must not Christians be like the heathen? Because the God on whom we call is most unlike. The heathen might well imagine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their gods (the best whereof were men deceased) that by multitude of words they might be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that alwayes they did not hearken unto them, as being otherwise imployed, as Elias telleth Baals priests, 1. Kings 18. 27. and therefore thought it needfull to repeat the same things oft, that if they did not heare them at one time they might at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As we see those priests of Baal to call upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42240:73"/>
him from morning, v. 26, 29. untill the time of the evening sacrifice, crying again and again, <hi>O Baal, heare us.</hi> But the true God on whom we call, he is our heavenly Father; and therefore for his love most ready and willing to heare us, even before we call upon him, Isai. 65. 24. And for his knowledge he knoweth what we stand in need of before we pray, as our Saviour sheweth v. 8. Which may be a third reason.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Solomon, Eccles 5. 1, 2. dehorteth from the same fault by two reasons: First, <hi>God is in heaven, and thou on earth: therefore let thy words be few.</hi> God sitteth in the heavens, as his throne full of majestie, power and glory; and we are on the earth, base and vile, being as nothing in comparison of him: therefore in great humility and reverence we are to speak unto him, framing and moderating our speech so as there be nothing idle or superfluous therein. For when a man is to speak to his prince or any whom he doth reverence, he will labour that his speech may be pithy, avoiding all vain, idle and superfluous talk.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Because in multitude of words folly is committed; <hi>For as multitude of businesse causeth dreams, so multitude of words argueth folly,</hi> v. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If in our speech with men ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Seventhly, Plato, though an heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, yet in his wisdome, for which he was called divine, he saw that brevitie and pithinesse in prayer was to be affected rather then prolixite; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preferreth the short prayer of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>That God would give them</hi>

                  <p>But never did the heathen so grossely offend in their battologie as the Papists at this day; who num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring upon their beads their prayers which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves understand not, perswade themselves that the more often they do repeat their <hi>Pater-nosters</hi> and their <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> the more satisfactory and meritorious their prayer is before God: yea, and to the greater multitude of such idle repetitions the Popes have granted the greater indulgences. For whereas according to the invention of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick their rosary or string of beads consisteth of 55 beads, whereof five (that is, every eleventh) be greater, to signifie that to every <hi>Pater-noster</hi> they must recite ten <hi>Ave-Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>What then? is it not lawfull to make long praiers? I answer, That prayer is not condemned of batto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or too much prolixity, wherein nothing is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, neither is made with that opinion that for the lengths sake it shall be heard.

                  </head>
                  <p>AS touching the quality of our speech; As we need not to be curious in respect of the style, because God looketh to the uprightnesse of the heart rather then the elegancie of the speech, so must we not be more carelesse &amp; negligent for the manner of speech then we would be if we were to speak to any mortall man. And because we are but too car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, let us make use of Malachi's rule, chap. 1. 8. <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to thy Prince;</hi> that is, Let us examine our selves whether we be as carefull to speak unto the Lord as we would be unto a Prince: and herein also let us shew that reverence which we ow unto the Lord. The godly in the Scriptures have been very exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and accurate in those prayers and Psalmes which are recorded in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the form it may be demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Whether a set form of prayer may be used.</note> we may use a set form of prayer: for that is denied by our Separatists, insomuch that they hold it unlawfull to pray in that set form which Christ himself hath prescribed. But they are plainly confuted by the words of our Saviour, Luke 11. 2. <hi>When ye pray say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. unlesse they will persist in their contradiction against Christ himself, forbidding us when we pray to say, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides that prayer of Christ there are other set forms in the Scriptures prescribed to be used in the Church of God. The whole book of the Psalmes was penned and committed to Asaph and other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42240:76"/>
as is mentioned in divers of their titles, to the end that they might be sung in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. More especially, the ninety second Psalme was penned to be used on the Sabbath-day; and the hundred and second Psalme is <hi>A prayer of</hi> (or <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>r) the afflicted when he is overwhelmed and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why may not a set form be used? Because the faithful <hi>praying in the holy Ghost,</hi> as Jude speaketh v. 20. must pray as they are moved by the Spirit, and not as they are provided beforehand.</p>
                  <p>The assistance of the Spirit is seen not so much in helping our invention, (The gift of invention or conceiving a prayer, is a gift of the Spirit, but a common gift, and not a proper grace of the sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit: for a man of a present wit and good speech wanting the spirit of sanctification may do much that way, especially if he be studied in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) as in these three; 1. in rectifying our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teaching us to ask that which is good for us, especially in time of affliction. For we being led by sense know not what to ask; <hi>but the Spirit helpeth our insirmities, and teacheth us to pray according to God,</hi> asking those things which tend to his glory and our good. 2. His help is seen in inslaming our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, teaching us to <hi>pray with sighs and grones that cannot be expressed,</hi> v. 26. And to the same purpose the Prophet Zacharie foretelleth, that the faithfull by the spirit of grace and supplication shall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when they look upon him whom th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>in our hearts, Abba, Father,</hi> that is, teacheth us to pray in faith, and to call upon God as our Father in Christ, Rom. 8. 15, 16. Gal. 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, where they say that they must pray as the Spirit moveth them, they seem with the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts to look for extraordinary inspirations, and are in the number of those which tempt God: for this conceit of theirs as well taketh away all meditation and preparation beforehand as set prayers. But we are to follow the counsel of the Wise man, Ecclus 18. 23. <hi>Before thou prayest prepare thy self, and be not as one that tempteth the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The promise made the faithfull, that they should not need to study beforehand what they should speak, but that they should speak as the Spirit should move them, is to be understood of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift of Gods Spirit wherewith they were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in inspiring them in their preachings, apologies and prayers, without their own study and industry. Wherefore as in preaching, to neglect study, and to expect extraordinary inspiration of the Spirit, that we may speak <hi>ex tempore</hi> as the Spirit moveth, when a man is not upon some present exigent and necessity put to it, is to tempt God; so likewise in prayer. And therefore we must not presume (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it be upon some present necessity) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a long prayer, especially prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> without some former study and meditation used ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the instant or in former times; but we must come prepared either with some set form (which notwithstanding with help of meditation we are to vary upon occasions) or with such a form
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42240:77"/>
as we have conceived in our meditation, that so we may with David call our prayer our <hi>meditation.</hi> Neither do I doubt, but that a good desire, vow or promise made in prayer upon former deliberation is more accepted of God, and is like to be more constant, and may likewise be uttered with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fervency of affection and begged with more assurance of faith then that which is rashly uttered upon a sudden. And therefore Salomon saith. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any word before God,</hi> Eccles 5. 1. Neither do I condemn all that seem to pray <hi>ex tempore:</hi> For as his faculty is to be commended that is so well studied in Divinity and exercised in preaching as that he is able to preach as it were <hi>ex tempore;</hi> not that he casteth himself upon extraordinary inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but is inabled by the help of his former stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and exercise: so is his faculty to be commended who is so well studied in Divinity and exercised in applying the severall parts of religion to the use of prayer that he is able as it were <hi>ex tempore</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a prayer; not that in so doing he casteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the extraordinary inspiration of the holy Spirit, but is inabled by the help of his former stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and meditations.</p>

                     </gap> form is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42240:77"/>
to be preferred before such an extemporall prayer. First, because it wanteth due reverence of God,<note place="margin">Reasons: 1.</note> when men dare speak to God <hi>quicquid in buccam venerit,</hi> whatsoever first cometh into the mouth, when as if they were to speak to their prince or any whom they reverenced, they would use prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and directly against the advice of Salomon, Eccles 5. 1. Secondly, because it is joyned with<note place="margin">2,</note> the presumptuous fansie of the Enthusiasts and tempting of God. Thirdly, because in prayers<note place="margin">3,</note> rashly and suddenly made many times things are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered which beseem not the majestie of God nor are expedient for men. Such sudden prayers are of the mind rather then of the heart. Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> Though the thing uttered were good without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, yet that good which is uttered upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation and mature deliberation is more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God then that which proceedeth from a sudden motion.</p>
                  <p>If they speak of a prayer conceived upon due meditation, I distinguish again, in respect of private prayer of one, and that which is common and publick. For private prayers, that course is to be followed for which most do find themselves best qualified, being alwayes carefull to avoyd those inconveniences to which either a set form or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer is more subject. The set form is more subject to wandering thoughts and want of attention of mind; the conceived, to want of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the powers of the soul being wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in invention. But for the most this will be found the most behooffull course, to have a set
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42240:78"/>
form or forms rather for the generall and the many blessings for which we are either to pray or to prayse God ordinarily, whereunto extraordinarily something is to be added as occasion is offered: I say, forms rather, for the avoyding of distraction and wandering thoughts. And because our prayers are defective, it shall be expedient to conclude them with that absolute form which Christ hath taught us.</p>
                  <p>As for prayers publick and common with others; Though a conceived prayer be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the speaker if it be performed without spirituall pride and ostentation, yet a set form or forms is more profitable for the hearers, who with a known form may easily concurre in prayer with the speaker, which in a conceived form unheard of before they cannot so well do. All which I have the rather noted, because I understand that in these times both many hearers do erroneously magnifie extemporall prayers, contemning all set forms, and also the oratours or speakers themselves in great ostentation and spirituall pride affect such variety of extemporall prayers, as if they scorned to use the same form twice; when as our Saviour in the garden is recorded to have prayed thrice and to have used the same form, Matth. 26. 29, 42, 44.</p>

                  <p>HItherto we have spoken of such things as are required in the action of invocation: Now we are to treat of those things which must be done out of the action, that is to say, both before and after.<note place="margin">I.

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>h more are we bound to prepare our selves when we our selves are to be speakers, that we may be fit to speak to so great a Majestie. 2. If we will not speak to our superiours, especially our Prince, without preparation, how much more ought we to come prepared when we are to speak to the King of kings, and that concerning matters of great importance? Thirdly, we may <hi>not be rash with our mouthes, nor let our hearts be hastie to utter any thing before God,</hi> Eccles 5. 1. But as the sonne of Sirach adviseth, <hi>Before we pray we ought to prepare our selves, and not be as those that tempt God,</hi> Ecclus 18. 23. Fourthly, we have the example of David Psal. 108. 1. and 57. 7. <hi>O God, my heart is prepared, so is my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I will fing and give praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this preparation consisteth partly in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<note place="margin">This prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, 1. in removing impediments</note> the impediments, and partly in the using of the means. For first, <hi>We must look to our feet,</hi> Eccles 5. 1. that is, with what affections and dispositions we come to prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently are to lay aside all carnall thoughts and worldly cares which might
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42240:79"/>
distract our minds. <hi>Quicquid ante orationis horam</hi>

                        </gap> praeparare debemus:</hi> Whatsoever before the houre of prayer the mind hath conceived, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that whilest we are praying it offer it self by the ingestion of the remembrance. Wherefore such as we would be found to be whilest we pray, we must prepare our selves to be such before the time of prayer. Secondly, we must put off the shoes off our feet; as Exod. 3. Jos. 5. that is, our pollutions and corrupt affections: as carnall lust, which maketh the heart speak lewd things; and anger, as 1. Tim. 2. 8. 1. Pet. 5. 7. Matth. 5. 23, 24. Thirdly, we must not suffer our heart to be made heavie with surfeting and drunkennesse, Luke 21. 34, 36. but contrariwise, with prayer upon extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to joyn fasting, 1. Cor. 7. 5. and with the ordinarie a moderate diet. Fourthly, if we be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any sin unrepented of we must repent thereof, promising and purposing amendment for the time to come; for sinne not repented of is as <hi>a wall of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between God and us,</hi> Isai. 59. 1, 2. <hi>God heareth not impenitent sinners,</hi> John 9. 31. Isai. 1. 15, 16, 18. &amp; therefore, as Psal. 26. 6. <hi>we must wash our hands in innocencie, and so come to the altar</hi> of the Lord to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the incense of our prayers, <hi>lifting up holy hands unto God,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>The means. First, because the Lord <hi>prepareth the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. In using the means.</note> 
                     <hi>heart,</hi> Psal. 10. 17. we are to desire him to prepare our hearts unto prayer. Secondly, we must use me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42240:79"/>
In which regard David calleth his prayer his <hi>meditation,</hi> Psal. 5. 1. that is to say, that which he had meditated of, Psal. 142. 2. <hi>Effundam coram eo meditationem meam,</hi> I will poure out my meditation before him. There is such affinity between medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prayer, that the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either of both, <hi>to meditate,</hi> or <hi>to pray:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gen. 24. 63. some reade that Isaac <hi>went out to meditate;</hi> others, <hi>to pray:</hi> And it is likely that he did both; first meditate, and then pray.</p>
                  <p>Now the end of this preparation being to make<note place="margin">Meditation required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayer.</note> us fit to perform such duties as are required in prayer, our meditation must be referred thereunto. And first if we find ourselves backward in the duty it self, we may meditate on those reasons which before we used to this purpose. And that we may perform it in an holy manner, we must stirre up our hearts, as David doth in many places, as Psal. 103. 1. that so we may <hi>call upon God with our hearts.</hi> And if our knowledge be so small that we are notable to conceive a prayer of our selves but must be fain to use a form prescribed by others, we must beforehand meditate thereof, that we may be able both to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it and to use it aright. And that we may pray in faith, we are to meditate on the promises of God made to our prayers, and on the mediation and intercession of our Saviour Christ, on which our faith is to be grounded. Likewise we are to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on our own unworthinsse, that so we may pray in humilitie; of the glorious Majestie of God our heavenly Father, that we may call upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; of the excellency, profit, necessitie of those
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42240:80"/>
blessings for which we either pray or give thanks, that so we may pray with fervencie and give thanks with alacrity. And further, if we conceive a prayer before not used, we are to meditate not onely of the matter but also of the manner and order of our speech, that we may be able to say with David, <hi>My</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 108. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>heart is prepared, so is my tongue;</hi> I will now call upon the name of the Lord. And thus much of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>After the action there ought to be such a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">II. Of the duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s to be performed after prayer.</note> as the severall kind of invocation doth especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally require: Whereof in due place. In the mean time this admonition in generall may be given, That when we have at any time called upon God, we take heed that we do not end our prayers as we end epistles, with a <hi>Vale,</hi> bidding the Lord Farewell till the time of prayer come again, as though we had then ended our task and had performed all the service we ow unto God, in the mean time neither thinking of God or godlinesse, but following our own corrupt wayes. For howsoever we cease to speak unto God for a time, yet we cease not to be in his sight and presence; and therefore cannot do as untoward children and unchast wives, who though in absence they have behaved themselves lewdly, yet approve themselves to their parents and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands by their demure carriage in presence: But we are continually in Gods sight and presence; and therefore if after we have called upon God we play the lewd children even in his sight, and go a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after vanities in his presence, how cannot this but greatly amaze us against we shall pray again,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42240:80"/>
and put us out of hope to be heard. Wherefore the frequent exercise of prayer is a notable bridle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us from sinne, whether you respect that which is past or that which is to come. For when a man is about to commit sinne, let him call to mind his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er past; <hi>Am I that man who so lately called upon God, making such shew of pietie, pretending a zeal of Gods glory in advancing his kingdome and doing his will? &amp;c.</hi> or that which is to come; <hi>With what face can I appear before God guilty of such offenses? with what affiance can I lift up these eyes unto God, that behold vanities; these hands unto God, that commit such sinnes? &amp;c.</hi> Let us therefore with David use to meditate, <hi>If I regard wickednesse in my heart the Lord will not heare me,</hi> Psal. 66. 18. following the advice of the Apostle, 2. Tim. 2. 19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> For, <hi>not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 7. 21. <hi>Inessicax est petitio cùm preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>

                  <p>NOw followeth the matter or the subject; that is, the things for which we either do pray or give thanks. Concerning which this is to be noted in generall, That we have a sound perswasion grounded on the word of God that they be lawfull and good: First, because <hi>what is not of faith is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. Secondly, for what we do either pray or give thanks to God, thereof we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be the authour: but it is blasphemous to make God the authour of that which is wicked &amp; unlawfull. Thirdly, prayers must be made in faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that God accepteth our prayers and will grant them unto us. This faith must be grounded on Gods promise; and God promiseth to give good things to them that ask, Matth. 7. 11. Evil things are not within the compasse of Gods promise; for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of that which is evil is rather a threatning then a promise. Fourthly, the assurance that we have to be heard, is when we ask any thing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods will, 1. John 5. 14. but to ask evil things is not according to Gods will. Fifthly, they that call upon God for evil things are like the wicked, Psal. 50. who think that God is like unto them. Sixthly, if we ask good things we have assurance to be heard, Matth. 7. 11. 1. John 5. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For our direction in this behalf our Saviour
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42240:81"/>
Christ hath prescribed a most perfect form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is <hi>summa petendorum,</hi> the summe of things to be desired: So that whatsoever may be referred thereunto we may be assured is according to Gods will; but what cannot be referred to some part of the Lords prayer, that our Saviour hath not taught us to ask nor the Father promised to give.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth the last point: For now it may<note place="margin">How we may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pray according to Gods will.</note> be demanded, How we being so corrupt and sinfull in our selves, should be able to pray according to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Of our selves indeed we are not able to think a good thought, and much lesse to conceive an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prayer?

                  <p>But here we are to take heed that we abuse not this doctrine concerning the help and assistance of the holy Ghost in prayer, by neglecting our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and presuming of the extraordinary inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy Ghost: for that is to tempt God: But in doing the uttermost of our own indeavour, we are to crave the assistance of Gods Spirit, who will not be wanting to those who are not wanting to themselves. Now if it be demanded how these<note place="margin">Quest.</note> things may stand together, that no man can pray without the spirit of God and without faith, and yet both the spirit and faith is to be obteined by prayer; I answer, God by his preventing grace<note place="margin">Answ.</note> worketh in us a true desire of grace and of faith; which desire of grace is the beginning of the grace desired. And therefore the grace of the spirit and faith in order of nature go before prayer, which is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42240:83"/>
the effect of that desire, and yet prayer goeth before the knowledge or feeling of either of both.</p>

Of the persons: In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is publick or private.</note> are the circumstances of Person, Time, and Place. Prayer in regard of persons is either publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Publick invocation is the prayer of a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as of a parish or colledge. Of publick prayer we are to make speciall account: For if the prayer of<note place="margin">Of publick prayer.</note> some one man can avail so much (as heretofore I have shewed) what shall we think of publick, where the prayers of so many ascend together unto the Lord? As the flame of one faggot-stick to the flame of the whole faggot or bundle, so is the prayer of one man to the prayer of the whole congregation: for <hi>Vis unita est fortior,</hi> force united is so much the stronger; <hi>and a threefold cable is hardly broken.</hi> Our Saviour Christ hath bountifully promised <hi>that where two or three be gathered together in his name, there is he in the middest of them,</hi> Matth. 18. 20. Yea, such is the presence of the Lord in publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that those which have been excluded thence have thought themselves banished from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and to be put away from his face. It was the punishment of Cain; and so he esteemed it, Gen. 4. For when the Lord had banished him from that earth <hi>which had received his brothers bloud from his hand,</hi> v. 11. which was the place of the visible Church, v. 14. he saith, that by reason of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42240:83"/>
he should be <hi>hid from Gods face.</hi> We see the same in the practice of David; Who when he was in banishment desired nothing more then to have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to come into the assemblies of the saints: &amp; when he had liberty he rejoyceed in nothing more. For the first, reade Psal. 27. and 42. and 84. In Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I require, even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to visit his temple.</hi> Psal. 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the hart brayeth for the rivers of waters, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, even for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the presence of God?</hi> &amp;c. And v. 4. he saith that his soul languished when he considered, that had it not been for the tyrannie of his oppressours he might have gone with the rest of the assembly into the house of God. Psal. 84. 1. <hi>O Lord of hosts, how amiable are thy tabernacles! My soul longeth, yea and fainteth, that I might come to the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh cry out after the living God.</hi> In the third verse he seemeth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie the sparrows and the swallows which had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lay their young ones there where he had no accesse: And then he cryeth out abruptly with a wonderfull patheticall exclamation, <hi>O thine altars, Jehovah, my King and my God!</hi> In the three next verses he pronounceth them happy not onely that dwell in the Lords house to praise him, but also those who have liberty to come to the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were by redious and troublesome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, both in respect of the way and the weather: thereby signifying, that he would think himself
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42240:84"/>
happy if he might have liberty to come to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, although he went through thick and thin: and that no way or weather should hinder him. And again, v. 10. he saith, that <hi>one day spent in the house of the Lord is better then a thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>lsewhere,</hi> and that <hi>he had rather be a doore-keeper in the house of God then to dwell in the tents of iniquity.</hi> Thus we see Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids affection to the assembly of the Saints, when he might not enjoy them. And as he placed happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sam. 6. 14, 16. When the ark of the Lord was to be brought to the city of David, David for exceeding great joy danced and leaped before the ark with all his might, as if he had not been his own man, insomuch as his wife despised him, &amp; v. 20. derided him, <hi>O how glorious was the king of Israel this day, which was uncovered to day in the sight of the maids of his servants as a fool uncovereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self!</hi> If we were men according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof it is called <hi>the house of prayer,</hi> Isai. 56. 7. Neither must our private prayer exempt us from the publick: For although it be an excellent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and in no case to be omitted, yet if it come in comparison it must give place to the publick.

                  <p>Concerning the voice, which I said was alwayes<note place="margin">Of the voice to be used in publick prayer.</note> to be used in publick prayer, we are to know; If it be uttered in one voice, as in praier, the mouth of the people ought to be the minister: because it is part of prophecie; and the Apostles Acts 6. 4. make it part of their function. If by the voice of many, as in singing (For singing also is warranted in the word of God both by the example of Christ, Mark 14. 26. &amp; by the commandment of the Apostle, Col. 3. 16. Ephes. 5. 19. &amp; of James ch. 5. 13.) then such singing is to be used as we may sing with grace in our hearts and spirits, with understanding to instruct and edifie
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42240:85"/>
both our selves and others. But we may not so sing as that neither we our selves can attend to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor they which heare us understand what is said. That both unanimitie and uniformitie may be used, it is fit that there should be set forms of publick prayer: for then may the people best joyn their consent and desire of heart when they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the very form of the request. Indeed to that which they understand they may at the end of the prayer say, <hi>Amen;</hi> but when they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what shall be asked, there may be a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence between the prayer of their heart and the speech of the minister who is the mouth.</p>
                  <p>Private prayer is either the prayer of a familie,<note place="margin">Of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>

To the former doth the promise of Christ also appertein; <hi>When two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, there am I in the middest of them,</hi> Matth. 18. 20. And it is so much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the other as it seemeth to draw nearer to publick prayer: And therefore it is the duty of an houshoulder to call his familie togethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and to pray with them.</p>
                  <p>The prayer of some one man is properly called private: For <hi>privi</hi> with the ancient Latinists is the same with <hi>singuli.</hi> That which properly is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this prayer is this, that it be private: as that we be not heard to pray of any man. This is done either when we are alone and ordinarily, or in the sight of others upon occasions offered. If when we are alone; we must neither be heard nor seen of any, but obey the commandment of Christ, Matth. 6. 6. <hi>When thou prayest enter into thy chamber; and</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42240:85"/>
                     <hi>when thou hast shut thy doore, pray unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</hi> And therefore we are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to contein our voyce within the compasse of the private place wherein we pray. For otherwise we break the commandment of Christ; and it is all one as if we prayed openly. For, as Tertullian saith, <hi>petitiones suas quid minùs faciunt quàm si in publico orent?</hi> What do they lesse in their petitions then if they prayed in publick?</p>
                  <p>Again, if we so pray privately as that either we be seen or heard of men, our prayers wil not be void of ostentation. But as we are to avoid evil, so we are to shun all appearance of evil. Now to pray for ostentations sake is a thing simply evil and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by our Saviour Christ, Matth. 6. 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to forbear not onely from it but also from the shew therof.</p>
                  <p>Is privately thou art to pray upon occasions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the presence of others, then thou art to pray in the closet of thy heart without using the voice, according to the example of Moses, Exod. 14. of Abrahams servant, Gen. 24. and Hannah, 1. Sam. 1. Nehemiah, chap. 2. 4. But this is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of him who praying in the company of others is as it were the mouth of the rest: For we are to conceive of that as of the prayer of the family, wherein the voice is necessary.</p>

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>continually,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in all things to give thanks:</hi> and not in that place alone, but also in divers others; as Luke 18. 1. that we must pray <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>alwayes;</hi> and 21. 36. as also Ephes. 6. 18. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>in all seasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then, will you say, must we do nothing els<note place="margin">Object.</note> in the whole course of our life but pray?</p>
                  <p>I say not so. This was the phantasticall opinion<note place="margin">Answ.</note> of the fanaticall hereticks the <hi>Euchetae,</hi> which thought they might do nothing else but pray, and grounded their hersies upon these places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But for the answering of them and informing<note place="margin">The <hi>Euchetae</hi> confuted.</note> our selves in the truth, first we are to search out the true meaning of those places of Scripture: First, therefore where it is said 1. Thess. 5. 17. that<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 17. expounded.</note> we must <hi>pray continually,</hi> it may be fitly expounded by that in the 18. verse, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in all things;</hi> for the sense would be the same if we should say, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in all things pray,</hi> and <hi>continually give thanks,</hi> that is, upon every just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion pray and give thanks. Now that these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of perpetuall continuance in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, excluding all other actions and duties, it is plain by this; Paul in divers places of his epistles doth professe of himself that he did <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>give thanks alwayes, continually, without ceasing;</hi> Rom. 1. 9.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42240:86"/>
Col. 1. 3. 1. Cor. 1. 4. Ephes. 1. 16. Col. 1. 9. 1. Thess. 1. 2. 2. Thess. 1. 3. and yet notwithstanding he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denied to obey the necessities of nature, neither omitted the duties either of his calling or of a godly life: Nay, he laboured in his calling more then all the rest of the Apostles. The like may be said of Cornelius, of whom the Scripture doth testifie Acts 10. that <hi>he prayed alwayes,</hi> which is all one with <hi>in all things;</hi> and yet by his calling a Centurion, and therefore sometimes in fight: and for the duties of a godly life, it is said that he was <hi>a just man,</hi> v. 22. and therefore exercised the duties of the second table, and gave alms.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as touching the place in Luke 18. 1.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. expounded.</note> where it is said that Christ spake a parable to this end <hi>that we ought alwayes to pray,</hi> the holy Ghost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth his meaning in the next words by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the contrary, that we should <hi>pray alwayes and not saint:</hi> So that <hi>to pray alwayes</hi> in this place, is <hi>not to saint in prayer:</hi> Which in other places is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to persevere in prayer:</hi> as Rom. 12. 12. that is, <hi>with some pertinacie</hi> (if I may use this word in the good sense) <hi>to persevere in prayer.</hi> And that this is the meaning of the words it appeareth by the scope of the parable it self, which is nothing else but this, That when we have prayed unto God and he seemeth not to heare us, we must not faint and give over, but stedfastly persevere untill we have an answer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the other places: Luke 21. 36. and<note place="margin">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42240:87"/>
just occasion, whensoever opportunity is offered. To confirm this exposition this reason may be used; The Lord in his word inioyneth us a great sort of duties besides Invocation; which if we do omit, for the omission of them, although we should do no hurt, we shall be condemned: Matth. 25. 42. the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation is pronounced against the wicked for the omission of certain duties, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily must be omitted if we should do nothing else but pray. Again, it is a received distinction, That the negative commandments of God do bind both <hi>semper</hi> &amp; <hi>ad semper</hi> to the absteining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those things which are forbidden; but the affirmative command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, howsoever they do bind us <hi>semper,</hi> yet for the most part they do not bind us <hi>ad semper.</hi> And therefore although we be alwayes bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty, and never exempted from it, yet we are not bound to do it alwayes. So that these commandments of <hi>continuing in prayer</hi> are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the whole life and not of every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time.</p>
                  <p>Now that we are alwayes bound to this duty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth<note place="margin">That we are alwayes bound to the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> both by our continuall necessitie to pray, in regard first of our necessities and wants both spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall; secondly, of the continuall rage of our spirituall enemies, who are never at truce with us except we be at league with them; thirdly, of innumerable dangers which are alwayes immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, from which by Gods continuall mercy and goodnesse towards us we are delivered, for which we must return thanks unto him. For if there were no other cause of thanksgiving (as there are many)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42240:87"/>
but onely this, that he hath spared us, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded us for our sinnes, this were matter suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: Lam. 3. 22. <hi>It is the mercy of the Lord that we are not confounded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that we may perform these command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of continuance in prayer, it is requisite that we call upon God both ordinarily at set times, and extraordinarily as occasion and opportunity is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore in respect of time prayer is thus<note place="margin">Of stinted prayers at set times, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinted upon occasions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</note> distinguished; <hi>Preces sunt statae vel vagae:</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction belongeth both to publick and private prayer.</p>
                  <p>For publick prayer; What set houres in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time are to be appointed for Divine service, it is to be left to the discretion of every Church. Onely in the night-time it seemeth inconvenient in the flourishing and quiet estate of the Church, that publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies should be held: but in time of persecution it is otherwise. For <hi>vagae:</hi> They are so often to be used publickly as occasion is offered either by any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick danger and calamity to pray, or by some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick blessing of God to give thanks.</p>
                  <p>But concerning private prayer, there is no time<note place="margin">No time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> of day naturall which may not be imployed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. It hath been the practice of the godly to call upon God both night and day. So did David, Psal. 22. 2. Annah, Luke 2. 37. and not onely she, but all right widows, of whom Paul fpeaketh 1. Tim. 5. 5. So did Paul himself, 2. Tim. 1. 3. 1. Thess. 3. 10. But more specially for the day; David saith that he would call upon God <hi>seven times a day,</hi> that is, many times, Psal. 119. 164. In another place he saith that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42240:88"/>
he would <hi>pray in the morning, in the evening, and at noon.</hi> And again, for the morning; Psal. 5. 3. and in another place, that he would <hi>prevent the morning watch.</hi> For the noon, Acts 10. 9. For the night our Saviour gave us a precedent Luke 6. 12. where it is said that he <hi>spent the whole night in prayer unto God.</hi> And to omit other speciall times; There is none so unseasonable as midnight; yet often in this time have the godly given themselves unto prayer: Psal. 119. 62. <hi>At midnight will I rise to give thanks unto thee.</hi> And so did Paul and Silas, Acts 16. 25. So that we see no time excluded from private prayer.</p>
                  <p>But to apply the former distinction to private prayer also: and first for <hi>statae:</hi> That our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be helped, and our backwardnesse in this duty relieved, we are to appoint to our selves some certain houres in the day which we will not let passe without invocation on the name of God: but yet so as we place no religion in one time more then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as the Papists do in their canonicall houres, as though God were more ready to heare one time of the day then another. This practice which I have named the most holy men of God have used: As David, Psal. 55. 17. <hi>In the morning, at noon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>nd in the evening will I pray:</hi> And Daniel, chap. 6. 10. used to pray three times in the day. Which practice of theirs we are thus to imitate: 1. to pray in the morning, before we go about the works of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; 2. in the mid-day, in the time of intermission of our works; and thirdly, at evening, before we take our rest: and besides, whensoever we take mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> we are to use both prayer and thanksgiving, 1. Tim. 4. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:42240:88"/>2. Concerning <hi>vagae:</hi> We are to follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apostle Col. 3. 17. <hi>In every thing which we do, in word or deed,</hi> both to take it in hand by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>upon the name of the Lord,</hi> and to end it with <hi>thanksgiving.</hi> Not that we are alwayes to use the voice and gesture of the body; for sometime it is sufficient to lift up the soul unto the Lord: Which kind of short prayers among the ancient Fathers were called <hi>ejaculations.</hi> And thus if we shall use <hi>statae &amp; vagae orationes,</hi> stinted and unstinted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, omitting no just occasions, we shall perform the commandment 1. Thess. 5. 17. but otherwise we shall break the same, and in so doing we shall incurre the wrath of God.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THirdly, concerning the place: To no one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place is that promise made that then was<note place="margin">That there is no limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place for prayer.</note> made to the temple of Jerusalem; <hi>viz.</hi> That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever men in their extremitie should ask of God in it, God would grant it in his holy habitation in the heavens. Jesus the Messias then looked for, whose presence was sought in the mercy-seat and between the Cherubims, is now entred between the veil, that is, in the heaven, and there abideth onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour for us: unto whom from all the coasts of the earth we may lift up pure hands with assurance that we shall be heard. Howsoever the Israelites under the Law were tyed to pray either in the temple and tabernacle, Deut. 12. 5, 14. Psal. 99. 6. or else
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42240:89"/>
towards the same, 2 Chron. 7. 38. 1. Kings 8. 44, 48. Psal. 138. 2. Dan. 6. 10. yet now all such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and difference of place, being but ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, is abolished. For that one place of prayer and sacrifice was a type of Christ Jesus the alone altar; and the praying in or towards the same did figure out thus much, That onely in the mediation of Jesus Christ, who is the onely Mediatour both of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and also of intercession, we are to call upon the Lord: Wherefore seeing these were but shadows and ceremonies of things to come, and seeing the substance and truth it self, Jesus Christ, is already exhibited, whereunto the shadows and ceremonies do and ought to give place; we are not now tied to one place more then another, as one being more typically holy then another. In the 4. of John v. 21, 22, 23, 24. our Saviour himself resolveth this doubt: for when the Samaritane had demanded of him, which is that place wherein God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, the mount Gerizzim where the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes temple was, or the mount Moriah whereon the temple of Solomon was built; Christ giveth her this answer, That now the time was come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all these differences of places, being but ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, were taken away; &amp; that now the Lord was no more to be worshipped by ceremonies but <hi>in spirit and truth:</hi> and therefore that it was lawfull to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God not onely in Jerusalem o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> in mount Geriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim but also in other places.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet Malachi seemeth to foretell the same, chap. 1. 11. For so the Lord speaketh by him, <hi>From the rising of the sunne to the going down of the</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42240:89"/>
                     <hi>same my name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered in my name,</hi> &amp;c. But most plain is that 1. Tim. 2. 8. where the Apostle willeth that <hi>men should pray</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> So that there is no such difference of place, but that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call upon God in any place: Which also is confirmed unto us by the practice of Christ and his Apostles: who did not onely pray in the temple, but without distinction in other places, as in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in the desert, in the garden, in private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, on the house-top, on the sea-shore; and where not?</p>
                  <p>Hence appeareth the vanity of Pilgrimages: Which<note place="margin">The vanity of Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> were used either because the places were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to which they went then others, or because the Lord was nearer to them there then elsewhere. The former reason I have already confuted: and the latter is more absurd. For is the Lord present at Jerusalem, and is he absent in England? nay, <hi>Do not I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ill heaven and earth? saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 24. And doth not the Psalmist say, Psal 138. 8. <hi>If I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I lie down in hell, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, yea, thither shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand hold me.?</hi> Seeing therefore that the Lord is every where present to heare us, we may call upon him in any place: and the rather because our bodies are the temples of God, and we our selves priests, and Christ Jesus dwelleth in our temples, upon whom, as being our onely altar, we may offer up incense, that is, our prayers, Revel.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42240:90"/>
5. 8. Psal. 141. 2. So that wheresoever we are, we have temples wherein to call upon the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now howsoever this which I have said be in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall true of Invocation both publick and private, yet it is to be understood of publick with this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For publick prayer is to be considered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the state of the Church: If the Church be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in persecution or warfare, wheresoever the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly meeteth to that purpose there may they lawfully pray: As namely in persecution, in private houses or in secret places: for the assembly &amp; not the place maketh prayer publick. But if the Church be in flourishing and quiet estate, there ought some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick places, as Churches, to be appointed for that purpose, wherein the congregation ordinarily is to be assembled; not for any greater holinesse in the Churches then in other places (for the assembly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the place, and not the place the assembly) but onely for good orders sake and politie of the Church.</p>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> or thanksgiving. In the former we ask good things at the hand of God: In the latter we return praise and thanksgiving for benefits received. The former hath reference to the time to come; the latter, to the time past. For in the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42240:90"/>
former we crave either the gift of such things as we want for the time to come, or the continuance and increase of that which we have. In the latter we praise Gods goodnesse for his blessings either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed already, or at the least promised. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we beg and pray; in the latter we give, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther render and repay, the praise which is due to his name.</p>
                  <p>But howsoever in nature these two sorts of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation<note place="margin">Prayer and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving must be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> do differ, and so are in doctrine to be severed, yet in use and practice they must go together. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we be more ready to crave new blessings at the hands of God then to return thanks for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits already received. And therefore the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of both these duties the holy Ghost in many places hath joyned together: as 1. Thess. 5. 17, 18. Psal. 50. 14, 15. 1. Tim. 2. 1. Col. 3. 17.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42240:91"/>
our selves, when we are affected with a thankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods goodnesse towards us for the time past, are the more encouraged with faith and affiance to crave new blessings for the time to come; Psal. 4. 1. 1. Kings 3. 6, 7, 8. Psal. 116. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>But first we are to speak of prayer. Prayer is<note place="margin">What Prayer or Petition i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</note> that invocation whereby we effectually crave any thing which we do well (that is, lawfully and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably) desire at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Where I say it is <hi>invocation,</hi> I mean that it is a religious speech of the faithfull made unto God in the name of Christ, according to the will of God, by the help of the holy Ghost, concerning good things apperteining to Gods glory and our good; and consequently, that whatsoever before hath been spoken in generall concerning Invocation is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be applyed to Prayer. The proper nature and difference is expressed in the word <hi>crave:</hi> For prayer is that invocation whereby we beg and crave of God. But because we speak of that prayer which is right and acceptable, and is framed according to the will of God, as was said in the generall out of 1. John 5. 14. and it is the will of God that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should be effectuall and our desire good; therefore I added, <hi>whereby we effectually crave any thing which we do well (that is, lawfully and profitably) desire of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That our prayer which shall avail with God must in it self be effectuall, S. James teacheth us, chap. 5. 16. <hi>The prayer of a righteous man availeth much, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectuall.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of which I have spoken before. As therefore that is an effectuall
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42240:91"/>
oration wherein nothing is omitted which the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory art requireth, whether the hearers be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or not; so that is an effectuall prayer wherein nothing is omitted which in the word of God, that teacheth the art and doctrine of prayer, is required either in generall or in particular. For although the efficacy of prayer doth not properly consist in the observation of the generall points, yet they are such as without them it cannot be effectuall: As 1. That<note place="margin">The generals of Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applyed to Petition.</note> the party which prayeth be faithfull, that is, a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and believing sinner; 2. That the prayer be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto God; 3. In the name and mediation of Christ; 4. By the help of the holy Ghost; 5. That it be a prayer of the heart, or that the prayer be made in truth; (for to that the promise is restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Psal. 145. 18. and therein the life of the prayer consisteth, without which it is dead and counterfeit) that it be made with knowledge, and with faith, with humility, with reverence, and with heartinesse; 6. For good things. All which are essentiall points required in all invocation.</p>
                  <p>But the things wherein more properly the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<note place="margin">Fervency &amp; faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our petitions.</note> of prayer consisteth are Fervency and Faith: and <hi>to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:42240:92"/>Now fervency presupposeth a sense and feeling<note place="margin">Sense and feeling of our wants required in prayer.</note> or acknowledgement of our want: And both of them in the Scriptures are signified in the phrases of <hi>hungring and thirsting,</hi> Isai. 55. 1. Matth. 5. 6. John 7. 37. For as in hunger and thirst there concurre two things; a sense of our want, and an appetite to have that want supplyed: so in prayer we must hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst after those graces and blessings which we do crave, that is, we must have a true sense and acknowledgement of our want, and an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have it supplyed. In which respect David compareth his soul to <hi>thirstie lands</hi> which gape for the rain, Psal. 63. 2. and 143. 6. and to <hi>the hart braying for the rivers of waters,</hi> Psal. 42. 1. Both these are necessary to effectuall prayer: For what we ask we desire, and what we desire we want: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we fervently ask that we do not earnestly desire, and we cannot earnestly desire that whereof we feel no want. <hi>The whole needeth not the Physician,</hi> as our Saviour saith Luke 5. 31. And as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers teach, <hi>Nihil appetit quod habet,</hi> Nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth what it hath: therefore this I said is presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. <hi>If any want wisdome,</hi> saith S. James, <hi>let him</hi>

                     <hi>ask it.</hi> For if he find not himself to want it in whole or in part, he is not to ask it, unlesse he will mock God, who will not be mocked, Gal. 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore they offend, I. In respect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, who trusting in their own means, and relying upon their own store, do not find themselves to stand in need of Gods help, neither do depend upon the providence or blessing of God in the use of the means. For such when they pray unto God for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42240:92"/>
these things, as namely, <hi>to give them this day their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread,</hi> they do not pray in truth, because they do not unfeignedly desire that whereof they find no want.</p>
                  <p>II. In respect of spirituall things two sorts of men offend: First, those that are carnally secure, who although they be wretched and miserable, poore, blind, and naked, yet being lukewarm with the Laodiceans, Rev. 3. 17. &amp; feeling no want, think they are rich and need nothing. Secondly, those who are righteous in their own conceit; as Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall and Popish justitiaries. For both these and the other feeling no want, either pray not at all, or if they do pray, it is but for fashions sake: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praying <hi>usu magis quàm sensu,</hi> out of custome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then sense, their prayer is not acceptable unto God, and like lukewarm water to the stomach. Wherefore it behoveth us to labour that we may have a true sense of our wants: Which I speak espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in respect of spirituall graces: for when we are pinched with bodily wants, we are many times but too sensible thereof: But of spirituall wants many have no sense; and being miserable they feel no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. First, therefore it is good to be perswaded that this sense of our wants is necessary for us: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it neither will we seriously seek unto the Lord, neither will he seem to regard us. We will not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly seek unto him: for what we do not want we do not desire; and what we do not desire that we do not ask, except it be for fashion: And how can we look that the Lord will <hi>compati,</hi> that is, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on us, when we do not <hi>pati,</hi> or feel any want?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42240:93"/>
How can we desire him <hi>misereri,</hi> to have mercy on us, when we do not esteem our selves <hi>miseri,</hi> to whom mercy belongeth? (for thence hath <hi>misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> the name.) Yea, if we be rich and full in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> own conceits, the Lord will send us away empty, Luke 1. 55. remaining in our sinne, Luke 18. 14. exposed to his curse, Luke 6. 24, 25. Whereas on the other side, if we be humbled with the sense of our want, the Lord will have speciall regard unto us, Isai. 66. 2. and 57. 15. and be near unto us in all our desires, Psal. 34. 18. Yea, such he calleth to him, Matth. 11. 28. such he promiseth to heare, Psal. 10. 17. John 7. 37. such he pronounceth blessed, Matth. 5. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we may attein to this sight and<note place="margin">How we may come to a sight &amp; sense of our wants.</note> sense of our misery and wants, we are to look into the glasse of the law; which will reveal unto us our misery, both in respect of our sins, and also of the punishment due for the same, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for as much as the sight and sense of our misery is the gift of God and work of his spirit, we are to pray unto God that he will anoint the eyes of our minds with the eye-salve of his spirit, Revel. 3. 18. that we may see our sins; and that he would touch our hearts with the finger of his spirit, as he struck the rock in the wildernes, that they may melt within us, as the heart of Josias did at the reading of the law, 2. Kings 22. 19. and be resolved into a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of tears, by which we may bewail our sinnes whereby we have displeased and dishonoured God.</p>
                  <p>From this sense of our wants ariseth the second<note place="margin">That we must in prayer have an earnest desire to have our wants sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed.</note> thing, that is, an earnest desire to have our wants

                  <p>This praying with earnest desire is commended to us in the word of God by divers significant phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: For besides that it is called <hi>crying unto the Lord,</hi> and <hi>crying mightily,</hi> Jon. 3. 8. <hi>lifting up of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Isai. 38. 14. this is also to <hi>poure forth our souls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord like water, Lam. 2. 19.

                  <p>Fourthly, we are upon extraordinary occasions to joyn fasting with our prayers, as we are directed in many places of the Scripture. For fasting as it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the hunger of the body, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>BUt the chief thing which maketh prayer effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is Faith: whereof Fervency it self is a fruit: And therefore our Saviour attributeth the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and importunity of the woman of Syropheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia's prayer to the greatnesse of her faith, Matth. 15. 28. For that prayer which S. James, chap. 5. 16. calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the prayer of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in prayer there is a double faith required:<note place="margin">A double faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in prayer</note> The one more generall, apprehending the promises of the Gospel concerning salvation by Christ, by which we are in some measure perswaded that we and our prayers are accepted of God in Christ: Of which I have spoken before in the general doctrine, Rom. 10. 14. Heb. 11. 6. Ephes. 3. 12. The other more speciall, giving speciall assent to the promise made to our prayer, whereby we are perswaded that our particular requests shall be granted unto us according to Gods gracious promise in this behalf; Matth. 7. 7, 8. John 14. 13, 14. and 16. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>To pray effectually therefore is to pray faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For <hi>what things soever,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>ye</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> be it unto thee.</hi> On the other side he prayeth not effectually who doubteth whether he shall be heard or not: Wherefore, as S. James saith, chap. 1. 5. <hi>If any man want wisdome let him ask</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42240:95"/>
                     <hi>it of God, and it shall be given him: But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed to and fro. Neither let that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</hi> So S. Paul, 1. Tim. 2. 8. would have men pray <hi>without doubting.</hi> Examples; Psal. 4. 3. and 55. 16, 17. And the Apostle S. John saith, <hi>This is our confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us: and if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him,</hi> 1. John 5. 14, 15. Wherefore <hi>seeing in Christ we have boldnesse and accesse with confidence by the faith of him,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. we ought as we are exhorted Hebr. 4. 16. <hi>to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtein mercy and find grace to help in time of need; and draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 22.</p>
                  <p>But here a distinction is to be used. In matters<note place="margin">That we must pray for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things absolutely;</note> spirituall necessary to salvation, as we are to ask them absolutely, as being perswaded that God hath subordinated our salvation to his own glory; so are we absolutely to believe that the Lord will grant them unto us. Yea, this may be added for our comfort, that if God hath given us grace unfeignedly and earnestly to desire any saving grace, the same grace is begun in us. In matters temporall or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall<note place="margin">for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> which are not necessary to salvation, as 2. Cor. 12. as we are to ask them conditionally, so far forth as they may stand with Gods glory and the good of our selves and our brethren, so are we to believe that he will so far forth grant them, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42240:95"/>
therefore that he will either grant our desire or that which is better. For which cause in such requests we are most willingly with our Saviour Christ to submit our will and desires to the will and pleasure of God, Matth. 26. 39, 42. who as he knoweth what is good for us better then our selves, so he is most ready <hi>to give good things unto us,</hi> Matth. 7. 11. and therefore we are alwayes to believe that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests being rightly conceived shall be granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
                  <p>I would believe that I should be heard, were it<note place="margin">Object.</note> not for mine unworthinesse and my wants in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>Indeed thou mayest be such an one, and such<note place="margin">Answ.</note> may be thy prayers, as thou canst have no hope to be heard: that is, if thou be an impenitent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing sinner God will not heare thee; or if thou pray in hypocrisie and dissimulation the Lord will not heare thy prayer. But if thou art a penitent and believing sinner, yea, if thou dost unfeignedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to believe and repent, and dost pray unto the Lord in truth with unfeigned lips, thou oughtest to pray with assurance to be heard: and this thy faith and assurance must not be grounded on thine own worthinesse or dignitie of thy prayer, but on the undoubted promises of God, and on the merits and mediation of Christ, in whom both we &amp; our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are accepted of God. As for the sense of thine unworthinesse, if it be in truth and joyned with unfeigned desire of grace, it ought to make thee the rather to pray in faith: for such, as I have shewed, our Saviour calleth with promise to heare and help
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42240:96"/>
them: And such he pronounceth blessed, Matth. 11. 28. John 7. 37. Matth. 5. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Now for the helping of our faith, we are in our<note place="margin">Meditations to strengthen our faith in prayer.</note> preparation to meditate of these things especially: First, of the power of God, <hi>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we do ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of his fatherly good will, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us nothing that is good, Matth. 7. 11. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of both which our Saviour hath prefixed before the Lords prayer, when he teacheth us to call upon God as <hi>our Father,</hi> therein noting his love &amp; good will; <hi>which is in heaven,</hi> therein noting his power, Psal. 111. 3. that being perswaded that God is both able and willing to grant our requests, we might pray in faith and assurance that our prayer shall be heard.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of his gracious promises made unto prayer: as Matth. 7. 7, 8. John 16. 23, 24. which if we cannot find in our hearts to believe, we are not to pray; for in not believing we make God a liar.</p>
                  <p>Lastly and especially, of the merits and mediation of our Saviour Christ who sitteth at the right hand<note place="margin">

Israel; and is effectually reproved by Judeth, chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 11, 16. in the governours of Bethulia, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Lord the term of five dayes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, otherwise they would give up their city. Not that it is simply unlawfull to mention circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, so it be done with submission to the will of God either expressed or understood; Gen. 24. 12, &amp;c. Psal. 102. 2.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I said, we do by prayer effectually crave that which we do well, that is, lawfully and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, desire at the hands of God. Lawfully, when we desire that which is good, and to a good end: For if it be not good which we desire, then is our desire unlawfull, and we sinne in going about to make God the authour of sinne. God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give <hi>good things to them that ask,</hi> Matth. 7. 11. But if they be not good, they are not within the compasse of Gods promise, nor ought to come within the compasse of our desire.

                  <p>ANd these are the duties to be performed in the action of prayer. Out of the action, before is required preparation: wherein we are to meditate of such things as may help and further us for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of such duties as are required in the action, which I have already noted in the particulars.</p>

And this is the meaning of the word <hi>Amen,</hi> where with our Saviour hath taught us (as it were) to seal up our prayers: for thereby as we signifie the consent of our desire, so also the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of faith. This was Davids disposition, Psal. 3. 4, 5. <hi>I did call unto the Lord with my voice;</hi> there is his prayer: <hi>and he heard me out of his mountain;</hi> there is his assurance that he was heard: <hi>I laid me down and slept;</hi> there is his quiet and secure resting in the good will and protection of God who did sustein him. So

Psal. 4. 6, 7, 8. Psal. 5. 3. <hi>In the morning I will direct my prayer unto thee, &amp; speculabor, and I will look and wait,</hi> untill thou shalt grant my desire.

For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our prayer is a tempting of God, as if we would have our desire granted as it were by miracle, and a fruit of no faith or unfeigned desire of the thing asked. For if we did truly believe and unfeignedly desire the thing which we ask, we would leave no good means unattempted for the obteining thereof. As for example, when I pray for faith or any other spirituall grace, I must besides my prayer use all the good means carefully which the Lord hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the begetting and increasing of those graces in us, as the hearing of the word preached, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, reading and meditating in the word, &amp;c.

                     </gap>, which we are to crave, to amend that fault. If the fault be in our selves, as that we lie in some sinne not repented of, we must by repentance wash our selves, and then renew our prayers unto God, Isai. 1. 16, 18. It may be we neither so greatly desire the thing which we ask while we want it, neither would so highly esteem it when we have it, as it deserveth, and therefore the Lord deferreth the granting of our suit, that our desire being deferred might be more fervent, and the thing so hardly obteined might both the more highly be esteemed and the more carefully kept. So Augustine, <hi>Deus differt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra postulata, ut discamus grandia grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We must persevere in prayer.</note> to remove the impediments, we are to persist and persevere in prayer without fainting. To which purpose our Saviour propounded the parable of the widow and the judge, Luke 18. 1. giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that those things which we do not obtein at the first, by reason of our perseverance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie shall be granted. To which purpose also serveth the parable of the two friends, Luke 11. 8. To this perseverance we are often stirred up both by precept, Rom. 12. 12. and practice; as of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42240:98"/>
1. Sam. 1. 12. of David, Psal. 109. 4. who gave himself to prayer; of Daniel, when he was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under pain of death to call upon God, Dan. 6. of Bartimeus the blind man, who calling upon Christ and being therefore rebuked of the people did so much the more cry after him, Mark 10. 46, 48. of the woman of Syrophenicia, who having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers repulses yet by her importunity obteined her desire, Matth. 15. 22. of the Primitive Church, Acts 2. 42. and 12. 5. of Cornelius, Acts 10. of Paul, who prayed without ceasing.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, as we are to persist with a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie<note place="margin">5. We must with patience expect Gods leisure.</note> in our prayers, so are we with patience to expect the Lords leisure, Psal. 40. 1. and 130, 5, 7. and not to be hasty, according to that, Isai. 28. 16. <hi>Qui crediderit nè festinet,</hi> Let not him that believeth make hast: but, as it is Psal. 123. 2. <hi>waiting upon the Lord untill he have mercie upon us,</hi> knowing, as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy speaketh Lam. 3. 26. <hi>that it is good both to trust and to wait for the salvation of the Lord;</hi> being assured that the Lord, who <hi>is a present help in the time of need,</hi> will in his good time grant our requests. And therefore we are exhorted Heb. 4. 16, <hi>to come with boldnesse to the throne of grace, that we may obtein mercy and find grace</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, if having persisted in prayer and long expected the Lords leisure we yet have not obteined our suit, insomuch that the Lord may seem rather
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42240:99"/>
wholly to deny it then for a time to delay it, we are to rest in the good will and pleasure of God, being perswaded that he hath heard our prayers in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manner then we desired, hearing us though not <hi>ad voluntatem</hi> yet <hi>ad utilitatem,</hi> that is, for our profit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this is true not onely in temporall benefits, which it is good sometime to want, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in spirituall which are not necessary to salvation. As for example; A man being troubled with some infirmitie, which is as a prick in his flesh moving him to sinne, prayeth unto God to be delivered from it: but howsoeuer his prayer in desiring to be freed from evil is acceptable unto God, yet it may be he will not grant it, the deniall being more for his glory and our profit: for his glory, because his power is manifested in our weaknesse; to make us work out our salvation with fear and trembling, to make us more circumspect of our wayes, knowing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42240:99"/>
that we carry such an enemy about us, as if we stand not upon our guard will be ready to foil us. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hereof in Paul, 2. Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9. And this ought to be our disposition when our requests do seem not to be granted.</p>
                  <p>But if contrariwise the Lord hath heard our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">How we must carry our selves when our requests are granted.</note> and granted our requests, then are we, First, to be thankfull unto God for his goodnesse, Psal. 28. 6. and 66. 20. and 118. 21. Dan. 2. 23. Gen. 24. 26. John 11. 41. Secondly, our love of God must be increased and our faith confirmed with greater confidence to make our prayers unto him for the time to come, Psal. 116. 1, 2. <hi>I love the Lord because he hath heard the voyce of my supplications: because he hath inclined his care unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi>

                  <p>The others for whom we are to pray, are either deceased or living. The deceased are either the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42240:100"/>
elect, which are happie in heaven; or the reprobate, damned in hell. For the elect in generall we do pray in the second petition of the Lords prayer, that the whole number of the elect being accomplished the Lord would hasten the second coming of Christ, for our and their full redemption, that both they and we may both in body and soul enjoy the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of our blessed Saviour, and by him the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the whole Trinity to our complete and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happinesse. As touching the reprobate in hell; we are not to pray for them, but rather against them: which we do in generall and by consequence in the same petition.</p>
                  <p>In particular we are not to pray for any deceased:<note place="margin">That we ought not to pray for the dead.</note> For either they be in heaven, and then our prayer is needlesse; or in hell, and then it is bootlesse. For as touching the purgatorie-fire, it was but a smoke, and therefore vanished; or at the most a devised fire, serving for the Popes kitchin, and the inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Popish clergie. Furthermore, as he that prayeth in particular for the saints in heaven wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, as supposing that they need his prayer; so he that prayeth for any of the reprobate in hell wrongeth himself; for such a prayer being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant, and therefore not of faith, yea expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Scriptures, which teach that out of hell there is no redemption, is turned into sin. For what warrant have we to love where we know that God doth hate, or to make intercession for them to whom the intercession of Christ doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long?</p>
                  <p>But we know not whether they be in heaven or<note place="margin">Object.</note> in hell.</p>

If we know not their estate, we are in charity to hope the best of those which die in the church; for whom being in heaven we can by prayer procure no particular blessing.</p>
                  <p>Concerning those that are alive; We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">That we ought to pray for those that are alive.</note> in the word of God to pray <hi>one for another,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. for <hi>all the Saints,</hi> Ephes. 6. 18. for the whole <hi>brotherhood</hi> of Christians, as our Saviour hath taught us, <hi>Our Father, Give us,</hi> &amp;c. The which as it doth teach us our duty, so to them that do it it ministreth comfort. <hi>Frater, si pro te solo or as, solus or as pro te: si pro omnibus, omnes or ant pro te:</hi> Brother, if thou prayest for thy self alone, then thou alone prayest for thy self: if thou prayest for all, then all pray for thee. And not onely for the faithfull are we to pray, but for all men in generall, that is, for men of all sorts and conditions, those onely excepted who have sinned against the holy Ghost: <hi>for whom there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinne, but a fearfull expectation of judgement, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fire which shall consume the</hi> professed <hi>enemies</hi> of God, Hebr. 10. 27. <hi>For these we are not to pray,</hi> 1. John 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>Of the rest there is a distinction to be made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both of their outward and inward estate. In regard of outward estate some are publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, some are private. We are to pray for all, but especially for the publick, and <hi>those which be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> 1. Tim. 2 1, 2. And as private persons are to pray for the publick, so contrariwise the publick for the private, 1. Sam. 12. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42240:101"/>In regard of the inward estate, some are faithfull, some are faithlesse. We are to pray for all, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>for those which be of the houshold of faith,</hi> Psal. 122. 6. Ephes. 6. 18. Gal. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>The faithlesse are the enemies of God, and some<note place="margin">Object.</note> of them the enemies of our Church and countrey, and some enemies to our selves; and shall we pray for such?</p>
                  <p>Although now they be the enemies of God, yet<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That we ought to pray for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</note> hereafter they may become friends and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him: whereof our prayer may be a means: And therefore howsoever we are to pray against their wicked practices, we are to pray for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they of enemies may become friends; of infidels, faithfull; of hereticks and schismaticks, sound Christians; of wicked and profane, religious and holy: for this <hi>is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who willeth that all men should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and come unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Examples of them who have prayed for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are very many in the word of God: As of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, for the Sodomites, Gen. 18. Moses, for the rebellious Israelites, Exod. 32. yea, for Pharaoh and the Egyptians; Samuel, for Saul; the man of God, for Jeroboam, 1. Kings 13. But why seek I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples? We have a commandment to pray for such as have sinned not unto death, and a promise to procure mercy for them, 1. John 5. 16. and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of God when this is not performed, Ezek. 22. 30.</p>
                  <p>Prayers made for the wicked are many times<note place="margin">Object.</note> without fruit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42240:101"/>If they be without fruit, though they be to them<note place="margin">Answ.</note> idle, yet not to thee: <hi>Thy prayer shall return into thine own bosome,</hi> Psal. 35. 13. according to that Mat. 10. 13. <hi>When ye come into an house, salute it,</hi> or <hi>wish peace unto it: if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for those that be our enemies; Though the Schoolmen teach that we are not or at least need not specially to pray for them, yet our Saviour Christ hath commanded us <hi>to love our enemies, to blesse them that curse us, and to pray for them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully use us and persecute us.</hi> So Jer. 29. 7. Rom. 12. 14. And this was practiced by our Saviour, Luke 13. 34. by Stephen, Acts 7. 60.</p>
                  <p>To this kind of praying for others we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre<note place="margin">Of Blessing, a speciall kind of prayer.</note> Blessing: which is a speciall kind of prayer of the superiour for the inferiour, Heb. 7. 7. As of the Prince, 1. Kings 8. 55. of the Priest, Num. 6. 23, 24. of the parents, Gen. 9. and 27. and 49. To which the Lord hath given great force, insomuch that the prolonging of the childrens life and dayes seemeth to be attributed to the parents in the fifth commandment, <hi>that they may prolong their dayes,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore not without cause are children taught to crave the blessing of their parents; the rather because as it is our duty to pray for others, so also to desire others to pray for us. Which hath been done not onely by the inferiour and weak in grace, as 1. Sam. 12. Jam. 5. 14. but also by the chief Saints of God, as by Paul in many places of his epistles, as Rom. 15. 30. Eph. 6. 19. But when

we desire others to pray for us, we must adde our<note place="margin">

And hereof are three degrees: The first, when we pray not against their persons but against their counsels and practices, that God would confound them and bring them to nought: So Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid prayed against Achitophel, 2. Sam. 15. 31. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we pray the Lord to inflict some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affliction upon them that they may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and brought to repentance, Psal. 83. 16. <hi>Fill their faces with shame, O Lord, that they may seek thy name.</hi> Job 34. 36. <hi>Optat Elihu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> Elihu wisheth Job so long to be afflicted till he acknowledged Gods justice, and absteined from blasphemous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, such as the wicked do use. Thirdly, when we pray for their utter destruction, Psal. 55. 15. But<note place="margin">Whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations be lawfull.</note> here it may be demanded whether these kinds of imprecations be lawfull and agreeable to charity, and whether also they be imitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42240:102"/>Of the first there is no question, seeing it is made not against their person but their sinne. Now it is profitable not onely for him that prayeth, but for the other also that is prayed against, that his sinne may be restrained, and his wicked practices prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor is there any great question to be made of the second, if it be made in hatred of the sinne and love of the person, that the sinne by the affliction may be mortified and the sinner saved. Concerning the third, we are to distinguish between such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations as are generally conceived against the wicked and obstinate enemies of God, and those which are particular. For of the first there is no question to be made, that they be warrantable and lawfull, as they are generally propounded without having a speciall eye to some particulars whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we maligne; Judg. 5. 31. Psal. 31. 17. Deut. 27. 15, &amp;c. to the end of the chapter. 1. Cor. 16. 22. <hi>Anathema Maranatha.</hi> Again, those that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected against particular men, sometimes they are, as Augustine saith, <hi>verba praedicentium,</hi> the words of<note place="margin">Contra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Jos. 6. 26. with 1. Kings 16. 34. And such are the words denounced by our Saviour to Chorazin and Bethsaida, Matth. 11. 21. against the Pharisees, Matth. 23. and Luke 11. 42, &amp;c. against Judas, Matth. 26. 24.</p>
                  <p>As touching the rest of the curses which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God in the Scriptures have denounced against the wicked, wishing the ruine and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their persons, we are to hold that howsoever

they were warrantable in them, yet not imitable of us. They by the spirit of God were inlightened certainly to know &amp; discern those against whom they make such imprecations to have been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate enemies of God appointed to destruction. Secondly, they were moved not with private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred but with a pure zeal of Gods glory, to which the love of our neighbour must give place, desiring that God might be glorified in the confusion of his obstinate enemies.<note place="margin">Our safest course is to abstein from imprecations</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for us who neither have the like certainty of knowledge nor the like purity of zeal, our safest course is altogether to abstein from imprecations directed against the persons of men; knowing that when curses do proceed from private hatred and malice, they are most horrible profanations of the name of God, whereby malicious men go about to make God the executioner of their malice: and therefore we are charged not to curse but to blesse, 1. Pet. 3. 9. even those that curse or persecute us, Rom. 12. 14. Matth. 5. 44. Cursed therefore are they which use cursing, Psal. 109. 17. especially if they curse any of the heirs of the promise, to whom God hath made this promise, <hi>Blessed be he that blesseth thee, and cursed be he that curseth thee,</hi> Gen. 12. 3. and 27. 29.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Of the reall object of prayer, or the things to be prayed for.</head>
                  <p>THe object reall, or the thing which we do ask, is either undetermined and not particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or else it is determined and expressed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The former, when in generall or in indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite terms we desire the Lord to heare us; Psal. 4. 1. <hi>Heare me when I call; have mercy upon me, and heare my prayer:</hi> Psal. 5. 1, 2. and 28. 1, 2. and 54. 2. and 55. 1, 2. and 61. 1. and 86. 1. and 88. 2. and 102. 1, 2. and 130. 1, 2. and 141. 1, 2. and 143. 1.</p>
                  <p>The object determined is either the glory of God or our own good. The advancement of Gods glory is to be asked both absolutely and first. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, I say, without any condition or respect of our own good, which we must subordinate to the glory of God, and not the glory of God to it. If therefore the glory of God and our own good come in comparison or in question whether should give place, we ought to preferre the glory of God before our own salvation. Example, Exod. 32. 32. Rom. 9. 3. For the glory of God is the chief end, and our good is no otherwise to be desired then it is referred thereunto. But as we are to ask it absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so also first: First, both in order, as our Saviour hath taught us, this being the first petition of the Lords prayer; and first in degree, that is, chiefly, because the end is alwayes better and more exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>It was said before that the matter or object of<note place="margin">Object.</note> our prayer must be good; how then can prayer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a distinction in respect of good and evil.</p>

And hereupon the benefits of God are distinguished into positive, which are reall benefits; and privative, which is deliverance or preservation from evil. The good things which we crave for our selves belong either to the obteining of a better life, or for the mainteining of this life: the former are commonly called spirituall blessings, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temporall.</p>
                  <p>The spirituall blessings (I mean so many as are necessary to salvation) we are to ask absolutely; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such spirituall blessings are absolutely subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to Gods glory and mans salvation. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, among those things which we crave for our selves they are first to be desired and sought, Matth. 6. 33. And that order our Saviour observeth in the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42240:104"/>
Lords prayer, teaching us after the glory of God, in the next place to seek our own chiefest good. For by <hi>the kingdome of God</hi> we are to understand both the kingdome of glory and the kingdome of grace. The kingdome of glory cometh to us in our glorification, the kingdome of grace in our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby we are brought out of the kingdome of Satan into Gods kingdome; and secondly in our justification, whereby we are both indued with the priviledges of his kingdome, which are the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God imputed, peace and joy in the holy Ghost, Rom. 14. 17. and also intituled unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. And by <hi>doing the will of God on earth as it is done in heaven,</hi> is meant the righteousnes of God so farre as it is by us to be performed, or the righteousnesse of sanctification, which is both the cognizance of all true subjects of the kingdome of grace, and the proper note of all the heirs of the kingdome of glory, Acts 26. 18. and 20. 32.</p>
                  <p>As touching temporall benefits; Some have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that they are to be asked of God; as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites and Manichees: others have doubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same; as Chrysostome and Basil, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthy either for us to seek and ask of God, or for him to give unto us. But our Saviour, when he biddeth us <hi>first seek the kingdome of God and his righteousnesse,</hi> implyeth that temporall things are to be sought also in a secondary respect: For, as Lyra saith, <hi>Primum relativè dicitur ad secundum.

Whereunto we may adde the practice of the godly; Gen. 28. 20. 1. Kings 8. 33, 35, 37. Prov. 30. 8. and the precept of our Saviour Christ, teaching us to say, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that in asking temporall things many do erre, either asking them chiefly or absolutely; but as we must ask and seek them in a secondary respect, so also conditionally, so farre forth as they stand with the glory of God and our own spirituall good.</p>

                  <p>In prayer for the forgivenesse of sinne these things specially are required: First, in the action it self, confession of sinnes. And of this Augustine speaketh excellently: <hi>Hortatur nos saepius Scriptura ad medicamenta fugere confessionis: Non quòd Deus indigeat confessione nostrâ,</hi> &amp;c. The Scripture doth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42240:106"/>
                     <q>often exhort us to flee to the medicine of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not that God needeth our confession, unto whom all things are present which we think, speak and do; but because we cannot otherwise be saved unlesse we confesse penitently that which we have done amisse negligently. He that accuseth himself in his sinnes, the devil hath not whereof to accuse him in the day of judgement. If at least confessing he do by repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blot out what he hath done, and doth not again renew them, &amp;c.

                  <p>Now this confession is both prositable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. It hath the promise of forgivenesse: So to the hiding of our sinnes is pardon denied, 1. John 1. 8, 9. <hi>If we deny our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>without wrath.</hi> And likewise we are to repent of those sinnes the pardon whereof we desire: For that is pretended in our asking forgivenesse, that is, both to be sorie for our sinne past, and to promise and purpose unfeignedly amendment for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>And both these duties of charity and repentance are likewise to be practiced in our lives after we have craved forgivenesse at the hands of God. For as touching the dutie of charity in forgiving others; If after we have desired forgivenesse, and in our conceit have obteined pardon, if we deal unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with our brother, whom we will not forgive, it will be an evidence against us that our sinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not pardoned, Matth. 18. 23, to 35.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42240:107"/>
And for the other duty of repentance; A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have assurance of the forgivenesse of his sinne which he doth continue in: For God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the sinnes which we our selves retein; <hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh his sinne shall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.</p>
                  <p>And as we are to pray for the forgivenesse of sinne or taking away of the guilt, so we must also pray that we may be delivered from the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and preserved against tentations alluring unto sinne for the time to come. And as we are to pray against corruptions and tentations, so must we in our lives strive and fight against our corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and resist tentations, avoyding also occasions of evil; otherwise how can we ask that of the Lord which we our selves will not yield unto in our practice.</p>

The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall is, when God doth punish sinne with sinne, blinding the eyes of men, and hardening their hearts, and giving them over to a reprobate sense.

                  </p>
                  <p>The duties required in thanksgiving are either<note place="margin">Of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duties required in thanksgiving</note> common to it with prayer, or proper and peculiar unto it. For when I say that thanksgiving is a kind of invocation, you are to understand that all those things which were spoken of in the generall treatise are particularly to be applied to thanksgiving. The which I will the rather do, because commonly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42240:109"/>
those things are delivered not as generall points but as particular to prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thanksgiving therefore as well as prayer, is <hi>a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what it is.</note> 
                     <hi>religious speech of the faithfull unto God in the name of Christ, made according to the will of God by the help of the holy Ghost, concerning good things apperteining to Gods glory and our own good.</hi> I call it <hi>a religious speech,</hi> because it is a principall part of that religious worship which we ow unto God: whereby it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so distinguished from the civill thanksgiving to men, and is therefore religiously to be performed.</p>
                  <p>In the rest of the definition I noted six things which are essentiall to all invocation, and without which it cannot be acceptable unto God: First, That the party which doth invocate must be faithfull: for <hi>God heareth not sinners:</hi> And thanksgiving being a sacrifice, the holy Ghost telleth us that <hi>the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. The proper subject of Gods prayse is the Church:<note place="margin">The proper subject of Gods prayse is the church</note> Eph. 3. 21. <hi>To him be prayse in the Church.</hi> Psal. 65. 1. <hi>Praise waiteth for God in Sion.</hi> The Lord, Psal. 50. 14, 15. exhorteth his saints and his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>to offer unto him thanksgiving, and to call upon him in the day of trouble: But</hi> v. 16. <hi>unto the wicked saith God, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, and to take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed, and castest my wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s behind thee?</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are to be offered by none but priests; and all the faithfull and they onely are <hi>a royall priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ood, to offer up spirituall sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 5, 9. Revel. 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>This duty is necessarily required of all, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42240:109"/>
without sinne be omitted by any; but cannot be<note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can be rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the faithfull onely.</note> acceptably performed but by the faithfull. And therefore the faithfull are in a speciall manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to this duty, Psal. 30. 4, and 145. 10. and 149. 5, 6. And this sheweth the necessity of faith in Christ and repentance towards God. Again, those which give thanks must be joyfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord; but the wicked cannot rejoyce in the Lord; neither ought they whilest they continue in their sinnes to be joyfull: yea, our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a wo to such laughers, Luke 6. The faithfull therefore alone are exhorted, as to rejoyce alwayes, so <hi>in all things to give thanks,</hi> 1. Thess. 5. 16, 18. Psal. 132. 9, 16. and 149. 2, 3, 5, 6. and 33. 1. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, O ye righteous; for prayse is comely for the upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as prayer so also thanksgiving is to<note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is to be offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ed unto God alone.</note> be offered unto God alone as the authour and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall giver of all good things, Jam. 1. 17. Psal. 50. 14. Col. 3. 17. Ephes. 5. 20. We may and ought to be thankfull unto men as unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of God; as Rom. 16. 4. And to be unthankfull is a great fault; 2. Tim. 3. 2. But if neglecting God we give thanks unto men as the authours, we commit sacrilegious idolatry in rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of his honour and giving it unto men. In this sense prayse and thanksgiving is a sacrifice which must be offered to the Lord alone; and in this sense his name alone is to be exalted, Psal. 148. 13. and therefore they which so give thanks to men, or rest in the means, they sacrifice unto them and make them their God; they <hi>sacrifice to their net and</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:42240:110"/>
                     <hi>burn incense to their drag,</hi> Hab. 1. 16. Eph. 5. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>unto God and the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thanksgiving as well as Prayer is to be<note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be offered in the name of Christ.</note> offered unto God in the name of Christ, Ephes. 8. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in Christ Jesus,</hi> Ephes. 3. 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>through Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 1. 8. &amp; 7. 25. Col. 3. 17. Heb. 13. 15. For we are an holy priesthood, to offer up spirituall sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, 1. Pet. 2. 5. Revel. 8. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the manner; There is required in<note place="margin">Of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thanksgiving</note> the soul, 1. in generall, that our thanksgiving be a speech of the soul and not of the lips alone. David therefore in some places stirreth up <hi>his soul</hi> to prayse God, Psal. 103. 1, 2. and 104. 1. And elsewhere he professeth that he would prayse God with his <hi>whole heart,</hi> Psal. 9. 1. and 86. 12. and 111. 1. that is, with an upright heart, Psal. 119. 7. To which purpose Paul also exhorteth us to <hi>sing in our hearts unto God,</hi> Ephes. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. To little purpose serveth the outward melody of the voyce, unlesse there be a concent thereof with the heart: We must therefore be carefull to sing Davids Psalmes with Davids affections; but we may not sing or praise God either with feigned lips or with wandring thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the mind there is required, first, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; Psal. 47. 7. Col. 3. 16. and secondly, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ith, whereby we are to be perswaded that this our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and sacrifice of praise is acceptable unto God in Christ; without which our thanksgiving cannot be as it ought, chearfull: unlesse we be perswaded by faith of Gods goodnesse towards us how can we be thankfull to him?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:42240:110"/>3. In our heart it is required that our praise or thanksgiving be humble, reverent, and hearty: Humble; that we may ascribe the whole praise unto God, unto whom alone it is due, and assume no part thereof unto our selves; Psal. 115. 1. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; for without reverence we cannot give unto the Lord the praise that is due unto his name, Psal. 29. 2. nor ascribe unto him eternall kingdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and glory. We must in our thanksgiving rejoyce in God, but we must <hi>rejoyce in reverence,</hi> Psal. 2. 11. and 95. 2, 6. performing therein a religious service and worship to God. Hearty, with all our heart; and that in particular with thankfulnesse and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without which our thanks will be either cold or counterfeit. See Psal. 68. 26.</p>
                  <p>And as for bodily duties: The voyce in more speciall manner is required in thanksgiving. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our tongue is called <hi>our glory,</hi> because by it we are to glorifie God. We are not by silence to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods prayse; but as we are inwardly thankfull so must we testifie our inward thankfulnesse by our outward thanksgiving. And in this kind of Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion especially is singing warranted and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us in the Scriptures, not onely of the Old Testament but also of the New, Jam. 5. 13. Ephes. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. Matth. 26. 30. Acts 16. 25.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this invocation also is to be performed by the help of the holy Ghost. For naturally we are tongue-tied in Gods prayses: but it is the spirit of God that doth <hi>open our lips that our mouth may shew forth his prayse,</hi> Psal. 51. 15. It is the spirit of grace which <hi>maketh us to sing with grace in our hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42240:111"/>Sixthly and lastly, our thanksgiving must be for good and lawfull things: otherwise we go about to make God the authour of evil.</p>

                     </gap>, <hi>Gratia gratiam parit,</hi> A good turn begetteth thanks: And in this sense the word <hi>grace</hi> is used for Thanksgiving at meals. The grace therefore that is required in the soul is Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. For outward thanksgiving without inward thankfulnesse is counterfeit and hypocriticall. There is no doubt but that <hi>habendae sunt gratiae quas agimus,</hi> we must have thankfulnesse when we give thanks. And as prayer is the expressing of our desire, so thanksgiving is the testifying of our thankfulnesse. And therefore as they play the hypocrites which pray for that which they do not desire, so likewise
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42240:111"/>
they which give thanks for that for which they are not thankfull, either because they have it not, or do not think themselves beholding to God for it, Luke 18. And as in prayer the Lord especially regardeth the desire of the heart; so in thanksgiving, the thankfulnesse of the soul.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of the outward expressing inward thankfulnesse by praysing God.</head>
                  <p>THe outward duty is, to expresse our inward thankfulnesse and chearfulnesse: Our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by celebrating and praysing the name of God, extolling his goodnesse, recounting his mercies, and exciting others to prayse God: Our chearfulnesse, <hi>jubilando,</hi> by making a joyfull noyse, and singing unto God; Psal. 100. 1. and 81. 1. Jam. 5. 13.</p>
                  <p>Now because naturally we are backward in the performance of this duty, insomuch that scarce one of ten can be found to return prayse and thanks unto God, as appeareth in the story of the ten lepers, Luke 17. 17. I will therefore use some arguments<note place="margin">Reasons mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us to praise God.</note> to move us thereunto. And first that threefold ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument Psal. 147. 1. <hi>Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing prayses to our God: for it is pleasant, and prayse is comely.</hi> I. <hi>It is good:</hi> For it is <hi>the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning us,</hi> 1. Thess. 5. 18. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God in many places; Psal. 50. 14. And the same is testified Psal. 92. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is <hi>pleasant:</hi> Psal. 135. 3. For it is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise wherein not onely the faithfull on earth do espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially rejoyce, but also the Saints and Angels in heaven, who enjoy perpetuall joy and happinesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and reposing therein a part of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

                     <hi>due unto his name,</hi> Psal. 92. 2. in respect both of his attributes and works: <hi>Praise the Lord: for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>r,</hi> Psal. 136. 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the faithfull; Psal. 33. 1. For what can more become those who by Christs benefit are become priests to offer spirituall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto God, then to <hi>sacrifice praise</hi> unto him? 1. Pet. 2. 5. Revel. 1. 5. <hi>By him therefore let us offer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to his name,</hi> Heb. 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>To these we may adde another ternion of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That praise and thanksgiving is an exercise it self most Excellent, to God most Honourable, to us most Necessary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The excellency of it may appear by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this duty.</note> it, first to the sacrifices of the Law: For the <hi>sacrifice of praise, the calves of our lips,</hi> is farre prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>sacrifices of goats and bulls,</hi> Psal. 50. 14. secondly, with Prayer: for as <hi>it is a more blessed thing to give then to receive,</hi> Acts 20. 35. so a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing to give thanks then to beg and crave. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what more excellent thing can be done on earth then that which is the exercise of the Saints and Angels in heaven? and therefore to praise God is not onely an excellent but also a blessed exercise; wherein the faithfull have reposed happinesse, Psal. 84. 4. <hi>Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will be still praysing thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Praise is <hi>Honourable to God;</hi> Psal. 50. 23. <hi>He</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Praise honourable to God.</note> 
                     <hi>that sacrificeth praise he honoureth me.</hi> God so highly esteemeth his praises proceeding from us, as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by something were added to his glory, to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42240:115"/>
infinite nothing can be added. Therefore the praysing of God in the Scriptures is called <hi>bl ssing.</hi> Psal. 103. 1. <hi>the magnifying of God,</hi> Luke 1. 46. and <hi>the glorifying of his name,</hi> Matth. 9. 6. the <hi>making of his praise glorious,</hi> Psal. 66. 2. or, as some reade, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone gloriam nomini ejus,</hi> appoint glory to his name, not that our praises indeed do make him great or glorious, or adde to the glory of his name, for his <hi>name is exalted above all praise,</hi> Nehem. 9. 5. but that to incourage us to this duty he is pleased so to term the setting forth of his praise, and the declaring or celebrating of his glory.</p>

Revel. 1. 3. Heb. 13. 15. because in our daily prayers we desire that we may glorifie his name, and therefore in our lives are to endeavour it. We desire also that <hi>his will may be done;</hi> but this is the will of God, 1. Thess. 5. 18. Would we, as we pray, <hi>do the will of God as it is done in heaven?</hi> then must we be frequent in sounding forth his praise: for this is the exercise of the Saints and Angels in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Necessitate medii,</hi> by necessity of the means; as a necessary means, in respect both of our good and Gods glory. 1.

Our speech was given us to glorifie God; &amp; therefore our tongue is our <hi>glory:</hi> So that they are worse then bruit creatures who are mute in Gods praises. Yea, such necessitie there is of praysing and glorifying of God, that if men should be silent God would make the stones to sound forth his praise</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Necessitate signi,</hi> by the necessitie of the signe. For it is necessary not onely that we should be thankfull unto God for his mercies, but also that we should expresse our thankfulnesse. And for as much as we cannot <hi>reserre</hi> or recompense Gods bounty, (<hi>for our goodnesse will not reach to him,</hi> Psal. 16. 3.) It remaineth therefore that we must <hi>agere gratias,</hi> that is, give thanks. For if we should enter into consultation with our selves, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what course we should take to testifie our thankfulnesse, our resolution must be the same with that of David, Psal. 1 16. 12, 17. Seeing then this is the onely thing besides the glorifying of God by a godly conversation that we can do to expresse our thankfulnesse, we are very unthankfull if we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective herein.</p>

Thirdly, by <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord with our substance,</hi> Prov. 3. 9. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him to be the chief Lord from whom we do hold all good things; by giving unto him the tithes which are his, Levit. 27. <hi>Debentur Deo, &amp;c.</hi> They are due unto God by vertue of his universall dominion over all, and by him assigned before the Law to the first-born which were his Priests, as to Melchisedec; under the Law, to the Leviticall priests; under the Gospel, to the ministers &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof, 1.

Neither are they due to the ceremoniall law onely: For the tribe of Levi, unto which the ceremoniall law doth tie them, in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham paid tithes to Melchisedec.

                  <p>It is true indeed that all things as they proceed from God are good, and are by him ordered and directed to his glory and the good of his chosen: and therefore in all things he is to be praysed. God is to be praysed for his attributes and for his works absolutely considered: but we are to give him thanks because he is good unto us who are his Church, and causeth all things to work for our good. We are therefore upon all occasions to give thanks unto God for his benefits either bestowed or promised,

                     </gap> seasons as just occasion is offered. In this sense David saith Psal. 46. 2. <hi>While I live I will prayse the Lord: I will sing prayses to my</hi>

For the distinction of invocation, that it is <hi>stata,</hi> stinted, or <hi>vaga,</hi> unstinted, is to be applied to this kind: We must both set our selves certain times wherein to call upon God, praying unto him and praysing him, after the example of Daniel, chap. 6. 10. and also extraordinarily be ready upon all occasions to return thanks and prayse unto God, acknowledging with David that when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth any new blessing upon us, he hath <hi>put a new song of thanksgiving into our mouthes,</hi> and think no time wherein God doth blesse unseasonable to give him thanks. And for as much as Gods mercies are <hi>renewed upon us every morning,</hi> Lam. 3. 23. and multiplyed upon us every day, Psal. 68. 19. and every night, therefore we are with David to prayse him <hi>every night and every day,</hi> Psal. 92. 2. and 145. 2. yea, <hi>seven times a day,</hi> Psal. 119. 164. Neither must we think <hi>midnight</hi> it selfe unseasonable for this purpose; Psal. 119. 62. Acts 16. 25. Every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are to prayse God for his blessing upon us that night, and every night we are to prayse him for his blessing upon us that day: Every meal is to begin with prayses and be concluded with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: every attempt and businesse of importance is to begin with prayer and be ended with thanks, Col. 3. 17.</p>

                     <hi>sed tantum sui similes invitare videtur,</hi> Paul doth not seem to invite all to continuall joy, but onely those who are like himself. But the faithfull, who are at peace with God, have also joy in the holy Ghost: whereby they do rejoyce in God in all estates, not onely in time of peace &amp; prosperity, but also in time of adversity, Rom. 5. 3. Yea the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est afflictions of this life are to be born of the godly, not onely meekly and patiently, but also comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and thankfuly. For 1. as God in all his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remembreth mercy, so must our faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his mercy as well as our sense apprehendeth his judgements. And therefore we ought to say with Job, chap. 13. 15. <hi>Though he kill me yet will I trust in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the faithfull have this priviledge, that as nothing can hurt them, Isai. 54. 17. so all things, even their afflictions, <hi>do work together for their good,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because God afflicteth them for their good, whether by triall or chastisement.</p>

                     </note> this prayer, so he doth not alwayes bind us to use the same words. For here two extremities are to be avoided: the first of the Brownists, who think it unlawfull to use the prescript form of these words;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42240:121"/>
the second of the Papists, who superstitiously insist in the very words and syllables themselves.</p>
                  <p>As touching the first; Our Saviour commandeth<note place="margin">2. The Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a prayer.</note> us <hi>thus to pray;</hi> and more plainly, Luke 11. 2. <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore unlesse it be unlawfull to obey the expresse commandment of our Saviour Christ, it is lawfull to use these words. Secondly, the book of Psalmes doth prove that we may have set forms of prayers. Psal. 86. is a form of prayer to be used in affliction. The 92 is <hi>Psalmus in diem Sabbati,</hi> A Psalme for the Sabbath. The 102 <hi>Oratio pro paupere,</hi> A Psalme for a poore man. The 136 A solemn form of thanksgiving. 2. Chron. 7. 6. and 20. 21.</p>
                  <p>For the second, when Christ commandeth <hi>to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">That we ought not to be tyed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this form.</note> 
                     <hi>pray thus,</hi> he doth not tie us to the words but to the things. We must pray for such things as herein summarily are conteined, with such affections as are herein prescribed. For we must understand that our Saviour Christ propoundeth this prayer as a brief summe of all those things which we are to ask. For as the Creed is <hi>summa credendorum,</hi> the summe of things to be believed; the Decalogue, <hi>summa agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum,</hi> the summe of things to be done: so the Lords Prayer is <hi>summa petendorum,</hi> the summe of things to be desired. But as all things particularly to be believed are not particularly expressed in the Creed; nor all things to be done, in the Decalog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>: so neither are all things particularized in the Lords prayer for which we are to ask: And therefore it is lawfull, nay expedient and necessary, often to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the particulars themselves. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42240:121"/>
whereof we have so many arguments as there are prayers of the godly recorded in the word: For though all of them may be referred to this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or some part thereof, yet none of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the same words. And moreover, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Luke in setting down this prayer are not curious in observing the same words: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore superstitious is the opinion and practice of the Church of Rome, who think that the bare repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these words in an unknown tongue, without understanding or faith, is <hi>ex opere operato</hi> meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: as though our Saviour Christ had prescribed these words to be used as a charm, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>First, whereas our Saviour Christ propoundeth<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> That this form is a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> this form, we may be assured that it is a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of prayer, that nothing ought to be asked which is not in it conteined. For <hi>in him are all the treasures of the wisdome and knowledge of God,</hi> Col. 2. 3. He knoweth what is acceptable unto God, what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us: therefore in this prayer is conteined what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is either fit for God to grant or for us to ask. By this then as a pattern we are to form our prayers, and as by a rule we are to examine them. May the things which we desire be referred to these petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? then may we boldly ask them. Can they not be referred? then do we not pray according to Gods will; and therefore can have no assurance that we shall be heard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas Christ teacheth his disciples<note place="margin">Ministers must teach their people to pray.</note> to pray, herein he giveth an example to be imitated of Ministers; <hi>sc.</hi> that as they teach other things, so also to pray. John Baptist, Luke 11. 1. taught his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42240:122"/>
disciples to pray; whereupon Christs disciples desire him in like manner to teach them. Wherein also they are to be an example to be imitated of all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: As the Father in the family, or the Pastour in the Church, ought to teach; so the child in the house, the hearer in the Church, ought to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to learn how to pray.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it sneweth that of our selves we know not how to pray. For if we should be left to our own affections and desires, we should ask many times those things which would tend to Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and our own hurt: As appeareth by Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, who wanting this direction of our Saviour Christ, knew not what to ask, but groping in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse desired in generall terms, that those things which are good he would give them whether they asked them or no, and would deliver them from evil things although they should ask them: <hi>Plato in Alcib.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <hi>O Jupiter King, give unto us good things whether we ask or ask them not; but put away from us evil things though we pray for them.</hi> And therefore our Saviour Christ thought it necessary to teach us how to pray.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, seeing our Saviour Christ hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to pray and taught us how, we are unexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if we neglect this duty.</p>
                  <p>One thing further is to be considered in the words as they are set down by Luke, <hi>When ye pray, say:</hi> Whether speech in prayer be alwayes necessary.<note place="margin">Quest. Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, either <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward speech:</hi> and prayer is either vocall or mentall: And the Lord heareth the cry of the heart, and our secret grones are not hid from him, Psal. 38. 10. Howbeit the voyce is to be used so oft as it may conveniently, both for the attention of the mind and intension of the affections, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>NOw let us come to the Lords Prayer it self. In<note place="margin">Of the Lords prayer.</note> which is lively, though summarily, set down unto us the practice of that doctrine which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have learned concerning prayer. For as we have been taught that Prayer and Thanksgiving are to be joyned together: so here with the Petitions is joyned a Thanksgiving, wherein we are taught to ascribe unto the Lord <hi>eternall kingdome, power and glory;</hi> which words almost David useth in his solemn thanksgiving, 1. Chron. 29. 11.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas we have been taught that unto prayer are required duties before we pray and also in prayer it self, both here are prescribed. Before we are to use preparation, wherein we are to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of such things as are fit to stirre up those graces in us which in prayer are to be expressed. In prayer
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42240:123"/>
two things are to be expressed; an hungring and thirsting desire of grace, and the speciall assent of faith: For the stirring up of both which it is fit to meditate upon the fatherly love and almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, which our Saviour hath taught us to prefix before the prayer it self. In prayer two things especially are to be expressed: 1. An hungring and thirsting desire of the grace and blessing of God; 2. A speciall assent of faith that our request shall be granted. Therefore the prayer it self is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Petitions and Conclusion: the desire being espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially expressed in the Petitions; the Conclusion conteining, 1. a confirmation, 2. a testification of our faith, in the word <hi>Amen.</hi> Of the Lords prayer<note place="margin">The parts.</note> therefore there be two parts: the Preface; and the Prayer it self, consisting of Petitions and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, conteining a Confirmation of our faith joyned with the praysing of God, and also a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication both of our faith and the truth of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, in the word <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In expounding the Lords Prayer we will observe<note place="margin">The order.</note> this order: First, we will expound the words, and shew the true meaning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; then we will inferre the uses of Doctrine, Confutation, Instruction in the duties of prayer and of our lives; and lastly, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, whereby shall be detected the hypocrisie of worldly men, who using these words do not pray in truth.</p>
                  <p>Whereas our Saviour doth not abruptly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Petitions, but prefixeth a solemn Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, we are taught before we call upon God to use some preparation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:42240:123"/>The preface conteineth a description of God to<note place="margin">The preface.</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray, taken 1. from his relation to us, that he is <hi>Our Father;</hi> 2. from the place wherein his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty doth especially appear, that he <hi>is in heaven:</hi> the former signifying especially his love; the other, his power. Of which two if in our preparation we do duly meditate, our desire will be kindled and our faith confirmed, considering that he to whom we pray is both able and willing to grant our requests.</p>

                        <p>SOme do expound these words as though they were a rhetoricall proeme which we use to win Gods favour. But we use words in our prayer not that God but that we may be moved and affected. First we call him <hi>Father:</hi> whereof we are first to seek the meaning, and then the use. By the name of <hi>Father</hi> God alone is understood: For, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith Matth. 23. 9. we must <hi>call no man father,</hi> because we <hi>have but one Father who is in heaven.</hi> Joh. 8. 41. <hi>We have one Father, which is God:</hi> A good profession if it had bene uttered with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>Now God is said to be a Father two wayes: by<note place="margin">God a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two wayes.</note> Creation, and Adoption. By creation, as Isai. 64. 8. So Adam is said to be <hi>the sonne of God,</hi> Luke 3. 38. and the Angels, Job 1. By adoption in Christ, Fphes. 1. 5. So every believer is <hi>born of God,</hi> 1. John 5. 1. For <hi>to so many as believe in Christ God hath given this priviledge, to be the sonnes of God,</hi> John 1. 12. And in this sense is every faithfull man to call God <hi>Father.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42240:124"/>But here it may be demanded, Whether the<note place="margin">Quest.</note> whole Trinitie is called upon in the name of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or the first Person alone.</p>
                        <p>The word <hi>Father</hi> is attributed unto God two<note place="margin">Answ.</note> wayes; either essentially or personally. Essentially, when he is so called in respect of the creatures, 1. Cor. 8. 6. Personally, when it hath relation to the other Persons, the Sonne and the holy Ghost. In this place it hath relation to the creatures. So Deut. 32. 6. Isai. 63. 16. But howsoever the whole Trinity is our Father, &amp; so to be worshipped of us, yet this speech is more peculiarly directed to the first Person, the fountain of the Godhead, who is the Father of Christ, Ephes. 3. 14. and in him our Father, John 20. 17. yet so as in worshipping him we joyntly worship the other two, who as they are all one in essence, coequall and coeternall, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also in all actions towards us, so they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be worshipped. <hi>O God, thou Father of Christ, and in him our Father, who givest the Spirit of thy Sonne, whereby we cry,</hi> Abba, Father, <hi>to thee we present our prayers in the name of thy Son, craving the help of the holy Ghost.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second Person is called our <hi>Father,</hi> Isai. 9. 6. &amp; so may the holy Ghost, who doth regenerate us, Deut. 32. 6. and to either of them may our prayers be directed, Acts 7. 59. So that our prayer may be directed to any or to all the Persons, 2. Cor. 13. 13. or to two of them, 1. Thess. 3. 11.</p>
                        <p>We are taught to whom to direct our prayers,<note place="margin">1. <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> namely, to God alone. For seeing our Saviour hath commanded us, <hi>when we pray,</hi> to <hi>say, Our Father,</hi> it is<note place="margin">1.</note>
                           <pb n="233" facs="tcp:42240:124"/>
evident that we break the commandment if we direct our prayers to any to whom we may not say, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Which title without blasphemy we cannot attribute to any but onely to the Lord, who is our heavenly Father: Jer. 31. 9. <hi>Sum Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Pater,</hi> I am a Father to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, whereas by nature we are the children<note place="margin">2.</note> of wrath, and yet commanded to call upon God as our Father, we are taught in whose name we are to come unto God: Not in our own names or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, Dan. 9. 18. for then we shall find him a Judge rather then a Father; but onely in the name and mediation of Christ, Eph. 3. 12. in whom he is our Father, and in whose name he hath promised to grant <hi>whatsoever we ask according to his will.</hi> It is well said of Calvine, <hi>Cùm Deum Patrem vocamus, Christi nomen praetendimus,</hi> When we call God Father, we pretend the name of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We are taught that the help of the holy Ghost<note place="margin">3.</note> is necessary in prayer. For how should we which were children of wrath dare to call God our Father, or be assured that we be his children? By the holy Ghost, who is <hi>the spirit of adoption, &amp; beareth witnesse to our spirits, that we are the sonnes of God, we cry in our hearts, Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 2. 15, 16. For if <hi>none can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the holy Ghost;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</note> then much lesse can a man call upon God as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Christ except he be endued by the holy Ghost. We must therefore, as the Apostle teacheth us, Ephes. 2. 18. call upon God the Father in the name of the Sonne by the assistance of the holy Ghost, so shall we, though unworthy and unable to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42240:125"/>
call upon God, in Christ be accepted and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost be enabled to pray according to God.</p>
                        <p>Here therefore first are they refuted who think<note place="margin">11. <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> they may lawfully direct their prayers either to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels<note place="margin">1.</note> or Saints, to whom the name <hi>Father</hi> is opposed, Isai. 63. 16. or to their images, saying to a stock or stone, <hi>Our father,</hi> Jer. 2. 27. If God be our heavenly Father, who is more willing to give good things then any earthly parents, and also all-sufficient, why should we seek to any other, unlesse we can either accuse him of unkindnesse, or object want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto him?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if God be our Father in Christ, then<note place="margin">2.</note> ought we <hi>with boldnesse to come unto the throne of grace through him,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. Neither do we need any other mediation then of the Sonne, who is the onely Mediatour as of redemption so also of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, 1. Tim. 2. 5. contrary to the doctrine of the Papists, who teach men to use the mediation of Saints: Whereas our Saviour John 16. 26. having commanded us to pray in his name, addeth, <hi>I say not that I will intreat the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you.</hi>

                           <p>And that we may come in faith, let us consider, First, that without faith we are no sonnes of his, but children of wrath, Ephes. 2. 3, 12. and if we believe we are the sonnes of God, John 1. 12. and of the houshold of faith. Secondly, that if God be our Father in Christ, he will grant us what good thing soever we ask. For 1. he is affected as a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 13.</note> towards his children: yea, his love towards us is so much greater then the love of earthly parents as his goodnesse and mercy is greater, Isai. 63. 16. Psal. 27. 10. Isai. 49. 15. Matth. 7. 11. Luke 11. 13. 2. In that he is our Father he hath given us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est gift that can be imagined, and therefore will not deny the lesfe. <hi>Pater quid negabit filiis, qui jam dedit quòd pater est?</hi> What will the father deny to his sons, who hath vouchsafed already to be our Father? For if <hi>he have so loved us that he gave his Son for us</hi> (that in him we might be adopted his children) <hi>how shall he not with him give us all good things?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. 3. In that he hath vouchsafed us this great love to be our Father and that we should be his children, he hath also made us his heirs, &amp; provided us an inheritance in heaven. For as he gave his Sonne <hi>in pretium,</hi> for a price, so he reserveth himself <hi>in praemium,</hi> for a reward. If therefore it be our <hi>Fathers pleasure to give us a kingdome,</hi> we need not fear but that he will grant us matters of lesse moment, Luke 12. 32. 4. In sonne-like submission we are to call upon God
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42240:126"/>
our Father, &amp;c. Matth. 26. 39, 42. And in this faith we are to rest in the will of our Father, submitting our selves thereto, knowing that he will dispose of us for the best.</p>

For though we call upon God as our Father, and yet do not obey him, nor honour him, nor fear him, nor love him, nor follow him, nor submit our selves to his chastisements, nor trust in him, we shew our selves not to be the children of God, but rather of the devil.

behalf of the whole fraternitie, which is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church, <hi>Our Father, Give us,</hi> &amp;c. he teacheth us to exercise the communion of Saints by mutuall prayers for one another, Ephes. 6. 18. and not onely to have respect to our own good but also to the good of others, 1. Cor. 13. 5. and withall inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us how we are to be affected towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren when we come to call upon God; that we should desire the same good things for them which we ask for our selves; that we should be touched with a fellow-feeling of their wants, as it becometh those which are not onely the sonnes of the same Father, but also members of the same body, Heb. 13. 3. Therefore as we ought to bring faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, so also charity towards men, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>wrath</hi> and dissension <hi>we may lift up pure hands unto God,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 8.</p>
                           <p>But is it not lawfull to say sometimes, <hi>My Father,</hi>

                              <hi>My God,</hi> and to pray for our selves in particular or for some others?</p>
                           <p>It is lawfull in private prayers to call God thy <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Father, so that thou dost not arrogate any thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to thy self besides or above other faithfull men. For this is the voyce of justifying faith (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of temptation, when the faithfull man may seem forsaken of God) to apply unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in particular that which commonly belongeth to all the faithfull, Psal. 22. 1. <hi>Deus meus,</hi> My God, my God, &amp;c. John 20. 28. Rom. 1. 8. The Lord instructeth his people thus to call him, <hi>My Father,</hi> Jer. 3. 4, 19. and Christ his disciples, Matth. 6. 6. <hi>Pray to thy Father; and thy Father which seeth in secret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42240:128"/>It is lawfull also to pray for thy self and for others in particular, so as thou forget not to pray for the whole brotherhood of Gods children. For as when we are commanded to <hi>do good to all, but especially to the houshold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. we are bound in particular to do good to those whose wants are known unto us: so when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray for all, we are bound in particular to pray for those whose wants are known unto us, and especially for such as do any wayes belong unto us or do desire to be commended in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God, Rom. 15. 30. Jam. 5. 14. Ephes. 5. 19. 1. Tim. 2. 1, 2.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, whereas we are taught to say, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">3. An use of comfort, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Church prayeth for us.</note> 
                              <hi>Give us,</hi> &amp;c. we may gather that this prayer and those that are made to the like effect are the common voyce of the Church and of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof praying mutually for one another: Which affordeth comfort to every one of us; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the sense of thy own wants &amp; weaknesse in calling upon God doth discourage thee, yet this ought to comfort thee, that this prayer and the like is the common prayer of the Church and of all the faithfull lifting up holy hands in every place, and praying for thee, if thou be a faithfull man, as well as for themselves. Now the prayer of the Church the Lord who is most gracious unto it is ready to heare, Deut. 4. 7. Isai. 65. 24. and being most faithfull is also willing to perform, Matth. 18. 20. Therefore this serveth, as for instruction, teaching us our duty in calling upon God for one another, so also for our comfort, assuring us that others in like
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42240:128"/>
sort pray for us, and that we are partakers of all the prayers of the whole Church and all the members thereof.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the hypocrisie of those is condemned who say with the Jews, John 8. 41. <hi>We have all one Father, God;</hi> but neither have faith in God, nor cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards men, nor any fellow-feeling of other mens wants, nor any true desire of their good; who say, <hi>Every man for himself, and God for us all.</hi>

                           <p>SEeing we have all one and the same Father, <note place="margin">Brotherly love required of all that pray.</note> Matth. 23. 9. therefore we ought to embrace one another with brotherly love, Ephes. 4. 3, 4, 6. For if God be the Father of us all, then are we all brethren. Which word of love ought to tie us with the bond of love, and break off all dissension, Gen. 13. 8. Acts 7. 26. Mal. 2. 10. And surely if we <hi>love not our brethren, the love of God is not in us: For he which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him that begetteth, loveth also those that are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> 1. Joh. 5. 1. And, <hi>Whosoever saith that he loveth God and hateth his brother, he is a liar,</hi> 1. John 4. 19, 20. Therefore where is not brotherly love there is not the love of God; where is not the love of God there is no faith; and who hath not faith is not the sonne of God. Therefore the Apostle saith, 1. John 3. 10. <hi>In this the children of God are known and the children of the devil; Whosoever doeth not righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.</hi> For if those that be the sonnes of God, as all the faithfull are (and we are to hope well of the most when we speak of particulars) be not our brethren,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42240:129"/>
and so we esteem them, then are not we the sonnes of God. For if he be our Father, then his children are our brethren; If the sonnes of God be not brethren to us, then are not we his children. If therefore we shall hate the children of God, how can we call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as our Father?</p>

                           <p>Now if we joyn these two together, of which we have spoken severally, That God is <hi>our Father,</hi> and therefore willing to heare us; and also <hi>in heaven,</hi> and therefore able to grant our desires; there will be no place left to diffidence and distrust, seeing God is both willing and able to grant our requests. Therefore we ought not to be distrustfully carefull, but with confidence and assurance that we shall be heard to <hi>make our requests known unto God,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. seeing, as Fulgentius saith, <hi>Deus multus est ad ignoscendum; in hoc multo nihil deest, in quo &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens misericordia &amp; omnipotentia misericors est:</hi> God is much in forgiving; in this much nothing is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, in whom is omnipotent mercy, and mercifull omnipotence.

                     <head>The division of the Petitions.</head>
                     <p>HItherto we have spoken of the preface. Now we are to proceed unto the petitions: Which are in number six; but yet in respect of the objects they may be distinguished into two sorts: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concern more properly and immediately the glory of God, without respect of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; or else our own good, and mediately the glory of God. For in the three former we say, <hi>Thy name, Thy kingdome, Thy will;</hi> in the three latter, <hi>us</hi> and <hi>our,</hi> &amp;c. Those that concern Gods glory are indeed most profitable for us; for with his own glory he joyneth the good and salvation of the elect: For if we glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the name of God, he will glorifie us: if we be subjects of the kingdome of grace, we shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriters of the kingdome of glory: if we do the will of God upon earth, we shall enter into the kingdome of heaven. But in propounding these pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions we are not to respect our own profit but the glory of God. Those which immediately concern our own good must also mediately respect the glory of God, whereunto if our good be not referred it is not good.</p>
                     <p>Those which immediately concern the glory<note place="margin">The order.</note> of God are set down in the first place. By which order our Saviour Christ teacheth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Gods glory before our own good, yea (if they should come in comparison) before our own salvation, Exod. 32. 32. because Gods glory is the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42240:134"/>
end, and therefore better then those things which are referred thereunto. For which cause not onely in order of petitions but also in the measure of our affections the glory of God must be preferred before our own good: <hi>Ideóque in tribus primis petitionibus oratio</hi>

                        <hi>est, cùm posteriores conjunctionibus colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur,</hi> And therefore in the three first petitions there is no copulative, when as the three latter are tied together with conjunction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>In the three first petitions we desire either the glory of God it self as the end, or else the means whereby his glory is procured: the end in the first petition; the means in the other two. For then is God glorified when his kingdome is advanced and his will fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>This order teacheth us that the main end of all our desires and actions should be the glory of God.</p>

                           </note> both God himself, and his attributes, which are himself, and also that whereby he is named. In the former sense the word <hi>name</hi> is often used to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie the persons named: as Acts 1. 15. and 4. 12. Revel. 3. 4. and 11. 13. So <hi>the name of God</hi> is put for God himself, Joel 2. 23. Deut. 28. 58. Hereupon the Hebrews use to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, <hi>His name is himself, and he is his name.</hi> And hereunto belong those places in which the <hi>name of God</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42240:134"/>
his attributes, which are nothing but himself: For the <hi>justice of God</hi> is the just God, the <hi>wisdome of God</hi> is the wise God, the <hi>mercy of God</hi> is the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, &amp;c. And these also are the <hi>name of God,</hi> as appeareth Exod. 33. 19. and 34. 5, 6, 7. For this is the name which he proclaimeth, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, strong, mercifull, and gracious, slow to anger, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodnesse and truth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the <hi>name of God</hi> signifieth that whereby God is named; whereby he is either renowned or known. The name of renown is his glory, which is (as it were) his good name: For so in great persons their good name is their glory and renown; and therefore they are said in the Scriptures to be <hi>men of name,</hi> Gen. 6. 4. In this sense the word <hi>name</hi> is used Gen. 11. 4. <hi>That we may get us a name:</hi> Gen. 12. 2. <hi>I will make thy name great:</hi> Jer. 13. 11. <hi>name, praise, and glory,</hi> Deut. 26. 19. The <hi>name of God</hi> therefore signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that whereby he is renowned and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be glorious, that is, his glory: So Exod. 9. 16. Psal. 8. 1.</p>
                        <p>Again, the <hi>name of God</hi> signifieth that whereby he is known; to wit, not onely his Titles, which more properly are called his name, and by which he is known, but also the Means whereby he is known. The titles are the names of the Godhead, of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and of the Persons. Of the Godhead; as <hi>Jehovah, Lord, God,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 3. 15. <hi>This is my name:</hi> Exod. 6. 3. Psal. 83. 18. Attributes, as Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Mercy, Justice, Majesty, &amp;c. Persons, as <hi>Father, Christ, Jesus, Saviour, holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The means whereby God is known are either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42240:135"/>
to the Church, or common unto all. Of the first sort are his word and religion therein prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The word of God is called his name, as Acts 9. 15. <hi>to carry my name,</hi> &amp;c. and 21. 13. 1. Tim. 6. 1. with Tit. 2. 5. Rom. 2. 24. Psal. 22. 22. Heb. 2. 12. So is the doctrine of religion and worship of God, Mich. 4. 5. <hi>We will walk in the name of our God.</hi> 1. Kings 5. 3, 5. <hi>to build a house unto the name of God.</hi> The common means are the works of God: The works of Creation, Psal. 19. 1. Rom. 1. 19, 20. In respect where of he is called the Creatour of heaven and earth. As also of Administration, as his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and judgements. In respect where of he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Governour and Judge of the world, Exod. 34. 7. All these doth the <hi>name of God</hi> signifie.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>sanctifie</hi> signifieth either to make holy, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<note place="margin">What is meant by <hi>sanctified</hi> or <hi>hallowed.</hi>
                           </note> &amp; declare holy. In the first sense things are said to be sanctified and (in themselves being not holy) to be made holy, which are set apart to holy uses; as the Sabbath, the Temple, Priests, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans consecrated and set apart to the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. In which sense the name of God, which is most holy, Psal. 111. 9. cannot be said to be sanctified.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To <hi>sanctifie</hi> is to acknowledge &amp; declare holy: as wisdome in the like phrase of speech is said to <hi>be justified,</hi> Luke 7. 35. and God to <hi>be magnified and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:</hi> And thus the name of God is sanctified either by us or by God himself, Num. 20. 12, 13. By us (I mean our selves and others, for whom also we pray) when, as the name of God is most holy and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, so we in our hearts acknowledge and that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42240:135"/>
in our tongues professe, in our deeds use it as most holy &amp; reverend. By God himself his name is sanctified, when either he manifesteth the glory of his mercy and justice, or else freeth it from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of men, especially when men neglect it, and removeth the impediments, Num. 20. 12, 13.</p>
                        <p>First, we pray that Gods name may be sanctified of us; that is, That God would vouchsafe unto us his grace, that we may <hi>give unto the Lord the honour due unto his name,</hi> Psal. 29. 2. that as his name is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, holy, glorious, and reverend, so <hi>his prayse</hi> may be <hi>unto the ends of the earth,</hi> Psal. 48. 11.</p>
                        <p>We sanctifie the name of God, which is most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reverend, and glorious, Deut. 28. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>. when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in our hearts, words, and deeds we do use it holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reverently.</p>
                        <p>But to speak more especially, according to the significations of the name of God: The names of God first signifie himself and his attributes, which are himself, which we desire in this prayer that we may sanctifie in our hearts, tongues, and lives. In our hearts we sanctifie God, as Peter exhorteth, 1. Epist. 3. 15. when as 1. we do acknowledge, and that effectually, That there is a God; That this God is such an one as he hath revealed himself in his word, most wise, most just, most mercifull, infinite in power, essence, and continuance, &amp;c. 2. When in our minds we think and conceive nothing of God but that which beseemeth his glorious majestie; that is, when we alwayes think and conceive of God most holily and reverently.</p>
                        <p>In our mouthes; 1. When we confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42240:136"/>
and professe God and his attributes, &amp;c. Rom. 10. 10. 2. When we speak of God and his attributes holily and everently.</p>
                        <p>In our lives; when the knowledge of God and his attributes is effectuall to bring forth in us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation answerable thereunto. Knowest thou there is a God? worship him. That he is a Spirit? worship him in spirit and truth. That he is just? fear him. That he is mercifull? love him. That he is omnipresent? behave thy self as in his presence. That he is omnisufficient? repose thy trust in him. That he is omniscient and <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>THirdly, the <hi>name of God</hi> doth signifie his titles; the titles, I say, of the Deity, Attributes, and Persons. This name of God is sanctified, when, as it is holy and reverend, so it is used of us. It is used of us either by taking it into our mouthes, or by taking it upon us. We sanctifie it in our mouthes,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42240:138"/>
and so in our writings, when as we make a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> holy and reverent mention of the titles of God. Which we do when we mention them in a serious matter, after a reverent manner, to a holy end. For the most holy and dreadfull name of the Lord our God Deut. 28. 58. must not be used to trifles and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous matters: neither may we lightly take up the most reverend name of God, which we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take into our mouthes: neither must the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of God be mentioned but to his glory either mediately or immediately. And hereunto we are to referre two sorts of usurpation of Gods name and titles, by Blessing and Swearing aright.</p>
                        <p>Blessing is either of God or man. The blessing of God is the praysing of God; of which we have spoken: Example Rom. 9. 5. and 1. 25. 2. Cor. 11. 31. Blessing of men in the name of God, which the Scripture calleth <hi>the putting of Gods name upon them,</hi> Num. 6. 27. is a duty to be performed by all, to all, even unto enemies, Rom. 12. 14. Matth. 5. 44. (whereunto referre salutation) but especially to be performed by superiours, Hos. 7. 7. to their inferiours: in the commonwealth by Princes and Magistrates; David, 2. Sam. 6. 18. Solomon, 1. Kings 8. 55. In the Church, Num. 6. 23, 24, 25. Melchisedec, Gen. 14. 19. In the family by parents: unto which the Lord giveth great force, &amp;c. By swearing we make a holy and reverent mention of the name of God, whenas we swear <hi>in truth, judgement, and righteousnesse,</hi> Jer. 4. 2, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>We take upon us the name of God when his name is called upon in us, as Gen. 48. 16..<hi>i.</hi> when we call
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42240:138"/>
our selves by his name, and professe our selves to be the children of God, Isai. 43. 6, 7. which began to be done in the time of Seth after the birth of Enosh, Gen. 4. 26. &amp; 6. 2. In these last times those of the Church of God do invocate the name of Christ, Acts 9. 14, 21. 1. Cor. 1. 2. and are called by his name, <hi>Christians,</hi> Acts 11. 26. and are baptized into his name.</p>
                        <p>Thus we sanctifie the name of Christ when as we <hi>walk worthy our calling whereby we are called,</hi> Ephes. 4. 1. and <hi>adorn the doctrine of Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in all things, departing from in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This preaching of the word is also called <hi>the arm of God,</hi> Isa. 53. 1. whereby <hi>he pulleth men out of darknesse into light, and out of the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26. 18. But especially the Lord ruleth in our hearts by his Spirit, drawing us unto his Sonne, bending and bowing us to the obedience of his word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening our minds, and sanctifying our hearts, and leading us into all truth, &amp;c. mortifying sinne and corruption in us, and renewing us unto holinesse

of life. The end of this kingdome is the kingdome of glory. And therefore Christ saith to his Church, Luke 12. 32. <hi>Fear not little flock,</hi> &amp;c. For therefore doth he pull us out of the kingdome of darknesse, and bring us into the kingdome of grace, that by faith we may <hi>have remission of sinnes and inheritance among them that are sanctified,</hi> Acts 26. 18. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the certainty hereof it is said that those <hi>that believe have everlasting life,</hi> John 5. 24. and <hi>are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from death unto life:</hi> that those <hi>whom God hath justified he hath also glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30.</p>
                     <p>The kingdome of glory in respect of us is the blessed estate of the godly in heaven, <hi>when as God shall be all in all,</hi> 1.

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>whom the Father draweth.</hi> Wherein appeareth the undeserved mercy of God in preventing us, in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was lost, in being found of them that sought him not, in coming to them that neither could nor would (through their own default) come unto him.

                        </p>
                        <p>Now let us see how this kingdome cometh, and<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the coming of Christsking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> what it is which here we ask. Of the coming of this kingdome there be three degrees: The first is the pulling and drawing us out of the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and power of darknesse unto God; which is our effectuall calling, whereby we are brought from the spirituall bondage of sinne and Satan into <hi>the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the sonnes of God,</hi> and are made <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens of the Saints, &amp;</hi> domestici Dei, <hi>of the houshold of God,</hi> Ephes. 2. 19. And this calling is wrought by this means. First, to us sleeping in our sinnes the word of God is sent to rouse us, the law shewing us our sinnes and the punishments due for them, the Gospel promising salvation upon the condition of faith and repentance. Secondly, the spirit of God concurring with the word inlighteneth our minds to understand the word of God, inclineth our minds to attend thereunto, mollifieth our hard and stony hearts in the sight and sense of sinnes; and then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling under the burden of them with wearinesse, he stirreth up in us a hunger and thirst after the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ and reconciliation with God, and teacheth us to pray with sighs which cannot be expressed.</p>

                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42240:147"/>Secondly, when the Spirit of God applieth the merits and efficacy of Christs death and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Thirdly, when Christ our King ruleth and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our hearts by his word and Spirit, <hi>teaching us to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, justly and holily in this pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>And this we desire not onely for our selves, but also for the whole company of the elect, That the Lord would from all sorts gather his Church, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the world, engraffing them into his Son, justifying them by faith, and sanctifying them by his Spirit; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>And because the Church of God is, as we have said, the kingdome of God, we desire not onely that God would gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>II. Now because this kingdome cometh by means, we are also to pray for them. The means are either outward or inward. The outward are<note place="margin">1.

The preaching of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the Gospel of the kingdome of God, is such a notable means of the coming of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that it is called <hi>the kingdome of God.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there be three degrees of this coming, our Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Justification, and Sanctification; every one of them ordinarily is wrought by the preaching of the word. We are called outwardly by the Gospel; We <hi>are justified by faith: faith cometh by hearing</hi> of the word, Rom. 10. 17. We are <hi>sanctified by the word of truth;</hi> by the preaching of the word we are <hi>begotten unto God.</hi> Therefore we are to pray that <hi>the word of God may have a free passage and be glorified,</hi> 2. Thess. 3. 1. and also that the preaching of the word and Gospel be not taken from us, or, as Matth. 21. 43. that the <hi>kingdome of God be not taken from us,</hi> but continued to us and our posterity. And because there cannot be preaching of the word except there be preachers, Rom. 10. 14. we are taught to pray, Matth. 9. 38. <hi>that God would send forth labourers into</hi>
                           <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42240:148"/>

                           <hi>a doore of the word, that they may speak the mysterie of Christ,</hi> Col. 4. 3. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there cannot be ordinarily learned guides and scribes taught unto the kingdome of God, except they be first trained up in good literature, we are to pray also for the Universities and schools of the prophets, which are the seminaries and seed-plots of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The second outward means is the government of<note place="margin">The second outward means.</note> Christ by his servants both in the Church and Commonwealth. In the Church, by the Ministers and governours exercising in the name of Christ admonition, suspension, excommunication. For whom we are to pray, That they may execute their offices according to the will of God, as shall most serve for the advancement of the spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, and defacing of the kingdome of sin and Satan; That the people submit themselves to the censures of the Church, and be reclaimed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. In the Commonwealth, by Magistrates, who are <hi>Gods ministers</hi> also, &amp;c. Rom. 13. whom God hath advanced that they might be <hi>nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers to the Church,</hi> Isai. 49. 13. For whom also we are to pray, 1. Tim. 2. 2. That after the example of David, Josias, Ezechias, they may reform religion, defend the truth &amp; profession of it, suppresse idolatry and superstition, punish sinne, &amp;c. That the subjects may live in all obedience unto them as unto the ordinance of the Lord.</p>

For it is the Spirit of God which maketh the outward means effectuall, and without which neither the preaching of the word nor the other means of government will any whit prevail, 1. Cor. 3. 7. Deut. 29. 4. It is the Spirit of God who in the ministery of the word knocketh at the doore of our hearts, and inlighteneth our minds to understand it: John 16. 13. <hi>he leadeth us into all truth;</hi> 1. John 2. 20, 27. <hi>he teacheth us;</hi> he <hi>openeth our hearts to listen unto it,</hi> as he did the heart of Lydia, Acts 16. 14. he maketh the word <hi>the savour of life unto life.</hi> For without the Spirit the word is <hi>a dead letter,</hi> the Scripture <hi>a seale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Isai. 11. 2.</p>
                        <p>In this petition therefore we desire that the Lord would grant us his Spirit (which he hath promised,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42240:149"/>
Luke 11. 13.) and that by this Spirit he would rule and reigne in us, and quicken us, that being animated thereby we may behave our selves as members of Christ, &amp;c. ruled and guided by his sanctifying Spirit.</p>

                        <p>But these were spirituall enemies. And we are not onely to pray against them, but also against the outward enemies of the Church, which is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: And these are either open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies, as the Turks and Infidels (the great Turk being that <gap reason="foreign">

For notwithstanding all their glorious profession, that they and they alone are the Church of God, yet these are they that say, <hi>We will</hi>

For whose law reigneth amongst them? Gods, or their own? The breach of whose law more severely punished? To whose government are they subject? Gods, or their own? What doctrine do they teach? the word of God, or the inventions of men? The word of God, which is his sceptre; do they not suppresse this light of mens souls? do they not hide it from the people under a strange language, as it were under a bushel? do they follow the Lambe that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the mark of the beast, and persecute with fire and sword all true professours? &amp;c. Well, against these enemies, both secret and open, covert and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that is, Gog and Magog, Revel. 20. we are taught to pray, that being subdued, (that is, either converted or subverted) the Church and kingdome of God may be advanced.</p>
                        <p>Besides these enemies there are also other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the kingdome of God opposite to the outward means. As to the preaching of the word, 1. The insufficiency of Ministers not able to teach; 2. Their negligence and idlenesse; 3. Their cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse non-residencie, and covetous multiplying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices with cure; 4. The want of maintenance by

impropriations and corruption of Patrones. All these we are to pray that they may be removed, and a free passage to his word granted.</p>
                        <p>Impediments opposite to government, are either no government but confusion in the Church and Commonweal; or else corrupt government, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers hindring rather then promoting the kingdome of Christ.</p>
                        <p>We see then what we desire when we pray that <hi>the kingdome of grace may come: viz.</hi> That where it is not it may be erected, and where it is it may be continued and enlarged; That he would blesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and protect his Church: That the Lord would rule and reigne in us by his word and Spirit: That he would effectually call those which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his election are not called: That he would justifie us by faith, sanctifie us by the holy Ghost, and make us and all his meet to be partakers with the Saints in light: That we may more and more feel in our selves the fruits of this kingdome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost: and to this end, That he would give a free passage to his word, and send faithfull labourers into his harvest, blessing them and their ministery, and also the seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots thereof: That he would establish an holy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church and Commonwealth, and blesse the governours, &amp;c.

                           <p>Now let us come to the uses. First, our need which we have to make this prayer, by reason of our defection from God in our first parents, and our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne derived from them. For before man fell from God by sinne, he was wholly subject to the kingdome of God, and conformable to his will in all righteousnesse and holinesse; his mind inlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knowledge, endued with wisdome, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science pure, his will holy and just, his affections or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, the inferiour powers of his soul subordinate to the superiour, and all to God, the members of the body instruments of holinesse unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But when as man fell from God by sinne, he became the subject of Satan, his mind darkened with ignorance &amp; folly in spirituall things, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science impure, his will not onely unjust but also unable to will that which is good, his affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, the inferiour faculties rebelling against the superiour, the members of the body instruments of sinne unto iniquity. We therefore that are bred and born in this state of disobedience, have great need to pray that the Lord would rule in us, that we may <hi>be renewed according to the image of God in holinesse and righteousnesse.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42240:152"/>2. Our spirituall servitude and bondage under sinne and Satan: by reason whereof we are not able to come unto God, but must desire that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may come unto us. When we ceased to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our selves to God, we became the subjects of Satan; when we left to be the servants of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we became the servants of sinne; when we left the image of God, we got the image of the devil. Naturally we are wholly carried away by the devil as captives to the obedience of his will, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sinne, and pleasing our selves therein; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves free, as John 8. being most bond: and therefore if we did feel the power of sinne and Satan reigning in us, we would with great fervency and vehemency of affection desire that the Lord would pull us out of this <hi>power of darknesse, and translate us into the kingdome of his Sonne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Our unthankfulnesse unto God that hath <hi>brought us out of this bondage into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the sonnes of God;</hi> especially considering he gave himself for us to this end, Luke 1. 74. Tit. 2. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 24. We had need therefore to pray that he would rule in us by his word and Spirit: For professing our selves to be redeemed by Christ, we behave our selves (many of us) as if we still were in the bondage of sinne: For, <hi>whom we obey, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants we are.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Our neglect and contempt of the word.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Our resisting the good motions of his Spirit, and striving against the same: our contristation or making heavy the Spirit of God.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The remnants of the kingdome of darknesse
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42240:152"/>
or rather our heaps of sinnes and corruptions; our continuall lusts and concupiscences.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Our yielding to the temptations of Satan; our worldly minds following after pleasure, profit, or preferment; our not crucifying of the flesh, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther walking therein.</p>
                           <p>And as we are to ask good things for others, so must we also bewail their wants. As when we see men plunged in sinne, and carried away headlong to their perdition, as the swine were into the sea, we ought to lament their desperate estate, Psal. 119. 136, 158. Ezech. 9. 4. We are to bewail all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of the kingdome of Christ, disorder in the Church, confusion in the Commonweal, the want of the word, and causes thereof. Our hearts ought to yern within us, as our Saviours did, Matth. 9. 36. when we see a people living in ignorance and sinne, without means &amp; without God in this world: and therefore for the supply of all these wants, we are in sense thereof to pray fervently, <hi>Let thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. In respect of the kingdome of power, That we acknowledge the Lord to be our absolute King: That we submit our selves to his providence: That we rest contented and well pleased with whatsoever he doth towards us, who doth all things according to the counsel of his will.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In respect of the kingdome of grace, we ought to have an earnest desire of the advancement of Gods kingdome, and zeal of the Churches good; and more particularly, that the Lord would reigne

in us by his word and Spirit. And unto this desire must be joyned an holy endeavour, first in order and first in degree to seek the kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, that is, that the Lord would rule in us by his word and Spirit, and that we may shew our subjection by bringing forth the fruits of righteousnesse.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A carefull using of the means which God hath appointed to advance his kingdome, &amp; to work our salvation; to heare the word with submission, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, attention, good conscience, and desire to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticeit; to nourish the good motions of the Spirit, yielding our selves to be drawn thereby.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Thankfulnesse to God that he hath made us subjects of his kingdome, Col. 1. 12. Mark 11. 10. and care to behave our selves as subjects of this kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Diligent endeavour in our severall places and callings to advance and further the kingdome of Christ. Princes and Magistrates must be nursing-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and nursing-mothers of the Church, zealous by all good means to advance the kingdome of Christ, and to remove the impediments thereof, and to set themselves against the kingdome of darknesse, of sinne, Satan, and Antichrist; to root out all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and idolatry, and the relicks thereof; to reform religion where it is corrupt; to be defenders of the faith; to take order that there may be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all places provided for, and see them discharge their duties; to punish sinners, and reward the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. If we be Ministers, we are by preaching of the word in season and out of season, to do our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42240:153"/>
to win men unto the Lord, &amp;c. If private men, we must live in obedience to superiours in Church and Commonwealth, as to the ordinance of the Lord, our King ruling us by them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we are, our dutie is to labour by all means, 1. that we our selves may become subjects of the kingdome of grace, and 2. that by all good means we may win others unto the Lord.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. To oppose our selves against the enemies of the Church both spirituall and temporall; to resist Satan and his temptations; to be wained from the world, and to mind heavenly things; to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit; to come out of Babylon into the Church of God, to keep us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; to oppose our selves against Antichrist and his adherents, as being enemies of the kingdome of Christ.</p>
                           <p>But here the hypocrisie of very many is detected,<note place="margin">The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny detected.</note> who ask this petition with their mouthes but desire it not with their hearts: As first in respect of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall kingdome, those that will not submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the providence of God, but desire rather that they were freed from all subjection unto God, they abuse God in making their prayer and pray against themselves, that God would advance his kingdome, and make his enemies his footstool, or break them with his iron sceptre like a potters ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in regard of the kingdome of grace; first, those that will not have Christ to reigne over them by his word and spirit, but cast off his yoke of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Luke 19. 14. Psal. 2. 3. sonnes of Belial:
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42240:154"/>
such mock God when they say this prayer.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Those who living in ignorance and sinne, and consequently in spirituall bondage, please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as if they were free, John 8. 33. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not truly desire that Gods kingdome may come, because they have no sense of their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Those that seek not the kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, but set themselves to seek their own carnall and worldly desires.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Those magistrates, ministers, people, that seek not the advancement of Christs kingdome in themselves, contemning the word, quenching the spirit, nor yet in others. As for those Magistrates who in stead of cherishing the Church do persecute it, in stead of advancing Gods kingdome do deface it, erecting superstition and idolatry, suppressing vertue, advancing vice; or those Ministers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the people of the food of their souls, and like dry nurses hunger-starve them; or those men whosoever that labour to withdraw men from alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance unto God: all those oppose themselves to the kingdome of grace; and therefore being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in making this prayer do ask their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. For our Saviour Christ sheweth himself to be a King as well in subduing his enemies as in preserving his subjects, Psal. 110. 1. Psal. 2. 6.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Those that follow the temptations of the devil, the desires of the world, and lusts of the flesh, and please themselves in so doing, they are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, but are <hi>enemies to his crosse,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. and souldiers in Satans camp.</p>

For which cause it is called the <hi>time of refreshing,</hi> Acts 3. 19. And therefore our Saviour Christ, Luke 21. 28. biddeth the faithfull <hi>to lift up their heads,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>because the day of their</hi> full <hi>redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> both body and soul <hi>draweth near.</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, we must expect with earnest desire, 1. eternall life, 2. the coming of Christ, Tit. 2. 13. For how can a man faithfully expect and certainly look for happinesse who doth not also earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it? therefore the Apostle saith, that <hi>we who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, do sigh within our selves, expecting the adoption</hi> (that is, the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance whereunto we are adopted) <hi>and the redemption of our body</hi> at the second coming of Christ, Rom. 8. 23.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we are with desire to expect the second<note place="margin">2. of Christs coming.</note> coming of Christ, <hi>looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God,</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 12. But there are many who with Balaam desire salvation, but how few that desire the second coming of Christ? Yet
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42240:156"/>
this is made a note of a true Christian, to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> it, 2. Tim. 4. 8. For, as Th. Aquinas saith, <hi>Qui diligit amicum cum desiderio exspectat eum,</hi> He that loveth his friend expecteth him with longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. And also they who believe that Christ is their Saviour, they will also desire his coming. And as the <hi>creature</hi> earnestly waiteth for that time which Acts 3. 21. is called <hi>the time of the restitution of all things,</hi> which now are <hi>subject to vanity,</hi> Rom. 8. 20. for then the heaven &amp; earth shall be <hi>renewed,</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 13. so we also, who have <hi>the first-fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, sigh within our selves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our bodies,</hi> Rom. 8. 23. Then is the time of Christs marriage with his Church, and of our conformation with him in glory, 1. John 3. 2. <hi>For when he shall appear, we shall be like unto him.</hi> If then the second coming of Christ shall be a <hi>day of refreshing,</hi> of <hi>full redemption,</hi> of Christs marriage with his Church; then those who hope to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of these benefits, &amp; are espoused unto Christ by faith, will with as earnest desire expect his second coming as the loving bride doth the marriage-day. Wherefore, as it is Revel. 22. 17. <hi>the Spirit and the bride say, Come: and let him that heareth say, Come.</hi> and v. 20. <hi>Come, Lord Jesu, come quickly.</hi> And so the Lord hath taught us here to pray. And therefore if we will pray unto the Lord in truth, we must labour to attein unto this assurance of faith; that being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of Gods everlasting love towards us in Christ, we may earnestly desire the Lord, that an end being put to these evil dayes, he would hasten the coming of Christ. Neither let us think that we have well

profited in the school of Christ untill we do with desire expect his coming.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, we must expect with patience. For he<note place="margin">III. With patience.</note> that is saved in hope (as all the faithfull are in this life) expecteth with patience that which he hopeth for: For hope is not of that which is seen. <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> saith the Apostle, Rom. 8. 25. <hi>we hope for that which we see not, we do by patience expect it.</hi> And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of this coming of Christ to our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we <hi>had need of patience,</hi> Heb. 10. 36. For, as Peter hath prophesied of these last dayes, there are come <hi>mockers, walking after their lusts, who say, Where is the promise of his coming?</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 4. but the holy Ghost answereth, Heb. 10. 37. <hi>Yet a very little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved,</hi> saith the Apostle Peter, 2. Epist. 3. 8, 9. <hi>be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeares as one day. The Lord is not slack as concerning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as some men account slacknesse, but is patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and would have none to perish, but would have all men come to repentance, viz.</hi> that the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the elect may be fulfilled. Therefore, as Isaiah saith, <hi>Qui crediderit nè festinet,</hi> Let not him that believeth make haste. For seeing the Lord in patience towards us deferreth his coming and the fulfilling of his promise, we ought with patience to expect it. <hi>Sustine ipsum,</hi> saith Augustine, <hi>qui</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42240:157"/>
with vigilancie, <hi>having our loyns girt and our lights burning,</hi> like the vigilant servants, Luke 12. 35, 36, 37, 40. and the wise virgins, Matth. 25: not like the ungodly servant, <hi>who saith in his heart, My master deferreth his coming,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 12. 45. nor the foolish virgins, who sleeping in securitie, and contenting themselves with the shining lamp of an outward profession, at the coming of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom were shut out.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. The third duty. So to live in this expectation<note place="margin">3.

For those that have this assured expectation, contemne all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of the world as mere vanity in respect of the glory that shall be revealed, and therefore are <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world, and mind heavenly things,</hi> &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this expectation swalloweth up the sense of all temporall afflictions, as experience hath taught us in the martyrs: For <hi>the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which shall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8. 18. Therefore, as the Apostle exhorteth Heb. 12. 1, 2. <hi>let us, having such a cloud of martyrs, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience runne the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. Jacob for the promised reward, <hi>viz.</hi> the marriage of Rachel, thought his seven yeares trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome service to be but easie and short: how much more ought we chearfully to bear all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42240:157"/>
of this life as light and momentany, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that <hi>super excellent weight of glory?</hi> And for this cause also we are to comfort our selves in all distresses in the expectation of a better life.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. We must <hi>walk worthy of God who hath called</hi>

For <hi>every one that</hi> indeed <hi>hath this hope,</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he shall be like the Sonne of God) <hi>purifieth himself as he is pure,</hi> that he may be in some measure like to him in grace in this present world, as he hopeth to be like him in glory in the life to come. And let us remember that if we have hope for the end, we must be carefull of the means, as being the necessary forerunners of glorification, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, sanctification. And in this expectation must the duties of <hi>piety, justice</hi> and <hi>sobriety</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Tit. 2. 13.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. We must so live as if we were alwayes ready<note place="margin">5. We must so live as ready to meet Christ.</note> to meet Christ Jesus in the clouds; and to this end set before us continually Christ sitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we may alwayes labour to be such as then we desire to appear, that we <hi>depart not from Christ ashamed,</hi> 1. John 2. 28. And surely what can be more forcible to draw men to repentance and to stirre them up to vigilancie then the meditation of the judgement to come, &amp; a continuall expectation of Christ coming in the clouds? <hi>Recordare novissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> Remember thy end, saith he, Ecclus 7. 36. <hi>and thou shalt not sinne.</hi> For where this cogitation is once settled, that we shall appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat of Christ, it will not suffer a man to be
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42240:158"/>
in quiet untill he be settled in such a state as that he may with boldnesse appear before the Judge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Christ to judgement is used as a forcible argument to draw us to repentance, Acts 17. 30. 2. Pet. 3. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. These things if we do, we shall with chearfulnesse expect the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and when he cometh <hi>we shall appear with boldnesse,</hi> 1. John 2. 28. but otherwise with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Felix we shall tremble at the very mentioning of judgement, so farre shall we be from truly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and at the sight thereof <hi>we shall depart from Christ ashamed, desiring the mountains to fall upon us,</hi> Revel. 6. 16. Wherefore to conclude; If we will truly make this petition in our daily prayers, we must every day so behave our selves as if Christ were presently to come to judgement. And in this behalf let us imitate S. Hierome. <hi>So oft,</hi>

Therefore we cannot hope that Christ his coming will be to our everlasting salvation, if we continue in our sinnes; neither can we truly and earnestly desire his coming, except we have that hope; neither can we truly make this prayer, except we have this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned desire. 3. Those that are wedded to the world, and are so farre from desiring the hastening of Christs coming that they do not onely desire to live here alwayes but also so behave themselves as if they meant alwayes to abide here, placing their paradise upon the earth, and not caring for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</p>

And of this will doth our Saviour speak.</p>
                        <p>This in generall is whatsoever the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us either in the Law or Gospel: But more specially there are some branches thereof recorded in the word of God. As, it is the will of God that so many as shall be saved, being <hi>adulti,</hi> come to age, shall <hi>come unto knowledge of his truth,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 4. that a sinner should <hi>convert unto him,</hi> Ezech. 33. 11. that we should <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> 1. John 3. 23. that we should <hi>be thankfull</hi> unto him for his mercies, 1.

                        <p>Unto this will of God are opposed the slesh, which is enmity against God, the desires of the world, the will of Satan, which is sinne, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is an enemie to the performance of this will. And therefore as we are taught to pray that Gods will may be done, so also that these things which be contrary and are impediments may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thy will:</hi> which is not onely just, but also the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42240:161"/>
rule of all justice: Not our will, nor the will of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or of the world. For here we are taught to pray, that our words and our lives may be framed according to the will of God, which is the rule of justice; and that we may have grace to deny our selves and our own will, renounce the desires of the world, &amp; resist the will of the devil; that he would create new hearts in us, and establish us by his free Spirit; that we may will and desire such things as are acceptable unto him. And surely if our Saviour Christ, whose will was pure, said, <hi>Not my will but thine be done,</hi> how much more ought we so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fiat,</hi> be done.] But here it may be demanded,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Gods will be alwayes done.</note> Whether the will of the Lord be alwayes perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not: and if it be, to what end serveth this prayer? and if not, how can that be verified, Isai. 46. 10. <hi>Consilium meum stabit, &amp; omnem voluntatem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am faciam,</hi> My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my will?</p>
                        <p>The <hi>will of God</hi> is diversly taken in the scriptures:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> For sometime it signifieth the decree of God, whereby he willeth simply and absolutely: Which is called <hi>voluntas Absoluta, Beneplaciti, Consequens, Efficax &amp; Invicta,</hi> the Absolute will, of his Good pleasure, Consequent, Effectuall, and Unresistable. This will of God is alwayes performed, Psal. 115. 3. <hi>Quaecunque vult facit,</hi> he doth whatsoever he will: and 135. 6. Isai. 46. 10. <hi>Omnis mea voluntas fiet,</hi> All my will shall be done. Neither is any thing able <hi>to resist this will,</hi> Isai. 14. 26, 27. Rom. 9. 19. Which also is proved by his omnipotencie. And therefore
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42240:162"/>
we may truly say that <hi>voluntas Dei est omnium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum necessitas,</hi> the will of God is the necessity of all things; and that in respect hereof all things come to passe necessarily, howsoever in respect of secondary causes some things are necessary and some contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. And this will is so effectuall and invincible that whatsoever happeneth cometh to passe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God, <hi>who worketh all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the counsel of his will,</hi> Ephes. 1. 11. yea, the very enemies of God when they do most oppose themselves against the will of God, do unwittingly perform it, Acts 4. 28. But hence arise two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If that which the wicked do happen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">How can the wicked sin, seeing they do Gods will?</note> to the will of God, how can they be said to sinne?</p>
                        <p>Sinne is not the transgression of the secret and<note place="margin">Answ.</note> hidden will of God, which cannot be hindred, but of the revealed will of God, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a rule to square our actions by: and therefore sinne is called <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>the transgression of the law: Ad legem &amp; testimonium,</hi> To the law and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If all things come to passe as God hath willed<note place="margin">How sinne is by Gods decree.</note> and decreed, then sinne also: and how then is not God the authour of sinne?</p>
                        <p>Some things God hath decreed to do; some<note place="margin">Answ.</note> things he hath decreed to suffer to be done: Of those things which he hath decreed to do, his will is the efficient cause; as of his creatures, and all good things: Of those things which he hath onely decreed should be effected by such and such causes, his
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42240:162"/>
will is not the cause, as namely sinne. And howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sin is evil, yet it is good that sinne should be, for the manifestation of the glory both of the mercy of God and also of his justice: and therefore though the Lord doth not <hi>velle peccatum per se,</hi> will sinne properly by it self, yet he doth will it <hi>per accidens,</hi> by accident, as it is referred to good ends. Again, sinne may be considered as it is <hi>malum culpae</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum poenae,</hi> an evil of fault or evil of punishment. Sinne as it is a punishment is a work of justice in him that punisheth: for it is just that he that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the evil of fault, should suffer <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum poenae,</hi> the evil of punishment: as it is therefore a punishment, <hi>i.</hi> a work of justice and not sin, it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God the authour of all good. In sin as it is <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum culpae,</hi> the evil of fault, three things do concurre: <hi>actus, macula, &amp; reatus,</hi> the act, stain, &amp; guilt. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>materiale peccati,</hi> the matter of sin: the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>formale peccati,</hi> the form of sin: <hi>reatus est obligatio ad poenam,</hi> the guilt is the obligation to punishment; the which is just as the punishment it self. The action as it is an action severed from the corruption is good: <hi>Omne ens quatenus ens est bonum,</hi> Every being as it is a being is good: and God is the authour of it; for <hi>in him we live and move and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 28. But of the corruption wherewith the action is stained God is not the cause. For unto every action concurreth the first cause and some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cause depending from him, as being the instrument of the first: The which instrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad (as many times it is) there is a double work in the action: one of the first cause, good;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42240:163"/>
the other of the instrument, evil. God then is the cause of the action, but not of the corruption; but yet useth, ordereth, disposeth the corruption of the instrument for the execution of his own good work. When the Lord gave his Sonne to death, he used Judas as his instrument. The action is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of Christ: which as it came from God, was a most glorious work, John 3. 16. Rom. 8. 32. But <hi>quem Deus tradidit Judas prodidit,</hi> whom God delivered Judas betrayed. When God will chastise his servant, he useth some wicked man as his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to afflict him: This affliction, as it cometh from God, is <hi>castigatio,</hi> a chastisement: but, as from the instrument, <hi>persecutio, rapina, &amp;c.</hi> persecution, rapine, &amp;c. A man that rideth on a lame horse is the cause why he goeth, but not why he halteth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Deus non est autor ejus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>ujus est ultor,</hi> God is not the authour of that of which he is the punisher and revenger.</p>
                        <p>Thus we see that howsoever God doth volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily permit sinne, and also useth, ordereth, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the same to good ends (for such is his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that he knoweth how to use that well which is evil) yet he cannot be said properly to will sinne, which he hateth; or to be the authour of it, which he revengeth. For this priviledge Gods will hath, Whatsoever it willeth it is therefore good: but sinne as it is sinne cannot be good.</p>
                        <p>But to return to my purpose: That this absolute<note place="margin">Gods secret and absolute will is not here meant.</note> will of God be performed we need not to pray, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Secondly therefore, the will of God which he requireth to be done of his creatures, <hi>quatenus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit vel prohibet,</hi> so farre forth as he commandeth or forbiddeth, which is therefore called <hi>voluntas Revelata, Conditionalis, Signi, Antecedens, Inefficax, non quatenus promittit vel minatur absque conditione, est decreti revelatio,</hi> the Revealed will, Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, of the Signe, Antecedent, Inefficacious, not as he promiseth or threatneth, and without condition, is the revelation of the decree.</p>

That in our prayers, especially for temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we do humbly and willingly submit our selves to his will, and wholly resigne over our selves to his good pleasure, saying with our Saviour Christ, <hi>Not my will,</hi> &amp;c. because we ought to be assured, that as for his wisdome he knoweth what is best for us, so also for his fatherly love he is most ready to grant good things unto us, Matth. 7. 11. Rom. 8. 32. and therefore if he deny our requests, that the deniall is better then the grant. And we are to remember that here we pray not that God would alter his will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ours; but contrariwise, that our will may be conformable unto his.</p>

                           <p>As we pray that we may do Gods will on earth as the angels do it in heaven, so must we have a true desire, an unfeigned care, and an upright endeavour in our selves to perform holy obedience to Gods will. Otherwise how can we perswade our selves

                           <p>And therefore, as it is the duty of every one to make this prayer, so none of us ought to think our selves exempted from doing the will of God: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we think it sufficient in words to professe God, and in prayer to crave good things of him, unlesse we be carefull in our lives to do his will. <hi>Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 7. 21. yea those that make a profession of religion and obedience, as though they would perform obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will, and yet do it not, are many times further from salvation then open sinners: as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the parable of the two sonnes, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, Matth. 21. 28, 29, 30. Neither may we think that we shall obtein our prayers, unlesse we be desirous to perform Gods will. For if we will not do his will, why should we think that he will do ours? Prov. 28. 9. John 9. 31. <hi>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper of God and doth his will, him he heareth. If we ask any thing,</hi> saith S. John, 1. Epist. 3. 22. <hi>we receive it from him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are acceptable in his sight.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be desirous and carefull to obey Gods will, we need not doubt, having these testimonies of a true faith, but that both we and our prayers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God. For our selves, our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that those <hi>be his brothers and sisters that do the will of his Father that is in heaven,</hi> Matth. 12. 50. And the holy Ghost giveth this testimony unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42240:167"/>
that <hi>he was a man according to Gods own heart, who would do all his will,</hi> Acts 13. 22. And elsewhere the Scriptures ascribe blessednesse to those that do the will of God, Luke 11. 28. For our prayers; John 15. 7. Psal. 34. 15, 17. And as we are to do the will of God in generall, so more especially those branches of his will which after a more speciall manner are called his will. His will is, if we would be saved, we should come to the <hi>knowledge of his truth,</hi> and not live in ignorance, 1. Tim. 2. 4. that we should <hi>turn unto him,</hi> and not go on in our sinnes, Ezek. 33. 11. that we should <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> 1.

                     <head>The fourth Petition.</head>
                     <p>HItherto we have spoken of those petitions which immediately concern the glory of God. Now we are to come unto those which more<note place="margin">How things apperteining to our own good are to be asked.</note> nearly appertein unto our good: Howbeit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately also they are referred to Gods glory, which must be the main end of all our desires: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are to ask for our selves we are to desire no otherwise but as it is subordinate to Gods glory. Spirituall graces and salvation we are to desire for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy in our salvation. And because a Christian man is bound to believe that the Lord harh ordained him to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore salvation and those spirituall graces which are necessary thereunto, may be asked abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as being subordinate to Gods glory, with which he joyneth the salvation of the chosen. Temporall benefits are to be asked conditionally, so farre forth as they serve for Gods glory and our spirituall good. Gods glory is to be sought for even in our eating and drinking, and whatsoever we do, 1. Cor. 10. 31. Nay, our life it self is no otherwise to be desired then it is referred to Gods glory, Psal. 80. 19. <hi>Preserve, O Lord, our life, and we will call upon thy name.</hi> Psal. 119. 175. <hi>Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee.</hi> Isai. 38. 18, 19. Psal. 6. 5. and 30. 9. and 50. 15. <hi>Sufficientia vitae,</hi> saith Augustine, <hi>rectè appetitur, non propter seipsam quidem, sed ut eam habentes commodiùs Deo serviamus:</hi> Sufficiencie for life is rightly desired, not for it self, but that we may more commodiously serve God.</p>
                     <p>Now these petitions are of two sorts: For in them
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42240:170"/>
we ask either temporall benefits concerning the body for the maintenance of this life present, or spirituall blessings in heavenly things concerning the soul for the obteining of a better life: Of both which we have a promise 1. Tim. 4. 8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to pray for both.</p>
                     <p>The prayer for temporall blessings is conteined in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>But first let us consider the order of the petition in respect both of those which go before and also which follow. In respect of the antecedents our Saviour speaketh, Matth. 6. 33. <hi>First seek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God</hi> (which is that which we desire in the second petition) <hi>and his righteousnesse</hi> (which we desire in the third) <hi>and then all these things</hi> which we begge in the fourth <hi>shall be cast unto us.</hi> Therefore preposterous is their care and study who first la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for temporall benefits, and post off the seeking of Gods kingdome and his righteousnesse untill the end of their dayes, &amp;c. And whereas this petition is set after the third, we are taught before we ask temporall benefits, to submit our will to the will of the Lord, saying with our Saviour, <hi>Not my will, O Father, but thine be done.</hi>

                     <p>As touching those that follow, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why we are taught to ask for temporall benefits before spirituall blessings: Is it because we are more earnestly to desire them?

Neither do I see how we may aptly desire Christ to be given unto us, whom the Father hath already given unto us. In the second petition we desire that we may be drawn out of the power of darknesse, and given unto Christ, that he may rule in us by his word and Spirit. Neither, as I think, would Christ have taught us to say, <hi>Give us that bread of ours,</hi> but rather, <hi>that bread of thine:</hi> For <hi>we are Christs, and Christ is Gods,</hi> 1. Cor, 3. 22. and <hi>he is that bread of God which came down from heaven.</hi> Neither would he teach us to ask this bread for a <hi>day,</hi> but rather for ever. And as touching the body of the prayer, which is a summe, not of all Divinity, as they imagine, but onely of those things which we are to ask (as the Decalogue is the summe <hi>agendorum,</hi> of things to be done; and the Creed, <hi>credendorum,</hi> of things to be believed) it may not be thought that in this perfect summe our Saviour Christ hath omitted any thing which we are to ask. But if you shall not expound this petition of temporall blessings, you cannot comprehend them in any other petition: for to say
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42240:173"/>
that they be comprehended in the first, it is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an exposition.</p>
                        <p>As for the Papists, that expound this petition of the Sacrament of the Altar; they are more absurd: For besides the reasons alledged, they contradict themselves, both by a divers exposition, translating the same word, Luke 11. 3. <hi>daily;</hi> and by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: For if the people are to ask that bread every day, then are they bound in conscience to give it them every day, whereas indeed they give it unto them but once a yeare.</p>

2. Chron. 32. 25. August. <hi>Divitiarum morbus super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> Pride is the disease of riches. 2. Disdain and contempt of our brethren, Luke 16. Dives. 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, Psal. 30. 6. Luke 12. 19. 4. Confidence in riches, Psal. 49. 6. Job 31. 24. 1. Tim. 6. 17. 5. The choking of Gods word in them, Matth. 13. 6. The nailing of men unto the earth, setting their heart and affections upon their pelf, Psal. 62. 10. whereby it cometh to passe that they serve Mammon. And these corruptions are not onely incident to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but sometimes also to the children of God. And therefore the Lord many times denieth prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his children for their good, and granteth it to the wicked, who <hi>have their portion in this life,</hi> Psal. 17. 17. Luke 16. 25.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, poverty is accompanied many<note place="margin">The evils that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> times with 1. murmuring against God; 2. repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the better estate of others; 3. distrust in Gods providence; 4. using of unlawfull means; 5. abandoning of all religion, taking a desperate course of life, as though they were perswaded that they have served God for nought.</p>
                        <p>Agur therefore finding these infirmities in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (which indeed naturally are in us all) desireth the Lord that he would <hi>give unto him neither pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor riches: lest,</hi> saith he, <hi>I be full and deny thee; and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poore, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain,</hi> Prov. 30. 8, 9.</p>
                        <p>Here therefore two sorts of men are condemned: 1. Those worldlings who covet after abundance of wealth, not knowing that they further and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their condemnation. 2. Those superstitious
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42240:174"/>
Papists that vow voluntary poverty, whereby they become unthankfull to God and unprofitable to men.</p>
                        <p>But our Saviour teacheth us to follow the middle course, and commendeth to us a moderate desire of that which is necessary and convenient for us, both for our own sustenance and also relief of others.</p>
                        <p>Now the same measure is not necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient<note place="margin">The same measure is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all men.</note> for all men in respect of themselves. For there is a necessity 1. of Nature, <hi>quatenus homo,</hi> as we are men; 2. of Person, <hi>quatenus solus est, vel familiam habet,</hi> as a man is alone, or hath a family; 3. of State, <hi>quatenus est persona publica vel privata,</hi> as he is a publick or private person. The necessity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is content with a little, is satisfied with food and raiment, 1. Tim. 6. 8. But the necessity of an housholder or one that hath a charge, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not onely that which is necessary &amp; convenient for himself but also for those that belong unto him: every one being bound to <hi>provide for</hi> them, 1. Tim. 5. 8. The necessity of state requireth that which is convenient for that condition and calling wherein God hath placed him. Every one therefore is taught to desire and by prayer to ask that portion of temporall blessings which is necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in respect of the necessity not onely of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but also of a mans person and place. And these things we are to desire, not onely for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of our own need, but also that we may have to communicate to the necessity of others: Ephes. 4. 28. Prov. 5. 15, 16. Acts 20. 33. The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others are either private or publick; and

those either of the Church or commonwealth: <hi>To whose necessities we are to</hi> desire that we may not be wanting.</p>

Now if we cannot deserve a piece of bread of God, but must acknowledge the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God therein and our own unworthinesse, Gen. 32. 10. much lesse can we chalenge eternall life as our own desert, but must with the Apostle Rom. 6. 23. acknowledge it to be the <hi>free gift of God.</hi> And as we are to acknowledge God the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of these things, so II. we are when we want them to beg them of him, and when we have them to return thanks unto him for them: For which cause we are taught to receive the good creatures of God with prayer and thanksgiving. III. If we are to desire temporall blessings as the gifts of God, we are to be carefull to get them by good means. For then we are to esteem them as the gifts of God and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42240:175"/>
pledges of his love and favour towards us when we obtein them by good means and have care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to Gods glory. But contrariwise, when we get them by wicked means, by deceit, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, usury, &amp;c. they are to be esteemed rather the gifts of the devil and earnest-penies of destruction. 4. We are not to trust in the means be they never so good, but in the use of the means we are to crave the blessing of God, and to depend thereon, whithout which they are nothing worth. Psal. 127. 1, 2. <hi>Except the Lord build the house</hi> &amp;c. True it is indeed, that we must use good means, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we tempt God;) but we must not trust in the means, but depend upon the <hi>blessing of God,</hi> which, as Solomon saith, <hi>maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 22.

That he would give us the use and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">God giveth onelv the use of all.</note> of them: which we have need to pray for, not onely because men oftentimes are deprived of those things which they have before they have use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the Lord threatneth Mich. 6. 15. <hi>Thou shalt sow, but not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with the oyl; and make sweet wine, but not drink it:</hi> So Hagg. 1. 6. <hi>ye have sown much and bring in little:</hi> But also because many men deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of that which they have, as the Preacher

For without the blessing of God neither will food nourish, nor apparel che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, nor medicines cure, nor any thing else be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for our good. Hagg. 1. 6. <hi>Ye eat, but ye are not satisfied; ye drink, but ye are not filled; ye clothe you, but ye be not warm: and he that earneth wages, putteth it into a broken bag.</hi> Mich. 6. 14. The vertue of food in nourishing, as some think, is called <hi>the staff of bread;</hi> which staff if God shall break, as he often threatneth in the Scriptures, we shall eat bread and not be nourished therewith, Ezek. 5. 16. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as those which are in want are to use this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that God would grant unto them such tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessings as are convenient for them, and would blesse those good means which they use to that end; so they that have abundance, be it never so great, had need to use this prayer, that God would grant unto them the use of those things which they have, and blesse the use thereof unto them: For without his blessing the greatest provision of all things will not help us, and with his blessing the meanest means are sufficient: for <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but</hi> &amp;c.

For the Lords providence stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the smallest things; to the lighting of a spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon the ground, to the feeding of all brute beasts, Matth. 6. 26.

Therefore seeing God is the giver of them, and we stand in need of them, it behoveth us by prayer to acknowledge him the giver of them, and to exercise our faith in asking them at his hands. And that we are so to do it further appeareth by these reasons: 1. Because Christ in this place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to ask them. 2. Because we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that we shall receive them, 1. Tim. 4. 8. 3. The examples of the godly; Jacob, Gen. 28. 20. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, 1.

In the use either of those means which we use for the obteining of our desire, or of the thing obteined, we are to crave the blessing of God, and thereupon to depend.

Now in this petition and in the last our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teacheth us to ask spirituall blessings for the obteining of a better life. Of spirituall blessings in this life there be two chief heads whereunto all the rest may be referred: <hi>viz.</hi> our j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>stification, and sanctification. For in these two the covenant of grace and the benefits which in this life we receive by Christ do consist. Heb. 10. 16, 17. <hi>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those dayes, saith the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them: and their sinnes and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities I will remember no more.</hi> And the covenant that the Lord made with Abraham concerning the promised seed was this, <hi>That he would give us, that</hi>
                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:42240:183"/>
                        <hi>we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies,</hi> that is, Ephes. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. having by Christ remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our sinnes and justification, <hi>we should worship him without fear, in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our life,</hi> Luke 1. 73, 74, 75. And these are the benefits which should be preached in Christs name, repentance and forgivenesse of sinnes, Luke 24. 47. Seeing therefore the summe of all the benefits which in this life we receive by our blessed Saviour consisteth in these two, we may be resolved that in these two the happinesse of a Christian in this life doth consist. For whereas the Lord sware to Abraham that <hi>in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. Zachary being filled with the holy Ghost, expoundeth that blessednesse to consist in these two, Luke 1. 73. And indeed whereas there are two degrees of our happinesse, the one begun in this life, the other complete in the life to come, that is to be esteemed our happinesse in this life whereby the perfect happinesse of the life to come is obteined. Now whom God hath chosen and called to salvation them he justifieth, and whom he justifieth, &amp;c. Rom. 8. 30. And this appeareth to be true also in the particulars, Psal, 32. 1. Revel. 20. 6. Seeing therefore the benefits which we have by Christ in this life, and consequently our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, consisteth in those spirituall graces which our Saviour here teacheth us to crave of God; it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth necessarily, that both in our affections we should desire and in our judgements esteem these spirituall graces farre above all earthly and temporall things, esteeming all other things as <hi>drosse and dung,</hi> yea as
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42240:184"/>
                        <hi>losse</hi> in comparison thereof, Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10. For what will all temporall benefits avail us, if God do not forgive our sinnes, and stablish us by his free Spirit? Surely no more then the good pasture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth the beast that is fatted for the slaughter. And therefore as these blessings are absolutely necessary to our salvation, and of farre greater value then all temporall benefits, so are they absolutely to be cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, and with greater fervencie and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>But let us consider the order and the coupling of<note place="margin">The order.</note> this petition with that which went before and also that which followeth. Our Saviour teacheth us in the former place to crave temporall benefits as the lesse, that our faith having been exercised in the lesse might be confirmed in the greater; that is, that we having learned to depend upon Gods providence for our maintenance in this life, might the more firmly relie upon him for our justification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for if we have not learned to trust in him for the lesse, it is not likely that we should believe in him for the greater. The order in respect of that which followeth standeth thus; We are taught to desire freedome from the guilt of our sinnes before deliverance from the corruption, because our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God in Christ and justification by faith in order of nature goeth before our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; howsoever in time the beginning of our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication concurreth with justification.</p>
                     <p>From whence ariseth both an instruction for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">We must be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be sanctified.</note> men, and a consolation for the godly. For if justification goeth before sanctification, then it is
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42240:184"/>
certain that we cannot be sanctified unlesse first we be justified and reconciled unto God in Christ. And this order the holy Ghost teacheth us Luke 1. 74. <hi>That being redeemed</hi> &amp;c. For untill our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we our selves are enemies, so all our actions are hatefull unto God. And therefore men had not need to please themselves in their naturall estate, and by their security suffer as much as in them lieth the bloud of Christ to fall upon the ground, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be most forward, carefull, and desirous to be reconciled unto God in Christ, and that his merits and righteousnesse may be imputed unto them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that whatsoever they do before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God and justified is no better but sin, whereby they hoard up wrath against the day of wrath, &amp;c. The consolation which ariseth from hence is most singular: For if men cannot die unto sinne unlesse first they be justified, then those that labour to forsake their sinnes, and truly purpose amendment of life, and endevour to please God in dying to sinne and living to righteousnesse, may be assured that they are justified by faith and reconciled to God in Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And so much of the order. Let us now consider<note place="margin">The conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the former petition.</note> of the coupling of this petition both with that which went before and also that which followeth: with the former; <hi>Give us this day our daily bread: And forgive</hi> &amp;c. Which teacheth us that we should not so wholly be addicted to the commodities of this life, but that we should withall and most principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour for spirituall graces perteining to a better life. <hi>There be many,</hi> saith the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But howsoever the world saith, <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi> yet we must say, <hi>But, Lord, lift thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We must therefore not onely <hi>labour for the meat which perisheth,</hi> but much more <hi>for the meat which endureth to everlasting life,</hi> John 6. 27. For <hi>what would it profit us if we could gain the whole world,</hi> if our sinnes being not forgiven us, we should be amerced with the <hi>losse of our souls?</hi> Mark 8. 36.<note place="margin">The conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the latter petition.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the latter; <hi>Forgive us our sinnes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And lead us not into temptation,</hi> &amp;c. Which teacheth us that we are to desire as to be freed from the guilt of our sinnes so also from the corruptions, because they are things that are inseparably coupled together; forgiving of sinnes in God, and forsaking of sinnes in us. Therefore those which sever these things (as most do) deceive themselves, Luke 1. 73, 74. 2. Cor. 5. 17. Gal. 5. 24. Our Saviour as he is our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and justification, so also he is our sanctification: and therefore that which he did for us in his flesh, he worketh in us by his spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> a dying unto sin and a rising again unto newnesse of life. In those for whose sinnes he died and rose again for their justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42240:185"/>
the spirit of Christ is effectuall to apply the merits of his death to the mortifying of their sinnes, and the vertue of his resurrection to their vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is called the <hi>first resurrection.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlesse thou diest to thy sinnes and risest again unto newnesse of life, thou canst have no sound as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that Christ died for thy sinnes, and rose again for thy justification. And therefore as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the pardon of our sinnes, so must we labour to renounce them, that we may not onely be freed from the guilt but also delivered from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themselves. True repentance as it mourneth for sinnes committed, and craveth the pardon of them, so is it carefull for the time to come not to commit that which ought to be mourned for.</p>
                     <p>Having thus spoken of the order and coherence<note place="margin">Parts.</note> of this petition, we are now to speak of the words themselves. In which two things are conteined: first, a deprecation or request for the pardoning of our sinnes; and secondly, a reason for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith in obteining the same. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest it self we are first to speak of the meaning of the words, and then to gather from thence such uses as they afford.</p>

For if God should requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>e of us satisfaction for those sinnes which he pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Christ, it would follow necessarily that either the sufferings of Christ were unsufficient, or else that the Lord is unjust. Moreover, it is absurd that sinne being remitted the punishment should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined: For sinne is the cause of punishment: and the cause being taken away, the effect also is removed. And again, whereas sinne is infinitely increased in<note place="margin">4.</note> respect of that infinite Majestie and justice of God which is violated, sure it is that we cannot satisfie for it before we have endured endlesse punishment;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42240:190"/>
which will never be. Whereas therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ teacheth us thus to pray, he sheweth that we cannot be discharged from these our debts by our own satisfaction or merits, or any other means, but onely by the free remission of them and imputation of Christs righteousnesse. And this is to be understood not onely of our great and grievous sinnes, but also of our lesse offenses, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists call <hi>veniall,</hi> and erroneously hold not to be mortall, neither need the death and merits of Christ for their expiation, but may by the holy-water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkle, or by episcopall benediction, or by knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the breast be taken away. As therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne, great or small, deserveth death, and is also punished with death, either in Christ or in the sinner himself; and as <hi>the bloud of Christ doth purge us from all iniquitie,</hi> 1. John 1. 7. so that by him we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all our sinnes: so are we to pray that the Lord would for the precious merits and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Saviour Christ remit all our sinnes both more and lesse, from which we could by no other means be delivered but by the merits of Christ.</p>
                        <p>But here it may be objected; Our sinnes were<note place="margin">Object.</note> forgiven in baptisme, Acts 2. 38. therefore we need not now the forgivenesse of them.</p>
                        <p>Some answer, That because we sinne after ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,<note place="margin">

                           </gap>me to pray that the Lord would forgive our sinnes. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is not sufficient, considering that in baptisme is sealed the remission of sinnes, not onely past, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the time to come during the whole course of our life: For otherwise baptisme had need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42240:190"/>
I answer therefore, That we feeling the burden of our sinnes, pray that the forgivenesse of sinnes, which was represented and sealed unto us in baptisme, may indeed be granted unto us, and that we may feel in our selves the fruit and effect of our baptisme. For we must not think that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments absolutely conferre grace to every receiver, but onely upon those conditions which are contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the promises of the Gospel, whereof baptisme is a seal. Now the Gospel promiseth remission of sinnes and salvation onely to them that believe; and therefore the Sacrament sealeth and assureth remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely to them that believe. For we ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse onely for the righteousnesse of Christ: but the righteousnesse of Christ is there imputed to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse where it is apprehended by faith: In which sense we are said to be justified by faith alone, and by faith to have remission of sinnes. And therefore in this petition we desire that the Lord would work in us true faith, that being united unto Christ and made partakers of his merits, we may have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgivenesse of sinnes, but also assurance thereof by the anointment of the holy Ghost, <hi>the Spirit of adoption crying in our hearts, Abba, Father,</hi> &amp;c. And because none attein to that measure of assurance but that it is mingled with some doubting, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>This teacheth us to pray not onely for the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own sins, but also of our brethren; it being
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42240:191"/>
a duty of charity to desire and to further the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our brethren. And this duty as it belongeth to all so especially to those that are governours of others, either in the Church or Commonwealth. Examples: of Moses, who oft stood in the gap, Psal. 106. 23. Exod. 32. 21, 32. Num. 14. 19. Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, 1. Sam. 12. 23. Neither are we to pray for our friends and well-willers alone, but also for them that hate and persecute us, according to the precept and practice of our Saviour, Matth. 5. 44. Luke 23. 34. and the holy martyr Stephen, Acts 7. 60. And as we are to pray the Lord to forgive them, so must we as willingly forgive them as we desire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given of the Lord: neither can we in truth of heart desire God to forgive them, if we do not.</p>

                           <p>The duties which here we are taught to perform<note place="margin">Duties are 1. more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar.</note> in prayer are either more peculiar to this kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, or common. The former is Confession, which must concurre with Deprecation of pardon, and goeth before pardon; as appeareth Psal. 32. 3, 5. Prov. 28. 13. 1. John 1. 9. Num. 5. 7. Examples; 2. Sam. 12. 13. Luke 15. 21.</p>
                           <p>Now this confession is to be made of unknown sinnes generally; as Psal. 19. 12. of known sinnes particularly; Isai. 59. 12, 13. And to this end it will be profitable to examine our hearts and our lives by the law of God, taking a view of the duties therein commanded and vices forbidden, that we may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly see and acknowledge what duties we have omitted and what vices we have committed.<note place="margin">2. more common.</note>

faith, and perseverance. That we may pray in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, we must have both a true sense of our wants, and earnest desire to have the same supplyed.</p>
                           <p>The wants which we are to bewail are, 1. our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold sinnes and transgressions, for which we are to be grieved that we have by them displeased and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God. And to increase this godly sorrow<note place="margin">Meditations to increase our sorrow for sinne.</note> in us, we are First, to consider and meditate of Gods manifold benefits undeservedly bestowed upon us, and our unthankfull behaviour towards him, &amp;c. Secondly, we are to desire the Lord that he would poure upon us the spirit of deprecation, that we may with bitternesse bewail our sinnes, whereby we have so violated the justice of God that nothing could be found sufficient to appease or to satisfie the same but the death of Christ, whom we by our sins have pierced, Zech. 12. 10. Thirdly, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the misery whereunto our sinnes make us sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both in this life and in the world to come. In all which respects we must esteem our sinnes as a most heavy burden, and being weary thereof we are by prayer to come unto the Lord that we may be eased thereof, Matth. 11. 28. Neither are we to bewail our sinnes alone; but as we are to pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of other mens sinnes, so are we also to mourn for the iniquities of the place and time wherein we live, Ezek. 9. 8. Psal. 119. 136, 158. 2. We are to bewail the hardnesse of our hearts, that we cannot so bewail our sinnes as we ought. 3. Our want of faith and assurance of the remission of our sinnes.</p>
                           <p>The graces which we desire, are 1. Remission of<note place="margin">The graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we desire.</note> sinnes and justification, <hi>viz.</hi> that God would cancell
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42240:192"/>
the bill of debt, Col. 2. 14. that he would take away our sinnes and cast them into the bottom of the sea, Mich. 7. 18, 19. that he would impute the merits and obedience of Christ unto us. And secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we receive remission of sinnes and are justified by faith, by which we apprehend the righteousnesse of Christ to our justification, and without which the merits of Christ are not communicated unto us, therefore we desire not onely that he would forgive us our sinnes, but also that he would work in us a true faith, whereby we may have assurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our sinnes and peace of conscience. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our faith is weak therefore we are to pray for the increase thereof, Luke 17. 5. and also that God would blesse unto us the means of the begetting and increasing of our faith. 4. Because reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and adoption are unseparable companions of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, we therefore must also pray that he would receive us unto his love and favour, and give us his spirit of adoption; that howsoever we be by nature the children of wrath, yet being reconciled unto him in Christ, we may have the testimony of his Spirit testifying to our spirits that we are the children of God. 5. We pray not onely for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and assurance of justification, and peace of conscience arising from thence, Rom. 5. 1. but also for the joy of the holy Ghost proceeding from them both, Rom. 14. 17.

sinne maketh <hi>a separation between God and us,</hi> Isai. 59. 1. and maketh us subject both to the curse of God in this life and after; and therefore above all things in the world we are to desire freedome from our sinnes, without which our estate is most miserable, &amp;c. and without which we cannot be saved.

By it we are made partakers of all the benefits of Christ to our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and salvation. In which respect the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits in the Scriptures which proceed from Christ are also ascribed unto faith. Upon which follow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, peace with God, and joy in the holy Ghost, and the beginning of eternall life it self in this life.</p>
                           <p>As we must pray for the forgivenesse of our sins in fervencie, so also in faith: that as we unfeignedly desire pardon of sinnes &amp; reconciliation with God, so we are truly to believe that the Lord will heare our prayer, that he will receive us unto mercy, and at the length grant unto us the certificate of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Spirit of adoption. For that which he hath commanded us to ask he hath promised to give. He commandeth us to ask remission of sinnes, justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Spirit of adoption, &amp;c. therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we are stedfastly to believe that we shall obtein them. The forgivenesse of sinnes is a chief part of the covenant of grace, Heb. 10. 17. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption is expressely promised to those that ask him, Luke 11. 13.</p>

For by faith alone we have justification and remission of sinnes, Acts 26. 18. because faith alone apprehendeth the merits and righteousnesse of Christ whereby we are justified. Now this and the former must go together: We must be cast down in our selves, acknowledging our selves that we are no better in our selves then the firebrands of hell: and yet withall we must relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ and his merits, being perswaded that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our manifold sinnes, yet the Lord will receive us into his love and favour, imputing unto us the righteousnesse of his Sonne, and covering us therewith as with a garment. If thus we believe in Christ we need not doubt of the pardon of our sins; because Christ having satisfied the justice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all the sinnes of them which believe in him,

If therefore we would effectually crave the pardon of our sins, we must have a true purpose of heart and resolution to forsake them: And if we would have assurance that according to our prayer our sinnes be forgiven, we must have a true endeavour to leave them, and to perform the contrary duties. If therefore we have neither purpose in our hearts nor endeavour in our lives to forsake our sinnes, we may not look that the Lord will pardon them. <hi>If in my heart I regard wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,</hi> &amp;c.

For whereas divers men making this prayer for pardon of sinne either do not believe at all the pardon of their sinne, or else deceive themselves with an opinion of faith, not loving him of whom they look for pardon, nor their brethren for his sake, but with the ungracious servant Matth. 18. 28. exact small debts of their brethren, and revenge offenses committed against them, as though they could love God and yet hate their brother: therefore our Saviour teacheth us to adde to the petition this protestation, that if we be able to make it in truth, we may be assured of the forgivenesse of our sinnes, and not be deceived (as many are) in our assurance. First therefore because we are so full of infidelity and diffidence that we are hardly brought to believe in particular the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of our own sinnes, and consequently to make this prayer in faith, our Saviour teacheth us to use this notable argument (not so much to move God as to confirm our selves) drawn from the lesse to the greater, <hi>As we also forgive,</hi> &amp;c. or, as it is more plainly set down in Luke, <hi>For even we also forgive</hi>
                           <pb n="375" facs="tcp:42240:195"/>
&amp;c. And the reason standeth thus, <hi>If we (who have not so much pitie, in regard of thine abundant mercy, as is a drop of water in comparison of the Ocean sea; if we, I say) be readie to forgive the offenses and injuries done against us, then no doubt thou wilt forgive our offenses, which we from the bottom of our hearts confesse unto thee with deprecation of pardon: But even we, Lord, whose mercy is as nothing in comparison of thine, are readie to remit offenses committed against us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we earnestly crave pardon, so we do unfeignedly believe that thou wilt forgive us our sinnes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The connexion of the proposition is necessarie. For, as we say, <hi>Quod in minori valet valet etiam in majori,</hi> That which is of force in the lesser is of force also in the greater: If a drop of pity in us doth wash away the offense of our brother, how much more shall the multitude of his mercies wash away our offenses? And our Saviour reasoneth elsewhere Matth. 7. 11. <hi>If yee which are evil can give good things to your children, how much more</hi> &amp;c. If therefore our consciences do testifie unto us the truth of the assumption, That we are readie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that offend us; we may also be assured of the truth of the conclusion, That God also forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth our sinnes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whereas many abuse the mercy of God,<note place="margin">2. Reason why these words are added.</note> whereof they presume for the pardoning of their sinnes, dealing unthankfully with God in cruelty &amp; revenge exercised upon their brethren, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves with a conceit of faith and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of their sinnes, when indeed their sinne is not pardoned: therefore our Saviour
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42240:196"/>
Christ would have this protestation added, that it may be a touchstone to trie whether we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne and assurance thereof. For, as our Saviour saith <hi>that he to whom much is forgiven lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth much,</hi> Luke 7. 47. and he that loveth God truly cannot but love his brother for Gods cause: For as John saith, 1. Epist. 4. 20. <hi>If any say that he loveth God and hateth his brother he is a liar,</hi> &amp;c. and chap 5. 1. <hi>Every one that loveth him that hath begotten doth also love him that is begotten of him.</hi> And, <hi>Love covereth the multitude of offenses,</hi> Prov. 10. 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will not forgive our brethren that offend against us, it is an evident argument that we do not love them: If we love not our neighbour, certain it is that we love not God: If we love not God, it is a certain signe that we do not believe in him nor are perswaded of his love towards us in the forgiving of our sinnes: If we believe not this, Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and merits are not imputed unto us to our justification and remission of our sinnes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we be not willing and ready to remit offenses committed against us, it is a certain signe that our sinnes are not forgiven of God. As contrariwise, our brotherly love in remitting offenses is a sure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the forgivenesse of our sins. For as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith, Matth. 6. 14, 15. <hi>If ye forgive men their offenses, then will your heavenly Father also forgive you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some expound these words as if in them we did<note place="margin">Our forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no cause of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving us.</note> alledge a cause why God should forgive us, or as though our forgiving of our brethren did merit forgivenesse of sinnes at the hands of God: As the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42240:196"/>
Papists also expound that speech of our Saviour Luke 7. 47. <hi>Many sinnes are forgiven her; for she loved much.</hi> Whereas in truth the love either of God or of our neighbour for Gods cause is an effect, and so a signe, of Gods love towards us in forgiving our sinnes. <hi>We love God because he loved us first,</hi> 1. John 4. 19. And so doth our Saviour in that place argue, not from the cause to the effect, but from the effect to the cause: as also appeareth by the opposition in the latter part of that verse, <hi>but to whom lesse is forgiven, he loveth lesse;</hi> and by the parable of the two debtours, ver. 41. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he loved more to which more was forgiven. So that our love is not the cause of forgivenesse, but the forgivenesse of our sinnes is the cause of our love; and therefore our love an effect, fruit and signe of the forgivenesse of our sinnes. Again, our justification and remission of sinnes is free, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the mere love of God without any desert of ours, Rom. 3. 24. howbeit it is deserved through the merits of Christ. And surely if our forgiving of offenses were the cause why our sinnes be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then may we thank our selves for our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: neither should we need to pray that God would forgive us for Christs merits, but for our own deserts. And lastly, the Apostle Paul exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to forgive our brethren, as to a fruit and effect of Christs forgiving us, Ephes. 4. 32. Col. 3. 13. <hi>Forgiving one another, even as Christ hath freely forgiven you.</hi> In these words therefore is not set down the cause of the forgivenesse of our sinnes, but an argument from the lesse to the greater to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42240:197"/>
our faith in the assurance of the forgivenesse of our sinnes; that lesse being also an undoubted fruit and sure signe of the remission of our sinnes.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, as touching the party: If he cannot be<note place="margin">2.</note> reclaimed by private means, we are to seek that by publick authority he may be reclaimed and brought to repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we are to take heed left by our patience our neighbour become worse.</p>

So in the Law the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that whosoever had offended his neighbour, and came to seek reconciliation with God by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sacrifice, he should first make his brother amends whom he had offended, the same day that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his trespasse, Lev. 6. 5. and then forgivenesse is promised of the Lord, v. 7. Out of our Saviours words, Luke 17. 3, 4. it may be gathered, that it is
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42240:202"/>
the duty of him that hath offended to acknowledge his fault with promise of amendment to him that is offended. And this duty (though very late) was performed by Josephs brethren, Gen. 50. 17. But many when they have offended a man, they do hate him so much the more (as Amnon did Thamar, 2. Sam. 13. 15.) and are further from reconciliation then the party offended: Because they having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served ill of him, as their conscience telleth them, therefore they expect ill from him, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate him. And of such the Italian proverb is true, <hi>He that offendeth will never forgive.</hi> But these men that will not forgive them whom they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, of all others are farthest from pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be farthest from repentance.</p>
                           <p>Now let us consider how we are to behave our<note place="margin">2. How we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended us.</note> selves towards them that offend us. Our duty stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on foure degrees: First, if the offense be not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, to take no notice of it, but to dissemble it and to passe by it. For as Solomon saith, Prov. 10. 12. <hi>Hatred stirreth up contention: but love covereth the multitude of offenses:</hi> and Prov. 19. 11. <hi>The discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man maketh him slow to anger, and it is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to passe by an offense.</hi> Examples, in Saul, 1. Sam. 10. 27. and David, Psal. 38. 13, 14.</p>
                           <p>Our first duty therefore when we are wronged<note place="margin">Duty 1.</note> is, not to fret and fume, storm and chafe, and much lesse to proceed to brawling or blows: For, as Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saith, <hi>Indignation resteth in the bosome of fools,</hi> Eccles 7. 10. <hi>but he that is slow to anger is wise,</hi> Prov. 14. 29.<note place="margin">Means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>o moderate our anger.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>And to moderate our anger and desire of revenge,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42240:202"/>
let us consider these two things: 1. That thy brother which offendeth thee is the rod of God, &amp;c. 2. That as thou forgivest so thou must look to be forgiven. If when thou art wronged, thou chafest, and storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and presently revengest thy self, when thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest this prayer thou dost desire the Lord so to deal with thee, that is, when thou offendest presently to be revenged of thee.</p>
                           <p>The second duty is, when we have been offended<note place="margin">Duty 2.</note> not to retein anger, purpose or desire of revenge, but freely and from our hearts to forgive one another, Lev. 19. 18. Rom. 12. 19. Ephes. 4. 32. Col. 3. 13. And thus we are to forgive our brother openly, if he acknowledge his fault and repent; and that so oft as he seeketh reconciliation, though it be seven times a day, Luke 17. 3, 4. If he do not ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but rather persist in hating and wronging us, yet are we in our hearts to forgive him, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire his good, and to pray for his amendment, Matth. 5. 44.</p>
                           <p>Unto the performance of this duty we are to be<note place="margin">Reasons moving us to forgive.</note> moved by these arguments: First, if we will not forgive our neighbour, the Lord will not forgive us,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> Matth. 6. 15. Mark 11. 25, 26. 2. If we retein anger<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> and desire of revenge, with what face can we pray unto the Lord to forgive us our great debts, that will not for his sake remit those pettie debts of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And to this purpose notable is that saying of the sonne of Sirach, Ecclus 28. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sinnes in remembrance. For give thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall</hi>
                              <pb n="386" facs="tcp:42240:203"/>
                              <hi>thy sinnes also be forgiven when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? He sheweth no mercy to a man which is like himself, and doth he ask forgivenesse of his own sinnes? If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sinnes?</hi> Therefore Paul exhorteth us to <hi>pray, lifting up pure hands without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 8. and Peter signifieth that anger inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth this exercise of prayer, 1. Pet. 3. 7. 3. If we<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> do not forgive our brother, in making this prayer we desire that the Lord would execute his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon us rather then crave forgivenesse, &amp;c. For this cause, as Augustine exhorteth, we are above all other sinnes to lay aside anger and hatred when we come to pray. For this prayer obteineth pardon for other sinnes; but for this sinne it doth not, but rather pulleth down vengeance upon him that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth revenge.</p>
                           <p>As for those reasons which we pretend for our<note place="margin">Pretenses of those who will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give taken away.</note> anger, hatred, and desire of revenge, they are most vain, especially if we compare the debts of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to us with those which we desire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given of the Lord. For some will alledge, <hi>The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses which he hath committed against me are great, and I cannot put them up.</hi> But they are nothing to those sinnes which thou hast committed against God. 2. <hi>Yea, but he hath touched my good name.</hi> And thou by thy sinnes hast dishonoured God, and hast caused his holy name to be blasphemed. 3. <hi>Yea, but he is mine inferiour,</hi> &amp;c. And what art thou to God? 4. <hi>Yea, but the offenses which he hath committed against me are many, and he never maketh an end of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                              <pb n="387" facs="tcp:42240:203"/>
                              <hi>me wrong.</hi> But nothing so many as thy sinnes are against God: neither dost thou put an end to thy sinning. 5. <hi>Yea, but I have deserved well of him.</hi> But not so well as God hath deserved of thee. 6. <hi>Yea, but I have sought to win him with kindnesse.</hi> And hath not the Lord by his mercies invited thee to repentance? 7. <hi>Yea, but he hath been often admonished of his fault.</hi> Not so oft as thou.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, as thy brother offendeth against<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> thee, so for the most part thou offendest against him, either by giving him occasion of evil, or by anger and impatience conceived against him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the debt being mutuall, thou shouldst be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to strike off thine own debt by pardoning of him. And although perhaps thou hast not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so ill of him, yet thou hast deserved worse of the Lord, who by him as his instrument correcteth thee: and therefore must say, as Mich. 7. 9. <hi>I have sinned, and therefore I will bear the anger of the Lord.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Duty 3.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>The third degree is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>forgetfulnesse;</hi> That we should not onely forgive but also forget the offenses done against us, as we desire that the Lord would forget the sinnes which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against him. And therefore this art of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, which Themistocles wished, we are to beg of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>The fourth is, by Christian charity to labour to<note place="margin">4. We must labour to win him.</note> win him, and to overcome evil with goodnesse, Rom. 12. 21. And this love must be exercised 1. by doing good to him that hath deserved ill, Psal. 25. 21, 22. for thereby also we shall resemble the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42240:204"/>
goodnesse of the Lord, who although he hath been diversly offended, yet first seeketh reconciliation with us. 2. in commending them to God in our prayers, Matth. 5. 44.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. The second use is consolation to them who<note place="margin">An use of consolation.</note> are ready to forgive the offenses of their brethren: For if we do forgive, we may be assured that we are forgiven, Matth. 6. 14. <hi>If ye forgive men their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, your heavenly Father will forgive you.</hi> For which cause our Saviour Christ pronounceth the <hi>mercifull to be blessed, because they shall obtein mercy,</hi> Matth. 5. 7. And undoubtedly the true love of our brother for Gods cause, which is especially to be seen in forgiving offenses, is an evident argument of the love of God. The love of God is a fruit of faith; for we love him because we are perswaded that he loved us first: and where faith is there is justification and remission of sinnes by imputation of Christs righteousnesse apprehended by faith.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. The last use is a reproof of those which<note place="margin">An use of reproof.</note> using this prayer notwithstanding retein hatred against their brother or purpose of revenge. And they are to be reproved both for their hypocrisie and folly: their hypocrisie; because they not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their neighbours but reteining malice against them, are not ashamed to lie unto the Lord, saying, <hi>For even we also forgive,</hi> &amp;c. Their folly; because using this prayer, <hi>Forgive us as we forgive,</hi> not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving but purposing and desiring revenge, in stead of craving pardon they desire God to be revenged on them for their sinnes, as they desire to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on their neighbour. Of both which hypocrisie
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42240:204"/>
and folly our lustie gallants, especially our che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers and hacksters, are guilty: who think it the greatest disparagement that may be (which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost esteemeth to be the glory of a man) to put up an injury; and therefore will die upon a man rather then suffer the least offense unrevenged. But these men must know, that not onely they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men and remain in their sinnes, but also that in seeking private revenge they are satanicall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish. And therefore when Abishai stirred up Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to revenge himselfe upon Shimei, David an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>What have I to do with you, ye sonnes of Zeruiah, that ye are this day to me</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>instead of Satan,</hi> 2. Sam. 19. 22. to teach us that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired of Satan that breathe after revenge. <hi>Yea, but,</hi> saith one, <hi>I know how to avoid both this hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and folly, and yet I will be even with mine enemie too. For either I will leave out this petition, or use some other form of prayer where this clause is not, or else I will not pray at all.</hi> Yea, but the sentence of our Saviour, whether we use these words or no, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sure; <hi>If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses,</hi> Matth. 6. 5. &amp; 18. 33. and therefore those that use such shifts do but mock God and deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Remember the parable, Matth. 18. and the saying of Tertullian, <hi>Quid est ad pacem Dei accedcre sine pace? ad remissionem debitorum cumretentione in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriarum? Quomodo placabit patrem iratus infratrem?</hi> &amp;c. What is it to come unto God to seek peace without peace? for remission of our debts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42240:205"/>

For whereas in the former we begged the grace of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and remission of sinnes, in this we crave the grace of sanctification and the spirit of fortitude whereby we may prevent sinne, and be enabled to resist the tentations of the devil, flesh and the world provoking us unto sinne. In the former we asked freedome from the guilt of sinne: In this we crave deliverance from the evil and corruption of sinne, and strength against tentations alluring us thereunto. But as touching the order we are taught to ask first justification &amp; freedome from the guilt of sinne, and then sanctification and freedome from committing sinne; because justification in order of nature goeth before sanctification. And as touching the coupling of this with the former, signified in the first word <gap reason="foreign">

No, we are taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary 1. Pet. 2. 24. Luke 1. 74.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man be not tempted at all, it is a fearfull signe that the strong man possesseth still his hold, because all is in quiet: Whereas contrariwise, to be troubled with tentations, is an argument of Gods favour, if also we have grace to resist them.

Men; as when one friend, to try the good will of another, asketh some benefit which he meaneth not to take: or when a man, to try the fidelity of his servant, either drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth some money in his way, or biddeth him do some difficult things which he would not have him to do, &amp;c. God trieth men, either that his graces may appear to his glory and their good; or their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities may appear, that they may be humbled &amp; more seriously turn unto him, Deut. 8. 2, 16. And<note place="margin">Of Gods trialls, 1. by prosperity;</note> these trialls of God are either of the right hand or of the left. The former are his temporall blessings, which he bestoweth upon men many times to try their thankfulnesse, humility, obedience, charity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in God; or the contrary. Exod. 16. 4. when the people wanted food, the Lord sent them food from heaven <hi>to tempt</hi> or <hi>to prove them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would walk in his law or no.</hi> If men which are in prosperity would consider that the Lord bestoweth his blessings upon them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to try them, that they should shew what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men they are, doubtlesse this meditation would be profitable, partly to bewray their wants unto them, partly to incite them to labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves to the Lord, that proveth them. Prove therefore and examine thy self: God hath
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42240:207"/>
bestowed these blessings upon thee, so many, so great: Hast thou been thankfull to God the giver? hath not thine heart been lift up with pride? hast thou been carefull to please him that hath been so gracious unto thee? or hast thou been displeased with thy self when thou hast offended so good a God? hast thou been ready to expose those gifts which thou hast to the glory of God and relief of thy brethren? hast thou not trusted in thy riches and thine own means more then in the providence and blessing of God? If in these respects thou hast been wanting, then by these trialls God would let thee see what thou art, that thou mayest be humbled before him, and mayest truly labour to approve thy self unto him by thy thankfulnesse, humility, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, charity, affiance reposed in him, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The trialls of the left hand are such as crosse our<note place="margin">2. by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> desires: as first, when the Lord commandeth such things as we are loth to do. So he tempted Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 22. 1. Secondly, when he exerciseth us with afflictions which are hard for flesh and bloud to bear. So Job was tempted; and so the godly in all ages. And therefore afflictions are called <hi>tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Jam. 1. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 7. laid upon them of God to try their faith, and their patience, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and their love, &amp;c. and are therefore called <hi>trialls of faith,</hi> Jam. 1. 3. Revel. 2. 10. <hi>The devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried.</hi> Ecclus 27. 5. <hi>The fornace proveth the potters vessel: so do ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations try mens thoughts,</hi> Pro. 17. 3. And as by winnowing the wheat is tried and severed from the chaff, so is the sound Christian from the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42240:208"/>
hypocrite by affliction. Hath the Lord therefore laid any crosse upon thee? consider that he hath done it to try thee. Examine therefore thy self if the Lord hath let thee see thine own weaknesse: let the sight thereof humble thee, and make thee more carefull for the time to come, and labour to approve thy self unto the Lord by thy humble, patient, thankfull and chearfull bearing of the crosse. For as James saith, chap. 1. 12. <hi>Blessed is the man that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth temptation: For when he shall be found approved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to them that love him.</hi> Thirdly, thus God also trieth his servants by suffering heresies, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wicked to live among them: 1. Cor. 11. 19. <hi>There must be heresies, that they which are approved may be known,</hi> Deut. 13. 3. Jud. 2. 22. Seeing therefore all these trialls of God are for our good, Deut. 8. 16. we are not to pray that we may not be tried, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrariwise, that we may be tried, and being tried may be found approved, Psal. 26. 2. and 139. 23.</p>
                        <p>Temptations which be for evil are either provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations<note place="margin">Of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for and unto evil.</note> unto evil, and therefore evil; or punishments of evil, and therefore just.

                           <pb n="398" facs="tcp:42240:209"/>
are either the desires or the terrours of the world: For sometime the world allureth unto evil by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising good things, sometimes terrifieth from good by threatning evil things. The desires of the world, that is, the things desired in the world, (as in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, peace and prosperity; in particular, pleasure, profit, preferment, and glory in the world) are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times so many baits of sinne, and snares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: baits, in respect of the getting; and snares, in respect of the using of them. For sinne, being in it self ugly and fearfull if it should come in its own likenesse, being the hook of the devil, therefore it is covered with the shew sometimes of pleasure, sometimes of profit, sometimes of preferment, sometimes of glory, as with a bait, that the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous man with desire of pleasure, the covetous man by coveting after profit, the ambitious man by gaping after preferment might swallow the hook of the devil to their perdition. Men had therefore need to look unto the means of getting their desires: for when they cannot be got but by sinne, they are the baits of the devil. In respect of using, they are snares of the devil, whenas mens minds &amp; hearts are intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with them so as they cannot mind or affect heavenly things. If they be called to the worship of God and means of their salvation, they have their worldly excuses, as those in the Gospel, Luke 14. 18. If they come to the worship of God, if they heare the word, if they call upon God by prayer, their heart notwithstanding goeth a whoring after their worldly desires, whereby they are so fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as that they cannot freely set their hearts and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42240:209"/>
minds on better things. Men had therefore need to take heed unto themselves, that <hi>they use the world as though they used it not;</hi> that they possesse the things of the world, and be not possessed of them: For if once they set their hearts upon them, and be wholly addicted unto them, <hi>they fall into tentation and snares of the devil, and into many foolish and noysome lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction,</hi> 1. Tim. 6. 9. As the good things in the world are many<note place="margin">By evils and crosses.</note> times baits and snares to allure men to evil, and to entangle them therewith; so the evils and crosses which be in the world are many times terrours to scare and terrifie men from God. <hi>If thou embrace godlinesse and sincerely professe the truth, then,</hi> saith the world, <hi>thou shalt not onely bereave thy self of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, profit and preferment which thou mightest have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, but thou shalt live in misery, in want, disgrace and contempt; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But for the most part he dealeth by means, using either as his instruments sometimes the flesh, that is, mans own corruption; and sometimes also the mediation of other men, as once he did the serpent; or else, as occasions and objects, the desires and terrours of the world.</p>
                        <p>The chief help and instrument of the devil is the<note place="margin">1.</note> flesh, that is, a mans own corruption; by which he hath all the advantage he hath against us. The flesh is as it were the devils bawd, prostituting the soul to his tentations, and betraying us into the hands of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42240:210"/>
the devil. And as he knoweth in generall our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to sinne, by which he taketh advantage against us, so he observeth and by observation acquainteth himself with the particular inclinations, humours and dispositions of men, following and fitting them in their humours, and by all means egging them on to the extremities of those things whereunto they are themselves inclined: And thus he worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in the hearts of men, carrying them captive to the obedience of his will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He useth other men as his instruments; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times friends, sometimes foes. Friends; So he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jobs wife and friends to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he useth foes: As when they are incensed by them unto anger, malice, and desire of revenge. For these are the works of the devil; and he that yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to these things, <hi>giveth place to the devil,</hi> Ephes. 4. 27. So Shimei was the instrument of the devil, and his <hi>

                        <p n="3">3. Sometimes he useth (as hath been said) the desires of the world as his baits and snares; therein cunningly fitting the severall humours of men, by offering the bait of pleasure to the voluptuous, of profit to the covetous, of preferment to the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, of honour and renown to the vainglorious. Thus (although in vain) he assaulted Christ, Matth. 4. Sometimes by threatning future dangers and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42240:211"/>
he setteth upon the weak and inconstant. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by aggravating the present troubles, either in respect of the greatnesse, or the length, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in them, or by comparisons with others, to move them to impatience, or to bring them to despair.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The tentations of the devil serve either to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow mens faith or obedience: Their faith; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by infecting their judgements with errours, partly by casting doubts into their mind; or contrariwise<note place="margin">Tentations of errours and heresies;</note> causing them to presume. First, That he may infect men with errours, he is many times a lying spirit in the mouthes of those that take upon them to be teachers of others. Secondly, he useth to cast doubts<note place="margin">Of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>g;</note> into mens minds concerning Gods love towards them, concerning their election, justification, and salvation. And his especiall motives hereunto are 1. the calamities of this life; 2. the conscience of sinne.</p>
                        <p>As touching the former, It is the usuall practice of the devil to perswade men being in affliction that they are not in Gods favour, either in respect of their continuance, or greatnesse, or by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their distressed estate with the prosperity of others. This was the main argument that the devil used to assail the faith of Job with by his wife and friends, That because he was so greivously afflicted he was not the friend of God but an hypocrite: and this assault made him sometimes to stagger, 13. 24. <hi>Why hidest thou thy face from me, and esteemest me as thine enemie?</hi> So David, Psal. 22. 1. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> But this tentation is the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42240:211"/>
most effectuall when comparison is made with others, Psal. 73. 12, 13. Jer 12. 1. And although reply be made, that the Lord many times doth greivously afflict his own children, he will alledge that never any was so afflicted either for the length or for the greatnesse, &amp;c. The second motive is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sinne committed. For the devil, that extenuateth a sinne when it is to be committed, making of a mountain a mole-hill; when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he will aggravate the same, and of a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill make a mountain, perswading a man that his sinne is greater then may be forgiven, as we see in Cain and Judas.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, he tempteth men to vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,<note place="margin">Of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> that it may occupie the room of faith: As when he bringeth mere naturall men into a conceit of themselves that they have a good faith to God, that they love him with all their hearts, that they are highly in Gods favour; First, by flattering them in their ignorance and blindnesse. For the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and sottish a man is in Christianity, the greater conceit commonly he hath of himself. Secondly, by making them please themselves in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of some outward works; wherein Popish devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consisteth, Mich. 6. 6. Luke 18. 12. Thirdly, by comparing themselves with others that be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sinners, Luke 18. 11. Fourthly, by letting them see the falls of others that seem forward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, he maketh them please themselves in their ignorance and security; as if all profession of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were but hypocrisie, and they in the onely way. Fifthly, by consideration of their great prosperity
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42240:212"/>
which, as Solomon saith, <hi>slayeth fools,</hi> Prov. 1. 32.</p>
                        <p>The tentations of Satan touching obedience<note place="margin">Tentations touching obedience:</note> serve either to withdraw men from good or to draw them to evil. Of the former there be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples as there are duties to be performed: As namely, in the duties of piety and of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; as 1. Hearing of the word: Either he keepeth<note place="margin">1. in hearing the word,</note> men from coming to heare; or when they are come, he withdraweth away their minds by putting other matters into their heads; or when they have heard, he stealeth away the seed of Gods word out of their hearts, or by the allurements of the world choketh it. 2. Prayer: Either he keepeth men<note place="margin">2. in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>ayer,</note> from prayer, saying as Job 12. 15. <hi>What will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us to call upon him?</hi> or if they do, he laboureth by all means to withdraw their minds from that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exercise, by suggesting other (and for the most part worldly) cogitations. 3. As touching<note place="margin">3. in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> the sacrament; Either he nourisheth men in hatred, &amp;c. that they are unfit to come; or when they do come, instead of examining and looking into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they busie themselves in looking into the sufficiencie of the minister, examining the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of other receivers, or prying into their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, whether they sit or kneel, or how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves.</p>
                        <p>Of the latter sort there be so many examples as<note place="margin">Tentations drawing men unto evil.</note> there are sinnes forbidden: Whereunto he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times provoketh men by suggestion; as he did Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, 1. Chron. 21. 7. to number the people; and Judas, to betray his Master, John 13. 2. Sometimes
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42240:212"/>
allureth by desires of the world, which are his baits; Sometimes inticeth by the counsel or example of others, which are his instruments; Sometimes and most ordinarily abuseth a mans own corruption, which is his bawd; Sometimes he draweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as a means to escape danger, as an evasion out of trouble, &amp;c. So foolish are men that they can be perswaded by the devil to seek an issue out of some bodily trouble or danger with the hazard of their souls. Sometimes he clotheth sinne with the cloke of vertue.</p>
                        <p>So much breifly shall serve to have spoken of tentations as they are provocations to evil. Against which we pray not that we be not tempted; but, that the Lord would not in his fierce wrath for a punishment of our sinne lead us into tentation, nor give us over to our own concupiscences to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in sinne, or to the world to be carried away with the desires thereof, or to the devil to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in tentation &amp; to be carried away captive to the performance of his will. For howsoever men willingly run into these tentations, as the beast goeth chearfully to the slaughter; yet there can be no greater judgement inflicted upon a man in this life then to be given over to his own lusts or to the allurements of the world or tentations of the devil.

                           </gap> and yet notwithstanding he is not the authour of sinne. In every tentation, even unto evil, God hath an hand: And the same tentation which proceedeth from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan or our own corruption may also be said to come from God. But in the same tentation we are to distinguish the work of God, which is good; from the work of the flesh or of the devil, which is evil.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42240:213"/>
As it cometh from God, it is either a triali or a chastisement, which are works of mercy; or a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which is a work of justice: But as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Satan or the flesh, it is a provocation unto evil, and therefore a sinne. Such is the wisdome and goodnesse of the Lord, that he knoweth by evil instruments to effect his own good work. The tentation of Job proceeded from God and from Satan. God by that means tried his patience; the devil provoked him to impatience and despair. When David numbred the people, it is said that <hi>God moved him so to do,</hi> 2. Sam. 24. 1. and <hi>Satan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to number the people,</hi> 1. Chron. 21. 1. Gods work was a chastisement of David, and punishment of the people; Satans work, an incitation to sinne. When Pharaoh deteined the people of Israel, it is said that <hi>God hardned his heart,</hi> and that <hi>Pharaoh hardned his heart,</hi> Exod. 8. 15, 32. and 9. 34. As it came from God, it was a punishment; as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a fruit of his own flesh, and so a sinne. Again, we must further distinguish betwixt the tentation of God, and of the flesh and the devil. The flesh, when it tempteth, sendeth forth evil concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which allure men to evil and withdraw from God, Jam. 1. 14. The devil, when he tempteth, casteth into mens minds, either by himself or by means, ill motions and suggestions. God doth not instill into mens minds ill motions; as the devil and the flesh do: But he is said to <hi>tempt</hi> in these respects: 1. By offering the occasion or the object of sinne for our triall; howsoever we through our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or instigation of Satan take occasion by the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42240:214"/>
triall of sinning: 2. By withholding and withdrawing his grace, which he is not bound to vouchsafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, but in justice might deny to all: 3. By giving them over either to their own lusts or to the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the devil, who is his executioner, as a just punishment of their former sinnes. And in this sense God is said to <hi>harden mens hearts:</hi> not that he maketh them of soft hard, but, being hard already, giveth them over to their own corruptions and the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan further to be hardned; which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they further gather to themselves, willingly committing sinne with greedinesse. Now this the Lord may do most justly: For when men have hardned themselves, what should bind God to soften them? <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> by softning them: <hi>and whom he will</hi> not have mercy on, them in justice <hi>he hardneth.</hi> And who shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him to shew mercy in softning where in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice he may harden?</p>
                        <p>This must teach us, 1. not to dispute with God, but to justifie him in all his judgements, which in justice he might exercise upon all, howsoever in mercy he spareth some: and 2. to be thankfull unto him for vouchsafing us to be in the number of those whom in mercy he so softeneth, when in justice he might have hardned us.</p>
                        <p>Thus we see in what sense the Lord is said to <hi>lead men into tentation:</hi> not that he suffereth them on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be led; but also that he giveth them over to be tempted, and in the tentation to take the foil. 2. Whereas our Saviour teacheth us thus to pray, <hi>That the Lord would not lead us into tentation,</hi> we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42240:214"/>
this consolation, That howsoever we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted<note place="margin">A consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Satan can neither tempt nor overcome without Gods permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> continually by the flesh, the world, and the devil, yet we shall not be overcome except the Lord himself lead us into tentation. Satan <hi>goeth about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually like a roring lion, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure:</hi> but he cannot tempt, except it please God to bring us upon the stage, as he did Job: nor in tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome us, unlesse the Lord give us over into his hands. For <hi>he that is in us is greater then he that is in the world,</hi> 1. John 4. 4. And if we be <hi>born of God, the evil one shall not touch us to hurt us,</hi> 1. John 5. 18. The <hi>devil desireth to sift and to winnow us as wheat: but</hi> our Saviour hath <hi>prayed for those that believe in him, that our faith may not fail,</hi> Luke 22. 32. The devils could not enter into the herd of swine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speciall leave. Neither could Satan touch the cattel of Job untill he had commission from God: and further then his tedder he cannot go.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore in all tentations the Lord ruleth the action and overruleth the tempter, our duty is, in all tentations to flee unto him, praying that he will not lead us into tentation.</p>
                        <p>So much of the person to whom we make this request. Let us now consider the thing against which we pray: That <hi>we be not led into tentation.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not teach us to pray that we be not tempted at all: For it is not an evil thing, to be<note place="margin">That it is not evil to be tempted, but good to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>

James biddeth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>rejoyce when they fall into tentations,</hi> Jam. 1. 2. <hi>He that is not tempted,</hi> saith the sonne of Sirach, <hi>he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but a little,</hi> 34. 10. and as Augustine, <hi>No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In Psal. 60.</note>

                           <hi>himself unlesse he be tempted.</hi> Besides, we are not souldiers under the banner of Christ, unlesse we fight with the flesh, the world, and the devil: and we sight not with them, unlesse we be tempted of them: neither must we look to be crowned, unlesse first we strive. Nay, if we be not tempted, it is a signe that he needeth not assault us. Lastly, all tentations turn to the good of those that love the Lord, Rom. 8. serving either to humble them by the sight of their weaknesse, 2. Cor. 12. 9. or to prevent sinne in them, making them more wary and circumspect for the time to come; or to manifest Gods graces in them, that they may be found approved, and so become happy: For as James saith, chap. 1. 12. <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth tentation: for when he shall be found approved he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to those that love him.</hi> We do not therefore pray that we <hi>be not tempted,</hi> but, that we <hi>be not led into tentation;</hi> that is, That when we are tempted the Lord would not leave us unto our selves, nor give us over to the tempter, nor suffer us to be overcome in the tentation, nor to be tempted above our power: but that it would please him <hi>to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish us by his free spirit,</hi> and minister strength unto us, <hi>giving with the tentations an issue, that we may bear them.</hi>

                           </note> And so our Saviour expoundeth himself in the words following, <hi>But deliver us from evil:</hi> Which, as hath been said, are the exposition of the former. Tertullian, <hi>Clausula haec interpretatur quid sit,</hi> Nè nos inducas in tentationem, <hi>hoc est,</hi> sed erue nos a malo, This clause interpreteth what this is, <hi>Lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tentation,</hi> that is, <hi>but deliver us from evil.</hi>

                              <p>Now in all these we are to pray, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teacheth us both by his example, John 17. 15. &amp; by his precept in this place, O Lord, we do not desire not at all to be tempted, but that we may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from evil: that is, from the tyranny of the flesh, that it hold not us captive unto sinne; from the allurements of the world, that they do not draw us unto sinne; from the assaults of the devil, that he prevail not against us; from the punishments of sin, and judgements which by sinne we deserve, so farre
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42240:218"/>
as our deliverance therefrom may stand with Gods glory and our good; and lastly, from the corruption of sinne it self; in regard whereof we desire the Lord would endue us more and more with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of sanctification, applying unto us the merits and efficacy of Christs death to mortifie our sinne, and of his resurrection to restore us to newnesse of life; wherein we are to proceed from faith to faith, and from one measure of grace to a greater, untill we come to a perfect man in Christ.</p>
                              <p>And as there are two degrees of our deliverance from these our spirituall enemies: the one begun and imperfect, by sanctification in this life; the other full and perfect in the life to come, which is our full redemption and glorification: So we pray, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we may be freed from our corruptions in part, but also may be fully conformed to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous image of the Sonne of God; and therefore pray that we may be <hi>delivered from every evil thing, and be preserved to his heavenly kingdome,</hi> 2.

                              <p>Now as these graces are to be asked in fervencie<note place="margin">That we must pray for these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith.</note> and affection, so also in assurance of faith that we shall be heard.

For first, the Greek copies have it: secondly, the Syriack Paraphrast translateth it: thirdly, the Greek writers expound it; as Chrysostome and Theophylact: and fourthly it is not onely consonant with the rest of the Scriptures, but also in this prayer hath a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary use. For we have heard that praise is to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prayer: and in prayer two things required; fervencie, and faith: Now as the petitions especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteined a specification of our desires, so this conclusion conteineth partly a confirmation of our faith joyned with praysing God, in these words,

For that they be reasons the word <hi>For</hi> signifieth. And reasons they are not so much to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade God that he would grant our requests as to perswade and assure our selves that we shall obtein. The reasons are taken neither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse nor from the dignitie of our prayers, (for if our faith were to be grounded thereon, we should neither dare to pray nor hope to be heard) but from the nature &amp; attributes of God; that we might know that the obteining our requests dependeth not upon our own worth but on the power and goodnesse of God. The reasons, I say, are drawn from three attributes of God: <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>eternall Kingdome, eternall Power, eternall Glorie.</hi> His is <hi>the kingdome:</hi> therefore he hath right to give us whatsoever we desire: His is <hi>the power and might:</hi> therefore he is able to grant our requests: His is <hi>the glory,</hi> both of giving all good things, and also of all good things given; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our requests do tend: and therefore he is ready and willing to grant our requests for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own glorie. And this we shall the easier believe if we consider to whom we ascribe these things; namely, to our heavenly Father, whose <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42240:220"/>
for our help. Neither doth the right, power and glory of giving benefits temporall and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this life alone belong unto God, but also of everlasting blessings in heavenly things after this life is ended. For his is the <hi>eternall</hi> kingdome, <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> power, and <hi>eternall</hi> glorie, signified in those words, <hi>for ever and ever;</hi> which are to be referred to all the three attributes.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>But first of his kingdome: Which here signifieth 1. generally the universall kingdome of God, which some call <hi>the kingdome of his power,</hi> whereby he ruleth and governeth all things, Psal. 103. 19. 2. Chron. 20. 6. and in regard whereof the right of all things belongeth to him, Deut. 10. 14. Psal. 24. 1.</p>
                        <p>This then teacheth us two things: 1. That our heavenly Father is the absolute Lord and owner of all his creatures; who as he is the Creatour so is he also the possessour of heaven and earth: in whose hand all good things are to bestow as it pleaseth him. This therefore must encourage us with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith to make our requests to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> heavenly Father, of whom we cannot ask any good thing, whether spirituall or temporall, which is not his to bestow. And therefore it is well said of Seneca, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter Deum roga, nihil eum de alieno rogaturus,</hi> Ask boldly of God, seeing thou canst ask nothing of him which belongeth to another. 2. That our heavenly Father is the sovereigne King and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord and Governour over all his creatures, ruling the good, and overruling the evil; to whose
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42240:221"/>
commandment all the good creatures obey, and at whose beck they are ready to do us good: And as for the wicked either men or angels; they are so overruled by the almighty providence of God, that when they seek to annoy us, they are against their purpose made the instruments of God to do us good.</p>

                           <hi>Thine is the kingdome,</hi> we are to observe that the kingdome of government which Kings and Princes have, it is the kingdome of God; whose ministers and leiutenants they are, Rom. 13. 4. <hi>by whom they reigne,</hi> Prov. 8. 15. and <hi>from whom all authoritie is,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. Which as it must teach them to subordinate their government unto the Lord, and in him to rule their subjects, because the kingdome which they exercise is not theirs but Gods, their <hi>judgement is not theirs but the Lords,</hi> 2. Chron. 19. 6. so doth it teach all subjects to be subject to their governours so farre forth as they are subordinate to the Lord; because in obeying them they obey the Lord, and in resisting them they resist God, Rom. 13. 2. But if Magistrates and Kings shall leave their order, in commanding that which God forbiddeth, we are bound to be subordinate to our supreme King, whose the kingdome is, in whom onely we are to obey the inferiour governours, Ephes. 5. 21. that so far forth as in obeying them we obey also the Lord, for <hi>better it is to obey God then men,</hi> Acts 4. 19. &amp; 5. 29. And as to obey an inferiour Magistrate which rebelleth against his Prince, is to rebell with him; so to obey a Prince or Magistrate rebelling
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42240:221"/>
against God, in that wherein he rebelleth, that is, in unlawfull things which he commandeth, it is also to rebell against God. So that not onely good but also evil Princes and Magistrates are to be obeyed; but neither good nor bad, unto evil.</p>
                        <p>More especially the kingdome of God is the<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace and glory.</note> kingdome of grace in this life, and the kingdome of glorie in the life to come. In the former the Lord communicateth grace to his servants, ruling in them by his word and Spirit: In the latter he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth glory to his Saints, vouchsafing unto them the fruition of himself, who shall be to them all in all. Do we therefore desire grace in this life or glory in the life to come? God is the King of grace and of glory: let us sue to his throne of grace; for <hi>he will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. 84. 11.</p>

And to his glory whatsoever we ask according to his will doth especially tend. Therefore as by his kingdome a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>d power he is able, so for his glory he is ready and willing to grant our requests which we make according to this direction of our Saviour. For what Christ hath taught us to ask in his name, that the Lord hath promised to give for his sake, <hi>in whom all the promises of God are Yea and Amen, to his glory,</hi> 2. Cor. 1. 20.</p>
                        <p>This therefore serveth to confirm our faith. For doubtlesse such things as tend to his glory he will grant: especially considering it is his glory to heare the prayers of his servants, and seeing to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the glory of giving every good gift: but these things which we ask according to our Saviours direction do tend to the glory of God, and to that end we ask them: therefore we may be assured that he will grant our requests so far forth as they stand with his glory.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas our Saviour directed us to make this our first suit, That <hi>Gods name may be glorified,</hi> and now teacheth us to make his glory the reason of our prayers; this sheweth, That the glory of God should be the main end of all our desires, for which we should affect them, and unto which when we have obteined them we should referre them, 1. Chron. 16. 35. Psal. 50. 15. And forasmuch as the glory is the Lords, which he will not have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to any other, Isai. 42. 8. therefore we are to
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42240:223"/>
call upon him alone, as being the onely fountain of every good gift, the onely hearer of our prayers. Of which glory we rob the Lord, if we direct our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to any other. And as we are not to give his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any other, so we are not to take it to our selves: For seeing the glory is the Lords, therefore vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious persons seek to rob God of that glory which is proper to him, and to assume it to themselves. But we must say with David, Psal. 115. 1. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and with Daniel, chap. 9. 7. <hi>Righteousnesse, O Lord, belongeth unto thee, and to us shame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But we ascribe unto the Lord not onely king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Everlasting kingdome power and glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to God.</note> power and glory, but also an everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, an eternall power, and immortall glory. For as Moses saith, Psal. 90. 2. <hi>He is God from everlasting to everlasting; he is King for ever.</hi> Therefore he hath right not onely in this life to crown us with his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, but after this life he hath an everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bestow upon us, Luke 12. 32. unto which he is able and willing to bring us by his power ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, to the immortall glory of his mercy.</p>
