            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir, this day I have met with my fellow-Commissioners, concerning the Subsidies now in hand; we have chosen a Collector for the gathering of them, and appointed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that they should with all convenient speed pay in the money, which I doubt not but will be within the compasse of a fortnight I moved the Commissioners, that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors should keep the money in their hands: But I found they were unwilling of it; I did not presse them over-much to it, in regard that this money is to be paid into the Lord Major of <hi>Yorks</hi> hands; as also, <hi>Yorkshire, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> with many other Counties. If you look into the Act, it will better satisfie you. Sir, I conceive, that if His Majestie would be pleased to send to the Lord Major of <hi>York,</hi> and the Citizens, that they should not part with the moneys untill they knew his farther pleasure, it might more properly

            </opener>
            <p>IN obedience to the Instructions (which I well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour punctually to observe) I have taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse humbly to present you this Account, that upon my first accesse into these pats, I distributed the deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Instructions to the severall Deputy Lieutenants therein concerned, and we have appointed a meeting of all the Deputy Lieutenants and Captaines in the County, upon Monday next: In the meane time it shall be the worke of my endeavour, to dispose and incline the Countrey to contribute their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the publike service, which I suspect may be the more difficultly obtained, because it is confidently beleeved and expected by many (who prepare accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) that his Majestie intends within short time to come into these parts, and to prepare the Countrey for his assistance and entertainement, hath issued a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Array to the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> wherein (it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65749:9"/>
credibly affirmed) there is joyned in the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the Lord <hi>Kilmorrey Cholmondly</hi> and <hi>Brereton,</hi> Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Wilbraham,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Aston,</hi> and Our Sheriffe, Master <hi>Leigh</hi> of <hi>Addlington,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Cholmondly,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Cotton,</hi> Master <hi>Whitmore,</hi> and others, some whereof have declared and discovered too much forwardnesse therein, though I hope one or two of them will be better advised.</p>
            <p>Because therefore it is apprehended that at the same time and places they will attempt to put the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in execution when the Ordinance touching the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia is likewise to be executed.</p>
            <p>Give me leave (I beseech you) to represent this to your consideration, that so such further directions may be added to the former as may be thought requisite. For by the former (as may appeare unto you by this clause herein closed) it seemes to be intended, that the power and strength of the County is to be imployed for the suppressing of such Assemblies, and for the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and sending up all such persons as shall after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and command to the contrarie persist, which is not to be expected to be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithstanding wee will use our best endeavours, within a short time to possesse our selves of the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, and what may be the further pleasure of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be observed by him, who will alwayes make
